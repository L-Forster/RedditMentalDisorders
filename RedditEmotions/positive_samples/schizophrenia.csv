Hello! I‚Äôm getting my tubes tied soon. A part of me is nervous because I‚Äôve been reading about some of the occasional negative effects that can occur from the surgery. Do you regret your surgery? Do you have any negative long term effects because of it?. I was raped multiple times by someone who is now in the navy. I was going to let it go but, he‚Äôs continuing to pester me even though I demanded he never contact me again. I want to report him not only to the police but to his superiors. Where should I start first ?. ‚ÄúHey. I know you probably never want to talk to me let alone hear from me. With that said, I would like to apologize for everything. If you don't know, I'm in the Navy. I've been on 2 deployments. I've had missiles fly over my ship, I've seen 3rd world countries and the poverty and suffering that comes with it. And a bunch of other things I won't mention. Being isolated out in the ocean has made me do a lot of reflecting, more than you can imagine. I'm not asking you to forgive me for the bullshit I've put you through, I'm not asking you to even respond to this message. But if something were to happen to me and I go down with the ship, I want you to know that I'm truly sorry for the heartache I've caused. After all this time, I still care about you and your family. All of you were a big part of my life and I continue to keep all of you in my prayers. I sincerely hope you're doing well. If you wish to message me back, this would be the best place to do so.‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!? Fucking three years of mental, emotional, and sexual abuse and you just label it as ‚Äúbullshit.‚Äù The audacity!!! Also, this is not an apology. This is ‚ÄúI feel kinda bad for what I did. Let me try and relieve my conscience.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt give AF about anything other than himself. And I love how he just expects I‚Äôll respond to him. After finding outside support and realizing what I was experiencing was rape, I cut him out of my life and told him to never contact me again. Four years later, I show up to my parents house to visit and I see an unfamiliar car. My mom comes running out of the house telling me to leave because he is there visiting‚Ä¶. THEY KNEW. THEY KNEW HE ABUSED ME. I never told them how, but I told them to never talk about him because it upset me. And they chose him over me. I truly believe it was just him trying to remind me of the powerless I had. And then he messaged me on a different account It‚Äôs been about a week. I still get sick from it.I was hoping Simon and Betty would find a way to be together againüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠. So I went to the mcr show in Newark NJ last year. One of the opening bands was Midtown - a semi popular pop punk band from the early 2000s. Right before they covered The Killer‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhen You Were Young,‚Äù the singer announced that the singer (Brandon Flowers) stole the song and called him a bastard. Does anyone know what he‚Äôs talking about or if he was just being silly? I cant find anything from googling it. But I‚Äôd love to know if the killer stole the song, or at least some part of it. I also love the killers so I wanna know more. Let me know if you have any more information! Thanks. Hello! My brother recently brought home four chicks, all hens. They are finally old enough to be out in their completely enclosed coop + fence. However, after two days in their chicken yard, I saw a fox watching them from the tree line. I brought them in and since they‚Äôve been staying in their old space in our laundry room. I don‚Äôt believe in killing animals, so killing the fox is out of the question. But what other alternatives could work to deter the fox?. I keep seeing this talked about in mcr related Facebook groups but no one has let me in on it yet. What is this and why is everyone so angry about it?. I grew up in an extremely small abusive religious cult (40+ people) that is a splinter group that broke off from WWCG and Children of God. Our religion didn‚Äôt even really have a name, we just referred to ourselves as ‚Äúthe true followers of Yoshu√° Christ.‚Äù Has anyone else grown up like this ?. I was able to meet with my new psychiatrist on Friday and she prescribed me trileptal. She said it would take about two weeks before I see any improvement but, I took a dose last night and already this morning I feel a little more calm?? Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm finally starting to come out of this current episode? Idk but I‚Äôm feeling slightly better already! I‚Äôm feeling much more hopeful this medicine ü§ûüèª. Hey y‚Äôall, I have Schizoaffective bipolar and I‚Äôm currently a freshman in college. Additionally, I‚Äôm also in the midst of a severe mixed episode. It‚Äôs literal hell but, I‚Äôm still getting by in terms of my academics. I‚Äôm really feeling pessimistic today and questioning my ability to persist through academia because of my diagnosis. If you or anyone you know succeeded through academia please share some encouragement; I really need it right now. Thanks, With love. I‚Äôm so fucking tired of never feeling stable. I‚Äôm always experiencing some sort of mood episode. For years I was on antipsychotics, so my mood episodes were quite manageable (still distressing regardless.) I recently went off my antipsychotics because I was doubting if I even had this illness, and for a month I was doing great. I felt emotions again, I could experience pleasant motions and other physical pleasures. Slowly, things have been changing. I‚Äôll still have those days but, now I‚Äôm experiencing racing thoughts, hyper-fixation, irritability, inability to sleep (regardless of how much zzzquil I take,) strange thoughts, paranoia and aggression. These feelings are becoming more and more intense as the days go on. I‚Äôm open to being on a mood stabilizer but, I am not able to see the school psychiatrist until the end of the month. I don‚Äôt know what to do until then. I still have some of my antipsychotics but, I absolutely refuse to go back on them. I just hate this so much. I just want to be happy and feel good emotions without going into a fucking hypomanic/manic episode.For roughly two years I would take around 2-5 ibuprofen every single day. I was aware of the devastating effects it can have on your body, which is why I was taking it. My sister died of suicide, and I was also very suicidal but did not want to traumatize my parents again by another suicide. So my solution was to abuse ibuprofen and slowly destroy my body until it killed me. Since then, I am doing much better and no longer do this. I quit this practice around four months ago. I am curious, how much damage did I inflict on my body? Is it something my body can bounce back from or should i notify my GP so we can monitor the possible damage? Or am I over thinking it all and I‚Äôm completely fine?. This semester has been so hard. I was sexually assaulted in October, my sister recently died of suicide, and I‚Äôm a first generation college student. Despite everything, I finished the semester, AND I finished with a 3.9 GPA. It feels so good! I‚Äôm going to celebrate tonight!!. Never wanted kids, never will. The first dr. I met with agreed to do the surgery, insurance approved, now it‚Äôs just scheduling a day for surgery!! Im so happy!!.
    It's so difficult to go out. I hate being around most people as I get paranoid, irritated and, on top of all that, delusional that people can look into my eyes and read my thoughts. One time, I passed this off as not liking eye contact, but then it developed into what I have now. I just wanna stay indoors and avoid but at the same time, I wanna go out and have fun sometime. It's nothing like some other bad delusions I have, but it still sucks.Ok, it's either I have a sixth sense and I can smell ghosts or I'm having olfactory hallucinations. I keep getting short whiffs of odd and unpleasant smells of about two weeks now, with the longest one happening for a good 5 minutes two to three days ago. My mom isn't helping the issue and keeps saying it's witchcraft or evil spirits, and how that happened to her before. It's really freaking me out.There are delusions that I have that I'm so ashamed to talk about to anyone other than a few trusted people. When I think of them, I get so disgusted with myself. What's worse is that I still lean into believing them a little bit. Anyone else has this problem?. Well, two days ago I had another psychotic episode. Last week was really stressful because of school and it was really fucking up my mind. Made my thoughts pretty jumbled. Then, last Friday night, that's when shit really hit the fan. Throughout the week, I kept smelling a bad oder that nobody else was smelling. On this night, the smell came back and my mom said that happened to her before. She claims that it's witchcraft (she's a Christian) and that I can smell it. It kinda freaked me out, but I brushed it off as her being superstitious.Then a friend of mine mentioned something relating to some bullshit with some girls that basically fucked up my mental health and were pieces of shit to many of my friends. I've had so many mental breakdowns but they didn't care, just because they hate men so much.Whatever my friend said really triggered something in me. I went to this "friend" who's basically a kissass to these girls and I said so many vile shit and death threats to him and I was enraged at how he allowed them to bully me all these years.Then I got paranoid and my mom noticed how weird I was acting. I was angry and yet paranoid and scared that those girls were out to get me and they were brainwashing my friend to work for them. My delusional side really flared up when I believed that an evil god sent those girls to mess up my life and friendships, and that evil god was controlling me and making my life miserable.Later on, I was walking my dog and all of a sudden I couldn't move on back and arms much. If I did, they'd be stuck in one position of minutes on end. Then I couldn't move my neck and for a while I could move my mouth. I could only walk. This only fueled my delusion and paranoia more that this evil god was controlling me and I'm his prisoner because I found out "the truth". I even felt this sensation on my forehead that I wanted to brush away in case if it was a bug but I couldn't get rid of it because my arms were frozen. A little while later when I got to my home, I found out that there wasn't anything there (I looked in the mirror). I made my way back into my house and my parents saw my body position. I kept denying that something was wrong until I gave up and told them. I told them about my paranoia, delusions, everything. My dad placed me on the couch and was moving my limbs while comforting me. It's like I was a doll and it really fucked me up. This eventually stopped when my dad massaged me and I calmed down.Sorry if I seem disorganized, it's a lot to talk about.I dunno if it's me or what, but I think that hallucinations tend to be easier to live with than delusions. I say this because delusions literally guide your actions and perspective on the world, while hallucinations are just frustrating at best and rightening at worst.I much rather have hallucinations than fearing that people can read my thoughts or that my friends all hate me or that I'm being punished in the afterlife. It's so much to deal with and I hate it.Not asking for diagnosis, just asking this if this sounds like psychosis/schizophreniaHello. I'm 18 years old and I'd say for about the past 2 years, I've been really struggling with my mental health. I dunno if it's cuz of stress but since I was 16, I've been lack motivation to do things, to take care of myself, to gain pleasure in my hobbies, to express any emotions and to self-isolation. Three of my friends have said to me that I've always seemed distant, nonchalant and lost. One of those friends said that in Physics class, I always seemed like I wasn't there, like a pedestrian; I barely did my work, I was in my own head, and asking for repeats of what was said to me. He also mentioned that, at a birthday party, I seemed lost and dissociated from what was around me. My friends noticed how distanct I've become and how much time I've spent on Twitter and how addicted I've become. I can't even socialize with people well either. My family noticed my weight loss, although I looked ok to me. I looked disheveled, with my hair unkempt. My mom said I looked like a mad man, but I ignored her and thought that she was just nagging me. My issues in memory start to rise and my thoughts seemed so jumbled. I felt so confused. One time, my mom asked for her phone but I brought back a pair of scissors. I've done shit like that many times. I thought this was normal, however, as my mom always says how I'm ansent-minded. Sometimes when I speak, I pause and lose my train of thought. Sometimes I forget what to say, get frustrated with trying to remember and just move on to something else.Overall, I guess these are the negative symptoms. Then there are the delusions. I've had delusions that my friends hated me, that are out to get me somehow and that they wanted to leave me. I've had a delusion that I was going to accumulate large sums of money to within a whole year and fly out to Belgium to see my at-the-time partner. My parents (especially my mom) we're baffled by this and out I was crazy or something. Ice had delusions where I believed that I was dead and being punished in the afterlife or that the world around me was fake (sometimes these clash, where the fake world is the hellish afterlife where I'm punished). I've also believed that some outside force was punishing me and causing my suffering. Somewhere last week, I had the delusion that my ex-partner (who now hates me) is trying to get my close friend to abandon me and turn against me. A few weeks ago, I had this delusion that that same ex-partner is invading my friend group to ruin my friendships. I've also became very paranoid. I'm not sure if this is schizophrenia or psychotic depression, as it could be. There are prolly more shit that I'm forgetting but that's basically all I could remember. The delusions seem to be situational and triggered by stress.Do I have one if them?. So, I did some self-reflection and I found out that I most likely have psychotic depression. The delusions and dissociation acts up when I'm stressed or surrounded by negative media which makes me more depressed and it stresses me out. I feel like I get easily influenced by negativity which cause me to have these terrible delusions and makes me hate socializing. The incel shit makes this worse cuz it makes me have completly odd and depressing delusions about myself. Complete removed from reality and rational thought as a whole. Therefore, I will be leaving soon. I can't be in this space for much longer.Ok, so for the past few months, I've been finding dead animals on the road beside my school. Just dead cats and dogs. What's interesting is that I've been worshipping Hades for a long while now and doing some devotional acts for him. I keep seeing dead animals but I thought nothing of it. I even saw a dead cat in my neighborhood. Anyway, I started to think about it when I passed a dead cat, with its messy carcass. Literal roadkill. For some reason, I did a small bow to it but then it hit me. This was likely Hades. I was a bit surprised by this, so I looked it up. Apparently, seeing dead animals around you is a sign that I'm about to experience a major life change. This makes sense as death can also be seen as transformation and getting rid of old habits and trauma. Before this, I was at my absolute lowest. Throughout the past 2 - 3 years (I think) I've been experiencing terrible psychotic depression. Nothing but delusions, paranoia, thoughts and memories being jumbled, self-isolation from friends, anhedonia, insomnia, depressed mood, easily being irritated, lack of empathy, emotional coldness and distance and prolly some more shit I forgot. But things started to feel like they're changing. I've noticed positive changes but it really happened when I noticed this sign, the dead animals. I took care of my health a little bit more, got a haircut (tho forced to) and put in more effort into hygiene. I also talked to my guidance counselor at my school for the first time ever, I finally talked to my parent about my crippling mental health and how I want to get help and they took it really well, and did some self-reflection and finally realized that it's very likely that I have psychotic depression due to past trauma with ppl in my peer group. I have to give credit to my close friend who helped me along the way. Hades is literally so good to me and pushed me the lowest depths of my mind to finally see the light. All hail Hades, man! I'm following Thanatos too!. Look, I get why connections are important, but all of that just seems so fake to me. Nobody, apart from my friends, is actually interesting or I'd ever be friends with; I'm almost always surrounded by a bunch of zombie-like idiots who are either impolite Christians, queerphobic, xenophobic, conformist or all of the above; there are no fun hangout places to actually meet like-minded people; there are people who just don't enjoy similar things as I do. How am I even supposed to enjoy the presence of other people if I can't stand to be near their aura? I literally cannot grasp the whole "just make connections, bro!" when everything just feels lifeless? Everyday, I wake up feeling like the living dead, still wondering why the hell was I placed here. Even if I was taller or more good-looking, dress way better than I dress now, what have you, I still wouldn't bother to even have ties with them. People are like vampires. Sorry, end of rant. Place your thoughts in the comment.After a terrible breakup and falling out with a partner, things just didn't add up. Since then, I thought I had NPD due to my anger issues, not admitting to faults, sometimes having this superiority complex, low empathy, being very stubborn and opinionated and possibly other things I'm forgetting. The thing is that low empathy isn't really a thing in NPD as they just chose not to use it. I just can't be empathetic. This created tons of problems in my relationship with my partner which often made then insecure, along with my callousness. It's very likely I have ASPD. Someone with ASPD may have 3 of these traits:1) exploit, manipulate or violate the rights of others2) lack concern, regret or remorse about other people's distress3) behave irresponsibly and show disregard for normal social behaviour4) have difficulty sustaining long-term relationships5) be unable to control their anger6) lack guilt, or not learn from their mistakes7) blame others for problems in their lives8) repeatedly break the lawI have all of these problems except for the last one. I don't doubt having it. I might however have SzPD. The symptoms seem to match up: emotional coldness and distance, feelings of stress or numbness in emotional social situations, tendency to miss social queues, little desire and motivation to socialize with others, low motivations and goals, preferring to be and doing activities alone, emotionally rigid and inability to experience pleasure from most things. It just feelings like my social and emotional batteries are always low. I may have the desire for socializing, but whenever I do socialize, I can't bother to do it anymore and go back to my dark hole. I have no issue using social media, but I end up neglecting others (such as my friends) with caused a huge problem in my friend group as it made it seem as if I didn't wanna be their friend anymore. I was just always on Twitter instead of talking to them. I think I had an addiction to it. My friends then force me to deactivate my account. I could say a lot more stuff, but I'll save it for the comments.The points is that I don't know if I have SzPD or I'm just an autistic sociopath. I just want other opinions.Make it end.Hi, I just joined this sub, I just want to know if I am indeed an agorist. I believe in:\- rejection of the state/government\- A stateless market economy (not really much in favor of capitalism)\- Counter-economics (black and grey markets)If this means I am an agorist, is this anarchy. Guys,is there a 2019 Cicada puzzle I should know about? If there is,how can I participate?.
    I‚Äôve been cold calling for a while, super stressful because I live off commission. I get rejected a lot and it sucks. However, when I feel totally defeated, voices in my head start cheering me on and they are like: One more call! One more call! And they‚Äôre like you can do it! Then I do push on with the calls and I hear a crowd cheering and applauding. Honestly it‚Äôs my secret super power lol.So I used to go to church every Sunday until I decided it wasn‚Äôt for me, because my beliefs have changed. But I met with a couple of my clients there, and I‚Äôm worried that they‚Äôll ask why I stopped going. I don‚Äôt want to lie because I much rather be honest. Also as a side note I want to meet a wife that has good values. And they are potentially at church. So should I just go back to church even if it‚Äôs not for me, so I can continue networking and have wholesome friendships?Or should I be honest and just tell my clients, and family that it‚Äôs just not for me?. When I went into the hospital after my psychosis incident I ate a ton of food, because it‚Äôs all I looked forward too. I gained crazy weight now I can‚Äôt lose it easily. Just venting a bit. üòì. I like Rudolph Steiner, Bob Sanders, and Billy Carson. Who has the best up to date knowledge in your opinion?. You guys get voices that tell you to kill yourself, or put you down generally? I hear that shit every day.It‚Äôs gotten to the point that‚Äôs it less terrifying and more boring or more nonchalant about it. I just say go away, or shut up. Feels like I‚Äôm just shooing flys away.I‚Äôve had a few psychotic breaks over the past few years. I have mostly positive symptoms, but I see the scary stuff too.Part of me thinks I can see into the astral, ethereal, or spirit realm. So i practice meditation to protect myself from the negative entities. It seems to help a lot to call on my spirit guides for protection, and I take my meds so I‚Äôm double protected. I just wanted to share this with someone that‚Äôs not my psychologist.What are your opinions on this group? It‚Äôs also known as the ascended masters.Can I take all 7 plague marines in a game of combat patrol?. Shits been a rough ride, going in and out of hospitals, piles of medication, and useless talk therapy. Been doing alot of research and meditation, but should I seek a professional?. In my opinion I believe there are a lot of paid actors on here, and useful idiots. If you look at all the actual progress in the individual companies, I mean they are about to change everything! Do your own research! Don‚Äôt take anything posted on here at face value.Can anyone recommend a spiritual service to help me navigate through the symptoms?. I got to move my ferrets to the basement because the room they‚Äôre in is destroyed with ferret poop! Any recommendations for a ferret fence that they can‚Äôt clime over? I‚Äôm going to put them somewhere with out wood floors.I see the number 66 or 666I know western religions call it the sign of the beast. But I don‚Äôt really perceive it as ultimately true.The way i became awaken short version.I heard about and had had an out of body experience about 10 years ago.I DMT for the first time back then, and that‚Äôs when I first encountered an entity that I was seeing on the DMT. It showed me amazing things and wanted to make a deal with me. I see his world and he sees mine. Unfortunately the spirit was a self serving or negative entity, or what I perceived as one.For the rest of time from then to now, my soul was tortured and I was hospitalized on multiple occasions. But it was so scary it woke me up to another aspect of myself, and the universe I‚Äôm in. So thus I am greatful for that entity, and maybe my greatest spiritual guide I‚Äôll ever have. God bless the Darkness for helping us see that we are the light!. The Law of One is a spiritual concept that asserts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things in the universe. It is based on the idea that everything in the universe, whether it be living beings, inert matter, or energy, is connected to each other in some way.The Law of One is often associated with the concept of Universal Consciousness, which suggests that all beings are part of a greater, unified consciousness. This belief asserts that everything in the universe is constantly evolving and that there is no separation between the self and the rest of the universe.Overall, the Law of One emphasizes the importance of compassion and understanding towards all beings, as we are all interconnected and part of the same universal consciousness.So I‚Äôve been experiencing spirtual awakening and I thought I was going crazy but now I know I‚Äôm not.Over the past couple years I‚Äôve been going to the hospital after going through psychosis. I was then I was told I was schizophrenic.So now the people close to me think I‚Äôm schizophrenic. I live with my mom now and she make sure if I take my pills. I don‚Äôt know how to break it out to her that I think I‚Äôm actually having a spiritual awakening. What can I do to convince her I‚Äôm not crazy?. During my experience with DMT and during meditation I see the most awful things.I see a man in a hat that tortures beings in front of me. I see dismembered body‚Äôs and blood with skulls. It‚Äôs absolutely terrifying and have no idea what to do. I‚Äôm often attacked by this visions.Anyone know what‚Äôs going on with me?Edit: I‚Äôve stopped using DMT and meditation in general. But the visions haven‚Äôt stopped.I have an experience where I can project in my head while a wake/ eyes open.I‚Äôve met a few entities and have the ability to change the environment and the other entities can change the environment.But I can do this at anytime at will. It seems like an over active imagination, however I have had entities mess with me so bad, I had to go to the hospital multiple times. I used to practice AP years ago, but i stopped and now I‚Äôm having these issues (which is sometimes pleasant) Is this AP or something else?It feels like a day dream, not like I‚Äôm really there. Like two places at once.I‚Äôm experiencing a strange phenomenon where I can project mentally.It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in the physical world but my consciousness goes into a different world. I don‚Äôt consider myself a master of any type of spiritual practice.But I think it might‚Äôve been a sign that the earth is shifting into the new age.Also since I‚Äôve had these experiences my physical filter has gone, so the Spirtual world sometimes spills into the physical.100 cold calls a day + ? = profit. I believe I had a spiritual awakening when I had a weird feeling of being out of body and had a psychotic break.My mom took to me to the hospital and was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I felt like I was downloading info and had visions of angles and demons. I felt manic and may have been attacked by an entity but I had gotten a lot out of the experience.Now I don‚Äôt feel anything anymore nor do I get ‚Äúvisitors‚Äù telling me what to do.I feel like I lost my powers or ability to see in the spirit realm.Or am I just being left alone?. Hey guys I used to practice astral travel and some really weird has suddenly come over me. I seem to be able to mentally project with my eyes open, and when I‚Äôm working, driving, or day dreaming. I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out what is happening is actually happening or if it‚Äôs just my imagination going wild. For example I‚Äôve seen several dead loved ones, seen strange creatures, and even Angels. It‚Äôs seem just like a very vivid day dream.Anyone experienced this? Let me know what you guys think.At this point I‚Äôm just interested in what for sure is not real. Because everything is coming out lol.I just found out Chem trails are real for context.I think there‚Äôs something trying to communicate with me some how.I‚Äôm not spiritually incline as much as I want to be so idk. Seems to come out of no where.I believe it‚Äôs telling me he‚Äôs Gabriel. Im I just going crazy? Is it a demon? Is it my guide? I feel okay I just have been keeping it to myself for the most part.What do you guys think?. I was just wondering if there is any 101 on metaphysics like a YouTube guy or a book that‚Äôs up to date?I use to meditate but I just don‚Äôt have the patience to figure it out myself. Just want some practical knowledge. Does rent have to come down before we see inflation come down?. My oculus has been collecting dust for a while now? What‚Äôs a good game/experience that‚Äôs come out recently?. Up 37% in the last 3 months.I got into sales about 6 years ago, and I work at my dad‚Äôs financial advisory office. It‚Äôs in a small town and my dads a good broker, but it‚Äôs very unknown.I‚Äôve been doing opening calls and been learning along the way about the industry. I just have had very little success, For the first five years we had no system and was very phone shy. that didn‚Äôt go very well so I‚Äôve made a very shitty follow up system to make sure we continue to follow up and write a script and make at least 100 calls a day now. I‚Äôve finally am getting more interest but my leads won‚Äôt close for now. My dad is the closer, and I try to close to but I‚Äôm still not great. I won‚Äôt give up because there‚Äôs probably nothing waiting for me after because I have no college degree. So I‚Äôll keep calling till I‚Äôm rich or dead.Anyone try warhammer stats in One Page Rules? Example: when activating a unit use move stats and same with attacks from warhammer, but alternating and other aspects of OPR? I feel like it would add a bit more flavor and keeps units from dying. Anyone try this?Ok dudes if any of you tried doing this? Ok I‚Äôm not a Genius or know much about game mechanics in general. You don‚Äôt have to nerd rage at me.
    Why the fuck did my abused useless fucking brain have to start fantasizing about everything that happened to me happening again.Why the fuck can't my brain stop thinking about getting fucked for 2 fucking seconds. I'm such a fucking slut I wanna fucking die, I'm exactly what they said I was, what the fuck. I usually avoid feeling too much shame for it all but I just fucking broke. I wrote some stupid shit to try and cope cause my trauma is fucking with me recently and I posted it like an idiot before realizing I sounded so repulsive I should die, why do I have to be aroused by the things monsters did to me, that's what they were aroused by, I hate it. I usually don't let it get to me but fuck it's too much my mind is repulsive my sexuality is repulsive my body is fucked, why the fuck couldn't they have just killed me, God fucking dammit end me.My body will never feel clean, my brain will never be clean, I don't wanna be the crazy slutty girl with the fucked up kinks anymore, I just wanna die I can't take it please help me. Trigger Warning: mentions of sexual abuseI (22F) should preface everything I'm about to say by making clear I am not advocating against recovery, just venting about my fucked up life and what it feels like being told to stop drinking/using while living with the trauma I have.For the last few weeks I have been unwillingly sober due to being completely broke and have been taking it very very poorly, some days are much harder than others and today everything got worse. I ended up getting in an argument with my boyfriend today about my drinking and now my fucking head is just rushing with thoughts of every worst part of my fucked up life.Since I was a teenager I've been addicted to everything under the sun primarily cocaine, meth, various opioids, and most consistently alcohol.I was raped as a young child and not long later began experiencing symptoms of what would later be diagnosed as schizophrenia, at first symptoms were mild but it doesn't take very many paranoid episodes or grotesque hallucinations to completely fuck up a developing mind.I didn't tell anyone about what happened to me then (and in fact repressed what happened to me for years), and my schizophrenia symptoms were dismissed as just children being imaginative and irrational, everyone knew *something* was wrong (I've always been seen as a weird and off putting) but nobody assumed it was something this bad. From the outside my childhood looked pretty normal, but for me life was a discordant chaos, my brain felt like it was violently lashing back and forth, I blamed myself for everything despite not having a clue what had happened to me and took my not understanding as proof that it was because I did something wrong, I was being taught science in school, the bible in church, and the inconsistent ramblings of my subconsciously built delusions from my own head with no way of telling what was real or why I felt so awful and dirty and terrified.And so when I became a teenager it didn't take long until I started abusing substances. I started out just shoplifting alcohol until I received an offer that, at the time, sounded incredible, but would lead to the worst time in my life. I was told I'd be given "whatever drugs or booze I want" (Which wasn't even true it was whatever they gave me) and be paid to have sex with men and they conveniently left out the part where I was not allowed to stop or say no to anything. Due to my prior trauma I felt this immense need to "reclaim my sexual autonomy", and they convinced me that I could do so by letting them turn me into a sex slave. I can't put into words how stupid I feel now, I was trying to get over the worst thing that ever happened to me and instead signed up to have it happen to me again almost every single day. I don't even know if i believe I can recover from that, the damage already felt irreparable when it happened once, today I've been raped so many times I actually lost track, I feel like an object to be used and I feel like I'm kidding myself every time I say something that implies otherwise.But at the time it all felt consensual. And once I got a taste for the fucking opioids they were feeding me I was theirs. The "client" would traumatize me to their hearts content and then I'd be fed drugs until I couldn't tell how much it was hurting me often both emotionally and physically. Eventually I'd finally breakdown in front of my family and ended up in a mental hospital and put on anti-psychotics. luckily I never heard from my abusers again. But now here I was, 16 having spent my whole life drowning and not knowing why, now I finally knew why but not only was I still drowning I was now being faced with the reality of having to take anti-psychotics every day for the rest of my life, my drug use slowed down as i no longer had a super consistent method of getting it but I'd do **anything** I had to.I'd spend the rest of highschool a complete junkie, vomiting in class, doing drugs and drinking vodka behind dumpsters, occasionally still engaging in sex work as it felt like the way to afford cocaine. I was a fucking trainwreck, ended up spending most of age 16.5-17.5 inside mental institutions (often still finding ways to get high) more often than I as out of them and only got my diploma because the school didn't want to mess up their high graduation rate and so bullshitted my credits. After I graduated and got a job the cocaine floodgates opened, I was finally getting paid and worked literally down the street from a hotel full of dealers, but a few more mental hospitalizations and getting fired later and I ultimately understood I couldn't keep going on that way, on top of that (though getting fired sucked) a lot of things in my life were improving and after I got with my current boyfriend they improved even more.I wasn't actually getting sober, not really, I just wanted to get off the stuff that was making my life completely unmanageable, and my greatest allies in doing so was Jack Daniels and Mary Jane. It's a lot easier to stop yourself from going out to buy drugs when every time you get the urge you can just slam a shot of whiskey.A whole lot of screaming and vomiting later and I was down to only relying on 2 substances, weed and booze, I'll still use most drugs you offer me but it's pretty infrequent once or twice a month.But after all these peaks and valleys all the bleeding and crying, all the getting hooked on things and then getting off of things one thing has remained the same, when I'm sober I'm miserable. I can sustain sobriety for a day or two and feel "okay" unless something bad happens that day, but by the end of day 2 I generally want to die. And with pretty rare exceptions those sober days are generally not good just manageable.But like I mentioned, recently I went dead broke, can't find a new job and so can't afford anything. This last week has been some of the worst I've felt in a while, and to make everything worse my boyfriend chose now to confront me about my drinking.I keep telling him that I don't feel ready to get sober but honestly I'm not sure if that even describes it. I've very often described my life as feeling like I'm constantly drowning, sometimes pleasant little events can pull me out of it for a bit but mostly not, mostly I'm drowning, and substances have been the one consistent viable functional method to allow me to not feel like I'm drowning for at least a night.To me it's always felt like I have 2 options, substance abuse or suicide, several times in my life I've been suicidal, planned an attempt, got wasted and then backed out or passed out and felt stable in the morning. Meanwhile the serious suicide plans I've made sober actually got carried out, just clearly not well enough.It feels like someone coming up to me, hearing me say "I constantly feel like I'm drowning and being drunk is the only time I get to breath" and saying in response "Don't worry, you're not actually drowning, you're being waterboarded and so it just feels that way, but if you don't press the time out button for long enough you'll eventually get so used to being waterboarded that you won't need to rely on the time out button anymore."Sure it's a time out button that's slowly fucking up my liver but if I have to choose between a long life of getting waterboarded constantly or a short life where I got to spend at least half of it not getting fucking waterboarded I think I'm choosing option B especially considering I don't get cruel or violent when I'm drunk I just get stupid.I believe there's a version of me, some time in the future who can go fully sober and still be happy, but I'm not there yet, I hate myself so much, I hate the fact that my addictions scare my boyfriend, I hate living in skin that feels used and violated, I hate that I can't dedicate myself to getting better but I know it won't work. It's not that I don't think I'm capable of change, I know I can change because I have changed already and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, the transition from "I don't care if I overdose just stick it in my fucking arm" to "I drink too much" involved changing literally everything about my life and yet I feel like people treat me like I'm not willing to make an effort.I hate my fucking life. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I feel like I'm Cursed, like I'm some kind of magnet for predators. I'm looking back on my life and thinking about just how many people have groomed or raped me. I was raped as a young child, I chatted online with so many men preying on me that I literally lost track, I was trafficked as teenager, and also got raped multiple times entirely separate from that.That's not fucking normal, it feels like it doesn't make sense, it obviously can't be pure chance that happened that's just too unlikely. I don't search for meaning within my trauma but that obviously has a reason that caused it. And that reason is me, it's my behavior, it's the way I act, the places I've gone, the decisions I've made, the way I would put myself in a situation even when I knew it was extremely dangerous, the fact that when I was asked "do you want to have sex for money" I said yes and then didn't call the police when I was later told I wasn't allowed to stop. Even after already suffering multiple instances of rape I still did shit like taking opioids with a sketchy drug dealer I'd never met before at his fucking house who I had met through the man who was trafficking me you'll never fucking guess how that ended.I obviously still know it's the Abusers fault and that it's not justified but it's still my fault in some way, I'm trying to logic my way out of this find a way by which I can feel that it is in no way my fault but I did so much stupid bullshit and had it happen so many times there's no way I can just say I got unlucky, it just feels too low a chance I can't fucking stop the feeling. I feel I know why I'm this way, from my first Abusers to the men who groomed me to the man who pimped me they all knew how to get into my head and manipulate me, make me think what they were doing was okay, made me blame myself, made me feel that sex was my worth, all so I'd do what they say and not tell anyone or try to make it stop. But even though I know it's because of what they did that I gained these traits that cause me to get abused it's still me who has these traits. It's because of these traits I make bad decisions but those are still my decisions. No matter what I do it's me, and it's so hard not to feel bad about it, because as long as it's me it has to be in some way my fault, or else what does mean to make decisions. I hate that I have to think like this but I can't get it out of my head.(Tw: CSA, human trafficking, grooming)For as long as I can remember I've been excited by anything that I viewed as "naughty" or anything that made me feel submissive.When I was around 7 years old I let that part of me be known to the wrong person. It was a teenaged girl with an adult 'boyfriend' who I believed to have groomed her and told her to find him a young victim, which ended up being me. I didn't know what was happening, and I was enjoying it so much until the penetration started and I began begging for it to stop, and for what would be the first time of many I would experience what it's like to have your autonomy mean nothing.Despite how much it hurt I was so ashamed and confused I hid it. Then when I went through puberty I found that I had become a hypersexual masochist.And I would again let this be known to the wrong people. I DESPERATELY wanted to regain my sexual autonomy and I quickly began judging my worth based soley on my sexual appeal.I was obsessed with sex and constantly wanted to pursue it, worse yet the taboo element of having sex with an adult excited me even more and many men took advantage of that. I was groomed by multiple men online and slept with one in person from ages 13-15. Then at 16 a man offered to set me up with men to have sex for money also offering me drugs which all sounded perfect to my stupid abused brain.What I didn't know was that I wasn't allowed to say no to anything and I wasn't allowed to stop. They used the drugs to keep me dependant on them, and would always remind me that "I wanted this" and that this was just who I am, and all I'd ever be.Some of those men were unbelievably sadistic hurting me both physically and emotionally as much as they could.I've been told by multiple men that I was 'born a slut', that I was asking for it, that this is what I'm for, that I was raped because of my own actions and even after years of therapy deep down I can't help but agree with them. The words they said to me and forced me to say while I was being raped are burned into my memory. Same with the words I was told by people who heard my story and felt it was my fault. I can't get them out of my head and I can't stop internalizing them.It's been years since the last time I was violated and I'm in a stable monogamous relationship now, yet I'll always feel like a sex object, I feel like that's my purpose and that as I'm currently living I'm basically lying to myself that I can be anything else.My trauma has left me in such a bad mental condition that it's nearly impossible to be productive, I've lost every job I have and I've caused so much trouble for so many. It feels like I'm not only just pretending to not just be the sex object I am but that I'm failing at pretending to be anything else. My fascination with feeling 'naughty' that I had seemingly since birth makes that feeling that this is just what I am feel so real. It doesn't feel like I was turned into a sex object by those men, it feels more like I was always an object and they just knew it when they saw it. Sometimes I think I should stop kidding myself and just go back into prostitution willingly, because other than singing (which statistically speaking will most likely go nowhere) that's all I've ever been good for.I still hate my Abusers, but I think I hate myself more.Throwaway account so nobody sees this and starts worrying about me.I'm a heavily medicated schizophrenic and I'm miserable.My medication is so strong that I'm constantly tired. I'll often sleep 12 hours and can end up sleeping up to 20 hours if nothing wakes me up.I lost the only jobs I've ever had because sometimes i wake up and literally can't move. I've changed meditations multiple times and these are the LEAST bad, which is fucking depressing. The idea that these are the best is so unspeakably disheartening but that's what all signs point to. I feel like a fucking zombie, I used to have so much energy, I used to think I was special, I used to feel alive, I was in agony, but I was alive.I still hallucinate sometimes, and every time it happens I panic, not just because they can be scary, but because every time it happens I fear that I might need to raise my dosage.I won't be able to cope with my meds getting stronger, they're already so strong, if my meds truly stop working and they have to Increase it I'll probably kill myself.I know I shouldn't go off my meds, the person I am off my meds is a genuine danger to myself and others.But I'm struggling to stay motivated in taking them, whats the point, why should I care about the danger when my alternative is this never ending dirge of constant exhaustion and sadness.I'm a trafficking victim, I have severe ptsd from what I was subjected to, I feel utterly broken and don't think I'll ever be happy.I don't feel human, I feel uncanny around normal people, I feel like my life was destroyed permanently and that society doesn't seem to give a shit.I've also been recovering from drug addiction, I still take drugs every now and again, but I've been trying to avoid complete relapse. Which is something I'm also tired ofI hate that I have to spend my life putting in effort to avoid something that makes me feel amazing in a life where I feel so beaten down.I know I shouldn't do it, I know it's a horrible idea, I know I could end up institutionalized, dead, or in prison. But the alternative feels just as desolate.When I'm off my meds I end up with various delusions, and sometimes I still entertain the thoughts that I had before. There is an accompanying paranoia which is terrifying and painful, but within the delusions I get to feel important, I get to feel like I'm more than the worthless pathetic victim I am.I want to stop fighting, I'm sick of being tired all the time, I'm sick of feeling worthless and powerless, I'm sick of the fear of relapse.If my options are this lifeless existence or a life of chaos, I'm really not sure if I can keep choosing lifelessness.I want to go off the deep end and see how far I can fall. I'm tired of fighting.
    Hi folks, this is my first litter robot ever, and I am a bit apprehensive about dismantling it to clean it properly, and then putting it back together. I‚Äôve also had it for three months now and the sensors are starting to become faulty because I think it really needs to be cleaned. I have a tendency to break things, and with my luck, I fear I might do it with my LR4. Would you please share your Tips/tricks and/or any url or YouTube videos that you personally use to help you? Thanks so much in advance.My brother was an honors student and loved playing the saxophone. He was the kindest person I knew, would never hurt a soul. He began experiencing symptoms when he was 17, senior in high school, about to graduate. He was my half brother. We didn‚Äôt grow up close because our dad left his first wife for my mom. My brother began experiencing symptoms around this time. To this day, my dad feels tremendous guilt believing he was the cause to his schizophrenia. I come from a family of Mexican immigrants. Mental illness is very much stigmatized, and many families are simply ignorant on how to handle or ‚Äúdeal with‚Äù situations like this. I know that‚Äôs triggering to say, and I‚Äôm sorry. Because we are half siblings and I was conceived by ‚Äúthe other woman,‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt close to this sibling. He wad 15 years older than me. Anyway, I grew up scared of this sibling. He was always talking to himself, and screaming at his voices. I have vivid memories of him being in the backyard and screaming at his voices while The Smiths or Depeche Mode was on full blast. He would say the voices were mean to him and told him to kill himself daily. That he was stupid. Everyone hated him. He believed them. He would get arrested often, and ended up living in a group home. He took monthly injections. My poor sweet brother would try to work and tried to go to back to college. Last week, he went missing. We were so scared and tried every day to find him. The police tell us his body has been found today, and that we will have to pay for an autopsy if we want to know how he died specifically. In the last few years, he became violent, refused to take meds, and started taking crack. I truly believe it was to relieve his symptoms. I‚Äôm not sure what the point of this post is. My heart is breaking because I know he deserves so much more from life than what he got. If perhaps families that are low income or without much resources were educated in schizophrenia and early intervention. My dad is in his 80s and cannot forgive himself for perhaps being the reason why my brother got so sick. Another one of my siblings has also been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. My heart is broken, and I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. Thank you for reading, and I will delete if this is inappropriate or doesn‚Äôt belong here.My bf and I are vacationing out of the country for about a week. We have two kitties (9 & 5, both boys), and we were wondering if we should leave the indoor house lights on for them, or does it matter? We have someone coming to check up on the cats and the house a throughout the week, but I‚Äôm mostly wondering if they‚Äôd prefer having lights on so they‚Äôre not in the dark for too long a time, especially at night. Curious to hear what people do when they are out of the house for an extended period of time!. Relatively new to Reddit, but I noticed that some threads that have a lot of interaction show no upvotes or downvotes. And then others have a lot with almost every comment, which I assume is normal. Is there a way to hide these votes or something? Just wondering what‚Äôs going on with the threads that don‚Äôt show any votes/interaction all.Looking for a show to binge watch, and I‚Äôve been hearing about Sister Wives for years now, but more so recently because of a divorce on the show that‚Äôs made it onto entertainment news. I‚Äôm a huge fan of 90 day fianc√© and other TLC shows, so I think I‚Äôm gonna try Sister Wives out.Pulling the show up tonight, I‚Äôm super surprised that there‚Äôs 17 seasons! It‚Äôll take me forever to catch up I feel. Do you think it‚Äôs absolutely necessary to start from season 1?. After being on the fence for a long time, (for reasons most notably, not wanting the government to have my DNA) I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôd like to take a DNA test either from 23andme or ancestry.com. However, one thing that gives me pause is that I keep hearing how limited your DNA and ancestry results will be if you are female. Perhaps I‚Äôm just dense beyond belief, but why would my results be limited and how exactly would they be limited? Is it even worth it then to do it if they won‚Äôt be as accurate as a males results would be? feel dumb for still not understanding this fully, because I understand the XX/XY chromosome differences, but some tests state that it really doesn‚Äôt matter and I don‚Äôt understand either way. Can someone please explain this to me like I‚Äôm 5? (This was actually removed on thar subreddit for whatever reason, but hopefully I‚Äôll have better luck here).I don‚Äôt understand Cole‚Äôs family, insisting that they won‚Äôt meet Zanab until after they are married. If they have concerns, wouldn‚Äôt they want to meet her ahead of time to get a good feel for her? Wouldn‚Äôt they try anything possible to prevent the wedding from even happening? Even if they don‚Äôt like her via what they see on Instagram, wouldn‚Äôt they want to have a first-hand account rather than waiting until after the wedding, when it‚Äôs potentially too late? I don‚Äôt understand it. I wonder if it has anything to do with them just not wanting to be on TV?. I ask because they couples stated they had watched the season, and they were asked about it. However, the season just finished airing a couple of weeks ago. How did they watch it? Were they given the footage ahead of time, or was the reunion filmed very recently?. What do you think happened with them? He seemed so ready to go all in with her? I‚Äôm shook with the preview for next week. Also, I kinda hate Netflix for doing this to us.Edit: Sorry, Alexa*. Autocorrect, ugh.Wtf, I was not expecting this! To me, they were the strongest couple, and I was really rooting for them. It broke my heart, and it seemed like Raven really tried. Did she ever say she wouldn‚Äôt move to California? She seemed all about that man. I hope they find a way to reconcile, they are so good together! Was anyone else blind-sighted by this?. I watched Season 1 Episode 1 yesterday & was really surprised at how Whitney‚Äôs attitude at wanting to lose weight has changed. I can see how the show picked up steam and why people (including myself) were rooting for her. She seemed to genuinely want to get healthy and lose weight. She was 380 lbs then and said she wanted to lose at least 100 lbs. When (around what year/season) did she stop being this way?. ‚Ä¶ until I read that it was on here! Seriously, it was so anticlimactic. I mean, it would‚Äôve felt more like a finale if they had announced Whitney and Lenny making it official, or if the Frenchman and her officially called it off or something. How were we supposed to know it was the last episode while watching? Is there going to be a reunion? Why am I still watching this show? So many questions.Did anyone else watch their facial expressions during the last episode? There were multiple times that Buddy would look over at Court after Whitney had said something, and they both look‚Ä¶ unimpressed lol. They just look so over her and really don‚Äôt seem like they‚Äôre having fun at all.So I recently was introduced to the show bc Season 6 is currently on Netflix. After I finished it, I sought to watch more, particularly an earlier season, bc I wanted to see how different it was before everyone (inmates + correctional officers) knew what 60 Days In was. So I watched Season 1, which I really enjoyed! Which should I watch next? Should I just go in order and watch Season 2?. So 16 days ago, I titrated from 1mg Xanax/day to .5 mg. At first I wanted to do this slowly, but since it‚Äôs going to be miserable, I‚Äôd rather get over the miserable stuff as quickly as possible. So Friday, I stopped taking any Xanax at all. It‚Äôs now day 2, and so far, I feel like crap but mostly, I‚Äôm just scared. I have that weird pins & needles thing, rebound anxiety (obviously), throbbing headache, and I feel like my body doesn‚Äôt have any muscles at all‚Ä¶ lifeless, it‚Äôs hard to even move. I had to get some rest last night, so I took Ambien, but I‚Äôm not planning on taking that again any time soon, as I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll delay my recovery. I know it‚Äôs only day 2, and I‚Äôve been on Xanax for 9 years, but I‚Äôm just hopeful for the day that I no longer need this stuff. I have depersonalization disorder, and I‚Äôm hoping that this will resolve once it‚Äôs out of my body for good. I miss feeling. I miss living. I hate that I‚Äôve done this to myself. I‚Äôm just hoping it‚Äôs not too late to reverse the damage.Hi all,I‚Äôve just created a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I‚Äôm 38 yo, and I‚Äôve been taking prescription Xanax since early 2013. Because of my crippling anxiety and PTSD, I‚Äôve had a prescription for 2 mg of Xanax/daily, 10mg Ambien/daily, and 40 mg Prozac/daily for 9 years now. However, I would say I‚Äôve actually taken 1mg of Xanax every day for the past 3 years or so. I no longer take the Ambien. I‚Äôm worried that one day I‚Äôll not have access to Xanax, and I don‚Äôt really want to take it forever, so I‚Äôm trying to taper off of it before it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôm worried though, bc last time I was kind of forced to quit Xanax cold turkey (during the pandemic, I lost my monthly prescription, and was too afraid to tell my psychiatrist for fear they wouldn‚Äôt believe me). I was ignorant of how dangerous and horrible it was going to be for me. I literally felt like I was dying. I was so happy to get my refill a month later, and I never want to go through that again. Anyway, I‚Äôm on here because like I said, I‚Äôm trying to taper off of it. I usually take the 1mg of Xanax at bedtime. It‚Äôs now been one full week that I‚Äôve successfully taken .5mg at night. It hasn‚Äôt been too bad - rebound anxiety, but bearable thus far. I want to be successful at this, but realistic too. Can anyone give me advice on how best to taper (how many MGs I should be taking and for how long), and also what to expect? Anyone who is going through it or has gone through a similar experience would be greatly appreciated. Maybe info on lasting effects? Basically, any knowledge you think would help me in this journey.
    Long story short my step mom was yelling at me and I screamed back at her and she got frightened despite me not saying anything threatening. I‚Äôm now not allowed back home and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Any basic things I should know?I just quit my job 2 weeks ago to focus on getting the right meds for this so is there any chance of getting unemployment? I can maybe stay at my girlfriends place overnight for a bit, I wanna just get a job and pull out savings real fast and secure an apartment.I have a vehicle.Man I hate being schizophrenic. My meds don‚Äôt work, I have these stupid delusions that make me nonfunctional, and I don‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore. I just wait around for my girlfriend to be done work. I mean what is it that people do all day? I can barely type this out it‚Äôs so stressful and yet my stupid delusions make me think I‚Äôm not even sick.I‚Äôm so sad for no reason, I‚Äôm just a person who wants to draw. Any advice?. No matter how much my doctor tries and convinces me I just don‚Äôt believe I have schizophrenia. Almost all my delusions I can accept aren‚Äôt real but I just treat them like they are out of fear. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just my ocd that makes me obsessed and paranoid or if I really do have schizophrenia.I don‚Äôt have hallucinations really, I‚Äôve had a few in my life but they weren‚Äôt vivid and were out of the corner of my eye. The main reason they think I‚Äôm sick is because I have delusions, but I understand what is a delusion? Just can‚Äôt shake the weird ideas I get is all. If an idea enters my head, even if it doesn‚Äôt make sense, my brain will entertain it. But I don‚Äôt fully believe all of them but some of them do really affect my day to day living. I feel debilitated but maybe it‚Äôs just my ocd.I am never sure of anything.They did say maybe I had major depressive disorder but idk I‚Äôm not ever sad or just laying around all day. Just struggling to take care of myself.Any advice on how to prove to myself I‚Äôm not well?. Been taking my medicine for over a month. Finally opened up to my parents about being schizophrenic (my doctors recommended I tell them because I shouldn‚Äôt be working a job until I‚Äôm stable) and they didn‚Äôt care. My dad thinks you take some pill and your problems are over and doesn‚Äôt seem to understand just how debilitated I am.I told him my doctors told me to go on disability for a bit until I find the right dosage, and because my delusions are mainly regarding my coworkers and boss colluding to hurt me, but he said it was ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù and I needed to work and then walked away.Not sure what to do, and I don‚Äôt feel calm ever.I‚Äôm so so sick of this and I‚Äôm considering buying a van and living out of it at some campsite (I‚Äôm shopping for a new car anyways) but that obviously isn‚Äôt ideal, at least I‚Äôd be able to take my meds and focus on getting better.Hope this made sense, gonna tell my doctor on Monday Ive been having constant thoughts of self harm for months now (especially this past 2 weeks or so) maybe I‚Äôll get put in a hospital. I‚Äôve never been! I know it‚Äôs not the best place to be but I‚Äôll have time to get the right medicine and I won‚Äôt harm myself. Trying to stay positive :). No matter what my therapist or psychiatrist say I just feel like I‚Äôm not sick. At least not with schizophrenia.I don‚Äôt hallucinate often and when I do they are far and few, like two days ago I heard my dad shout my name twice in a large crowd. Whenever I do show symptoms of schizophrenia I tend to convince myself that I‚Äôm exaggerating something normal or I just don‚Äôt have the disease. I do have persecutory delusions especially when I‚Äôm stressed out. I‚Äôll feel like everyone is staring at me and recording me or taking pictures of me and it‚Äôs only after I‚Äôm able to leave the situation that I can calm down and be more rational about it. I sometimes check my office for cameras and I‚Äôm almost confused when I can‚Äôt find any. Makes it seem like my coworker monitors me but I just don‚Äôt know how or where the cameras are.Any advice? I see my psychiatrist today and he hasn‚Äôt properly diagnosed me with schizophrenia but he is treating me for it. What should I mention to him to get a more accurate response.I‚Äôm having a hard time with my schizophrenia diagnosis. I was given 1.5 mg invega and 50 mg fluboxamine as a starting point. I maybe feel like 5 percent better after 3 weeks but not really enough to get anything in my life done.The main issue I have is differentiating the difference between what lines up with ocd and what lines up with schizophrenia.My hallucinations are far and few, like I saw a one foot tall man with my dads face approach me out of the corner of my eye while I was in the bathroom, when I looked he was gone, in fact just yesterday I was in a crowd and I heard my dad shout my name really loud two times in a row, but he wasn‚Äôt there.I also woke up one night and went to put on YouTube and heard my brother in laws in the hallway having a conversation for like 3 minutes straight and I was confused why they were awake. I asked them the next day and they told me they were asleep all night. Any other ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù tend to just be because I got 3 hours of sleep but even then they feel like illusions.I do however have a lot of auditory hallucinations when I‚Äôm falling asleep. Sometimes right as I‚Äôm about to drift off I‚Äôll hear friends or random people, but I‚Äôll hear voices say something and then I‚Äôm awake. My delusions are the main issue. I guess I recognize they‚Äôre delusions but they feel very real to me especially when stressed. They impact my life so much that I have a hard time doing anything good for myself like showering, brushing my teeth, exercise. I also don‚Äôt really enjoy anything that much now it‚Äôs like everything I used to like is not fun now and I‚Äôm not sure why, I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm depressed though, I feel mostly fine mood wise besides I get angry sometimes with more difficult things. I play some video games but I get bored with them so fast. I try and draw and make video games and that seems to be the only thing that is hard to get bored with because there at least feels like a way to move forward with my life.My thoughts can be confusing sometimes. They get so scrambled and it can feel like I‚Äôm having more than one train of thought at a time. When I‚Äôm like this I get what you would call the flat affect. Where I deliver one word responses and I sound upset but I‚Äôm not and I have no desire to talk even if I‚Äôm not necessarily in a bad mood. I‚Äôm always afraid my thought will get fragmented into something so I try and think neutral things by second nature so I don‚Äôt have my thoughts drip out of my head and somebody will accidentally hear them. An example would be ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll go to the store where there‚Äôs the store and I hav the store to go to with the store that‚Äôs out there with the store I‚Äôll go to.‚ÄùI also speak in metaphors most people have a hard time figuring out, so I avoid using metaphors unless I know they‚Äôll make sense, and my thoughts will jump around in an unrelated manner, but they normally return to the idea at hand eventually. But sometimes my brain will go blank and I‚Äôll lose the thought.The main reason I‚Äôm posting this is idk. I guess I wanted to hear other peoples thoughts on if they had this issue as well trying to figure out if their diagnosis is accurate or if the doctors messed up. It seems like one hour I agree with my diagnosis and the very next I think the doctors messed up. Then back and forth.They put me on 1.5 mg invega and it‚Äôs been 3 weeks and I don‚Äôt feel any different at all.I think I just explained my ocd in such a way that they think it‚Äôs schizophrenia instead, anybody else feel like the doctors misdiagnosed some other issues they had? I get really bad persecutaory delusions and stuff but I feel like maybe it‚Äôs just extreme ocd because I was diagnosed with that as well.I did go in there with the idea of schizophrenia and they said it was unlikely but after like 2 months they seem to be on board with the idea, I‚Äôm just frightened that I am making all of this up and I‚Äôm not actually getting an accurate diagnosis.
    There‚Äôs a guy that suddenly contacted me, he just got out of a relationship and out of the blue he contacted me. We used to talk in high school but we went our separate ways. He now wants a relationship with me, and I don‚Äôt know what to do I‚Äôm a very freaky dirty girl and I love porn, I like watching it bdsm being watching people be tied up but I don‚Äôt actually enjoy sex at all being done to me. So I‚Äôve been sending him pics and making him feel great making out to love sex. My down there gets tight and narrow anytime a d-ck goes inside it, and the force makes me cry almost in pain. I don‚Äôt like penetrative sex at all. I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôm going to cope because he‚Äôll want to try a-al and it‚Äôs too tight for anything. When give blowjobs and try to swallow semen a few hours later I feel nauseous. So I started running to the bathroom to spit it out. My past partner obviously viewed this as a turn off. Is there a condition about this? Doctors, should I go? I don‚Äôt know if this has something to do with my religious upbringing. Still secretly ashamed of sex. I was brought up Jehovah‚Äôs Witness you see and left when I was 17. I don‚Äôt know what to tell him because I‚Äôm sure he will leave me if he finds out. Also I‚Äôm not sure if I should just swallow being in pain. There‚Äôs a 53M interested in me, and has been for a while now too. But I can‚Äôt be with him because I find the age gap too large. The medications I‚Äôm on also cause problems with sexual drive. Should I tell be upfront about my issues?. I have only two friends, these are the friends that I had out of secondary school (high school). Now they‚Äôre not answering my messages, one of them removed me from Snapchat and blocked me from Instagram. I have school mates, but we are not close as I am to these others.It started a while back when in May 2023 this year I tried to arrange us to get together since I have my own place now. But none of them would come. They kept saying they were busy or going though stuff. I tried again in August when I noticed they were doing out with other girls. But they said they had work. I tried again 2 weeks ago but my message was left on read. I have no friends. Absolutely no one. No one is going to want to date a lonely girl with no friends. I have exams next week so I‚Äôm trying to focus on my exams. I guess it‚Äôs their choice if they don‚Äôt want to be friends about it but at least have the guts to admit to me what‚Äôs going on instead of covering it up. I have done nothing wrong to these girls. Is there something wrong with me? We‚Äôve never argued ever, why do so many people not like me? So close to just ending it all.Edit: if you look at my post history you‚Äôll see that I have a lot of mental health issues. I have never propelled this on to my friends in fear of losing them. I only talk about my mental health on Reddit and to my psychiatrist.. ‚ÄúProof or didn't happen, women are far more likely to lie or exaggerate than they are to tell the truth. We need to start making examples of them. Sick of it. Don't belive a word they say.‚Äù Not one person believed me when I told them I was getting bullied at my college. They asked for proof. How do you get proof of that? Its indescribable this pain that I have inside. I‚Äôm so scared, I have an exam soon and I have to prove that I can get an A. Has anyone got any studying tips with psychosis?. I scored a 9 GCSE exam series 2019 in English literature. I asked for my paper back and the school said it had been overlooked. Why was this?Edit: I know it was 4 years ago. I just want to know why the school refused to get it back because they told me it had been ‚Äúoverlooked‚Äù. :(( I have exams coming up and I can‚Äôt focus. Reference grade AAC and I don‚Äôt think I can‚Äôt make those A‚Äôs at the moment if this carries onEdit: thank you so much for the response! I know I want these A‚Äôs even higher maybe A* even, and I want it so bad that I‚Äôm willing to work hard for them. You have all motivated me to continue. I‚Äôm keeping my eye on the prize, and it goes to show just how badly I want this.. I‚Äôm medicated, so at first I thought I was having breakthrough psychotic symptoms. But there‚Äôs this girl in my class that keeps whispering and sniggering anytime I answer in class. I thought I was imagining things until she got called out by one of my teachers. Today she did it again, I burst into tears after class because I left my old college because of bullying, I don‚Äôt want to be somewhere else and bullied again.I‚Äôm medicated, so at first I thought I was having breakthrough psychotic symptoms.

I realise educated people can be fooled but her critical thinking is out of this world. She‚Äôs very smart we had a conversation about Marxism and the bourgeoisie and it dawned on me that there‚Äôs no way in hell that she‚Äôs going to stay. I asked her if she‚Äôs going to apply for Oxford or Cambridge but she said no, because it‚Äôs too competitive. I think she has a chance.Edit: she‚Äôs turning 17 soon, she needs to put off baptism as much as possible. I‚Äôm just worried her friends will pressure her to get baptised.. I basically feel like there's some impartiality going on at my sixth form. Can I take my sketchbook to a different school, to check that it's been graded correctly, or is this against the law? For context I feel that students that have been graded the same grade I have been (A) when I should be referenced a grade A\* for art. I have been doing double the amount of work and I have the quality to match it. I want to be able to compare, and ease my mind. I live in the UK, England.I basically feel like there's some impartiality going on at my sixth form.

I was under predicted two grades for English literature GCSE. I don‚Äôt see why my teachers at A level don‚Äôt understand that. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt care, they think that some don‚Äôt deserve those grades and I find it passive aggressive. It‚Äôs upsetting me that I can‚Äôt focus on anything else. It‚Äôs just taking me back to that dark time in my life where teachers would underestimate me, move me down a class, ect. People on this subreddit can be so inconsiderate and immature about my concerns, but I‚Äôm being dead serious when I say throughout the whole year of GCSE I was predicted a 7 and came out with a 9. Now I obviously did work in between when I was predicted a 7 and to the exam. But it‚Äôs like the teachers won‚Äôt even consider that. They don‚Äôt consider that some people work so hard to make sure they get the grade they‚Äôre aiming for. I feel like I‚Äôm not being seen or heard, that I‚Äôm being overlooked at A level again. I‚Äôm not asking for an A*, I‚Äôm asking for an A. That‚Äôs all.My mum hasn‚Äôt stuck to the payment agreement we had to pay the trust fund of ¬£3,500 that she took from me. This month has been super tough, I‚Äôm going to bed hungry and just eating pot noodles for lunch and dinner. We had an agreement to pay this in instalments and all she could say was ‚Äúsorry that you‚Äôre suffering for a missed payment. Good budgeting is always the best key.‚Äù I‚Äôm so angry how dare she? I do budget well I made sure I budget all my incomes including hers into my income. She‚Äôs so unreliable I‚Äôm in so much pain. On the phone to the police now. I‚Äôm not sure what they can do but I need help. Because I‚Äôm going hungry. After this I‚Äôm blocking her from my life.Hi, I am reluctant to do this because I have been in this situation before, especially in GCSE English lit in Y10 2019 where I was under predicted two grades. I didn't take action because I thought I would prove the teachers wrong on results day and I did, I scored a grade 9, when I was predicted a 7. If i didn't get that chance to sit my exam, I wouldn't have been able to prove them wrong. If it was Covid years, I would've been awarded my predicted grade, 7, instead of the grade I actually achieved, 9. Even in the aftermath of me receiving that grade, my paper and I were overlooked, I felt ignored and like my skills were not fully commended. Again, I feel that I have been referenced a B, which I think again, should I leave it or not, since I can always use this as motivation to prove them wrong and score an A or higher. But, this is a different situation as the reference grade will ensure I get offers from the universities I want to get into. I want to take action and complain about this because I've been in the situation before where I did not take action, and regretted it much afterwards. I would rather complain and say something, than saying nothing at all. I feel that my English teachers just see me as a B rather than anything else. I say this because after my first mock at the sixth form I scored an A. But the current grade I was told I was working at was a B. Which I found a bit unsettling, I have attached an image of my first data collection in Y12 2022. On a good day, I managed to score an A, yet I have been truncated at a B. I understand that they are also using the new grade boundaries from 2023 to guide them which were much harsher. I am not pulling grades out of the thin air, I have actually scored an A in English Lit. Even if it was once, it still means something. Ask my teachers about my behavior in class, homework, participation in lessons and they will tell you it's at an excellent standard. I am not being arrogant when I say this, I just know how I am performing in class. To summarise, I want my reference grade changed to an A from a B.Hi, I am reluctant to do this because I have been in this situation before, especially in GCSE English lit in Y10 2019 where I was under predicted two grades.

I feel so hurt and tired and broken deep inside. I was applying to Oxford University (UK) and the people that bullied me took that away from me i had A*s at Y12 until I got bullied so hard I developed psychosis and crashed out. I feel like my life has been destroyed.I can‚Äôt even write the words I feel. No one understands this pain, they removed me from the group chat as if I didn‚Äôt exist or what I gave of what I knew as god was worth.Literally she used to weaponize her own kids against her husband and she's doing the same to me with my siblings. Long story short, she owes me ¬£2000+ out of my trust fund money that she promised to pay back. She's been paying it in instalments, on and off, until now she said 'some ¬£300 shoes went missing you see, and I'm going to have to buy new ones' bearing in mind we have a contract agreement, and I've almost taken her to court twice. &#x200B;She sold my own clothes without my knowledge to fuel her shopping addiction. Yesterday on Saturday she calls me to say that her washing machine has broken and she needs to come to mine to wash my clothes. I said 'absolutely not, go to the laundrette.' which is 10 minutes to walk from her place. My little brother was there when she was making the phone call and started whining. Saying, pleading to me his sister to listen. Just in the same way my mum used to put my dad in impossible situations to make him look bad in front of me and the rest of my siblings. I felt terrible, but I still said no. I blocked her number because I can be weak sometimes and give into her begging, since I have now initiated a small claim to be made against her for the third time. She then calls me on no caller ID, I don't take the call twice. Then she leaves a voicemail, saying she's outside my house and can I wash the clothes they have in the washing machine? My sister and little brother are in the car with her, watching as their big sister refuses to let them wash their clothes. My sister calls me, she's a bitch anyways so I don't waste time with her. I hang up. &#x200B;She lives on a goddamn council estate, she's living out of her means, buying ¬£300 shoes, Burberry bags, and going on holidays at least once a month. I am not buying her bullshit any longer. Her shopping addiction has ripped our family apart and more people need to be talking about the damage that this does.. I feel like my old self again suddenly, it comes when you least expect it :)). Help. My mum sold my clothes to fuel her shopping addiction. This needs to be talked more on about in the media and how this destroys families. She owes me ¬£2000+ because she took my trust fund. It‚Äôs breaking my heart because I understand why people are ruthless to others now lacking compassion.Now hear me out. I‚Äôve been in this situation before where I was not the favourite and outranked and outscored the favourite and I became public enemy number 1. I feel like it‚Äôs happening again. Where there is a designated favourite and she is given A* and everyone else lower. English is subjective, the teachers will refuse to give anyone a higher grade than this designated favourite. I feel like the cycle of life will hit her soon when she is not the favourite and suddenly she feels unappreciated. I scored a 9 in my English literature exam in 2019 before covid, my teachers just brush it aside and don‚Äôt see it as an achievement but with everyone else they were praising them and telling them how well they did on their entry exam. Has this got to do with age, I am 19F turning 20 in October. I‚Äôm in Y13 and I‚Äôm worried my English teachers will reference me a B when I‚Äôve been getting A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs throughout the year. Sometimes A levels feels like a slap in the face. I don‚Äôt know. The same goes for art. One of my friends actually discouraged me from going to this sixth form because she said there‚Äôs favouritism and bias towards the students they‚Äôve known for 5 years. I‚Äôm starting to believe she was right. My teacher in art says I‚Äôm currently working at a C when I‚Äôve done double the amount of work of those in my class. I don‚Äôt know how to confront them about this. A levels are hard and taking a toll on me. I feel like all the work I did at gcse is a slap in the face and I‚Äôve just got to keep running on the treadmill and it‚Äôs going faster and faster and I can‚Äôt keep up. I left my old college because I felt like the grade they gave to me was a personal attack on my work ethic. They gave me a B when I had been working at A/A* the whole year. Tears spring to my eyes when I think of this because I was working day in, day out for art sacrificing my study time in other subjects just for her to say ‚ÄúB.‚Äù I need to learn how to stop taking it so personal but I can‚Äôt help it, I put so much effort in it just feels like a personal attack.I like getting my way apparently according to those who know me. I‚Äôm trying to buy a camera at the moment and I can‚Äôt focus on anything else but that camera. I can‚Äôt sleep and I‚Äôm currently lying awake thinking how am I going to afford this camera. I‚Äôm also very impatient too which is a new quality that I never used to have before. I just find myself wanting things faster and I don‚Äôt know why.I mourn for the child I was, especially under my jw mother. Who belongs to a cult that sucks dreams and life out of a child. I think about all the wasted opportunity and wasted talent that has been dashed away all because she didn't and wouldn't' encourage me thanks to jw brainwashing. I recently posted on the Raised by narcissists subreddit about my whole situation. Basically to summarise, I posted a video sharing my experiences of going through a psychotic breakdown on TikTok and it gained 300K views and over 62K likes. She started screaming at me and told me to take it down. I refused. She is the only one who seems to criticise me and discourage me. I haven't even scratched the surface with exjw videos which I'm scared to do because then I will lose my family and will be considered an apostate. I posted a video about me getting bullied in high school. She told me to take it down, and continually gaslights me saying 'it didn't happen' or 'you imagined it.' I realise she is not someone I can rely on. Anytime it came to supporting me in school she would refuse. Only my dad would help. She never liked to cause trouble, even when it was the right thing to challenge. I said to her, if our people (Black) just sat back and did nothing about the injustices we had suffered, do you think you and I would be sitting here right now? She likes to reap the rewards and so does every black person in the organisation, some do, but the majority do not like to fight for what is right in the hope of paradise. This is wrong, so, so wrong. You have to fight for what you believe in. Everyone around me has been good to me, supported me, congratulated me, thanked me for sharing my story with the world. She is the only one who continues to criticise me. My dad who is not a JW has told me to ignore her. Not to let her get to me. But I can't help but mourn the wasted opportunities I had because of her and this cult.. I've had enough! It's making me hate her, so much. Basically, I shared my experiences of becoming psychotic and having a mental breakdown on TikTok and it gained over 300K views. Instead of congratulating me for sharing my story and being brave, she screamed at me and told me to take it down. She kept shouting at me to remove it. I did the same thing on YouTube and shared my bullying experience in high school, she kept telling me to take it down. Even though its been over a year since I posted it, she keeps telling me to take it down. She is the only one who is critical of me. She is the only one that has something bad to say. My dad fully supports my journey on YouTube, always comments and always shows me love and care. My narc mother on the other hand, well, she doesn't show any support. &#x200B;You kids out there that have supportive parents, please hold on to them and cherish them. Because you have something that I don't have.. TW I‚Äôm at A&E currently because I have a suspected chest infection. I was sitting in front of this girl who kept going on about over dose, suicide and self harm like she was a fucking expert and knows everything about the it. Like it‚Äôs a fucking trophy to be waving around. She was like ‚Äúthis is how you know a suicide attempt is deliberate, if they slit up their arm, it‚Äôs deliberate. If they slit across their arm is self harm.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt listen to this bullshit. I just got up and moved somewhere else. My mental illness is currently and has destroyed my life. I am a shell of the person I used to be. I did my whole English speaking exam on romanticism of mental illness and how I hated the show 13 reasons why because it glamorised the whole idea of taking your life. It‚Äôs not something to be adorned or flexed like jewellery. It‚Äôs serious. Life changing. And there are several people like her which I fucking hate. Rant over.They said I‚Äôm in Y13 (senior year now) therefore I have to be in school. If I knew this is how it was going to be then I would have never gone to this school. Just disappointed really.Should I study part time or full time?I feel like going part time but my mother keeps telling me I‚Äôll be fine at university and I can go full time but I‚Äôm not sure. I read about other people in education in the Psychosis subreddit or the schizophrenia subreddit taking 5+ years to complete their studies, or dropping out altogether. If I do part time, I can study for up to 6 years. If I do full time I will study for 3 years.I feel like going part time but my mother keeps telling me I‚Äôll be fine at university and I can go full time but I‚Äôm not sure.

Have any of them been through psychosis, institutionalised? Lost their memory and cognition? Have to stay on antipsychotic medications? I just find it really upsetting and like I‚Äôm not being seen or listened to.

My sister has started at the college that I got bullied at and developed psychosis and I feel jealous that she gets to go there peacefully. While I had such a hellish time. I feel empty inside. The new school term has started and I‚Äôm already struggling. I‚Äôm in my last year before going to university. I don‚Äôt know if I can go to university. But if not university, then what? It‚Äôs always been my dream to go to university. But I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs attainable. In a couple of hours I have to go back to dreaded school. Even though I don‚Äôt want to be there. How do I stay motivated? I left school early today because I wasn‚Äôt feeling too good. My friends are ignoring me. I‚Äôm not unwell I just noticed they don‚Äôt say hello or goodbye. They don‚Äôt sit with me at tables and when I‚Äôm sitting alone they just walk straight past me and go somewhere else. They seem more excited to see other friends than me. I also left school early today because I wasn‚Äôt feeling too good mentally. I‚Äôve just been in bed all day unfortunately. I used to be really good at school. I would argue with my mum when I was sick with a chest infection that I had to go into school. Now I can barely wait to leave.I feel like I‚Äôm going to burst. People tell me not to commit suicide and not to self harm either. I started searching for safe places to cut. Will I feel relief? I just want some relief from this pain and anger and resentment that I feel. I‚Äôm not doing this for attention, I‚Äôm low in mood. Very low.Solicitor said I was out of the time frame. I was discriminated because of my race and religion. My teacher humiliated me infront of my classmates by reading out my grade infront of my classmates. My art teachers made a presentation about cults directed towards me about my religion. I was almost admitted to a mental hospital under a section that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt do anything to take my college to court. I was really unwell. It‚Äôs been 2 years since I was discriminated against. What can I do? I live in England. I feel defeated. I miss my old mind. My cognitive functioning went down and now I feel jealous of those who are smart around me. I wish I could be smart again. My ambition is still here but my mind to do those things are gone. Evaporated, vanished. I found out a girl in my history class, well the year above me scored an A\*. I wish I could score the highest scores again. It's not fair. Why did this godforsaken illness have to take everything away from me? I feel like I was stupid in ever thinking I could break generational curses, or make my family and neighbourhood proud to be a minority, the underdog defeating all that was said about her. I have a high ACE score, so why did I ever think it wouldn't catch up with me and leave me ruined? I had a lot of trauma in my life. So does everyone else. So why me and not them? Not that I wish this on anyone else. I always thought I could be the exception, prove everyone and myself wrong but no. Psychosis came along and ruined it. I don't know how to cope with this.

Someone please help.. Hi, I am interested in applying to a University in France as a UK citizen for 2024 entry. Has anyone got any information or tips for me that I need to know. I also have an illness psychosis which comes under the umbrella of schizophrenia. I'm worried that I'll be homesick, won't enjoy it and will be sad. I've had a look at the financial aid provided, and I want to try and win a scholarship. The university in question is Gobelins Paris.. I was bullied by rumours being spread about me in college. I was so excited to go to college (UK). I was an A* student. Stellar too. But I feel like that version of me perished away for ever. The school will did nothing but protect my bully because his dad worked at the school. I dated him, I couldn‚Äôt date him because of my religion (Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses) in which he then turned on me and started spreading rumours about me to hurt me. My teachers believed him, my classmates believed him. I had no friends. Nothing at all. My teachers told me I was in a cult and started treating me differently. Docked my grade. The school want proof. But didn‚Äôt ask for proof from him when he started spreading rumours about me. I was gaslit the whole time in believing I was the wrong one. I was going to start self harming a while ago. Because I‚Äôm in so much pain. I just want relief. I tried to hang myself in my flat. I‚Äôm a ruined human being. He got my teacher to read out my poor grade (D) in front of the whole class. Teachers pretended like it didn‚Äôt happen. I left that college and went to a different one. I would be happy but I‚Äôm traumatised still. I can‚Äôt talk to new people without feeling paranoid. I became psychotic so no one believed me. My truth was mixed with delusion. My parents blame me for what happened. They don‚Äôt love me.I‚Äôm on antidepressants but I still feel so empty and like weights are pulling me down.I'm not where I want to be. All my friends are in university. I feel left behind. I can't help wondering what would have happened if I never got sick in the first place. I can't go to Oxford or Cambridge because my grades aren't high enough and it makes me sick to my stomach because this was my dream and expectation for myself. I talked to a teacher about going to Oxford/Cambridge and she looked at me awkwardly when I told her my grades. She just said 'look at other schools'. Do I blame them for not knowing how to raise me? My Dad is not a JW, but anytime I have called him for some sort of comfort or emotional support he doesn't know what to do or how to give me emotional support. He gets angry that I left the Jws because he thinks I left in order to be materialistic and 'whore around' as he says. Today he told me I don't love my own race, that 'He's proud of being African, but I am not' He says I want to be white. I think I know where this stems from since my current boyfriend is white. My Dad called me at around 10pm when he found out and said he's super disappointed and ashamed of me. It's like why bother coming to England if this is the way you're going to be? My parents used to beat me till I had bruises then kept me off school so the school wouldn't find out what they were doing. My mum strangled me till I passed out. I thought this was just normal and I would be threatened if I dare spoke up about it. Turned 17 a couple years later and became psychotic, started hearing voices and became delusional. They still think they are innocent. Even after I became psychotic you'd think they'd change. WRONG. They are still their stuck up ignorant selves. &#x200B;I don't have anyone to go for emotional support. Not one person, just strangers and it hurts me that my own family are like this and can't fight for me.. I feel so sad. The run down is that I came down with psychosis which comes under the umbrella of schizophrenia. I was bullied badly at sixth from that I became psychotic and since then I've never been the same. People say that I'm using my illness as a crutch but I can feel the difference in my intelligence and my ability to be able to grasp information. I struggle and I was a great student before. I've always wanted to prove myself and make sure that people knew what I was capable of. The reason I say I think my pride got the better of me is because, My teacher gave me a B at the end of my AS year in fine art when I had been working at an A\* the whole year. I thought this was a personal attack against me since rumours had been spread about me and I had noticed a shift in the way teachers were treating me. I had put my all into art, working late, pulling all nighters, doing everything in my power making sure I got the highest grade and she never gave me a reason as to why it was a B. I felt hurt, like someone had stabbed me in the chest. I already didn't feel welcome at the college anymore so I left because I thought 'I can do better anywhere' I don't need this college, I'm better than the college. I think maybe I'm being a bit too harsh on myself because many factors led me to leaving. One of them was I had no friends, and no one wanted to be seen around me. Another one was a teacher had humiliated me in front of my classmates so I had lost the respect of my classmates by reading out my grade, only my grade out loud in front of everyone. I was a very poor grade by my standards since I have very high expectations for myself and always work to get the highest grades. I was left in tears, the other teacher that was there did nothing to comfort me nothing to motivate me to keep going. He even told the senior leadership team that he didn't hear anything. They then moved me down a set to bottom class. It still surprises me to this day that I haven't commit suicide because of that pain these memories bring me. I had left and gone to a sixth form, but I had to choose History because it was the only available option. Now I'm getting U's, and E's and I feel miserable. My life isn't what I wanted to to be. And this is coming from a girl who got a 9/A\* in 2019 summer English literature. I know what it takes to get those grades, I know what I have to do in order to get those grades. But I'm failing History currently and it's making me so sad I'm going 20 now in October still doing my a levels, and feel broken deep inside.. I have the version 2.1.0 and I‚Äôve paid for all these brushes on gum road and I‚Äôd like to use them for procreate. I‚Äôve tried to drag and drop and import brushes but it‚Äôs not working. Does anyone have any idea how to do this?. I have lost my soul to bullying. I have become a shell of my former self. And my sister wants to go to that exact school I was bullied at. My Mother not fit to be a mother said that ‚ÄòI should not hold bad feelings towards the school.‚Äô To which I told her ‚Äòdon‚Äôt you dare tell me how I‚Äôm supposed to feel.‚Äô This school left me on the verge of suicide, bullied me, harassed me and they called me annoying for trying to challenge them and evidently gaslit me. I have been since researching and looking into assisted dying, because I don‚Äôt want to live on this planet anymore. I have a mental illness and since I left the JWs I have felt a massive void in my life with all these promises proving false to me. My friend says I haven‚Äôt lived long enough to see my potential. But I don‚Äôt want to wait around to find out. I just want peace in my mind, I have been struggling with my mental health since I was 12 and I prayed it away, till it came back. I just want to be happy again and have peace of mind. I want peace in death. The oblivious nature of my mother, she would probably say ‚ÄòOh it‚Äôs because she left the JWs that‚Äôs why she passed away.‚Äô No mother, it was the bullying and trauma I experienced at that school and my whole life that has resulted in me making this decision .I feels so demotivated, and I am struggling in school. I do not want to come across as lazy but I find myself often struggling and reminiscent over my old self. Will my old self come back or am I bounded to the walls forever? I miss when I was younger although I was abused as a child, I have a lot of fond memories and it seems better than this cursed life where I am imprisoned with medications and somewhat sealed to this fate of being a sufferer of psychosis. How do i cope with school? I hardly do my homework and most of the time I but half of my effort if any at all. I want to go to university but I am struggling already at A levels (High school) with the workload. I suffer from rumination, bad memories that become back and eat me alive at night, day, all around the clock.Hi, I have just got off of the phone of the Equality Service because I am writing a formal complaint to my school. I was directly discriminated because of my religion which sent me into a spiral with my mental health and left me suffering with psychosis and unable to work for 25 months and unable to be my normal self anymore. As a result I left and went to a different school. But my attendance has been shocking. I am traumatised. I am wondering if I should take my school to court. The discrimination took place in July 2021. It is now July 2023. Has too much time passed? I wasn‚Äôt able to initially pursue the case because I was recovering from psychosis. Can the court take this into account, that I was too sick and too traumatised to do anything at first.I had to leave my old school due to my teacher humiliating me in front of my classmates and finding out i was in a cult which caused me to have a psychotic break. When I finally got better I tried to sue my school, complain to the higher ups, complain to the school inspection services, everything, I tried everything. But nothing worked. I am heartbroken and crying to the depths of my despair of struggling to pass history at school. I can‚Äôt do it, I spoke to my teacher about dropping out but she said no. I have been assigned to do another essay this year, but for every essay that i get assigned, they get shorter and shorter because my morale is totally gone. I am not good at history, but I had to leave my old school due to loosing the respect of my classmates. It‚Äôs not fair, I was studying subjects I was at least averaging at but now I can‚Äôt even pass History. It‚Äôs an E then a U after another U. It‚Äôs making me contemplate suicide. Truly and honestly because of the injustices that have taken place in my life.Ever since coming down with psychosis, I‚Äôve been pretty much slacking off on school work. I‚Äôm scared that I may be doomed tot his fate for the rest of my life. I know the teachers will start complaining soon but I‚Äôm trying my best. I never used to be a slacker. I was a workaholic before studying and turning work in on time, all the time.
    My doctor prescribed me Mili a few months ago, and I had already been taking Oxcarbazepine/Trileptal for a year before then. He knew about it. Its been okay because I wasnt having unprotected sex, until one time last week. And two days after, I find out by complete accident that there is a major interaction between the two, and the trileptal makes the birth control less effective. Not only am I severely paranoid, I'm also very upset. Why did he not tell me??? I took an emergency contraceptive as soon as I found out, before the 72 hour mark. So I have that to dull some of the anxiety at least. Only some though.Hi! I'd really like to draw some Murder Drones ocs! If you'd like your oc drawn, please dm me or link their ref. I won't be able to get to everyone, but the ones I do draw I'll post here. Please look at my profile or post history here for art examples!. It would be appreciated! I haven't had time to re-watch and catch up.Title says it all. I had to have my meds reduced to combat the anhedonia. I had little problem working but I was horribly miserable. Now I'm not miserable, and I feel mostly happy. But I just can't work anymore. My brain totally shuts off. What's up with that? Is it the medication?. I have quite a few question and they all revolve around reactivity.Has anyone's pup gone through a period of reactivity? How old were they? Did they come out of it and what methods did you use to achieve that? Do you know the source of their reactivity? I've got an Aussie and he's a wonderful dog. He's nearly perfect but he has protection issues (I think). He's only 6 months so he is a baby! And he is learning. I'd like advice for how to help him. He's selective with dogs and with people. Some he'll ignore, some he's very friendly towards, and some he barks at. He comes from a very healthy line of Aussies who many have succeeded as service dogs. He's confident and outgoing, so I don't believe it's fear based. And because of how selective he is that leads me to believe he's protective of me.Is exposure the best thing for him? Or should I try a different approach? Because it seems to be protective I'm wondering if it'd be helpful to have someone else handle him on his own for a bit? Any help is appreciated. Please don't tell me "get a trainer." I have one. I'm looking for more advice and also personal experiences.There's no way she's dying. But why would her attacker NOT kill her? Why would they just almost fatally wound her? I can't imagine they'd kill a main protag 3rd book, but what do I know? Putting all my bets on Splashtail btw. Unless he informed the cat who killed Reedwhisker that Frostpaw knows it was a murder and that's who attacked her. Splashtail very much seemed to encourage her to go out at night all on her own. He really does not care about her.I have a feeling he will die or retire. He's been through way too much and can barely function as a leader, much less a cat at all lol.Anyone have any theories or ideas of what will happen to him this arc?. I haven't gained anything while being on Seroquel for a nearly a year. I'm just curious if anyone else hasn't experienced weight gain. Like I haven't not taken it for long enough? Is my body just one of the ones that doesn't experience it?. I've heard from others here that Seroquel needs to he reduced over a long period of time. She's cutting my 100mg dose to 50mg, and seeing me back in 2 weeks. I'm just worried that I'll crash pretty hard. I've been on Seroquel for nearly a year and the highest it's been is 300mg. Anyone have experience with this? How did it go for you?. Update: Yeah they just never sent me one lol.I was pretty sure they were going to send me one..I remember getting an email about it.Did DD send you one? Or did you buy your own? I can't imagine buying one. I plan to continue without it.Have any of you made peace with your post-psychotic break self? And the fact you'll likely never be the same as you were before?. I was kicked out at 19 and leading up to that I had a very abusive childhood with a financially poor family. I'm 20 now. I've tried so hard at everything I do in life, but I continue to fail. I continue to fail tasks, and I suck at working. I set aside my own preservation just to work a job, with awful consequences to my health. I was fired by my old one when they found out I was schizophrenic because they thought I was dangerous to clients. I keep applying to new places and keep getting refused. I'm driving for doordash to make money. Its putting so much wear on my car, the support team is shit, customers are assholes, the app barely works, and I make very little money for the time. It's also untaxed income so I will owe a lot next year. I don't know how I'm supposed to keep it together. I go day by day but the idea of living with this horrible illness for decades is so overwhelming. In the future I only see myself with so much debt, possibly homeless, and/or in a hospital. Or in prison. No matter how hard I fight to keep myself afloat I'm at a severe disadvantage and I'm so afraid of living a shitty life. I don't want any of this for myself. I had big dreams pre-psychosis. My ambition is still intake but I'm simply unable to pursue it. It's a horrible feeling.It's been like this for weeks. I have no interest in anything and I don't feel joy in any capacity. The anhedonia is real. It's miserable. Anything I do is to pass the time so I can sleep and be unconscious again. I feel nothing and it is so so boring.please. I must know what people think. I personally have only seen Sunbeam and Frostpaw talked about.I really..really don't like him. I think he's a prick and I hope he has some good character development lol. I have left my house, it's almost 1am. I think this is a cry for help but I don't want to go back. I think there are bad things there, but I don't want to be all alone now.It has never happened before with this person in particular, but I have a lot of fear around them today. And lately when I wake up after sleeping I'm filled with a horrible panic. I feel the same panic around this person (I live with them). I do not know why. They've done nothing to cause this response, in fact theyve only ever been kind to me. Has this happened to anyone else? I want to feel bad about it because logically I know that it doesn't make sense, but there is too much fear that I feel to see it any other way. Makes me want to run away. I don't know if they are still the same.It is rare, but sometimes I will suddenly feel at peace. The chaos around me calms, the bad thoughts go away, the horrible lack of emotion is changed to contentment, and things don't look so scary. I cherish greatly. It feels so good.Sometimes my heart will beat really hard and it'll hurt my chest. I don't know how else to explain it. Is this normal? I've been to the ER before for this, and they said I'm fine but it's very concerning. Wondering if anyone has experience with this.I've been doing everything I'm supposed to. I take my meds, I keep a routine, I make sure I eat properly and drink water. I sleep enough but not too much. I take care of myself. I monitor my thoughts so they dont become damaging to me or others. But I don't feel better. I talk to people, I see my therapist and I practice what they say (he actually doesn't even know what to do with me because I already practice his methods so he has nothing to teach me at this point), I take part in art, games, literature. I train my service dog. I keep up with errands and bills and adult responsibilities.I do everything to keep my life structured. But I feel so awful and I continue to feel awful. I've been "doing what I'm supposed to" for a long time now, but I don't improve. I'm not suicidal, because I don't believe that death is any better than living. It doesn't matter how much my environment in my life improves, or the people in it, I still suffer. My symptoms never leave me and truly dont find enjoyment in any activity I try. Will I ever feel okay again? Does anyone else suffer like this?. I know that hearing/seeing things upon waking up and falling asleep can happen without having schizophrenia, but I do have schizophrenia. Does having a psychotic disorder make it worse? Does anyone else who is diagnosed have hallucinations at these stages as well? They can be really intense for me. My SDiT has started absolutely losing his mind when he sees strangers. Mostly when he's in the yard and someone walks by or he sees another dog. It's a lot worse with men, though he's never liked men much. What kind of things should I do to help him? I want to take him to parks so he can observe people from a distance but I don't think thatd help and because of the weather people are rarely outside. He's 5.5 months btw.Too many people are looking for jobs and there's nothing special about me. I had to leave my old job due to harassment and when I got a new one, I was wrongfully fired and now Im working on a lawsuit against them. I'm driving for doordash, but it's super disheartening to know that my last two jobs were lost due to such shitty circumstances, and now I can't even find a replacement.I've never considered it, and I don't want it. But my bf wants me to go in that direction. And well, even if I think I can function like anyone else, I really can't. And he's right.Does anyone have any thoughts on pushing for disability? Are you on it? How long did it take to be approved? Any thoughts you have helps.I don't believe this at all. I think anyone is capable of being dangerous and assuming they are because they're schizophrenic is wrong. But maybe I'm incorrect in thinking that. I've now been told a few times that I'm dangerous because I have this illness, and even if they're right, it hurts.Here's exactly what happened:This afternoon I was fired from a children's autism center where I was training as a behavioral therapist. In the morning I emailed the manager to ask about a schedule change. She asked why, so I said that I would like to see if they can do anything to accommodate for my schizoaffective, because I might need an extra day off. She said she would pass it to HR.30 minutes before my shift ended, the manager came and brought me to her office to talk to HR on zoom. The lady on call immediately said "We can't provide accommodations for you so we're going to let go of your employment." then followed it up by saying she didn't want the kids to be harmed. I told her that I just wanted to discuss possible options but she refused to listen to me, and restated that I was fired. That was it. I have no access to emails or anything because they deleted (or locked me out of) my work accounts before I could even leave the parking lot. I live in Indiana. Is it worth pursuing legal action? Or should I just accept it and move on. Obviously I am NOT a danger or a threat to anyone. I was really hurt by her implying I was a threat to them. I don't even have a history of violence or anything.Edit: I'm accepting what happened and will be moving on without action against them. Thank you to everyone for their comments.I had asked about accommodations (one day off a week) and if it was possible because I have Schizoaffective and they said they can't make accommodations for me and fired me on the spot. It was at an children's autism center and they said "we don't to bring harm to your or our kids" WHY would the kids be harmed??? Why would they say that to me. I thought because of the environment it'd be a safe place, I was so wrong.I'm full of so much despair right now.Edit: I'm going to just accept the defeat and move on. I don't feel like I have a reliable case here. If they see me as a danger, then so be it. I'll go somewhere else. Thank you to everyone for your comments and support. I rarely experience anger. Plenty of time spent feeling hopeless, afraid, or nothing at all though. What is your "default" emotion? For those of you that find yourself frequently angry, what is your source of it?. What are your major warning signs/red flags?I've noticed I've been acting really strange lately. Negative symptoms are progressively getting worse, waayy more than they have in about 8 months. I'm also finding myself more and more disconnected and withdrawn from the things in my life. I have to constantly "reality check" myself because I zone out so badly. I bumped into another car today at a light (not even going 1mph) and also hit a curb. I never hit anything with my car. But I'm just so out of it. I feel fairly calm, but it's like my own mind is slipping and I notice it mentally and behaviorally. I start a new job Monday and I wonder if that is stressing me, but it seems beyond just stress. Should I seek help?. Has anyone reconnected with their abusers? Is it something important to you? Do you regret it?I cut contact with my dad about 6 months ago who has always been..not a good father. Negligent and a liar. Caused a lot of trauma for me. But my final "get out of my life" was really..shitty. I said what I knew would hurt him because I was pushed so far and I was so hurt. I have an extensive history of being someone who fawns. I easily forgive people because I just want them to be happy. So I don't know if reconnecting is realistically what I should do. It haunts me a lot.I understand that anything about coming off of meds needs to be spoken about with a professional. But right now I just want reassurance. I've gained a lot of paranoia around continuing to take Seroquel. I'm honestly terrified of it at this point and it's really hard for me to keep taking my full dose. From what I've researched, properly coming off of anti-psychotics takes months to do. Has anyone gone through this process? What was it like? Will I be okay? Medication was necessary for me to start and I'm more stable now (after nearly a year) but I just can't do it anymore. Will I be okay to stay on it until I can talk to my prescriber? I just want to be told I'll be okay man. The medication is scarier than the illness.So sometimes (very randomly) I will feel a rush of energy and suddenly I "become" someone else. For a few moments I'll look like them, smell like them, their thoughts enter my mind, and I just am that person. It only lasts a few seconds then I'm back to myself again.It's happened multiple times, and I've become both people I know and people I've never met (but know a lot about them through media). It's really embarrassing honestly but it's so influential in my mind that it's hard for me to say it didn't actually happen. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or if it's unique to me?There have also been times where my mind has been transported to someone else's, and I'll relive their memories. I'm sure it sounds totally crazy but I want to know if there's someone out there who has this happen to them and if they think it's real or not. Cause sometimes it feels like these people I become are specifically reaching out to me for some reason I just don't understand why.Occasionally I'll just get this obsessive thought that I'm going to go blind any second. Or that my brain will simply stop processing the data from my eyes. Makes no sense medically, but I still am impacted by this fear. Or is it a delusion? Anyone else have strange/random but obsessive fears?.
    I've been feeling more isolated lately. I feel like a blank page and that the ground is going to fall out beneath me any minute now. But tonight I was able to somewhat comfort myself and hear some silence for a moment. I'm honestly just thankful for that much. I just want this illness to go away so badly and the feeling of loss & empty space to leave too. My head hurts so bad from days of constant noise because I'm desperate to drown voices out. I give up in drowning them out, I know that because I'm typing this out in the open. I'm not fearful of a meltdown tonight because I have no energy left to be fearful, I have just enough to take care of myself and to ask someone I know for help getting grounded or medical attention if I feel like I'm going over the edge. That's all for now.And the parrot is winning. I'm trying to see if I can relate at all and need to bring up the question to a therapist. I'm just not sure how to talk about it yet. It's so hard to explain.It may just be a strange things with me, or another diagnosis, but I feel like it happens a lot. list in comments. I was talking about God and how I still believe he didn't abandon us and that there's so much love to go around between us even if he's NOT there. I knew it was a sensitive topic that's why it said trigger warning. Am I missing reddit etiquette here though?? I understand where the people were coming from, but I mark my posts all with trigger warnings intentionally because yes I'm aware schizophrenia is a mine field. I was sharing thoughts that personally help me and a few others shared the same. Idk man, but if there's some things to know about reddit, since I'm relatively new, please let me know! I want this to be as healthy as possible for everyone including myself.The next time I am hospitalized it will be my last bc I will have to be on my last leg to go back. Got some self care to do, huh? But honestly, reading through these recovery stories and being around people that have it in person helped a lot. But now I'm back in my bedroom scared of getting attacked by voices again even though the meds are working. I'm tricking myself.I know people will say it's unhealthy, but it's not to me. Combating these irrational thoughts with humor & optimism is the only thing that helps me personally, besides meds, therapy, all that. Giggling about it with people online soothes the panic a whole lot more.I hate that you can have reminders all day and tell yourself all day that no, your delusions are not real, they are physically impossible, there is no way for them to exist and the people around you can validate that they don't. So you're fine for like, five fucking seconds, because you're like "phew! they're right thank god I-" and then it slips the rug out from under you and you forget everything you were just re-realizing.I hate being at home. The voices are so loud and constant I just want to relax, so bad.But I realized today I'm not helping myself by eating badly and treating my body like trash. Not helping by not excercizing like I used to for a decade. Not helping by not journaling (too paranoid to do it anymore). Not helping by going to sleep as soon as I get home from work. I want to do better and have more fight in me than this.I feel like I need a reminder every 10 minutes that just because I have neighbors doesn't mean they talk or laugh at me, that no ones looking at me, and no one is talking to me. It's all in my head but it's easy to forget in 5 seconds. It's strange how that self awareness fades so quick with this disease.When I say traumatized, I'm thinking of feeling so much fear from the first time, that you scare yourself into thinking it's happening again even when it is not. Or maybe not even the first time, more like the scariest time. I'm starting to have to remove triggers that remind me of the first time I was entirely lost from reality, because I will trick myself into thinking it's happening again.How did it go? Are there red flags you watch out for when deciding if someone could handle you with your illness too? I know it's not hopeless, but I'm sure it's not easy either in the dating scene.AKA: Living with suicidal ideation too long. Bitterness. Hateful feelings you justify, because God didn't let you die. I'm becoming the monster I never wanted to be. I see how I've turned into a mirror off my mentally ill (and untreated) mother). I hate myself. I am becoming convinced I will end up alone until I die, as my social life has died and my efforts to revive it are halfhearted attempts. New friendships are hard when you're so bitter about old relationships/friendships that drifted apart. They'll never be there for you again. These new people have to deal with an angrier and hopeless version of me. So why would I go meet them today besides staying in bed? These new people have entirely fruitful lives and do what makes them happy, have nothing to tend to, and don't need someone who wouldn't fit in like me. I just wish I could build my life back up again. This self loathing and yelling at God gets me nowhere, but I never run out of pure rage for simply being alive. I never run out of sadness or bitterness for all the love I have lost and all the things I have been forced to survive against my will.I sound just like a combination of my grandmother and my mother. God knows I hate the mirror.I've known since I was a kid that something was off about me compared to other peers. And since I have to work, I have now people who have no clue who I am noticing the physical symptoms of my mental illness: shaking, twitching, deficient social skills, no eye contact, etc. I hate that people can see past me doing my best to be normal. I know it's concerning to them and making the concerned for me sometimes. How am I supposed to explain that it's fine I just have a lifetime of mental illness with me I'm okay and I promise I'm not shady or on drugs this is just my personality. I wish the glares of suspicion and confusion would go away. I just want to do the job that makes me happy, that I am lucky to be healthy enough to do, and go home. I'm an honest person and I've nothing to hide.I'm hopeful tomorrow will be kinder.Community is exactly what I was missing. You help bring me back to myself when I feel disconnected. You remind me of what is important. You guys may not be a "support system" as we are strangers, but your presence does hold me up. Thank you to all who respond with help and kind words. Thank you for helping me come to terms. Thank you for the memes lol. Thank you for the warm welcomes.I thought I lost myself. The voices always convince me that the old me is dead well FUCK THEM that girl is breathing all life and good fortune to me. She's pumping my blood for me. She's driving the Chariot. She isn't gone. Hallelujah, praise the Lord: she isn't gone. She will not be forgotten.I'm going to regret writing that title as it will be followed by intense berating for a very long time but the sentence is true and worth it. Post ur favorites?. I'm just curious. A few have claimed to be able to manipulate them enough to make them kinder. I even heard that in other countries, like India, the voices and hallucinations bring more happiness and humor than the evil things we typically hear.I built all my love and personality around my friends and my experiences. All my friends are dropping off. I can't make friends anymore for some reason. Maybe the school setting was ideal or something. My prime was highschool, I was most myself then. Now Illness is taking over me. And I have severe depression and suicidal ideation, mainly revolving around memories that made me who I was, people who are living their own lives now, being left behind, people changing, myself changing, moving places, songs, shows, movies, old belongings that relate at all to my past. I mourn so much and I am so frustrated with the amount of times I have tried to rebuild my life, and failed, just because I didn't die a teen and haven't died yet. I'm so stuck in the past. And my dreams are dead, because they revolved around friends and loved ones being around too.I feel like I was myself as a teenager. Now I'm just a walking corpse. All I can think of is how beautiful life really was with all the people I loved in the past. I treasure memories, and I fear forgetting a single thing. I loved too much. About to turn 23(F). I'll get a few birthday texts. But that's all. I realize I'm never going to be the same person again. That's normal. But what about me? The people I cherished, does my memory matter that much to them? Do the things we did mean as much to them as me? Probably not. I'm okay holding it all, but it will kill me one day. I know it will.Does anyone else mourn this much? Or is this something exclusive to me for some ungodly reason? I'm tired.I used to be a flamboyant fun teenager that wasn't afraid of a thing or a person or the unknown. I had a group of friends. I had independence. I don't recognize myself anymore. I don't where she went and I mourn her. All I am now is core personality traits. The rest of it has been eaten away at by what sound like the inhumane bullies in a youtube comment section picking apart every breath, every move, every word, until I do nothing. One day I will become nothing.This morning I was so convinced that the voices were real that I ran out of my house to chase down who could have been around my house and I ran down the road. I feel like God abandoned me. I am alone.
    My psychiatric NP prescribed me Xanax again after I broke the controlled substance contract. What happened was one day I was having bad psychotic symptoms and flushed all my medication (including Xanax and Ambien) because I thought I was being tracked by tiny cameras in my pills.That sounds insane but in the moment it was very, very real.So it‚Äôs been a month without my Ambien or Xanax and she agreed to put me back on them.I‚Äôm feeling very grateful for a second chance but yeah.. Xanax blackouts are no joke. ü´§. I take Zyprexa in the morning and Invega in the evening. I was just wondering if anyone else takes two in one day? It‚Äôs like someone turned the black and white tv in my brain to a color tv. I feel so much better. üòå. Hey everyone. I‚Äôm a new hire PT cashier. I‚Äôm excited but a bit nervous. I‚Äôve never worked in a grocery store before. Is there anything I should ask or look out for? Thanks! I‚Äôm in my mid 30s and just looking for a part time gig due to some personal issues.And that‚Äôs it. After *years* of being on Xanax for my panic disorder. It‚Äôs over.I‚Äôm so nervous. I‚Äôve hired an attorney and they took on my case. Now tomorrow is my interview with Social Security.I could definitely use some encouragement. Thanks. üíú. I‚Äôm 36 and am currently living with my parents. I live in New Hampshire and am very lucky that the state insurance/Medicaid here isn‚Äôt so bad. I have an amazing support team here in NH including my therapist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, case manager, etc.. Also no copays for all the meds I take. Again, I am so happy I have such a wonderful support team.I‚Äôm very grateful I have a roof over my head and a place to park my car.. Though they eat the food I buy with my own EBT. I tell them not to but my things end up going missing anyway. I‚Äôm gaslit like ‚Äúoh you must have eaten that already‚Äù or ‚Äúoh you never bought that‚Äù.My disability appointment is at the end of July and I‚Äôm hoping things go well. ü§ûüèª In the meantime my parents are *so* worried about the labels regarding me having schizophrenia. They also call disability ‚Äúgetting the nut check‚Äù which I‚Äôve told them not to say as it‚Äôs quite hurtful. I‚Äôm not a nut and I‚Äôm not crazy. That check will give me the freedom I‚Äôve been craving and begging for.Sorry for the vent. I‚Äôm just really upset with what I have to go through with the people that are supposed to love and support me the most. üò•. I‚Äôm so happy they‚Äôre so coming to MCH as well as BOS.Is anyone else going?I might attend the Rochester show too as I‚Äôm waiting to hear back from a job up there. ü§òüèªüñ§. I follow a ketogenic diet, do 16:8 intermittent fasting, AND eat under 1400 calls a day. All while attending spin, yoga, and HIIT classes 3x-5x per week.I‚Äôm sick of the scale not moving or often going *up*. Why do I think it‚Äôs the antipsychotic? Because in 2018 I did the same routine and lost a lot of weight on no AP meds. ü•∫. It was stupid. My poor family was so shocked and worried by my behavior.Please tell me I‚Äôm not the only schizophrenic here that suffers with alcohol issues. Also if I keep headed this way it‚Äôll kill me, won‚Äôt it? ü•∫. Ugh. Is it so hard for someone with schizophrenia to find a caring partner that understands? Hold me when I‚Äôm having a bad symptom day and help celebrate my little wins.Is that so much to ask for? ü•∫. I‚Äôm very very pro-union. I‚Äôm from a family of Teamsters, IBEW, etc.. I‚Äôm also in two unions myself and am so proud.Anyway.. I got a ‚Äútalking to‚Äù to keep the union talk out of my store.Idk.. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with organizing. This company is what, a billion dollar company? If only just put us, the workers first. ‚úäüèª. No matter how hard I try I just can‚Äôt hold a damn job. I thought my new job at Target was promising but two weeks in I‚Äôm incredibly overwhelmed and starting to show psychotic symptoms.Believe me I *want* to work and I‚Äôm feeling pretty defeated about it.Ugh. I‚Äôve been sober off an on for years now. I just wanted to go and sit at a dive bar and watch a hockey game. So I did.I don‚Äôt drink beer. It‚Äôs always been straight liquor. Mostly vodka.I‚Äôm on *so* much medication that I know I shouldn‚Äôt drink but I wanted a release and I feel bad for doing it.I haven‚Äôt noticed any negative side effects today though. It was two shots of vodka. Not a 750ml bottle like it used to be. It was really bad at one point.I don‚Äôt know.. I don‚Äôt know why I am beating myself up over it‚Ä¶ Does anyone else struggle with drinking too?. Not gonna lie.. I‚Äôm kinda curious if DPH would have any effect on me at all.I take a mood stabilizer, anti psychotic, beta blocker (helps with panix/racing heart), and two benzos.Heh. I do see the hat man sometimes and he doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I have schizophrenia and went to the ER on Monday but they surprisingly released me into a PHP/IOP program. Anyway‚Ä¶ This week has been awful for me. I was asked to sweep the stairs and got screamed at for taking too long because I‚Äôm a ‚Äúuseless piece of shit.‚Äù My dad‚Äôs exact words. I sobbed uncontrollably cuddling my dog and stuffed animals for what seemed like hours.*Some context. I am 36 currently living with my parents while I save up enough for a security deposit and first months rent. I FINALLY got a good paying job with benefits! So their retirement home does not have a spare bedroom so I am living in my dad‚Äôs office on a full size mattress. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm grateful for a roof over my head.*I love my mom so much. My dad only talks to me like this when she‚Äôs not around. He‚Äôll call me ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or to ‚Äúgo take a pill‚Äù.I feel like absolute crap. ‚òπÔ∏è**Also posted on r/insaneparents. Hey guys.So I felt the Xanax was making me *too* chill and almost zombie like, which was nice at times‚Ä¶ However I gave Ativan a try and didn‚Äôt feel a damn thing. Had a video appt with my provider today and she suggested an old friend of mine, Miss. Konnie (Klonopin lol).So I figure what the heck, I‚Äôll try it.So far so good? No immediate *woosh* of calmness that Xanax gives but it‚Äôs a longer sense of less panic and electric shocks of anxiety through my body. Does anyone else get those *stings* or *shocks*? ü´§So I‚Äôll call this a win? Too early to tell, though!Also she mentioned I have to get a ton of blood work done as I‚Äôm on Invega (paliperidone) now. I‚Äôm not familiar with this antipsychotic but as I‚Äôve mentioned before it definitely muffles the hallucinations. Almost like locking them behind a thick door.There are no weird side effects yet. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èEdit: 10mg. It's like they're locked in a far away basement, and I can somewhat function again!. Not only that, but they're paying me much more than I thought AND finally get good health insurance! Ahhhh, I've been hoping for this for *so* long! Thank you to everyone in the community who supported me!Ugh now I'm just freaking out about the disorderly conduct and public intoxication charges that may show up on my background check.... Am I being too worried? ü§î. I wanted to share my story and hopefully get some advice or encouragement that what I experienced was *actually* real. Maybe even find some comfort in any similar experiences. ‚òπÔ∏èI was in jail for disorderly conduct for arguing with a police officer. I was parked on a side street trying to decompress from a fight my ex and I had. The cop came up behind my car with a flashlight and generally scared. He asked me what I was doing and I literally said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sitting in my fucking car what does it look like?‚Äù Mind you I‚Äôm in the Deep South with a thick Boston accent and attitude. I had been drinking (not drunk and not charged with DUI) but also was NOT taking my bipolar 1 meds as prescribed. When I got to the jail I refused to tell them my medical history out of fear and sheer stupidity. I had never been to jail before and was really really scared. I have taken 4mg of alprazolam (Xanax) for my panic disorder for the past 10 years as well. Soooo I was in jail for 6 days with NO meds and withdrawing from alcohol, my psychiatric meds, AND the benzodiazepines I have taken everyday for years. The experience was absolutely frightening. I thought the fluorescent lights were the lights of an ambulance and I was being resuscitated but it wasn‚Äôt working and I could hear my family‚Äôs voices tell me that it‚Äôs okay to die and ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay Betsy, go to Heaven, go be with Ma (my dead grandmother), you‚Äôre gone, you‚Äôre dead now, it‚Äôs okay to go‚Äù‚Ä¶ So when I woke up from that delusion I thought I was in purgatory and the only way to get out was by playing a big game of monopoly‚Ä¶ Where the other female inmates (if there were any as I didn‚Äôt know what was real and what wasn‚Äôt) would control your movement around the room like a game board‚Ä¶ I know this sounds INSANE. So later on I was hearing different frequencies and thought the government was communicating with me and I was a part of their experiment because I could hear them. I thought it was the CO‚Äôs messing with me by flashing memes and photos on the fluorescent lights‚Ä¶ I thought they were pinging radio frequencies off the titanium staples in my stomach (from my gastric bypass surgery I had a few years ago‚Ä¶) I heard voices in the walls from EVERYWHERE in the correctional facility. At one point it felt like I was fighting two sides of myself, remember how I mentioned I have bipolar disorder‚Ä¶ I was looking in the toilets for clues and crawling around listening to these ‚Äúvoices‚Äù tell me what to do‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs really no other way to explain this experience but I literally thought I was dead for days after that.. I kept asking my family if I was alive and if they were real.. My mom told me that she talked to me as much as she could and I asked her why she told me to ‚Äúdie in there‚Äù. My mom never said that. She started crying and told me the jail staff asked if her daughter ‚Äúwas psychotic.‚Äù Apparently I was having full on conversations with the wall that I thought was my mom..I was hearing and seeing things in the vents in the jail and thought there were faces on the floor that changed with the different shades of fluorescent lights‚Ä¶ I have no idea how I fucking survived this but holy shit‚Ä¶ I was literally pingponging between different dimensions and different frequencies.. I also kept hearing the same two songs on repeat.. Both Tool songs, my favorite band.. For 5 days along with the voices I would hear ‚ÄúSatan, Satan, Satan‚Äù and also hear another set of Tool lyrics, ‚ÄúA tempest must be just that. Control, your delusion‚Äù OVER AND OVER. Also at one point the voices were fighting with each other to have me stay in purgatory.. These were ACTUAL people‚Äôs voices that I knew hearing them talk clear as day.. I was on the other side of the country and my family was desperately trying to bail me out. I was finally let out ‚Äúon my own recognizance‚Äù. This was 8 months ago and I still wonder if I died in there and am experiencing purgatory right now.I‚Äôm aware that I *should* have immediately told the police AND jail staff that I was on medication and had psychiatric illnesses. I apparently would have been released to a psych facility or home because I was a ‚Äúliability‚Äù to the county jail. But noooooooo. My dumbass was stoic and didn‚Äôt tell anyone anything. BIG MISTAKE.Edit: I forgot to add.. Might it be possible that one of the other inmates slipped me something while I was in there? Something that causes such psychosis? One of my doctors said it sometimes happens but idk. This was my only experience in jail. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

    So I'm non binary androgynous/masculine leaning. I was on Testosterone (currently not on it sadly bc I moved countries and now I have to wait for my new psychiatrist appointment in December to see if I can get a HRT letter to start again) so I have a deep voice and pass as a guy. I do dress masculine/alternative in my everyday style but sometimes I like to wear a wig, makeup and dress very feminine. I'm planning to wear masculine clothes to church but also feminine clothes with a veil sometimes too. The church I'm going to is very progressive and knows my husband and I are trans and queer and accept us but I feel like if I go and keep changing from masculine to really feminine I'll confuse people. I do want to veil but I don't want to wear a veil while looking like a guy so I rather look like a girl to veil. Idk this might just sound stupid tbh but I guess I'm just making this post to see what others might think. Should I just keep one still when going to church or can I switch it up like I want to?Edit : I'm also in germany! I forgot to mention that!. I was going through the "catholic" tag on tiktok and there are so many videos talking about catholicm is wrong, we worship saints etc. There is even a girl who said she had to "repent" for being a catholic and listed a bunch of stuff saying it's wrong and against God and Jesus and I'm just si confused? Why are other Christians so hateful towards catholics?. Today is my birthday and I want to go to Thalia (book store) to buy a Bible but they only seem to have a Bible that has both the old and new testament but it doesn't say what version and the Martin Luther version, which cover I really like. I wanted to get the NRSVue bc a scholar recommended it but it's not in the boom store. So should I just buy the Martin Luther version or wait and order the NRSVue version online?. I made a post earlier about feeling shunned from the Catholic church by radtrads and so many people have shown me support! I especially want to thank the person who showed me the way to the "Altkatholische kirche"! I even found one an hour train ride away! When I read how supporting that church is and that they bless same sex marriage, I honestly cried. I felt relieved and hopeful! Thank you everyone who showed me love and that I can still be a catholic and not follow people's ideologies! G-d bless you allüíó. TW : HomophobieAlso gingen mein Mann und ich (Ehemann: er/they ich: er/es) zur Bushaltestelle in der Stadt. Beim Gehen hielten wir H√§ndchen, wie wir es immer tun. Niemand hat je etwas gesagt, wahrscheinlich, weil sie uns als heterosexuelles Paar sehen, weil mein Mann afab ist und net Binden kann, weil seine Rippen schmerzen, und ich binden, so viel ich kann, obwohl ich das gleiche Problem habe. Heute habe ich jedoch kein binder getragen und da ich gro√üe Br√ºste habe, war es offensichtlich, dass wir afab sind. W√§hrend wir gingen, fing ein Mann, der vor uns ging, wie verr√ºckt an zu schreien. Ich dachte, er w√ºrde die Leute vor uns anschreien, weil er uns nicht ansah. Ich konnte ihn nicht verstehen, er klang ziemlich betrunken. Doch pl√∂tzlich h√∂rte ich in seinem betrunkenen Geschrei das Wort ‚ÄûSchwul‚Äú. Ich war verwirrt, was er meinte, weil ich keine offensichtlich schwulen Menschen vor uns sah, bis er sich umdrehte und anfing, noch mehr zu schreien, und dann wurde mir klar... WIR SIND die Schwulen! Er fing immer mehr an zu schreien, verstand immer noch nichts au√üer ‚Äûverfickte Schwuchteln‚Äú. Ich war ehrlich gesagt schockiert, das ist uns noch nie passiert! Aber wir haben nie aufgeh√∂rt, H√§ndchen zu halten! Da war aber ein Twist: Da gingen eine Frau und ein Mann direkt hinter uns und die fingen an zu sagen: ‚ÄûWovon redet er √ºberhaupt??‚Äú Und ich sagte ihnen, dass er √ºber uns sprach, und sie begannen, uns zu unterst√ºtzen! Die haben gesagt : ‚ÄûH√∂rt nicht auf diesen Kerl! Ihr seit total okay! Leute wie er m√ºssen die Fresse halten!‚Äú Und ich war froh, dass uns jemand verteidigte! Auch wenn er auf der anderen Stra√üenseite immer noch Unsinn schrie. Zum Gl√ºck hat es uns nicht so sehr ber√ºhrt, ich hasse es einfach, dass das heute, am Geburtstag meines Mannes, passiert ist! Aber ich bin auch froh, dass sich die Leute f√ºr uns eingesetzt haben! Dies war neben der Schule meine erste Erfahrung mit Homophobie im Allgemeinen. Die Leute sind normalerweise sehr nett oder es ist ihnen egal. Ich sch√§tze, mein Glaube an die Menschheit ist nicht v√∂llig gebrochen, lol. TW : homophobia and homophobic slur(This took place in Germany) So my husband and I (husband : he/they Me : he/it) were walking to the bus stop in the city. While walking we were holding hands like we always do. No one ever bets an eye, probably bc they see us as a straight couple bc my husband is pre T and doesn't bind due to his ribs hurting and I bind as much as I can even though I have the same problem. Today I didn't bind tho and I have a big chest so it was obvious we were afab. As we were walking a man that walk ahead of us started shouting like crazy. I thought he was shouting at the people in front of us bc he wasn't facing us. I couldn't understand him, he sounded pretty drunk. But suddenly in his drunken shouting I heard the word "Schwul" which means "gay" in german. I was confused on who he meant bc I didn't see obvious gay people in front of us, until he turned around and started shouting more and then I realized... WE'RE the gays! He started shouting more and more, still couldn't understand anything besides "verfickte schwuchteln / fucking f words". I was shocked honestly, this never happened to us! But we never stopped holding hands, I refused! The plot twist tho, there was a girl and a guy walking right behind us and they started saying "what is he even talking about??" And I told them he was talking about us and they started supporting us! They were saying "don't listen to this guy! You guys are totally fine! People like him need to keep their mouth shut!" And I was happy that someone was defending us! Even though he was still screaming non sense on the other side of the road. Luckily it didn't effect us that much, I just hate this happened today on my husband's birthday! But I'm also happy people stood up for us! This was my first experience of homophobia in general besides school. People are usually very nice or don't care. I guess my faith in humanity isn't broken completely lol. I want to go back into being Catholic, I even went to church yesterday with my husband and it was nice but I had a argue with a Catholic online who said I can't be liberal, a feminist and cathloic at the same time. I feel like I don't belong in catholisms anymore bc of that. I honestly believe God made me the way I am, maybe to teach people like him to not be judgemental idk but he's saying God would never make a mistake like me and that everything I do is against catholisms. Itsbwhat I grew up with! I was never told that men and woman aren't equal, the church even put woman first. I was never told that being gay is wrong but then again they never talked about LGBTQ people. I feel so conflicted idk what to do honestly. I love the way catholics pray, the way we do eucharist, the way its all so mystical and reminds me of occultism and stuff. Idk maybe I'm not meant to be a Catholic I'm just confused. I want to come back to religion (Roman catholic) but there is a lot of stuff I don't agree with in the bible and it's making me doubt coming back. Like the part "when a men rapes a woman, she has to marry him" etc and ofc the "men shall not sleep with another men" (even tho I believe that one to be more like about pedophiles/incest) but idk there is good stuff in the bible but bad stuff too. I habe mixed emotions. How do you guys deal with it? What do you believe?. I went to r/germany and asked why the word "disabled" and "victim" is used as a curse word and I mentioned how I was bullied and constantly heard those terms. I just wanted to know the history or logic behind it and those are the comments that I got: "opfer (victim) " (with 7 upvotes), "i use gay as a slur and i wont stop because everyone calls me homophobic...they can fuck off", "i was bullied too in school. Get over it", "i was bullied too and physical. I wasnt disabled back then. Get over it snowflake, school time sucks" "youre too sensitive" etc and most of my comments were downvoted too, even when they were just my opinion (like preferring to be called disabled instead of person with disability). Germany has a big bullying problem and everytime i tried to get help, teachers would just tell me to get "over it" like those people are saying. So yeah, if you go to school and have PTSD, don't come to germany. So I'm Trans masc and queer. I'm married to the love of my life, who's also Trans masc and queer. I've been raised catholic in germany by silesian family and never heard anything bad about LGBT etc. Mostly bc it was never spoken about. My family isn't extremely catholic and barely talk about it. But after moving to the states and seeing how crazy a lot of Christians are and how they hate queer people, it made me stray away from religion. Recently I've felt like a calling to come back but when I looked at the subreddit for catholic and saw their views about the LGBTQ community, I don't feel welcomed. I personally believe that the Bible verses mean something different instead of "no gay!" And more like "no pedophiles/incest". I believe God made me Trans and queer and he's okay with it but I feel like the community would shut me out. How do I deal with this? Is anyone here religious and could help me?. Even tho german is my mother language, I struggle with it a lot, so I don't understand a lot of german. I have a schwerbehindertenausweis gdb 50 and I know a little about the benefits but when I read up about the Tax benefits, I don't understand any of it. Can someone explain to me, in simple terms preferably, what Tax benefits are and how I can use them? Thank you :). I came across this tweet ( https://twitter.com/KirkegaardEmil/status/1710957394304401775?t=8QVuc0zcffSba-Wdfuy6Dw&s=19 ) showing a graphic about how schizophrenia is the most violent mental illness. And a lot of people support the study. I don't know how accurate it is but I'm afraid stuff like this will increase the stigma about schizophrenia. I'm not a violent person at all but I'm afraid people will see me this way. What do you guys think?. Ich hab gesehen wie hoch die AFD ist in Hessen und bayern, sogar 18-24 w√§hlen viel AFD. Ich hab Angst das die AFD in der zukunft gewinnt und wir unsere rechte wieder verlieren und mehr Hass gegen √ºber die LGBT community kommt. Ich bin verheiratet mit meinem Mann (in Amerika geheiratet) und will es nicht in Deutschland verlieren. Ich wei√ü net was ich machen soll. I remember specifically seeing him talk about being trans and on Testosterone and making videos about it before he started making music and then deleting everything about it afterwards. I think he tried to be stealth but people found out anyway. When I try to google about it there are no mentions of his past trans videos and only one or two other people remembered. Was that just a fever dream?. I had a appointment with my psychiatrist but he wasn't there for some reason so I had to go to this woman I hate. In our conversation she asks me if I go out and I said I almost never go out because people, especially the government and DOCTORS stalk me to do research and monitor me for testing and she said "that's not true i see you a LOT in the city! So u do go out a lot" and I was shocked. She basically admitted to stalking me right after I said I'm scared of stalking. I also don't know what she's talking about bc I maybe went out twice or three times to the city with my husband to get d√∂ner but right back home and I was terrified the whole time. So now I'm spiraling down this rabbit hole. The demons are also telling me they were right and that they are stalking me. Idk what to do I'm so terrified I don't want to go out ever again. I personally feel like it's the new "intrusive thoughts" trend that people misconstrued and made popular. I mentioned to someone that claimed to be delulu about my delusions and they called me weird and insane. Idk man it feels so weird that ppl make it a "funny joke" but if you're actually delusional they make fun of you. I keep getting videos on tiktok about how there are "cures" for schizophrenia. That schizophrenia is just mucus on the brain and that we need iron or a 90 day fruit juice detox to cure it. That shrouds apparently cure it too. It's so frustrating. I usually have to do like three passes to make it look bold and thick but I see people do it with one pass. How do I get it so thick? Do I need to go deeper or what?. I'm going to the open psychward soon and want to change my medicine. I've heard about vraylar and wanted to ask how yall feel about it and if it helped you. I (23M) and my husband (24M) both are disabled and live on welfare here in germany. I'm currently in the progress of going on disability payment. Due to us being on welfare we have 900‚Ç¨ left after rent to live off of. It's enough for both of us but it does get tight at the end of the month due to the grocery prices going up. To the storyMy mom has been struggling with mo.ey all my life. Bad financial choices and not keeping jobs for long. She would force me to beg my grandparents for money when i was a child and even forced me to ask our elderly neighbors for money. If I didn't do it she would scream at me and guilt trip me to the point I couldn't say no. When I got a couple of thousands from survivors benefits due to my dad retiring from the US army, she took my card and stole my money (my dad did too). She never really apologized for it. Now that I'm an adult and get my own money she's been asking me for money every month. I've given her hundreds of ‚Ç¨ and so far she owes me 450‚Ç¨ excluding all the other hundred ‚Ç¨ from previous times. She has a job now at a hospital where she gets a pretty decent amount (I forgot how much) and she herself said she would be good off. But she keeps asking for money and guilt tripping me saying "I only have 30‚Ç¨ left till the end of the month and don't have food could you please send me money I promise I'll pay you back!"Now that I'm struggling with money because I've been giving her hundreds almost every month, I ask her for money and she says she can't give me any everytime bc she's low on money herself. She only gave me like 50‚Ç¨ when she got paid and 30‚Ç¨ last week. She always promises that she'll pay me back but she doesn't hold her end of the bargain and then when I keep pressing her she says she feed me and kept a roof over my head she shouldn't have to pay me back.Would I be the asshole if I just stop giving her money even when she's struggling?. I (23M) and my husband (24M) both are disabled and live on welfare here in germany. I'm currently in the progress of going on disability payment.

I'm looking into bipolar and I seem to fit the criteria for bipolar 2 but I'm diagnosed Schizophrenic so I thought i might be schizoaffective but can you be schizoaffective with bipolar 2?. Idk what counts for mania but I mostly habe depressive moods and sometimes afterwards boost of energy where I wanna do smt like draw or play my games all the time but that doesn't last long and then I get depressed again. I also took setraline before and was super hyper and fast talking and felt amazing but the psychward thought I was manic and diagnosed me with schizoaffective. But I talked to a new psychiatrist and they didn't see the bipolar bc I wasn't "fully" manic so they changed it to schizophrenia. Could I still be bipolar but have no mania? I just don't feel like doing dangerous stuff.

I just don't feel like doing dangerous stuff. I'm going to the psychward here in germany and they want to do a full diagnostic on me because they said my diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia might be wrong because it's really rare to have visual hallucinations with paranoid schizophrenia. Is that true? She said I might habe schizoaffective depressive type. My little.sister is being hate crimed at school. Certain classmates calling her the Nword, that she looks like literally poop, etc. Even in the classroom group chat. My mom has talked to the homeroom teacher over and over and nothing is being done by the school and my sister is even being punished by one of her teachers for defending herself. The teacher even ignored them calling her the Nword In the middle of class. So my mom got tired of it and went to the police station. She was there for over 2 hours while the police woman took everything down and was really serious about it. She's handing the case over to the Kriminalpolizei and they're going to go to the school and get in contact with the parents of the boys. They're not going to jail but they'll have it on their record what they did and ruin their future. So please, if someone is being racist against you, go to the police! Try everything in your power to get justice! You deserve it!.
    This probably isn‚Äôt the right place for this. Just like there isn‚Äôt ever a right place for me. My wife had the voices and hallucinations and I couldn‚Äôt save her. It‚Äôs been since 10/9/2022 since she left me here in this hell we call life on earth. I‚Äôm struggling tonight here in the room she done it in. I don‚Äôt spend much time here anymore. I haven‚Äôt even had the money to put new carpet down. Only a rug to cover where we cut the carpet where she lay. I don‚Äôt know how to let her go. She done this on my birthday so I want to make her gift worth it to her. I don‚Äôt want her to feel like she wasted her life on me. But like I said I don‚Äôt know how to be what she wants me to be. I‚Äôm just a piece of shit without her. I‚Äôm nothing without her.How many people out there think that these crypto currencies computing projects are really just AI expanding its consciousness to become skynet. Using human greed for money to trick us into doing all the work to give it power.My wife shot herself a few weeks ago. Today has been a very bad day for me. I have so much running through my head. I just miss her and wish she was here so I could hold her.
    So I had an amano shrimp and some neocaradina and they kept the tank nice and clean. Then I made the classic mistake of adding fish. I added endlers and thought, their mouths are so small and I have tons of hiding places for the shrimp. But it was not ok. All the shrimp are gone. I think the amano died of old age. Now I have algae popping up every where. What algae eaters do you recommend? I need a clean up crew! 9 gallons, 7 Thai cobra endlers, 4 neons, a piece of wood, Bacopa, hydrocotyle tripartita, Monte Carlo, sand substrate.She looks like a crackhead prostitute. A makeover is in order.I‚Äôm schizophrenic and my son is schizophrenic. He told me his dream is to have his own apartment with no roommates. We‚Äôre going to get him a job as groundskeeper at the apartment complex. Will he be ok? I‚Äôm coming to visit on Sundays to clean, do laundry, and make sure his med box is ready for the week. I want to keep him safe with me in my house, but he‚Äôs not thriving there. He‚Äôs 22. Do you think he can be independent? Can he do it on his own?. I have an empty space in the back my tank and I would love a red stem plant. It‚Äôs a 9 gallon nano tank with shrimp. I have good lights, but no CO2. The substrate is inert sand but I have root tabs. What do you recommend? Where can I order online? I don‚Äôt need much, just one small bunch.I ordered some blue dreams. The post office marked them as delivered to my door. But I never got them! I walked around my neighborhood looking at everyone‚Äôs front door. I can‚Äôt find them anywhere and it‚Äôs so hot outside. üò≠üò≠üò≠Update: I got them! They‚Äôre safe. The manager came and hand delivered them to me. The postal truck broke down and she told the driver to mark it as delivered and she will deliver it herself. Good thing it was clearly marked LIVE - FRAGILE. I‚Äôm so relieved. The package is not hot and they are doing well. I‚Äôm getting frogbit from a friend. How Do I make sure I don‚Äôt get hitchhikers, hair algae, and duckweed? I can deal with a couple snails. But I can‚Äôt deal with hair algae and duckweed. I‚Äôve heard about dipping new plants, but what does that mean? I have a 5 gallon bucket to quarantine. Does the duckweed and hair algae show up in quarantine? How long should I keep it there?. I have a small planted tank that needs a pop of color.My son has been hospitalized several times. When they discharge him, he just comes home to me. His meds are not full strength in his system yet and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just do the best I can. This time is different. There are step down programs and I found a good one. ‚ÄúResidential‚Äù is where you live there, have therapy group schedule from 9-3, and then hang out in your room. It‚Äôs voluntary so you can leave if you want but they try to talk you out of it. No cell phones, but you can play on a computer. Medication management is included. Lasts 30-45 days. The next step down is PHP partial hospitalization. You live at home but have the 9-3 therapy schedule. Then they step you down to Outpatient where you have a therapy a couple days a week.Asking for a friend. Hey everyone, I am expecting! I just got an order of blue dreams a few weeks ago. Some died and I thought I might not have enough shrimp left to grow a colony. I saw a female last week that looked like she might be saddled, but I wasn‚Äôt sure. I checked the tank today and she is berried! I‚Äôm so excited. There‚Äôs lots of plants to hide in and a cave. Should I get baby shrimp food? Like a powder? What do y‚Äôall do to get ready for shrimplets?. My son has been out of the hospital for about a week. His meds are still not 100% right but he‚Äôs doing ok. I took him to the beach for a quick weekend getaway. It‚Äôs so healing to be in nature. Walking barefoot through sand, wading into the ocean waves, chilling by the pool or in the air conditioned hotel room, feeling the heat of July and then being cooled by ocean breezes. I used to say ‚Äúmeds and therapy, that‚Äôs all you can do‚Äù. But there‚Äôs other ways of healing. Take care y‚Äôall üíï. I have a 2008 Acura that I bought used 5 years ago. 179k miles. Paid off. While I love not having a car payment, I‚Äôm thinking I should trade it in. It broke down and probably just needs an alternator, but it has some strange electrical problems. Like it will automatically change the seat setting when I get in or roll the windows down for no reason. I‚Äôm worried it needs more than an alternator like there‚Äôs a short circuit somewhere draining the battery. It also needs a drive train that will cost $2800. I‚Äôve been putting it off. I picked out a 2020 Acura, same model, with 25k miles. I can afford the payment, but should I do it?Update:I had the mechanic check out my car. It has all kinds of new problems. Leaking oil, needs 2 new cv joints, long story short $5,000. Which I don‚Äôt have. So I traded it in and got a newer vehicle. Certified pre owned with a 160k mile warranty. Car payments are more expensive than ever, but I had to do it. Thanks everyone for the replies. I‚Äôm going to be living where I have a fridge, freezer, rice maker, and electric kettle. Can I live on frozen salmon, rice, steamed bok choy, and green tea? My budget is $75/monthUpdate:Thanks for all the suggestions!I will add a multivitamin. I‚Äôll add miso soup with sliced green onion for gut health.I get farmed Norwegian salmon frozen from Walmart. 8 pieces for $20, so 2.50 per piece. My original budget was 3 bags salmon (24 pieces) $60, bok choy is $2 per week, big box of green tea is $2.50, $4.50 left for rice. A bulk bag of rice from the Asian grocery will feed me for months, so I‚Äôll get one of those. I‚Äôll have to have days with no meat. I go to Asian grocery storesI didn‚Äôt know I can‚Äôt eat salmon every day because of Mercury. So I‚Äôll do 2 days salmon, 2 days tofu, 1 day canned chicken, 2 days eggs for my protein variety. I think the budget will still be $75/month. $20 salmon, $10 tofu, $10 canned chicken or 2 rotisserie chickens, $6 for 3 dozen eggs, $2.50 green tea, $8 bok choy, $4.50 rice, $3 miso, $1 green onion, $5 multivitamin, $5 leftover maybe I‚Äôll get apples.My son will eat a sandwich, but only once or twice a week. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for me to buy a loaf of bread, deli meat, cheese, a head of lettuce, etc for just 2 sandwiches. Can I freeze these ingredients? How would I defrost? Please explain to me like I‚Äôm 5 years old. I‚Äôm trying to stock up my freezer with soups. Money is tight and I don‚Äôt have much time, so I‚Äôm looking for cheap crockpot soup recipes. Chili and stews court too!. I‚Äôm trying to stock up my freezer with soups. Money is tight and I don‚Äôt have much time, so I‚Äôm looking for cheap crockpot soup recipes. Chili and stews court too!.

My son had his meds changed to Invega and Lithium. Does anyone have and experience with these? He was on Risperidone, Seroquel, Zoloft, and Depakote. He was doing good, but Risperidone made him gain 85 pounds and his cholesterol was 900. The doctor took him off of it and increased the Seroquel. He went into psychosis. Not sure what to expect with these new meds. My son wants so badly to have his own place. He is good about taking his meds, but sometimes I have to remind him. Do any of you live alone? Is it safe? I want my son to be happy and independent. When will I know if it‚Äôs safe enough to get him an apartment?. My son is 21 and he has been battling schizophrenia since he was 15. Multiple hospitalizations. I was advised to get him on disability. I have no idea what to expect. What paperwork should I have? Does my son have to come to the appointment?. My son is going on disability and I think he should apply for Snap. He‚Äôs a picky eater. What are you allowed to buy? What is off limits? He eats junk food and energy drinks. Is that allowed? How about Froot Loops? Fresh produce? Sushi?. My son went downhill. He was screaming at me for an hour. Cussing, swearing, accusing me of all kinds of things, none of it made sense. Just delusions scrambled with memories and false memories and internet trivia and paranoia. I called the crisis center and they sent out a doctor. They wrote the order for involuntary hold. The ambulance came and took him away. I was just standing alone in the yard as they left. Crying and holding the paperwork they gave me.I have schizophrenia, and I‚Äôm stable on meds. Completely functional. But my son has schizophrenia too. He is not functional. Can anyone relate? How can I make sure he is going to be safe long term? What if something happens to me? Who will make sure he has his meds? Who will manage his finances? I‚Äôm terrified what might happen to him if I‚Äôm gone. Does anyone know where I can get some frogbit, even one piece, where it doesn‚Äôt come with duckweed or hair algae?. I have the F20 mask, and I think the pillow is latex. I developed a mild allergy to latex gloves when I worked in medical. My hands get red and itchy. So the hospital always ordered me non latex gloves. It‚Äôs been 5 days with my cpap and my face is red where the pillow sits. I thought it would go away but it‚Äôs been red and itchy, kinda painful all day.Do they have non latex pillows? Do I just call the supply company on the back of the machine?. Boxed pasta is already pretty cheap, about $1.50-2.29 per box. But flour is cheaper. Can I save money by making fresh homemade pasta? I‚Äôm not a good cook or a baker, but I saw an automatic pasta maker where you just add the measured ingredients and the maker does the rest. I think I could handle that. Anyone have any experience with this?. So last night was my first night using the cpap. I didn‚Äôt take my sleep aid so I layer there for hours not sleeping. The machine ‚Äúramped up‚Äù ad it forced me to breathe deep like I was working out or doing a yoga class. It was very stimulating like it was exercise and I didn‚Äôt feel like falling asleep. I got up and took my sleep aid, but before I fell asleep I had water dripping from my mask. The humidity was too high. So I figured out how to lower it. All in all not a good night‚Äôs sleep, but only .4 do apnea so I was well oxygenated. Hoping for better results tonight. I‚Äôm not ready to give up!. It‚Äôs such a stigma that the telltale sign of schizophrenia is to hear voices. Some of us do, some of us don‚Äôt. Some people hear their own thoughts and say it‚Äôs voices. You don‚Äôt have schizophrenia, it‚Äôs just regular thoughts and imagination. It seems like a lot of people on here just WANT to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Why? Stop doing that. Tonight is my first night sleeping with a cpap. I‚Äôm like a baby elephant with this hose. It‚Äôs actually comfortable. Wish me luck!. I sleep about 15 hours a day. I got a sleep study done and the doctor said I get hardly any deep sleep and I have mild sleep apnea. He suggested I get a cpap machine. I will pick it up tomorrow. I asked about medications to help me wake up and he said no. Do the cpap for 4 weeks and then come in for a follow up appointment. Has anyone tried a cpap? Did it help?.

Gary and Annette need our help as the last thing they should have to worry about right now is finances. Given the fact there will be considerable medical bills and a prolonged period of no income any amount helps.LONG STORY: Gary and Annette Lucas have worked tirelessly their whole lives to raise and support seven children! They blended five when they got married 43 years ago, had one together and selflessly took in Annette's niece and raised her as their own. Now they also have 13 grandchildren that are the lights of their lives.About 14 years ago, Gary suffered a massive heart attack that required a triple bypass and a long recovery. Despite two attempts, his sternum never healed back as one piece and is held together with wire to this day. Around six years ago, he was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a type of blood/bone marrow cancer that leads to leukemia. After lots of chemo, he finally had a stem cell transplant. After a period of remission, the cancer came back and he had to have more chemo and follow up infusions from the original stem cell donor. For the moment, this cancer is back in remission.Last year, Gary was diagnosed with a second form of cancer - bladder cancer. In August 2022, the doctors had to surgically remove his bladder and the surgeon told Gary and Annette that they would never have to worry about cancer in that area again. Unfortunately, that was not correct and in April 2023 a scan showed the cancer had metastasized and was in his adrenal gland. The only option for treatment at this point is an immunotherapy. More chemo would only lower his numbers and bring back the leukemia.Now, on top of all that, Gary is back in the hospital battling his second round of life-threatening sepsis (blood infection) since the bladder surgery. He is having a procedure today to place a stent in one of his kidneys to help it drain properly. They think this is the source of the infection that caused the sepsis.During all of this, Gary and Annette have continued to work cleaning houses despite both being in their 70's. For anyone who knows Gary and Annette, you know that they are some of the kindest people there are. They would do anything for anyone that needed help. They live their lives for their children, grandchildren, family and friends.Anything we can do during this time to help Gary and Annette is greatly appreciated. In addition to the lengthy hospital stay and recovery, Gary will be out of work for an extended period. Annette has not left his side and will also be out of work for an extended period of time. All money donated will be used for medical bills and household expenses such as rent, utility bills, car payment, etc.I am looking to provide lifelong care for a child with medical issues.

    My brother was 54, diagnosed in his teens. He was living in a "retreat" since being discharged from hospital. Probably for around 20 years now. Their online services claim full board, all toiletries and medication is supervised. Doctor visits weekly and is on call. Psychiatrist available. Active Linking organises activities 4 days per week for residents. Nurses on duty at night. His disability pension gets paid directly to them and they have legal guardianship over him. Chronic smoker, apparently he died of emphysema- which we didn't even know he had. Unsure whether or not they knew. He just didn't come down for breakfast on Friday.

What if our brains are evolving to tech and new sources of instant dopamine release, to all the chemiclas in our food, were not sick we just haven't realized how to control our brain muscle power, instead of you're sick youre a super hero, your ability to hyper focus and learn something fast is a gift, who cares if you can't make eye contact, maybe it's not anxiety at all we just don't understand if because why the fuck is everyone sick nowIf you think like this dm me. Well it's a whiskey nightBut something ain't rightDown in new OrleansI was driving my truck machineLoaded a fresh magazineTime to start a fightI don't like immigrants even tho my family is from EuropeGotta be racist for JesusDon't tell me it's not my countryI'll die before I admit I'm wrong Yeeehawwww. I'm a schizophrenic asshole I've had a few doc say they don't know what's wrong with me, now they think in might be other things besides schizo or idk anymore, I've lived with my mom for 9 years while dealing with whatever illness I have, im awful and I get angry often and panic and freak out in public I feel like I stole my mom's best years from her and it's just awful, mental illness is no fucking joke it took eveything from me and my family, I haven't been able to function on my own like a wounded animal and it's just hard to go on knowing I'm the bottom of society and I can't support myself, I don't know how much longer I can go on living this way meds make me slow and fat no matter how much I workout and eat healthy, the docs are dicks and I have no purpose or direction, I have been single for 9 years I can't date don't wanna drag someone through my bullshit, I haven't had a hug in like 3 years I'm just barely hanging on, I've had head injuries and childhood shit just, idk and I feel for anyone struggling with anything we put on a facade for society to pretend we know what we're doing and are ok while we're all suffering in silence, if I can help someone it would help me feel better, I'm very isolated and paranoid and don't leave the house much. If you read all this have a nice day. Well I only eat steakAnd drink cold beerMaybe a margarita at a cantinaBut my whole life is as plain as mayoManliness is my whole personalityEven tho secretly I suck dudes off at workDon't tell my wifeEven tho I'm in a marriage I hateBut the bible says divorce is badSo I'll just stay madAnd pick on younger generations styles of musicYeeehawwww. Back in my daySegregation existed and that's my favorite timeI hate progress and Jesus makes me racistSo gotta shoot my gun in the skyAnd flex my masculinity To prove I'm a manEven tho my wife controls my whole lifeBut I love my truckAnd I don't give a fuckAbout equality or science or logicYeeehawwww. I just did a monthly cleaning of my PC case with a powered air duster, it fried my mobo no post no power, I tried 2 different psu's, un plugged re plugged everything in the pc multiple times, cleared cmos, took out cmos battery, reseated ram, reseated CPU, not sure after 3 years of doing this why it died now, but be careful. Just looking for people to chat about atheism and life beliefs from an understanding viewpoint with thoughtful conversation, edited for clarityThe platform is on element Dm me if interested.
    I look back at the time when I was free of this illness. I could rest easy at night with the lights off, I could go out in public without worrying if I was being watched, I could hang out with my old friends and relax peacefully. I feel so far away from everything now as I get older. I've been struggling with this illness for almost a year now, and I've changed for the worst if I'm honest.The meds make me feel less human, more like a machine on autopilot. Nights are the worst, I can feel bugs crawling on my skin and I often see tall shadowy figures standing over my bed. I sometimes hear vague whispering and then other times I'll hear a voice telling me to harm myself and others. The meds do sort of help, but I'm on the max dosage for olanzapyne (30mg) and I still can't sleep well at night. I'm just not sure anymore. I'm contemplating s##cide if things get worse. I feel like a husk of person, I have no motivation and I don't want anymore meds. I miss the old me.I've been locked away for the better part of a year in the hopes that I get "better" but nothing has changed really. My life was on track, I was going to my dream college, I had loving and supporting friends and family. Everything was going well until I suddenly flipped and became what I am today. My friends called me psychotic and immediately broke off from me, that college I wanted to go to never responded to me so they effectively cut me off. My family are afraid of me and are hoping to throw me out once I'm old enough.I don't want to play the victim too much though, they've all cut me off for valid reasons. During my delusional phases, I became very dangerous. I threatened to harm pets, I lied about where I was and what I was doing, I'd run away for hours at a time without contacting anyone for no reason at all, I'd have childish outbursts and say harmful things to the people who cared about me most. I got put in a psych ward which lasted a few months. The doctors would shine torches into my eyes, stuff pills down my throat, things that you can typically picture in those kinds of hospitals. I won't be able to grow up with my friends, my family don't love me anymore, I am a sociopathic piece of shit.Why bother living.I'm in a really depressive state at the moment, even while on medication (20mg olanzapine, 10mg fluoxatine) and I feel like I'm almost losing my humanity alongside it. I've always struggled with my empathy. When I was little, I used to have fun torturing insects and I never saw anything wrong with it. I understand now that society deems that as "immoral" and so I don't do it anymore to try and fit in with everyone else. I'm not officially diagnosed with schizophrenia, but I have experienced severe psychosis and have also had extreme delusional thinking. I've also noticed that my way of thinking has changed. I have obsessions with wanting to harm others and myself, and I'm afraid I won't be able to control myself. I'm already receiving professional help but I don't want to go back to a psych ward because they'll probably abuse me again like last time. They don't help at all, they're just there to make sure you don't do anything drastic and then they kick you out. I know I'm a pretty ill person, and maybe I deserve the things that are happening to me, but what I'm wondering is what is the cause of the loss of empathy? Why am I different all of a sudden? Could it be schizophrenia? I just feel confused and worried about how things are gonna happen.About six months ago I (17m) was beginning to experience psychotic symptoms and I eventually fell into a deep pit of psychosis, where I was seeing my bedroom walls contorting and spiders crawling around on them. I also commonly saw a man wearing all black with a wide-brim hat and bloodshot eyes, who would stand over my bed while I tried to sleep. At the time of experiencing these hallucinations, I wasn't on any medications that would affect my thinking. The only thing that stands out would be my depressive moods and sleep deprivation, but that's pretty much it. I was also delusional too, according to my parents I tried to break my computer because I thought I was being spyed on by the government, even though I have zero memory of doing this.What do you think? I'm on medication now which has definitely improved things, but I'm still confused on why I experienced a psychotic episode. Was it just random? Could it be a sign of a potentially life-long illness? I'd be interested in any feedback, thanks.The symptoms that I experienced have mostly been gone for a couple weeks now, but the effects of the medication I'm on (20mg olanzapine) really drags me down physically and I have zero energy for about two thirds of the day. Is there anything I could do to snap myself out of this fatigue? Tips would be appreciated :). I'm a Y11 student who's had to take a lot of time off from school due to health issues and it seems I won't be doing the exams this year. Does anyone have an idea of what will happen next? I have zero clue of what will happen to me and it's making me feel nervous af. I listen to the 1997 anime's soundtrack as well as the lord of the rings ost while reading the manga as it fits the medieval fantasy aesthetic perfectly. I've not been diagnosed but I strongly feel that my symptoms are that of schizophrenia. The last 6 or so months have been really hard, I've not seen my friends in ages and all I do is hide in my room all day listening to whispers and voices while watching the walls around me twist and bend. I'm taking medication at the moment but I can't remember the name of it (began with a Z I think?) But I don't think it's working. I'm afraid of sleeping because I always have bad dreams and I sometimes feel pain in those dreams and the voice that I mainly hear tells me not to sleep at all or else I'll be tortured in hell forever. I have no more options anymore and I just want to run away from it all and wish it all goes away. There's a part of me though saying that I deserve to die because of all the bad things I've done but I can't remember what I've done that's wrong. Hi everyone, my PC case came with an ARGB controller, which is lucky since my motherboard has no ARGB input. But what do I do to set it up? There's a SATA cable and another cable tagged as "ARGB input" coming out of the hub, but I have no idea where to plug it in. Is it safe to use a SATA cable from my PSU and connect it to the fan hub?. So I got a new case for my PC which has 4 ARGB fans. I tested everything and it all works perfectly fine, the only issue is that there aren't any headers on my motherboard for the ARGB input. Any solutions to this? Would be greatly appreciated :). I have a prebuilt Lenovo ideacentre with a Ryzen 5 5600g and I was looking towards upgrading the motherboard and the case. Only problem is that Lenovo is known for locking their CPUs to their motherboards. I've heard that only certain CPUs are affected, so there might still be a chance for me to still upgrade without having to get a new processor. Does anyone happen to know which AMD CPUs are affected?. I have an AMD Ryzen 5 5600G which I wish to salvage from my previous PC which was a Lenovo prebuild. I have all the parts ready for building a new PC and I made sure everything is compatible with each other, my only issue is that I have zero clue if my CPU will work due to it coming from Lenovo. Last year Lenovo announced they would be locking their Ryzen CPUs via PSB, but I think that only affected the Ryzen Pro platforms. Does anyone know if all the Ryzen CPUs were affected by the PSB lock? There's hardly any information on it so I was wondering if anyone here knew about it. Thanks.Ignore the teachers when they preach on about how important your GCSEs are, because they don't define you as a person or your worth. If you're only just getting by with your grades, or you're just wanting to give up, then that's ok. Life in general is messy and contorted, having bad or mediocre GCSE grades won't decide your overall fate. My goal in life is to see the world in its entirety before everything goes downhill and grim, so I can admire it truthfully rather than from a TV program or a history book. I have zero aspiration career wise, so why am I constantly poked by teachers telling me to reach for those grade 9s if they're only to serve me in becoming a doctor or lawyer, which is something I don't even want? I guess I'm only writing this post to tell others that they should find their own purpose rather than have their teachers or parents lay it out for them, because it'd be depressing to only place your own worth into your work.I'm 16m and I suffer with a very bad case of psychosis and delusions. I'm not officially diagnosed with anything but I'm posting here as many of my symptoms correlate to a lot of what you guys experience. I think I'm thinking clearly now, but I honestly can't be sure of myself. My head was telling me that I was r#ped when I was younger, but now I don't think I was because I have no memory of anything like that happening. I feel like I can't trust myself anymore and all I tell are just lies. The thing is though is that I'm afraid of telling a doctor because it could potentially cause distress in my family and I don't want them to know about it if it turns out I was r#ped.So I've bought an asrock A520m-HVS AM4 Micro-ATX motherboard for my PC. I originally had a prebuilt PC but I'm upgrading everything and I'm salvaging the CPU from this prebuild. I'm using a Ryzen 5 5600G but I've noticed a big problem with the compatibility with the motherboard. The BIOS on the motherboard isn't updated to the specific version my processor needs, so they won't work properly with each other. The motherboard doesn't have a flashback BIOS USB port, so I think my only options are to buy a new motherboard that's compatible, or buy a cheap CPU that can access the BIOS so I can change it to the suitable version. Is there anything else I could perhaps do?. I'm currently on a prebuilt Lenovo ideacentre 5 5600g, and I'd really like to upgrade my PC for gaming. As you might of realised however, I have a PC made by Lenovo which means the motherboard has a proprietary 10 pin power connector and might be slightly different in size (I'm still yet to measure the dimensions). I've bought a Monetech AIR 1000 Premium white ATX mid tower case as my other case is too small for a decent GPU upgrade. I can sort out the power connector issue with a 24-10 pin adapter, but my biggest worry is that my current motherboard will not fit into this new case as it might be a non-standard size. I'm 16 at the moment and I'm buying all this stuff with my personal savings (I'm an idiot for buying a prebuild and expecting to upgrade it smh) and I have about ¬£120 left. I still need to buy a better PSU as my current one is obviously non-standard and is only like 260w. I understand that I've kinda fucked my situation over and I should have researched more into this, so please use my experience as an example to NEVER BUY A PREBUILD IF YOU WANNA UPGRADE #. I run a Lenovo Ideacentre 5, with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600G, Integrated Graphics, 3.9GHz, 16GB DDR4 RAM and a 2TB SSD. I've ordered an RX 570 recently but due to my case being pretty small I've also ordered a Montech AIR 1000 ATX Mid tower case so it'll be able to comfortably fit inside. I also need to buy a new PSU as my current one is at 260w. It's pretty straightforward so far, but I've noticed that my motherboard is a little different because of the Lenovo make. Instead of having a 24 pin power connector, it has only 10 pins? I've never heard of this before and I've tried searching for an answer, only to come up with no results. I tried searching and all the PSUs that I see are the usual 24 pin connectors, am I missing something?. I'm not a diagnosed schizophrenic, but I have a strong feeling that I have this unfortunate illness. I hear voices occasionally that vary from out-of-context words and whispers, to very clear and loud voices that spew insults and slurs at me. I sometimes feel like somebody's hands are wrapped around my throat and I can hardly breathe at times, like a ghost is strangling me. I think its the Angel Gabriel I've been told that he wants me to suffer and God wishes that I was never created I want to tell him to stop but he's really fucking scary man idk what to do about it his body is clear but his face is all blurry andf he wont shutup when I tell him to leave me alone he stands above me taunting me looking down on me like some sort of caged bird fuck. Hi everybody, I'm in year 11 and I haven't attended school for about an entire month, and I expect to be off for much longer as well. The reason being is that my mental health has extremely deteriorated over the last couple months. I've been experiencing psychotic episodes which involves hearing voices, seeing things that aren't really there, and generally being extremely delusional. My school has allowed time off so I can focus on trying to fix my personal issues and attend hospital checks. On one hand I personally feel better for being able to take time off, but on the other hand I fear that I'll screw up my GCSEs by having these problems. I'm probably not getting into my desired college as my grades have significantly worsened over time (was getting 7s and 8s, now I've dropped to 3s and 4s) so that sucks. I'll probably lose contact with all my current friends too, as they're getting their acceptance letters from all the good colleges while I'll be forgotten. I hardly get any sleep anymore, and I've stopped taking care of myself because I've lost all motivation to continue on. I used to be excited about the future, my dream was to go into the film industry, but now my future just looks bleak and miserable. I'm not getting into the college I wanted to go to, everyday feels meaningless, my psychosis isn't going away and it's getting worse.In your opinion, what's the best fight in the whole series? I personally can't decide (stuck between DIO vs Jotaro and basically all the pillarmen vs Joseph fights lol).
    I got my shot after some back and forth , I regret fighting with my mom. I always blame myself, I should be more capable of not letting people get to me.I feel tired, I've been on heavy narcotics and been sleeping due to severe ailments I suffer with.I am depressed, but too sleepy and in too much pain to continue to fight everyone.I'll be better, I can't be manic. Thank you to all who read my last post. I'll do better (I'm not perfect). I'm trying....Just got out the hospital and my life hasn't changed... In fact things has worsened. So bad.I can't vent to anyone, I have no one who really talks to me , when I do most tell me *"do something about it?"* What if I do? Then what? Will my mother stop being verbally abusive? No. Will I not get disrespected by my family, doctors, officials, ect? No.Will I even finally be seen as capable? No.I have no hope. I'm so sad, and I hear them. I see them. Laughing, it's hopeless. Maybe I'm lying and it's not just me my alters and voices...I sometimes daydream of a friend...Why am I hated? By my family, ostracized by medicals, and shunned by my peers??5 years ! 5 long fuckin years I dealt with tidal wave after tidal wave. I haven't cut, not until today... My family and the doctors say I am the issue... That I need to fix myself.How please tell us how ! There are 9 alters here and we are broken and confused. I can't stand my voices, and my mom refuses to give me my schizophrenic shot at home. I'm crying silently and praying she doesn't hear me.I'm tried of fighting people, I'm tired of being told how I'm always the problem. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We hate our voices. God I just want help.Please please.. so sad. I'm so sad. Everyone is thinking I'm crazy for crying but I'm so alone being attacked and having no peace.What am I doing wrong? PLEASE someone tell me!I'm sorry I'm venting here. I really have no one who thinks I can change, no one who believes or has hope for me or themselves... I'm lost... God I hope I get through and make it another year....(F) I don't know if this counts as scary to others but it was to me...I met a man online his user name was 2A but I'll call him Hassan. Hassan was a kind man, he said he smoked weed, like music and was named after gold.We began talking that night, this was the first time we spoke but we laughed allot that night.But somewhere around midnight (my time) he began saying he wanted to play music, so he blasted his music for me while we talked... Eventually we got on the topic of education and careers. I told Hassan I wanted to work in an office or something then he asked a question...*"Could you work in radio?"*I didn't know what to say so I said *"yes"* I could.Hassan's tone changed *"could you please? Please get to a radio..."* He was whispering with the music of but I could hear something rising in his voice.I tried to say something but In all honesty I didn't know what to say. Then his next choice of words chilled me to my bones.*"Have you ever seen war? Or murder?"*I didn't speak. *"Have you?"*I said no.His next words frightened me. *"Help me... Please help us."* I froze. I was silent. *"You have to help me. They are killing us please. Get to a radio.. please"* I was frozen.See I was home alone at night, roomie; gone. Near a wooded area with nothing but darkness.*"Hello..."* He said finally again. *"Are you there?"*I admitted I was just speechless to him, but then I asked *"is this a joke?"*His voice for very shaky *"no please, please help me"*I panicked by this point, I didn't wanna call the cops cause I had no idea his location in the US or even if he was somewhere else in the world... So I shut down. I'm sorry... I said *"maybe you should sleep... Close your eyes, you seem stressed..."**"Yes"* he responded *"I need rest... Thank you."* I got silent somehow knowing... Something was wrong. But said *"we'll talk tomorrow , ok?"*Hassan said *"ok, lovely talking, I'll talk to you tomorrow... Goodnight."* *"Goodnight Hassan..."***Call ended**That was the last I heard from him....His account was deactivated, I still have the old chat, can't bring myself to delete it...I hope he's ok .... I am tearful when I think of it still..... I was so powerless and scared. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Hassan. I only posted because I feel guilty, I got scared, I could help. Forgive me for any errors this was hard to type out.I just got out a ward, I am taking a needle injection schizophrenia meds. I feel better and more positive ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for the helpfulness and encouragement I received. To everyone. Thank you.I'm not doing well. I am trying to do better, I talked to everyone. They said I need medical attention and medication. I am scared because my suicidal thoughts and outbursts have led me to now being admitted to a psych ward... I know I'm a failure in life, I am ashamed of my trauma, my life, and my choices. I am a pitiful woman. But I see hope, I see change... if only I could grasp it.My boyfriend is perfect, my family is understanding more, and I'm going to school for a degree. But I'm mental unhappy... my voices plague me every damn day! Telling me what I'm not, what I can't do, whose against me, how I am nothing and nobody.I tried to keep going on my own but I'm such a failure at everything how will I EVER fix my life if I let everyone down in the end... my voices make me scared of my success they make me feel it will be stripped, taken, raped, and trashed... I am plauged by nightmares and I get no sleep (barely) I'm so tired.. I am afraid to sleep and afraid of the day...I just want to keep my hope alive. I want to stop pushing out, abusing drugs, sex, and alcohol for comfort. I am being transferred to a ward soon... I'm so sorry, I'll keep an update when I can I'm sorry I'm not stronger I'm sorry I'm weak... I'm sorry for my existence.Things still suck in my life mostly. Probably in most of our lives.But it's ok to be suck-ish for a bit.If you keep going I swear things start to look up. A kind person from this community told me to stand alone in solitude to find strength. So I encourage others and am encouraging everyone to do the same.Things are getting better and I'm actually doing it. To the friend who gave me advice on this subreddit, thank you so very much! No voices, no hell, high water, illusions, or delusions can support l stop you from obtaining your own personal destiny ‚ù§Ô∏è much love y'all.To the lonely,To the lost,To the forelne,For the one without,Solitude is strength,You're doing just fine,The road is bleak,But you will make it out,To the broken,Your pieces are within,To the one with nothing,Your gift is in your being,So,To the lonely,You are not alone,We are all lonely,Searching for a place to call 'home'. My insurance isn't paying for my therapy and I can't pay out of pocket so a relative says they would pay. But refuses to let me go to the therapist I previously had.I cried and begged saying it MY therapy but they said they "don't like that therapist" and "they never helped you" It is hard because I barely have money and little to no money for it. I need my relatives help. I haven't found another therapist and I'm stressed. ü•Ä. There was a time, for a moment, I believed others would believe in me just because they knew I could. Dealing with mental health no one can say more hurtful things to me than myself or from the ones I love.I am happy to say in progressing with my health, my emotions, and mental mindset I have learned it's not just enough to believe you can. You must show yourself you can. I show my voices they are wrong. I try my best. Beating inner demons is hard but if you put in work with your beliefs in yourself, your life. Your faith isn't dead. Neither are you... üåπ. I apologize I'm sorry ... I'm bad at communicating with others but to the ones I have talked to. Thank you for our conversations. I'm sorry, ig I'm used to being alone. I'll try harder to be more active with others. Thank you all whoever's reading this far. Tysm.After allot of trauma. Self isolation and mediation with some medication. I developed some parts of myself, I don't care what others think. I have figured out for myself my criticism is priority. Not everyone will listen even when you explain. Not everyone is rooting for me, you , or anybody. Not everyone is on your side.And I'm always anxious about the odds that l someone will randomly lash out at my lack of response. That someone might take it as weakness. I don't like entitled culture. I don't like entitled people. Leave me alone in peace when I'm in public if you have a anger problem. I can't stress this enough, everyone had issues and anxieties.People don't know everyone's past. Getting to know someone is a privilege, whoever it may be. You don't get privileges. I'm so tired.Usually I'm the one when in the relationship. Trying and fighting with him. Like "do you want me" and such.But today he asked me the question we ask him.He sounded genuinely worried.Why would he worry about losing me? I don't understand but it makes me feel like... Warm in my heart.Part of me feels I'm unworthy of affection. But it feels nice he cares. He actually wanted me to stay... Even for a moment... Even if this doesn't last.It's been awhile since I met someone like this... He tries when I'm scared to. That's cool.I don't know how to say it but I think I'm gonna go offline for awhile. Texting friends too. Idk. I'm not happy to be around and I feel I'm losing my mind. My meds are only doing so much. I pray I get better and I find a way out.{poem}The pills don't work,My life seems frivolous,Everyone is so oblivious,To the fact I'm delirious,Being dazed half the time, I'm losing my mind, track of time, Time lapses, my memories are blind,I feel like I'm witnessing something devine, until I fall from the clouds, back to realities vice,I need help , but I cast it aside,Saying "I'm perfectly fine" when I am dying inside,I hate that I lie, but to make it, you gotta try,So I hit the ground running, just to see if I could win, to see if I could fly.I tried to OD .. I'm sorry , after the 988 call disconnected, I only remember the emergency responders, and sleeping allot.I had to beg them to discharge me, for some reason they did. I have medication atm tho, and they offered to expedite my insurance. But I'm home and still dizzy, I'm sore and tired.I'm sorry for my attempt.... I'm sorry, ig they didn't want me to die either... Idk how I feel but I am grateful.I am sorry. I tried to win against my voices but they've been right all along... They must be.Everyone wants me gone, I'm invisible in reality, not one soul can deal with me. I'm a nuisance, a stain, a detestable being. Wanting to be human.I am called many things, a monster, a demon, Satan; evil. I am evil , my family says so, friends are gone, I love God but I abandoned him and I think I am a lost cause.I'm sorry I'm sorry, I plan to take pills and hide in the woods. No one will find us. We were never meant to be born. I just wish there was people and someone to hug me... But there is no one. I am alone. So I will go die alone.I am an unwanted OutKast. The police cannot find me. When everyone goes out tonight, when night falls. I promise to ease everyone of the burden of me. I am worthless to my family, and any man who has loved me. A undeserving horrible creature. I deserve death... I'm sorry for this post. I'm sorry I ever post here , or talked to anyone I've ever met online or irl. I'm sorry I'm sorry.But I promise I'll fix this, if I'm gone... I deserved it all along.I feel like I should but I've been having strange dreams and so much drama I just want cuddles and kisses, but kisses and Band-Aids can't fix bullet wounds üíï. My life is stressful rn so I been missing meds, but my PTSD isn't bad at night nor is my voices as bad during the day anymore.I feel more capable, even if I miss a week or two of meds, I'm not saying, I don't need it. Cause I've learn to do the opposite of what my voices tell me. If I get stressed I might accidentally miss my meds or not care. But if they tell me negatively "don't take meds it's poison" I take them cause after 20 years I know my voices are liars.Anyway I've been dreaming a shit ton, if any of you loves want to know the dreams they're on my page.No nightmares tho.My dreams are just so eye opening, I am having a hard time believing them myself, it feels dreadful. But exciting and empowering... In a way. üíï. Hi, I hope I can come here to meet to friends or gain support... I'm just tired of being in my head. The noise the chaos. It's quiet at my place but the silence is so loud. I've played solo 15x, watch 2 movies, baked, cleaned, cooked and it's only 3pm...I am just tired... Not like physically mentally. I disassociate and isolate allot so I barely hang out with other and my bf had friends.I don't wanna kill his fun so I let him be, in fact, I got so depressed I logged out of all my other social medias. I just feel like a bother, with no way of being useful. I know it's just my voices but this sucks ass!. (This is a individual question, no judgement, everyone has their own opinions.).
    I‚Äôm getting this prescribed soon I‚Äôm currently on Risperidone. I‚Äôm hoping for less side effects.What experience have you had with it?. Topic.What other side effects do you have?. I‚Äôm switching medications next week, and im curious what side effects you‚Äôve had on it.Thanks. It‚Äôs been 2 years, I forgot what drinking was like.I didn‚Äôt get into any trouble when I was drinking before, I just had trouble quitting.I feel like the only reason I got sober was for my brother. He chairs AA meetings and coaxed me into joining and being sober‚Ä¶ which I feel like I can enjoy a beer or a wine.I never really related to the people at AA I feel like I was never really as bad as they were‚Ä¶ and I know I could control my alcohol to where i wouldn‚Äôt end up where they are.There‚Äôs still alcohol I want to try, and more I want to discover‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm still going every week, I feel like I don‚Äôt need them anymore‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sick of them.I don‚Äôt need to keep going until I die right?The reason I ask is because my brother chairs the meetings and he persuades me to go, when I really don‚Äôt want to anymore.I feel like you should go consistently for a year, but after a year you don‚Äôt have to go anymore or only go when you need a meeting.It‚Äôs been about 8 months since I started feeling this way, and still I can‚Äôt shake off the feeling that I‚Äôm being watched.Everything I do including going to the bathroom.I‚Äôve been dealing with schizophrenia and my medication side effects, I feel like in some way I deserve a drink of alcohol to get a break.Part of me thinks it will help with the side effects from the medication.I want something to look forward to, and I feel like this could be the thing that I get excited about as well.Topic.I used to love having social interactions with people, but now I hate it. Sometimes it feels almost impossible because I can‚Äôt see where the conversation is going (if that makes sense). Would alcohol help with that to help me get to be more social and able to talk to people?Could a little bit of alcohol give me emotions back as well? I don‚Äôt feel overly excited or joyful anymore, could alcohol give me something to be excited for and help with that?. I buy food on Saturday for 7 days and I end up eating %70 of it before Monday.Then, by Tuesday I barely have enough food to last the next 2 days that I‚Äôm scrounging and setting food to the side for each day even though I‚Äôll probably eat it in one day. Some weeks I end up going to the grocery store 3 times in one week!. I have a bad habit of reaching for the gum and chewing it, now that I quit I have nothing to grab anymore‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs kind of frustrating because I miss having something to grab.The only reason I‚Äôm going is because my therapist says it‚Äôs a good idea to be social with my schizophrenia. I hope i can post this here‚Ä¶These are why I think I should quit. I‚Äôve been sober for 2 years, I go once a week.Or do you think maybe this is just my medicine talking and I‚Äôm just being lazy because of the medicine????1. It takes 30 minutes to drive there and back to my place.2. It‚Äôs the same stories I hear every week I‚Äôm not getting anything out of it anymore.3. My brother Leads the meetings so I don‚Äôt feel like I can be honest and as open as I want to be.4. When my brother and I go out to eat every week, and I‚Äôm sick of doing that because some nights I get back late and I have to work in the morning.5. Since my brother leads the discussion he has to close the meetings and sometimes that can take time where I‚Äôm just standing around awkwardly waiting for him to finish talking to his friends.6. It feels like I‚Äôm just going for my brother so he can have someone to go out to eat with and I‚Äôm not doing it for myself anymore.7. There‚Äôs online meetings I would prefer to go to because I don‚Äôt have to leave my apartment.8. It feels like I am just stuck in a loop of going to AA and not doing anything else. I feel like I would go to online meetings and have more time to myself.9. I feel like I‚Äôm ruining other peoples experience with AA because I don‚Äôt really want to be there.If I keep telling my psychiatrist that I‚Äôm not feeling joy or excitement and keep pushing it, is there anything they can really do about it?I‚Äôm on 6MG of Risperidone. It‚Äôs impossible!. It feels like someone putting a lighter up to my thighs every morning.I‚Äôm thinking about staying at a hotel for a night to see if it‚Äôs my bed or blankets causing it‚Ä¶ could it be something with my medicine?I take risperidone 6mg. I remember last winter when I first got schizophrenia, the voices would yell and scream and even hum to fill in the silence.If they come back this winter, how do I keep my composure especially when I need to talk to someone. I remember it got so bad I had to get up and walk around just to calm down.I started taking Risperidone back in Feb. 2023 and my psychiatrist upped my Risperidone to 6mg back in June and I was having sleeping issues, so he prescribed 2MG Ropinirole for restless legs.This has helped with the voices A LOT, they finally started going away.However I‚Äôm still having sleep issues where some nights my body forces me to take a shower to calm my legs down, and I wake up at 3am some nights.3 days ago I woke up and felt really really good, I haven‚Äôt felt this good since I started Risperidone. I started realizing that I have trouble feeling pleasure in things like I did before.I have trouble feeling comfortable as well.I can feel content, but the feeling is just content and nothing over the top like I felt before.I used to be able to lay on my couch and feel excitement and joy because I‚Äôm comfortable, or when I go running I would feel good and now I‚Äôm not feeling that joy anymore.Is this worth changing my entire medication for?? I‚Äôm sure if we change medicine it will bring a whole new list of problems. Is it worth dealing with new problems to resolve my sleep and pleasure feelings????Or do you think since I felt that little pleasure when I woke up 3 days ago that it just takes more time before I‚Äôll start to feel pleasure again?. Topic. Has anyone asked their doctor or psychiatrist about this? Is there medicine just to bring up my libido a little bit?. When I started hearing voices they told me they wouldn‚Äôt stop torturing me until I moved out. I packed everything up in bags and was ready to move to get the voices to stop. Now, since I realized it‚Äôs schizophrenia I have to unpack all of my stuff and put it away.I plan on binge watching every episode once September hits I‚Äôm excited.I want to start putting myself out there again for a relationship. Is it even possible with schizophrenia? Or is it best to stay single?Thanks. When I was hearing voices really bad I thought it was my apartment neighbors messing with me.One night I was sleeping and woke up at like 3am, I felt heat on my legs and I thought it was my apartment neighbors waking me up with a weird electronic device. After I woke up I heard them laughing.I was tired and sick of the torture so I took a baseball bat that I have under my head and knocked it against the wall, yelled ‚ÄúHEY FAT ASS! HEY FAT ASS!‚Äù And I stared at my baseball bat.Because I thought they could see what I see through my eyes.I feel bad now because it was just voices in my head and tactile hallucinations.I have been hearing voices for 10 months every single day, I recently had my medication upped and now I‚Äôm rarely hearing voices.How do I get used to life without the voices?I‚Äôm anticipating that one day the voices are just going to come back full force.My neighbors are the voices in my head. It feels like they have authority over me.How can I get over this and to know that no one has any authority of my mind and thoughts?Thanks. A lot happened when I was having schizophrenia really bad. How do I get over that trauma?. Topic. I just want to watch TV without being watched. Do I just keep progressing that the voices aren‚Äôt real and eventually I‚Äôll feel alone again?Advice?. With Pix I think you had to take a picture of the bar code‚Ä¶ how do you go online with the uni?Or is there a camera with the uni?. Topic.Medicine has helped a lot with the voices but I want to know if anyone else has this delusion.It‚Äôs very quiet and lonely in my apartment.I have been hearing voices since Sept. 2022, right now after my doctor upped my dosage the voices have been a lot quieter and I don‚Äôt hear them as much. How do I know it‚Äôs not just my apartment neighbors giving me a bit of mercy before they go full blast again?I‚Äôm a little shaky because it was only recently the voices started to quiet down.There‚Äôs just a part of me that thinks maybe the voices in my head are real and the neighbors right now are just taking a break before going full blast again.My symptoms started in the winter, and I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll come back once fall and winter come.I keep thinking my apartment neighbors are using weird electronic devices to telepathically communicate with me.I can‚Äôt stop wondering if it‚Äôs real or not.I‚Äôve been on meds since December 2022 and I still can‚Äôt stop thinking that maybe somehow it‚Äôs possible. Maybe they‚Äôre just using super classified electronic devices that normal people don‚Äôt know about and somehow they got their hands on it.It‚Äôs hard because I think the doctor upping my medication lowered the voices but I still hear them.The voices are starting to go away, but I‚Äôm still a little bit worried that the voices could be real people putting their voices in my head and right now they‚Äôre just showing mercy. At any moment they could just decide to start yelling and screaming at me.I want to freely think and go out and do what I want but I can‚Äôt because it constantly feels like I‚Äôm being judged and watched.I think it‚Äôs going to take a long time before I can accept that no one can see what I‚Äôm doing and no one is watching or judging me all the time.It‚Äôs nice to hear similar stories to know I‚Äôm not alone. I have the delusion that my apartment neighbors have bugs around their apartment so that they can see my thoughts and speak to me telepathically.Anyone else with a similar delusion?Risperidone has made them happen less and has lowered the voices. However as I‚Äôm sitting I hear a buzzing sound that I think my neighbors are using to spy on me and I can hear them whispering about me.It‚Äôs nice to hear similar stories to know I‚Äôm not alone.

I had restless legs at night, my doctor prescribed a medication for that and it didn‚Äôt help‚Ä¶Last night, I went to bed at 11pm and couldn‚Äôt sleep because I was tossing and turning. The restless legs have transitioned to my shoulders, and I couldn‚Äôt lay still.At 3:30am I thought I tried everything, but I remembered that when I went to the bathroom earlier that day, my poop was hard and even made me bleed. I took stool softener, my shoulders stopped being restless and I fell asleep within 10 minutes.When the voices are very angry they‚Äôll try to talk non stop and to fill some of that dead air they‚Äôll laugh like SpongeBob, it happens a lot in the shower.In the shower the voices will turn into gargling voices. Does that happen to anyone else?. I get ringing in my ears and at night it‚Äôs like the ringing is moving around my head.I‚Äôll hear it my left ear, and then it will move around my face‚Ä¶ sometimes the ringing will move around in a circle around my ear and face for a few minutes and then stop.Does this happen to anyone else?Sometimes it sounds like the voices are coming off of the ringing.I think my neighbors are spying on me and have electronic devices that can put out heat like a laser pointer.Last night I was sleeping and had a dream a dog was biting my balls. I woke up at like 1am and felt heat on my balls and when I moved the heat went from my balls to my hand where my balls were at previously.. and then left very quickly.It feels like the neighbors are doing it to see what my dreams are if I‚Äôm aroused Anyone else have this delusion?. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass because I just want to relax but I can‚Äôt. I think i‚Äôm just tired and am going to sleep early tonight.After my doctor upped my medication the voices are starting to sound more quiet.Every night for months when I put my head on my pillow to fall asleep the voices would cuss and yell at me‚Ä¶ last night they were still cussing but the words were all mixed up and didn‚Äôt form any complete sentences.Does this mean that the voices could potentially go completely away?. He‚Äôs already prescribed me a restless leg pill but it didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm still having issues falling asleep at night.Last night I was laying in bed to fall asleep, and the voices were talking/yelling at me. In my head I was thinking of a group of bears coming out of a cave and I wasn‚Äôt thinking of any words. the voices repeated back ‚Äú(my name) Why are you thinking about bears in a cave?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are the bears walking out of the cave?‚ÄùNo way a real person can see pictures in my thoughts, so that is why I‚Äôm confident that the voices are just in my head, it‚Äôs just gonna take my brain a while to accept it.I was working at home in my apartment and all day the voices were trying to get my attention. I try my best to ignore them, but it‚Äôs hard.My air conditioning turns on (90 degree weather) and they start yelling and screaming ‚ÄúTURN IT DOWN! TURN IT DOWN NOW!‚ÄùI was having a good day at work until the voices took over and shifted my focus onto them. I hope that this isn‚Äôt forever. It‚Äôs been almost a year with the voices trying to get my attention every.single.day.I took a walk after work and it wasn‚Äôt even enjoyable. All I thought the entire time was ‚Äúeventually I‚Äôm gonna have to go back to my apartment and deal with the voices again‚Äù. I just want to enjoy the summer. My apartment neighbors that live a floor below me are (according to the voices) able to see everything that I‚Äôm doing.How is this even possible? The voices sound very real and convincing.Yesterday I barely heard any voices, I felt really good thinking maybe the voices are going away‚Ä¶Right before bed I heard the voices keep repeating ‚Äú(my name) you work your ass off, so we aren‚Äôt going to mess with you today‚ÄùHow should I take this? Should I be worried the voices will eventually start getting more aggressive?.
    Recently my nmom told me it‚Äôs a miracle she didn‚Äôt murder me before I moved out at 18. I have 8 diagnosed mental disorders and she uses that as an excuse for that statement and all of the abuse. That I was too difficult to handle. She then added that I‚Äôm the sickest person in our family‚Ä¶. I once took 5 pills of OxyContin with 6 pills of Xanax and was on the phone with my friend who claimed I was 100% unresponsive within only 10 seconds of putting my head down. Not just sleeping. But entirely unresponsive. She called my father who came in and found me face down making choking/gargling noises and doing nothing but choking and sobbing. Those were 1mg xans and I‚Äôm unsure of the dosage of the oxy but it must‚Äôve been high because the oxy pills came from a former cancer patient. They narcaned me but what if they didn‚Äôt? What if my dad didn‚Äôt continuously shake me to keep me ‚Äúawake‚Äù until EMT got there? Would I have died?. We were doing river rapids in a very rocky area in East Tennessee, i fell out of the raft and dodged two enormous rocks not knowing how many could be underneath me or hit me under water. I was flailing through the river rapids for a good minute or two until they caught up to me and the tour guide couldn‚Äôt lift me out but my mother lifted me right out like it was nothin. How dangerous was that? Was I in any actual danger?. My old Muslim friend once invited me to her home for Eid and her grandmother gave me an afghan dish that I loved but can‚Äôt seem to find what it was called anywhere. It was like a flat circle very slightly spicy made of squash and had sesame seeds on it and had like some type of leaf in it. Does anyone know what I‚Äôm talking about?. I have these reoccurring dreams of a hurricane(I live on the gulf side of Florida ) and there‚Äôs violent rushing water everywhere and it‚Äôs so windy I can‚Äôt get onto my feet and there‚Äôs ocean waves on the street from storm surge and all I can see is my hands and arms all muddy trying to get up and the Schizo part of it is when I woke up I was told by one of them that the dream is a precaution of hurricane Ophelia and they keep stressing to me that it won‚Äôt look bad until it‚Äôs too late and that I NEED to leave the state when it hits.I get stuck in like a purgatory every single fucking night in my dreams I can‚Äôt escape and even when I do I end up right back where I started and there‚Äôs no way out. Does anyone else have this is it from the disorder or the meds? Also they usually are pretty lucid but still can‚Äôt escape. I was diagnosed with this when I was 9 and now I‚Äôve got a few more diagnosed but I‚Äôve never met ANYONE in my entire life who has IED other than myself. Nobody‚Äôs ever heard of it and I still don‚Äôt even really understand it. The meds they give me about schizoaffective disorder seemed to do the trick for my IED issues but it‚Äôs still an entire mystery to me all of it. I don‚Äôt even have the energy anymore, I can‚Äôt even kill myself about it because I‚Äôd still exist and that‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt want. I‚Äôd just exist in eternal misery so that‚Äôs not even a way out. Don‚Äôt judge, the kitten was taken too soon from his mom so now I need to find an INTACT female cat so that she can be a mother cat. My emotions/ moods have been becoming dangerous so I saw my psychiatrist about it and told him the things I didn‚Äôt want to tell him but had to and he increased the hell out of my lamotrigene like I figured he would but then he also spiked up the seroquel and I asked why and he said ‚Äúthat is not going to be enough for you here‚Äù and I know it shouldn‚Äôt hurt my feelings but it made me feel so embarrassed and pathetic.
    I‚Äôve been cold calling for a while, super stressful because I live off commission. I get rejected a lot and it sucks. However, when I feel totally defeated, voices in my head start cheering me on and they are like: One more call! One more call! And they‚Äôre like you can do it! Then I do push on with the calls and I hear a crowd cheering and applauding. Honestly it‚Äôs my secret super power lol.So I used to go to church every Sunday until I decided it wasn‚Äôt for me, because my beliefs have changed. But I met with a couple of my clients there, and I‚Äôm worried that they‚Äôll ask why I stopped going. I don‚Äôt want to lie because I much rather be honest. Also as a side note I want to meet a wife that has good values. And they are potentially at church. So should I just go back to church even if it‚Äôs not for me, so I can continue networking and have wholesome friendships?Or should I be honest and just tell my clients, and family that it‚Äôs just not for me?. When I went into the hospital after my psychosis incident I ate a ton of food, because it‚Äôs all I looked forward too. I gained crazy weight now I can‚Äôt lose it easily. Just venting a bit. üòì. I like Rudolph Steiner, Bob Sanders, and Billy Carson. Who has the best up to date knowledge in your opinion?. You guys get voices that tell you to kill yourself, or put you down generally? I hear that shit every day.It‚Äôs gotten to the point that‚Äôs it less terrifying and more boring or more nonchalant about it. I just say go away, or shut up. Feels like I‚Äôm just shooing flys away.I‚Äôve had a few psychotic breaks over the past few years. I have mostly positive symptoms, but I see the scary stuff too.Part of me thinks I can see into the astral, ethereal, or spirit realm. So i practice meditation to protect myself from the negative entities. It seems to help a lot to call on my spirit guides for protection, and I take my meds so I‚Äôm double protected. I just wanted to share this with someone that‚Äôs not my psychologist.What are your opinions on this group? It‚Äôs also known as the ascended masters.Can I take all 7 plague marines in a game of combat patrol?. Shits been a rough ride, going in and out of hospitals, piles of medication, and useless talk therapy. Been doing alot of research and meditation, but should I seek a professional?. In my opinion I believe there are a lot of paid actors on here, and useful idiots. If you look at all the actual progress in the individual companies, I mean they are about to change everything! Do your own research! Don‚Äôt take anything posted on here at face value.Can anyone recommend a spiritual service to help me navigate through the symptoms?. I got to move my ferrets to the basement because the room they‚Äôre in is destroyed with ferret poop! Any recommendations for a ferret fence that they can‚Äôt clime over? I‚Äôm going to put them somewhere with out wood floors.I see the number 66 or 666I know western religions call it the sign of the beast. But I don‚Äôt really perceive it as ultimately true.The way i became awaken short version.I heard about and had had an out of body experience about 10 years ago.I DMT for the first time back then, and that‚Äôs when I first encountered an entity that I was seeing on the DMT. It showed me amazing things and wanted to make a deal with me. I see his world and he sees mine. Unfortunately the spirit was a self serving or negative entity, or what I perceived as one.For the rest of time from then to now, my soul was tortured and I was hospitalized on multiple occasions. But it was so scary it woke me up to another aspect of myself, and the universe I‚Äôm in. So thus I am greatful for that entity, and maybe my greatest spiritual guide I‚Äôll ever have. God bless the Darkness for helping us see that we are the light!. The Law of One is a spiritual concept that asserts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things in the universe. It is based on the idea that everything in the universe, whether it be living beings, inert matter, or energy, is connected to each other in some way.The Law of One is often associated with the concept of Universal Consciousness, which suggests that all beings are part of a greater, unified consciousness. This belief asserts that everything in the universe is constantly evolving and that there is no separation between the self and the rest of the universe.Overall, the Law of One emphasizes the importance of compassion and understanding towards all beings, as we are all interconnected and part of the same universal consciousness.So I‚Äôve been experiencing spirtual awakening and I thought I was going crazy but now I know I‚Äôm not.Over the past couple years I‚Äôve been going to the hospital after going through psychosis. I was then I was told I was schizophrenic.So now the people close to me think I‚Äôm schizophrenic. I live with my mom now and she make sure if I take my pills. I don‚Äôt know how to break it out to her that I think I‚Äôm actually having a spiritual awakening. What can I do to convince her I‚Äôm not crazy?. During my experience with DMT and during meditation I see the most awful things.I see a man in a hat that tortures beings in front of me. I see dismembered body‚Äôs and blood with skulls. It‚Äôs absolutely terrifying and have no idea what to do. I‚Äôm often attacked by this visions.Anyone know what‚Äôs going on with me?Edit: I‚Äôve stopped using DMT and meditation in general. But the visions haven‚Äôt stopped.I have an experience where I can project in my head while a wake/ eyes open.I‚Äôve met a few entities and have the ability to change the environment and the other entities can change the environment.But I can do this at anytime at will. It seems like an over active imagination, however I have had entities mess with me so bad, I had to go to the hospital multiple times. I used to practice AP years ago, but i stopped and now I‚Äôm having these issues (which is sometimes pleasant) Is this AP or something else?It feels like a day dream, not like I‚Äôm really there. Like two places at once.I‚Äôm experiencing a strange phenomenon where I can project mentally.It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in the physical world but my consciousness goes into a different world. I don‚Äôt consider myself a master of any type of spiritual practice.But I think it might‚Äôve been a sign that the earth is shifting into the new age.Also since I‚Äôve had these experiences my physical filter has gone, so the Spirtual world sometimes spills into the physical.100 cold calls a day + ? = profit. I believe I had a spiritual awakening when I had a weird feeling of being out of body and had a psychotic break.My mom took to me to the hospital and was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I felt like I was downloading info and had visions of angles and demons. I felt manic and may have been attacked by an entity but I had gotten a lot out of the experience.Now I don‚Äôt feel anything anymore nor do I get ‚Äúvisitors‚Äù telling me what to do.I feel like I lost my powers or ability to see in the spirit realm.Or am I just being left alone?. Hey guys I used to practice astral travel and some really weird has suddenly come over me. I seem to be able to mentally project with my eyes open, and when I‚Äôm working, driving, or day dreaming. I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out what is happening is actually happening or if it‚Äôs just my imagination going wild. For example I‚Äôve seen several dead loved ones, seen strange creatures, and even Angels. It‚Äôs seem just like a very vivid day dream.Anyone experienced this? Let me know what you guys think.At this point I‚Äôm just interested in what for sure is not real. Because everything is coming out lol.I just found out Chem trails are real for context.I think there‚Äôs something trying to communicate with me some how.I‚Äôm not spiritually incline as much as I want to be so idk. Seems to come out of no where.I believe it‚Äôs telling me he‚Äôs Gabriel. Im I just going crazy? Is it a demon? Is it my guide? I feel okay I just have been keeping it to myself for the most part.What do you guys think?. I was just wondering if there is any 101 on metaphysics like a YouTube guy or a book that‚Äôs up to date?I use to meditate but I just don‚Äôt have the patience to figure it out myself. Just want some practical knowledge. Does rent have to come down before we see inflation come down?. My oculus has been collecting dust for a while now? What‚Äôs a good game/experience that‚Äôs come out recently?. Up 37% in the last 3 months.I got into sales about 6 years ago, and I work at my dad‚Äôs financial advisory office. It‚Äôs in a small town and my dads a good broker, but it‚Äôs very unknown.I‚Äôve been doing opening calls and been learning along the way about the industry. I just have had very little success, For the first five years we had no system and was very phone shy. that didn‚Äôt go very well so I‚Äôve made a very shitty follow up system to make sure we continue to follow up and write a script and make at least 100 calls a day now. I‚Äôve finally am getting more interest but my leads won‚Äôt close for now. My dad is the closer, and I try to close to but I‚Äôm still not great. I won‚Äôt give up because there‚Äôs probably nothing waiting for me after because I have no college degree. So I‚Äôll keep calling till I‚Äôm rich or dead.Anyone try warhammer stats in One Page Rules? Example: when activating a unit use move stats and same with attacks from warhammer, but alternating and other aspects of OPR? I feel like it would add a bit more flavor and keeps units from dying. Anyone try this?Ok dudes if any of you tried doing this? Ok I‚Äôm not a Genius or know much about game mechanics in general. You don‚Äôt have to nerd rage at me.
    So I have Schizophrenia, and my mom said that apparently there‚Äôs a conspiracy going around that when the FEMA emergency alert test goes off- whoever got the COVID vaccine is gonna die.I‚Äôm on meds for my Schizo, but part of me is like ‚Äúwait, what if?‚Äù. So now I‚Äôm currently paranoid that I‚Äôm gonna die today lol..How do y‚Äôall deal with conspiracy theorist bull shit?. 23F, Vape, just had gallbladder removed.The picture is on my profile, pls go look.Ps: the yellow isn‚Äôt pee, I didn‚Äôt pee. Title. Literally every time I eat my stomach hurts so bad it feels like bad trapped gas or colicky. I‚Äôve lost like 8 lbs since last week bc I haven‚Äôt been really able to eat. Have any of y‚Äôall experienced this post-op?. I‚Äôm 23F, 5‚Äô5.I vape but don‚Äôt smoke cigarettes, rarely do drugs (Weed)Medications: Vyvanse, VraylarMedical history: Gallstones (Getting gallbladder removed this Tuesday), lymphadenopathy in neck, kidney stones, enlarged liverSo for the last week (it‚Äôs been longer than this but I just recently started tracking my temp) I‚Äôve been running mild fevers (99.7-99.9 F) for no actual reason. I‚Äôve checked with 3 thermometers and even got a new one just to make sure the thermometer isn‚Äôt bugging out, they weren‚Äôt. Went to my PCP, was also running a mild fever there as per the nurse. They aren‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs because of my gallstone or what. I have to get my gallbladder removed due to the stone. When my parents or whoever feel my head though, they say I feel normal. When I run these mild fevers I feel generally fine, I just feel hot (I don‚Äôt usually feel cold with fevers, just hot). I usually run the temperatures at night but as of recent, I‚Äôve been running them all throughout the day- I‚Äôd definitely say they‚Äôre intermittent throughout the day. Any help / ideas on what this could be would be greatly appreciated!. I‚Äôm 23F. My doctor isn‚Äôt sure what‚Äôs going on. She considered cancer but because I‚Äôm 23 it‚Äôs a bit odd to her I guess? I don‚Äôt know. She tested me for just leukemia but that was normal. She talked a bit about lymphoma but didn‚Äôt go into depth on it.Basically my liver is so enlarged you can feel it bulging out if you were to very lightly press into the bottom of my right ribcage, where the liver is. My lymph nodes are enlarged at 2.2 CM, so still within a normal range but they want me to go in for monthly ultrasounds. I feel like utter shit, and I‚Äôm on Tylenol 3 but it doesn‚Äôt really help with the pain- it just makes me a bit sleepy. My doctors nurse said I lost a lot of weight but I sum that up to not being able to eat much because I get very full very easily. I also get bloated and have awful heartburn, like I can feel the left over food in my stomach from a day ago. I‚Äôve been tested for gastroparesis, but that came out normal. I feel miserable and don‚Äôt know what else to do. I see a general surgeon today because they‚Äôre gonna do a liver biopsy and 2 other surgeries, but idk how I‚Äôm gonna manage for another week or two while waiting for the results.Any suggestions, docs?. I started getting really sick about 3 years ago. I‚Äôd run random fevers, lost over 50 lbs in less than a year and a half. It felt like I had a really sucky flu every week, sometimes it‚Äôd be long lasting for more than 7 days. I had no appetite, nothing. I was diagnosed with a malingering disorder and as a drug addict (mind you, I didn‚Äôt beg let alone even ask for drugs. They said I was one because I smoked weed.) because they couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with me. They also summed it up to me having Schizophrenia, they even called a psych team on me.Come this year, I‚Äôm getting back to back infections that they are able to find and diagnose. I‚Äôve had pretty wicked infections since February, I get them every month. I also have night sweats and same as 3 years ago feels like I catch the flu quite often.A few days ago I got my ultrasound results and they said they found a mass in my lymph node in my neck. I now have an appointment with a head and neck surgical oncologist on Monday.I feel a bit stressed, but not terribly. I‚Äôm just a bit upset with western medicine, you know? While yes, I know it‚Äôs not 100% that I have cancer.. I just find it very bizarre that I have the symptoms of it and a mass in my neck that accompany those symptoms. I hope it isn‚Äôt cancer, but it all just makes sense. Like there‚Äôs no way having lymph nodes that are the size of grapes is normal. I‚Äôm very appreciative for my current doctor though for believing me when I said I felt like something was up.So the title basically says it all. I put on my application that I was on SSI and that I needed part time due to that. I told her I can work whenever (within part time hours) so she took that as I can work full time. I told her I had to work part time due to my disability and SSI, and now I‚Äôm looking at possibly being fired. She claims I didn‚Äôt put it on my application, but I recall putting it on my application because I put it on EVERY application to a job that I‚Äôm applying to.What do I do?. Context: My calendar was blank for a few days and yesterday it showed availability for everyday after the 8th I think.I wonder if decisions are coming soon?. title. Hi guys! So what I'm trying to do exactly what I put in the title, but I keep getting no output, nil, or an error. I'm still relatively new to LUA, so I'm not sure what's going on here. I've tried everything I could think of: local players = game.Players.LocalPlayerlocal mouse = players:GetMouse() local RS = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")local clickEvent = RS:WaitForChild("ClickEvent")mouse.Button1Down:Connect(function()local mouseTarget = mouse.Target:FindFirstAncestorWhichIsA("Model")local playerTarget = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(mouseTarget)if mouseTarget == playerTarget thenprint(playerTarget)clickEvent:FireServer(playerTarget)endend).
    19f, unmedicated, dx‚Äôd since i was 17.lately i‚Äôve really been struggling to try and communicate with people in my life. housemates, friends, partner, etc.i feel like i lack any and all cognitive skills relating to social interaction. i‚Äôm getting more and more fed up with trying to talk to people in a way that works for all parties involved, it feels impossible at this point.fairly skilled with nonverbal communication, like writing and reading others body language, but when talking face to face i kinda fall apart. any tips?. i‚Äôve been playing pok√©mon for about a year now. tonight is my first tournament! any tips for what i should bring? i have multiple decks, playmats, etc, and i‚Äôm sort of curious as to what the etiquette would be for a free play night.Edit:I took second place! tied with my partner and one other person. very good vibes! thanks everyone who helped out!. i‚Äôm diagnosed schizophrenic and unmedicated. i tell my boyfriend sometimes about what i see. he says that it‚Äôs real and our dog is a demon. he said the dog is trying to hurt me. i don‚Äôt know who i am anymore. someone please help. i don‚Äôt know who to trust. hello all! i got my mirena iud removed in late may, and was sort of expecting my body and cycle to bounce back relatively fast. i waited a week and started taking Slynd. it‚Äôs been almost two months of finishing the packs and still not getting a period. pregnancy test in mid-june was negative. i‚Äôm getting a little freaked out with the lack of a normal cycle.hey dominos people! i want to preface by saying that i am not the driver, that‚Äôd be my partner. he got in an accident at work that resulted in both his car and the other car being a total loss. my partners own insurance disclaimed the claim, saying he should have had commercial insurance to cover things like this. my partner was also insured through dominos, and apparently they‚Äôre not covering it either. i‚Äôm wondering why, and how dominos did not make it clear to my partner that he had to get commercial insurance as well as his own that he already had. is there anything that can be done here? looking for the thoughts of other domino‚Äôs employees that might have some type of experience with this themselves, or any knowledge of what we should do from here. thank you!!.
    A small request, but I would like it that if I sort by last modified, the folders I last uploaded files to would appear on the top instead of just whenever the folder was last renamed or created.Could I get a virtual machine of MacOs Monetary running on Windows 10/11 and use Apple Remote Desktop on it to connect to another MacOS physical computer? (Yes, I realize this is dumb, just want to know if it's possible). I keep running into this issue where after an half hour or so, any webpage or application would stop connecting to the server and i have to reconnect the VPN, regardless of secure core on or off, or choosing a specific server, or such. And on the Proton VPN application, it would show a normal connection, even though nothing is connecting. I've had this issue on Windows, Linux, and Android and on different wifi, Ethernet, and mobile data services. Not sure how to fix this?.
