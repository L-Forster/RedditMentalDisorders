I used to think this disorder was a blessing. Not having to deal with emotions and only caring about myself seemed pretty sweet to me. Ha ha.I now realize how wrong I was after having yet another mental breakdown that no one will ever know about. My sense of self is nonexistent. I don’t know who I am. I am completely empty. My emotions are very limited. People love the act that I put up whenever I’m in public or dating, but it’s not real. I’m an amazing speaker and I use this power to my advantage whenever I need to or feel like impressing people for validation/ego boost. My ego is so huge, yet so fragile. My entire self worth and grandiosity are based on superficial things like money and status. It got to a point where small financial setbacks are sending me into mental hell and destroy my entire self image. If I’m not financially succesful, then who am I? I feel like I’m a nobody if I’m not succesful. I can just be honest now and say that I hate this. I’m not a sane person and will try to look for help for the first time as mentioned before by some other people on here. Thank you for that. I understand it now.It feels like most of the time I’m just trying to mask the emptiness by pleasure seeking or work. I can try to act like it’s not there, but in reality it’s always lingering in the back of my mind. I feel like when I get to my core and strip away all the artificial bullsh*t I created around myself, it’s just emptiness. It seems like there is no way to fill the void. I get very very close sometimes, but it’s always just ever so slightly out of reach. Do I have to live like this forever? It doesn’t make me all that sad, but it worries me to some degree. It’s the restlessness that comes with it. Anyone here that understands this?. After trying many times, I came to the conclusion that relationships are just not meant for me. I’m running into the same old issues that I’ve always been running into with other women and I’m already devalueing my new girlfriend after only a few months. It’s quite evident that I am the problem here. The unsuccessful relationship doesn’t seem to bother me that much. Hurting her feelings on multiple occasions doesn’t affect me either. What bothers me more is that I can’t just be normal and experience the things neurotypicals experience. The human condition, or whatever you’d like to call it. What it means to be content with someone and sticking together. It’s tiring to always look for more. It’s never enough and I just want peace. I need the validation from other women, which leads to me cheating yet again. I absolutely love the chase. I love new and exciting things. I don’t feel remorse for anything. When my girlfriend cries to me, I just feel blank. I can’t connect with my girlfriend because I don’t feel her emotions. All my responses to her intense emotions are robotic. She complains about me always being emotionally unavailable and disregarding her needs. She is right, but I honestly don’t care.I’m curious if anyone else here managed to make a relationship work. It doesn’t feel possible for me.I feel like I have no real personality. The way I act, speak and present myself completely depend on who I’m with and where I am. It seems like I fit the mold perfectly no matter where I go. Sometimes everything I do is so smooth that it’s off putting for other people. To the point where one of the girls I dated literally asked me if I was a real person. She told me the way I speak is like out of a movie. She even asked me if I was a psychopath because she noticed my emotionless gaze. I genuinely don’t think I am a psychopath. However, it surprised me that she knew something was off after spending some time together. It was the first time this happened. She even jokingly called me a narcissist at some point. Jokes on her. She fell in love with me nevertheless. I just wonder if this is common for pwnpd. Just for clarification, I am not bothered by this at all. Me being like this has benefitted me greatly in life. I’m just really curious as I’m trying to understand my weird brain.I realised that I don’t particularly like it, nor dislike it after sleeping with yet another woman that I just met. I find way more enjoyment in everything that comes before sex. I love how it gives me the feeling of power, control, being admired, lusted after, etc. The fact that I can easily get women to sleep with me gives me a kick. I’m very apathetic when it comes to the act itself. It’s just something that has to be done. After the act I just want to move on the next to repeat the cycle. It feels like I already completed the game at that point, so why bother anymore? The supply that it gives me is on another level. I do realise that it’s quite a shallow way of living. For me it’s more like chasing this ego boost drug feeling than forming an actual relationship with somebody. I think it’s also because I have trouble forming real deep relationships with people in general, especially romantic relationships. I just wondered if anyone else here experienced/experiences the same thing.I feel like I’m walking a tightrope at all times and I might lose my mind at any given moment. I’m not sad or depressed at all it’s just that sometimes I feel extremely disconnected from the real world. I look and act normal, but I severely lack real emotional depth. It’s just an act. I have trouble genuinely caring about other people and the things they tell me. Like when someone is telling me something that means a lot to them (e.g. moving into a new home, new job, marriage, etc.). I’d tell them how happy I am for them and that I’m excited, but in reality, I feel nothing. It’s just blank. Matter of fact, I try to make the conversation about me again. I hate it when the conversation is not about me. Honestly, I can’t stand most people and usually feel like smashing their face in. But I don’t. I just smile and they love it. People have no clue that I’m actually like this. I visited my mother yesterday and I tried to tell her how much of a piece of shit I am to most people, but she wouldn’t even believe me. I gave up on that. People really believe that I’m a good person, when in reality, I’d ruin their life for money if I got the chance. If only I got the opportunity to do so. My life revolves around money and status. My ego is so big that it sometimes ruins dates with women.I talk to as many different women as possible and tell them about my accomplishments for supply and sex. If I feel like they can’t give this to me, I just instantly cut them out of my life without notice or hesitation. A simple example of my mental state: Today my card declined, because I used the wrong one. I was literally sweating and shaking by the idea that the cashier might have thought to herself that I’m poor (which I’m not). I told her I have 4 cards that’s why I picked the wrong one. I seriously thought of not going to that particular store anymore. Everything I do and chace is superficial and shallow, but I love it. I think I’m destined to live this way.
    TLDR at bottom,Ok so I had COVID for about 5 days, I was super sick and don’t think I even washed my hair that whole time. When I finally did I had a HUGE knot on the back of my head that hurt. I went to urgent care, they diagnosed me with impetigo and gave me a z pack and 5 days of prednisone. But since I have now found out it was probably a cyst, I guess at some point it burst (because it went down and unrealized to me, turned into a decent sized scab)I went to er cuz I was out of medicine and thought something was still wrong. I told the doctor it was a knot, he looked at it but didn’t tell me it had turned into a scab. He gave me oral and ointment medication for staph and mrsa. My appointment with the dermatologist was just the other day, she said it was a cyst that burst. I have an open wound 1 1/2 cm in the back of my head now and obviously no hair there and the hair directly around it fell out also. TLDR; From what I have read it’s very rare to develop those type of cyst so fast. Could I have sprayed some keratin products on that area of my head then got COVID and layed in bed for so long it infected something and turned into the cyst?. I have someone in my life that I’m very sure is one of the two. I try and try to read what would make someone one or the other, but I’m still stumped. The person in question has no empathy whatsoever, enjoys hurting me, uses things in my past against me to hurt me. Never cares about my day, and doesn’t necessarily want to share his day either. Just wanted to add some info, but if someone could just tell me how to tell the difference in the two I would greatly appreciate it!!. So pretty much everything is in the title. His dash says the battery is charged good and he tried to hook up a jump start box and it did nothing. Please help he’s very stubborn and is being a d1ck at the moment lol. Ever since I downloaded to iOS 17 I’ve been having issues with find my. So I share locations with my kids and a few friends, and the find my friends app has not been working right. It will only continuously show live if I stay looking at the location app. On messages it seems to take forever to go to live. Can’t find a background app refresh settings for find my either. There’s also no refresh button on find my or message to make it refresh. You just have to wait for however long…Anyone else having this issue or know of a fix??. Ok we have been together for 12 years and have a 10 year old. I just turned 40 in the past couple of days. This is having a lot to do with it. Like I kept telling him weeks ago that if it didn’t get better soon (around my bday) that I don’t think I would be able to stay with him. I didn’t want to say I would leave for sure cuz I knew that wasn’t true. So he hardly ever talks to me anymore unless it’s right after he was extremely mean to me and saying something surface level being somewhat fake. He calls me every name in the book and sometimes gets really creative telling me “to go f3ck a goat” “google these nuts on ur chin” to telling me to unalive myself in various ways. He calls me a cun! Very regular. It’s gotten so bad this past month. He has went as far to say to go get a different bf, to go call someone else if I wanted to talk, that he doesn’t love me or care about what I think or feel but gets raging mad when I can’t trust him if that’s how he really feels. He will eventually say he only said it cuz he was mad but will not under in any circumstance will he ever actually apologize. To keep things fair I will say the things I do that make him mad… he gets the maddest about me saying I can’t trust him. We share locations but if I ever say anything about looking at his location he calls me a stalker. If I bring up something we fought about the night before he says I’m trying to start fights when I’m just trying to get closure. if I ever bring up anything that needs real communication he gets mad or stonewalls me. I’m trying to not make this post too long. I recently tried to talk to my mom about it and said how stupid I feel that I don’t really want to leave him. She already knows the horrible things he says to me. I mentioned a few things he recently said and her response was “and u still don’t want to leave him??” Like duh I just said how stupid I felt, it added insult to injury.TLDR; I just don’t wanna be freshly 40 and freshly broken up but it is killing my soul to stay with someone this emotionally mentally and verbally abusive.I ate 4 or 5 pieces idk how I don’t remember exactly, but alls I feel is edgy and nervous but I know there’s nothing to be nervous about. I just don’t like the feeling right now. Do other people feel like this on mid doses?? Should I just take more?The bar says: Microdose: 1-3 pieces stimulate the mindTherapeutic 4-9 pieces, mindful and elevatedGod mode: 10-15 pieces walls might meltI was wanting to go for ego death but I’m just getting a feeling if I eat more I’ll just feel more uncomfortable. Obviously I’m ok enough to right this, but just barely lol, I can barely handle being on my phone rn.Ok so my car was running pretty normal then I got the oil change and it was running really rough and then the drive light started flashing for like the end of a long drive for 5 minutes. When I turned my car off and back on it stopped. When I googled what that means it says the transmission is screwed, and that’s kinda what seemed like was messing up (it would barely go when I took off sometimes and wouldn’t shift as soon as it should) besides just running louder in general. Now that the light flashed and stopped it’s running completely normal. Only drove it for about 20 minutes since. Anyone have any clue if the mechanic could have messed something up???. So I’m prescribed suboxone and kpins and have to go for a random pill count and pee test 2mrw. I’m gonna be short 5 days worth. What do u think they will do??? I’m freaking out!!Edit and update: so I went and just seen a nurse practitioner. I explained to her what I did. She said I would just have to talk to my doctor on the 4th about it. She acted like since this was my first time having the wrong pill count I’ll probably be ok and to just not let it happen again. My doctor is pretty cool w me and knows I’ve been trying to get down to 4mg of suboxone for months. I was desperate to get down to 4mg b4 the winter and did what I could to get down to 4 mg. I’m going to continue to take only 4 mg of the suboxone and only take 2 of my kpins a day so I don’t go n to withdrawal and have a seizure (it’s happened b4 twice) but hey I’m closer to the end goal of getting off my suboxone and I’m going to take in all my extra suboxone so my doctor can see I’m not lying.So I just totaled my Honda Crv from hitting a freaking curb!! The airbags came out and that’s what totaled it. I had to swerve out of the way from someone who was about to hit me right in my drivers side door. So that’s how I ended up hitting that ******* curb. Of course the other person drove off. I called the cops and they didn’t even make a report. The only thing the cop said was that these types of accidents happen all the time at that intersection. It’s a very weird road that you can only drive on the middle lane from 6 to 9 in the morning for rush hour.Anyway… I don’t really know what kind of cars are generally more reliable than others. I had an Acura RDX that I absolutely loved, then I got the Honda. I really like SUVs but I’m open to getting a car also. I know with the Acura RDX I would have to worry about the turbo and my ex husband (who’s a mechanic) kept telling me I was stupid for getting the Acura because the radio system controlled everything (or something like that). So are there any makes/models anyone would suggest for reliability or any that i should stay away from?. So as the title says my boyfriend only wants to have sex once or twice a month and we have no affection or intimacy any other times, and hardly ever even talk anymore. I am pretty sure the relationship is about to end.What’s bothering me is he keeps telling me to go f myself. Obviously I have had to masturbate, so I’ve gotten bored of it so when he says that I get so angry. It makes me want to cheat. What would u do if you’re significant other who was the LL would say that to u on a regular basis?. I did a consult with her and specifically asked if/how she was going to tone it and she just had me pick out a color of blonde (which was a level 10 color blonde, I can’t remember the name of it) and she said she would just use that color to tone it and put all over so it’s even. She then told me to text w any questions, so later thinking about it, I asked her about the toning process and she basically said that the “Demi permanent colors she showed me in that book are toners.” I know toners can be Demi permanent and also colors, so I’m very confused why she is saying demi permanent colors are toners?? Because wouldn’t they be 2 different things?? Or can a color, platinum, cover the harsh yellow after bleaching??Also I’m at a level 10 blonde.. it’s been a journey to get here. I have natural very dark hair (red/orange undertones) I have only put toner on my hair to get the color I have, so I’m also a little hesitant about the whole idea of even using all over color (I definitely don’t want it to end up darker) or worse not even tone the hair. Someone please help me understand?!I’m just so confused lol??? Wouldn’t she have to use a toner to get rid of all that yellow?? I never think my hair was equivalent to the “banana peel” yellow everything says you have to get to have platinum. I honestly think that little extra little lift that the 20 volume developer does mixed with wella t14 is the only way to get my hair this light. I’m just super nervous because I have had multiple stylists mess up my hair. TLDR; So if I’ve explained this correctly I’m asking if she could just bleach my roots and then use a Demi permanent (almost platinum color) all over to tone the roots??? Or would a toner be needed???. Ok so I know odd question lol, but I keep noticing this at multiple gas stations I go to. I have to visit a lot of gas stations because I’m a gig driver. So at some gas stations (I’ll use one I have to frequent a lot for an example) I’ll walk in and see the girl attendant laughing it up/half way flirting with a guy customer, then I’ll get up to the line and boom her whole attitude changes. She won’t even say hi or anything to me and is very cold and unfriendly to say the least. I’m super friendly, especially to other girls, so I know it’s not me. There’s only about 3 gas stations this happens at. I don’t have problems with other women anywhere else. If anything I’m trying to make friends lol. Idk if this is even the right sub to post this in. If it’s not can someone please direct me to a better one. But if it is the right sub, have any guys noticed this?. So ever since I got a different car and it’s considered “large” I have almost always only gotten routes with 20-25 packages, and the route’s always have more miles because the stops are so spread out. I feel like I used to get more packages with my old car. I thought having a large vehicle would mean more packages. There has been multiple times I can just throw all the packages in my front seat cuz I’ll only have 10-15 stops. I normally put the first 10 or so up there anyway. I have a 2012 Honda Crv for reference. It does seem to get decent gas mileage. The back would be super helpful for alot of packages because it has a shelf so there’s a top area and bottom area. Does this happen to anyone else who has what Amazon considers a “large” vehicle? Or could it be because my car gets decent gas mileage? I just hate loading up and seeing all the extra room, plus of course I would rather have stops 2-4 minutes apart opposed from 7-13.So I bleached my hair and it didn’t turn out light enough and still has some brassy parts. I have tried to tone it and it doesn’t work because my hair is not light enough. So rebleaching is my only option to go lighter. My hair is a very warm level 7-8. I hate the warmth with a passion lol. I’m trying to get to platinum to do silver. So I’ve waited for my hair to be healthy enough to do another bleaching session, but now I have about 1/2- 1 inch of roots to bleach also. Everything says to do roots last, in this case would I do my roots first or just do it all at once?Also my hair is VERY thick, so normally when coloring I have to do one side of my head at a time or one side will be lighter/darker, or in this case maybe fry my hair off (I’ve watched to many bleach fail videos lol) so basically what I’m asking is how would I go about bleaching and having to wash it out section by section possibly or at least I’m going to have to do half and half. It takes me too long to apply it. I hope I’m making sense. Someone please help me!!! Planning to bleach in a few days after I haven’t just washed. Any and all help appreciated!!!!. I normally start getting them on Wednesday and I’m having issues with my app so just wondering if anyone else is getting them?Edit: support is telling me to download the app from the site to make sure I have the latest version, I have 2.114.12.21620 US.. the email won’t tell me if that’s the latest version or not can anyone tell me if I am or not?. While 65 north is closed at the south split it is so congested in the mornings. If u r going west, get off on Raymond and take it to west street and then go north to get on 70. Hope this helps someone, haven’t seen many Indianapolis peeps in here. Whenever my bf (38m) is mad at me (39f) and he’s at work he will block me. He’s done it so much I have no clue how many times it’s really been. We share locations and he knows it upsets me to not be able to call him or be able to see if he’s almost done at work (he does fedEx and doesn’t like to be on the phone so normally I can just look at his location when I wanna know if he’s almost done) Today he was already mad at me for the previous night because I said something about wanting to communicate more. That’s all I texted and he called me a cun! Told me to die and blocked me. I was in line at Starbucks w our 10 yr old. I can’t believe I was able to hold it together. I am crying a little now but I’m not going to let it ruin my day. I feel like this is a little win for me. I just want things to work out w him so bad, but I know he’s never gonna change. I’ve tried leaving b4 and I always beg him back. I’ve just been trying to get used to the idea of not being w him and being alone while he’s still here. I’ve basically been in a relationship since I was 17. I don’t have much of an income but if we break up I’ll have to figure it out. I just don’t do good w breakups 😭 I either just cry 24/7 or relapse. I wish I never met him. Ok so I sat down and we were waiting to get assigned a route. This is what was said that made me wonder if she was using a bot:Her: I didn’t even know I had a block until this morning cuz IT grabbed me one in the middle of the night?Me: what do u mean it grabbed u one?Her: I got a reserved offer in the middle of the nightMe: really? I’ve never got a reserved offer for the same day, and I thought u have to accept it almost immediately (because she said she didn’t know until this morning)Her: yea, I mean it woke me up in the middle of the night and I accepted it. I fell like I knew she was lying because she originally said “it grabbed it for me” and “i didn’t even know I had a block until this morning” totally contradicts her last statement and how else would u not know u have a block until this morning (I’m guessing when she got the 2 hr alert) I just changed the subject after that cuz I always wonder if someone is using a bot or scamming the system cuz so many people come in around 7am and get sent home. Including me for once today lol. But I’m really just curious if she was telling the truth… have u ever got a reserved offer in the middle of the night for the next day? I thought they came the week before.I’ve waited so late to do my taxes because I’ve been so confused and just procrastinated 😔. I have 3 separate jobs that I have tracked mileage for each one. Would I claim the mileage separately for each job? I’ve asked my mom what to do (because she did Uber) and she said it’s so confusing I need to go to an accountant. I really didn’t want to go to an accountant and feel like I have to explain everything. For you who have filed taxes were you able to do them yourself or do i really need to go somewhere? I know none of us our tax experts but a little other info is idk what to do about my daughter who is in college, but I think it walks you through it. Just wanted some advice from my fellow gig drivers 🙂. I recently started having to take blocks that don’t start until 7:30 or 7:45am, because I need to get my child on the bus. When I have arrived every day this past week, their is already 10-15 people already checked in and waiting for a route. I have talked to most of them and they also have a 3 hr block. Once they start rolling some carts out, I get a route before everyone else who has already been there. One guy that I have seen every day this past week said he’s been sent home 8 times without getting a block and getting paid still. That he will get sent home, and just go somewhere close and keep hitting refresh and get another one that would have been in his block time, go back to the station and get sent home again. I have never once been sent home with pay. I pretty much talk to whoever while I’m waiting and one day I was talking to the security guard chick and she seen it happen and I was like wth is goin on?? She said that maybe they are sitting there with airplane mode on so they don’t get a route. Is that even a thing that u can do?I’m just wondering why I never get sent home, and why would I get a block before others who checked in before me? Everyone I have talked to has at least been sent home with pay once, I’m so confused.Im just trying to find out if I can figure out what country my dads side came from. I don’t know any of my dads family and my dad has passed away. His skin town was darker, as is mine and one of my brothers. I found out I must be a carrier of the abnormal hemoglobin N. Baltimore because, when my son was born 21 years ago his newborn screen originally said he could have sickle cell, but it turned out it was just N. Baltimore. I then had a child with a different father 10 years ago and she has it also, so I know I am the one passing it down. This is where the skin tone comes into play. What research I have done says it comes from either, someone far back in my family tree being from the Mediterranean (is that even a thing?) or that someone way back in my family tree could be from Africa. My skin tone is not as dark as my dads and has an olive color to it. My 10 year old just asked me if I was “mixed” lol, because she said I look like one of her friends that is. I’m not at all trying to say I’m “mixed” if it does mean there was someone from Africa way back in my family tree. Can you be Mediterranean? Someone once told me that wasn’t a thing, that it was just an ocean. Now I’m just more curious to find out my family’s background. I honestly just want to know if I can assume I’m from the “Mediterranean” just from the N. Baltimore gene or if anyone has anymore knowledge about where that gene originated? My ancestry spit thing did come back with places around the Mediterranean, but also said 1% African if that helps or means anything. TLDR: can I find out my family’s background from knowing I have the N. Baltimore gene?. I had a 2007 Acura RDX, got into an accident and replaced it with a 2010 Honda cr-v. I’ve noticed it does have alot more room. It’s the only vehicle I have, but now I’m curious to know if offers will say large?. Ok so the other day when I called support it said there was a plus ten minute wait but then I was almost instantly connected to a lady who identified herself as an Amazon manager. The apartment needed a key fob and the office was closed (it was 5 am. But the notes also had an access code. I told her the only way in was with the key fob. She checked street view to see if I was right? Or telling the truth, because she was like there’s no way there can’t be a call box or something as she said she was checking. After the whole conversation about the apartment delivery, she then stressed how important making the phone call to support is if a package isint deliverable. Then I said I was having issues with my app, but then I was like I know I need to email support about that, and she said all these different departments she had worked in and how she could help me more. Then she kinda went on a rant about how pictures are supposed to be. It was the oddest call to support I have had.So I (39f) thought my bf (38m) was starting to be less abusive. I want it to work with him so bad and I dont even know why. Probably because we have been together 11 years and I’m terrified of change. Anyway he had stopped calling me names for the most part, but with less abuse came less attention. He never tried to care or talk to me. We haven’t even had sex in over 2 weeks. I just can’t bring myself to have sex w someone who will not just do the basic things in a relationship and care about my day and life and show me love and affection. Since there’s been so much silence between us lately I have continued to beg him to just kiss me bye for once or do anything to show he actually does love me. He says that’s me talking shi1 so he won’t talk to me. Then today when I called him I said how could u not respond to the text I sent. Nothing hateful, just begging him to love me or leave me. That’s when he said “you just lost ur privilege to talk to me the rest of the day” called me a cun1 and hung up on me. I don’t even know why I’m crying so bad he has said so much meaner things to me. I guess I’m just realizing he’s never gonna change and it hurts so bad.So like I said, me and my boyfriend will maybe have sex only once a month and that’s only if I get naked, put lingerie on and walk around with my pu$$y out. If you haven’t had sex in a long time, do you just get horny from sensations in your private area lol? I’m starting to think he’s just not attracted to me anymore. So first off I swear I did not put an AirTag n his bag, we share location’s so idk the point of me even doing that. Secondly he said it had my picture by the notification. Everything I have searched on google shows the notification without anyone picture (so I think he is lying about that part)So my question is could he have been delivering an air tag and it somehow connected to his phone or should I ask him to ask his boss if they put one n the truck? He has yet to apologize to me for accusing me and I want to prove him wrong so maybe he will apologizeEdit: I appreciate everyone’s advice and comments saying how it has happened to them before. He never got the alert again and admitted my picture wasn’t on the alert. Sorry for anybody who didn’t think this was where I should post it. So he knows there was no AirTag in his bag, and I got a good laugh out of it as I hope some of you did too.I just started in the beginning of December. I broke my ankle jumping for my bf (a 150 lb grill fell on my ankle) but this was before I was an actual employee, the last week of November. My bf told me they needed me immediately so my bf had me working with out my air boot on for an entire week before we made up some story that I didn’t know I had broke it until I listened to a voicemail from the doctor. They then let me work w my boot on until I went back to the doctor and he said I needed to take a cpl weeks off to let it heal better. That was fine with them, I just went back this past Wednesday wearing a shoe insert that I was supposed to wean into. On Friday I tripped going into some apartment and hit my head so hard on a handrail I’m almost positive I had a concussion. I was supposed to be getting trained to drive that day with the assistant manager, but he had an appointment later that day and said we had to do 40 an hour to get done in time, so he was just gonna have me jump, so needless to say I was rushing and running as much as possible. I ended up tripping going into some apartments (because of my ankle, I’m pretty sure) and hit my head on a handrail so hard I lost consciousness for just a second and was sure there was going to be blood. No blood just a huge knot. The assistant manager didn’t even tell the manager that happened. On Monday i still couldn’t walk without the air boot and texted the manager. I didn’t say I quit. I just said I thought it would be better if I didnt come back until my ankle was all the way healed or I’d have to wear the boot for a couple days. I texted him that to cover my ass, but he called me back immediately and just told me he couldn’t have me getting hurt constantly and basically fired me. Idk what to do, should I go back to the doctor so there’s record of all this?? My main concern is my bf works for the same contractor and i don’t want them to take anything out on him cuz that’s our main source of income. Any suggestions on what to do would be appreciated.So shortly after I started I broke my ankle, not technically a work injury. I’m in a air boot. But the person I’m riding w encourages me to take it off cuz she don’t want to run so I did and now it’s worse. I’m going back to ortho 2mrw. Also all day I am in the back of the truck lining up packages and such, which puts a lot of pressure on my ankle. While I have been in the back of the truck, he has jumped out 2 times with it STILL N DRIVE and was 2 inches from hitting a car one time. Has also almost hit about 2-3 cars w me n back. Then I literally almost got thrown out of the truck when he was turning. I don’t feel safe always in the back. I’m also upset that they said I would be being trained and I guess that’s not gonna happen till after peak. I don’t even think I can do this job I’m a 110 lb girl with no upper body strength to begin w lol and my hands are so little I can barely hold the scanner and I have a short arm span. I feel like every day would just b a struggle. Any advice on if they should be having me in back or why they would even want me to work until they could train me?UPDATE:I texted my manager and told him that I think being in the back while they drive is making my ankle worse because I have to stabilize myself with my ankle. He is fully aware that I’m back there while the driver is driving.Just took my test and the temp was all good but now I’m freaking out. If anyone has been to a nova center and used synthetics urine how did it go??. I broke my ankle a few weeks ago and was prescribed narcotics. I’d rather not report this and have to jump through the many hoops I would then be required too. Does anyone know if DOT examiners have access to your prescription records?Edit to add:there are other reasons I don’t want them to know my medication history, like antidepressants and antipsychotics. I broke my ankle and was prescribed narcotics. I’d rather not mention that on the DOT exam to avoid jumping through hoops. Has anyone went to get a DOT exam and the examiner knows what prescriptions you have been prescribed?. I have no idea if being level 3 or being at fantastic standing would have anything to do with this, but just in case that’s where I’m at.Whenever I take the preferred offers I am constantly getting sent to the same city/town about 45 mins away and I hate the area. They have weird roundabouts that I’ve almost wrecked at. Plus it just gets boring getting sent to the same place (same streets) like almost every block. The other thing is I always have a very high number of priority stops that are sometimes impossible to make. I also used to get done early with my routes now I’m lucky if I even get done a half hour early. Is it just bad luck or are any of these things contributing to why I am mainly getting sent to the exact same area every block??.
    Honestly, one of my favorite activities is just to go outside with my headphones, music blasting and to walk around while essentially dissociating into fantasy.Walk past people, sporting a subtle air of indifference and superiority through my physical demeanor.Just being in my own inner world where I’m important and have control while I simply just walk down the street, crossing someone’s path every few minutes.Immersed in my own world, the reality of my surroundings appears unimportant.I’m free to feel the euphoria of my fantasized reality freely, without anyone noticing.ADHD meds (Ritalin) appear to “cure” my narcissism and I hate it.So I’m a 22 year old male and about 3 months ago, I began seeing a psychiatrist. First it was mostly because my doctor advised me to make an appointment with a specialist after I explained to her that I thought that I suspected that I had ADHD since I was a kid and that it was causing me problems at work.Over a few sessions, my psychiatrist formally diagnosed me with ADHD.She prescribed me Ritalin and I was actually enthusiastic at the prospect of potentially « curing » my issue with attention and concentration.I had seen psychiatrists and psychologists in the past and it was suggested several times that I had NPD and throughout the years I’ve found it to be a likely explanation for my thoughts and behavior.« Strong characteristics associated with Cluster B disorders is seen » was said numerous times.At first it seemed like Ritalin indeed helped me focusing on individual tasks and follow through with plans, diminishing my procrastination and keeping me from getting lost in thoughts and daydream fantasies.I feel so different on Ritalin. I feel… normal. I feel like just a normal guy going about his tasks. I feel… rational, logical.No grandiosity, delusions of grandeur. No vivid fantasy life influencing my emotional states, no larger than life emotional reality.I just feel like a regular guy and it makes me anxious about my internal life being what’s it become and it scares me. It bursts me out my shell and it’s terrifying.For years I desperately wished to be normal and to be cleared of the darkness.This medication makes me feel like I’m nothing without it and I don’t know what to think anymore.I. First of all I understand that in the American justice system, a person can only be found insane if they didn’t know right from wrong when they were committing the crimes.People who murder for money, revenge or jealousy should be sent to prison but imo, people who strangle and fondle corpses out of a desperate desire for human closeness should not be sent to the same place.I do think that what Dahmer did was horrible, but I really believe that he, as well as probably most serial killers should be considered criminally insane.They are people who kill because of a compulsive need to satisfy a kind of inner darkness that we still today are basically unable to comprehend.It is not sane to fantasize about doing these horrible things to people and experience psychological gratification from thinking about it to the point where the individual feels that they have to act out in order to not let the darkness make them implode.It’s quite possibly the textbook definition of insanity.Sure they may be careful and calculated, but it’s not unlike a child doing something terrible out of a desire for excitement, knowing it’s wrong but unable to stop themselves.The psychology of Jeffrey Dahmer, which led to this dark path, is insane and abnormal and someone like that would be sent to a mental hospital immediately if they came clean about their fantasies to a psychiatrist before having committed any crime:. I’m a 22 year old French man.Today I got fired unexpectedly, randomly, without warning, as I was finishing one of my regular shifts, in a good mood, hopeful about the future.In February I moved to Clermont-Ferrand, a city that holds a good reputation and a good standard of living and I got hired at an Ibis Hotel to work as a receptionist.I quickly started to love this job. The hours were good and the salary was really good, especially for a 21 year old who dropped out of college.I got along with everybody and loved the job in and of itself. It was basically a mix between administrative work and sales, and I had past experience with both.I never had any friends and apart from the hotel, my life in this city has been quite empty so far.I started to consider all my colleagues my family and I actually, for the first time in my life, started feeling content and excited to work.I wasn’t trained properly and many mistakes were made on my part in the beginning, but for at least the last 3 months, I’ve been a model employee.Today, at the end of my shift, my boss asked to speak with me.He, in a nutshell, told me I was fired because a client left a bad review specifically mentioned me in it by name on Booking.com, saying that I has apparently drank what was left of a cocktail drink made for two clients in front of him and other patrons and that I had « refused » to serve him a beer as our supplies were empty.I never, ever drank a drop of alcohol at work and I suspect he lied because he couldn’t get his precious beer.He mentioned me by my first name which is odd since I never gave my first name to patrons.Because of that I can’t help but think a conspiracy might be at play. To help budget restrictions perhaps?Regardless, I’ve just lost a job I thought I would have for many years and I want to die. Whenever I get reprimanded by my boss because of a mistake I made, which happens quite often because I have ADHD,I get overwhelmed with a feeling of dread, of pure negativity and although I usually smile and apologize while physically mimicking the gestures someone who feels embarrassed would make, all I feel is absolute dread.It’s like I’m dying inside, even because I was slightly scolded for a small mistake.In my mind, it’s like people can only perceive me as being all good or all bad.I know it’s a flawed perception but I still can’t help experiencing it.I’m either totally competent or an incompetent piece of shit. There is no inbetween.Today my boss scolded me because I made a mistake that could have easily avoided had my concentration skills not fuck me up for a thousand times. than I can remember. I've been binging this show since yesterday, and I love it. It's brilliant, profound, incredibly well written and it just draws you in immediately. Everything seems clockwork except for one tiny little thing that just bugs me.&#x200B;Hannibal, although obviously good at hiding his "true persona", some of the characters, who also happen to be some of the cream of the crop behavioral analysists and criminal profilers, don't seem to notice any of the big, sparkly red flags Hannibal displays.Like, seriously, at the beginning, I get it, but as soon as the serious mind fucking shit starts going down, Hannibal should start to appear suspicious to them, people who happen to be experts at spotting psychopaths. Hannibal is the stereotype of the "perfect psychopath". He's cold, calculating, he's extremely detached in general, is scarily good at getting into people's minds. He displays no emotions whatsoever, he is freakishly calm in intense situations, like the raid of the Shrike's house, that should have picked Will's interest right away.I mean that there are tones of scenes where characters should have gone "Fuck, this dude would be a really good serial killer"&#x200B;So yeah, that's it, what do you guys think?. About a year ago, a little before the Covid outbreak, I was at a party with some friends and most of the people present there were unknown to me. There was a girl there who kept staring at me, whenever I took a glance at her she was looking at me. I thought she was physically attractive but at that time I had a low libido and I had been through a tough breakup a few weeks before. Also I was on antidepressants at the time and they really do reduce your sex drive, at least in my experience.At some point, everyone was pretty drunk, including me, and that girl. I was sitting alone in one of the bedrooms upstairs and the girl came and sat next to me. She started flirting with me a little, complimenting my outfit and stuff, and I wasn't really into it cause I was drunk and wanted to be alone.I remember the experience quite vividly to this day. She started kissing me, I tried pushing her away but she... overpowered me. She was clearly less drunk than me. She kept kissing me and she put her hand down my pants. She complained that I wasn't getting hard, at which point I bluntly said that I didn't want to. What sort of traumatized me was that seemed to enjoy it, the humiliation she was inflicting upon me. I recall her smiling. She took her pants off and shoved her panties in my mouth. At this point I felt, actually I was helpless. She sat on my face naked, and forced me to pleasure her, by which I mean that she said she wouldn't get off of me unless I did. She then got dressed and walked away.I never told anyone. I don't even know the girl's name. I tried telling a friend once, but he dismissed it as me being drunk and having spontaneous sex, which is not true.I had a very intense crush on this girl I met in high school, more than 4 years ago now and for years I've been unable to get her out of my mind. Her hair, her divine stare, the tingly sensation I experienced in my forever broken spine every time I took a glance at her. I felt this unfathomable, intense attraction towards her and I never really knew, for a fact, how she felt. My masochistic brain idealized her, blinded my perception and dwelled on her until exhaustion. I had never actually, formally shared my feelings towards with her, and I had never gotten over her. The sparkly blue moon that she was in my love hungry eyes kept manifesting itself in never ending melancholia fueled dreams. So last night, a dream that had left me numb and sorrowed convinced me to write her a poem expressing how I felt.What I found was that reality is exactly what you expect it to be, deadpan, nihilistic, empty. She formally rejected me, and.. that's it. I can finally move on. But I didn't expect it to hurt like this. It's like someone stole a little piece of me, a piece of hope. I wanna bury my head in my pillow and drown in my sugary tears.For a while now, I’ve been experiencing really vivid and intense dreams that are very movie like in that they have plots but calling them lucid dreams wouldn’t really be accurate because I don’t necessarily have a sense of control over them, I’m more of an actor and spectator in those extremely detailed emotional plots. I could use some interpretations regarding this one.My dreams are generally filled with feelings of sadness, melancholic satisfaction, loneliness and rejection.Last night I’ve had a weird dream. I was with my girlfriend, and the dream was about her, but not exactly, it was basically her, she looked like her, but was a lot different in terms of persona.I’m gonna spare you a lot, because it was very detailed.So as I am walking down a weird street, drinking and talking to strange people, I stumble upon this house. It’s occupied by a couple that seems very cool. They seem friendly and open minded, and I am struck by the overall complete beauty of the girlfriend, who is loosely based on my girlfriend. I don’t remember it all but the guy and the girl break up and I become friends with the girl, who seems absolutely perfect and even in my sleep I was overwhelmed with love.We fall in love, it goes great, I’m so in love with her that I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack when she’s around me. I’ll spare you some details, which I don’t even accurately remember myself, but after a while, something seems odd, I find out that her previous boyfriend, that I met at the beginning of the dream, is bankrupt and depressed.I later find out that my girlfriend, who is nameless in the dream, has been manipulating me all along, she turns out to be a cold, sociopathic scammer who is stealing from me.So weirdI was so in love, to discover that, it destroyed me, I tried to get her back, telling her I forgave her, and that I wanted to love her some more, but all she did was taunt and ignore me.

    I see alot of posts here that are confusing basic narcissism which all people have and is a spectrum. On one end you have too little which is dysfunctional as you need a degree of self investment and desire to do what’s right for you in order to do anything for yourself. In the middle you have normal healthy narcissism which is a belief in yourself that you are confident in that is also in line with reality, and what you have actually done and can do. In other words a realistic view of where you are in the world, what you’re good qualities are and what ones you could use to work on. The higher up the scale you creep the less you can invest in others and their well being and feelings. In other words the less you give a shit about other people as long as you get what you want.Then at the far end you have NPD which is a set pattern that is consistent throughout life and very rigid, as in the person is unable to adapt to any other way of viewing the world or how they react to those around them. NPD is not feeling really good about yourself, in fact many narcissists are miserable people who take their anger and frustration out on other people which many times is simply projection. Grandiosity In NPD is this unrealistic view of their own abilities because NPD’s lack the ability to see good and bad in themselves they must be this grandiose version in their minds but because it doesn’t line up with reality they are constantly let down and disappointed leading to depression, narcissistic collapses, or mental breakdowns there have been a number of name’s through time they are all describing the same thing.Most people who have personality disorders are what you would call damaged people. Sorry I have them and that’s what we are, We are damaged. It’s not our fault but that is what is beneath all of these random symptoms… it’s pain. Internal pain, fear of abandonment, fear of failure, never being treated as a human being. The list goes on, the important distinction I’m trying to make here is people with PD’s are suffering and that suffering is what causes the symptoms. Grandiosity isn’t just feeling better than everyone else, it’s feeling inadequate and trying to compensate so much you actually lie to yourself about who you are. I see lots of young people posting here about having NPD and it frustrates me because they haven’t even experienced life yet. Have no conception of the world yet. I was diagnosed at 34 am now much older. I wish a bolt of lightning would just strike me in the head and end it all tbh, i could never kms because I don’t want people remembering me as a coward but i experience no joy in life and to me this is how NPD and ASPD is from the inside. Anyone feeling great about themselves that’s great you probably don’t have a PD and I encourage you you to find something else that will be more fulfilling to pursue.Has anyone used this combo? Basically to keep them close enough to the reanimator to both get the boost of its nano scarab beam? Any luck with it if you’ve used it before?. I see this climbing and climbing and my thoughts are that this will come to a head sooner or later but what can happen? There seems to be no real attempt to control spending or really do anything about it, it seems like the plan is to just ignore it and hope it goes away on its own somehow. I really hope to avoid a political discussion as both parties have contributed and I’m honestly more interested in the math. At what point do we have to get serious about this, do we even have to get serious about it. To me it seems to be getting out of control. Is this a legitimate reason to get out of the market or to reduce positions in equities?. I currently have one squad of 3 lokhust destroyers with one heavy. Looking to add either a second squad or maybe a doomsday ark. Undead floating ghost ships are cool as hell but is it worth it?.
    I just had my second appointment with a therapist. At some point she asked me if I'd be Ok with answering questions about my childhood, and I said "yes, but I wan't to make sure you'll give me time to answer because when you ask me straight questions like this I get nervous". She then proceeded to ask me why I get nervous, to which I answered "because I feel vulnerable when I can't give an answer quickly".Then I realised, when people talk to me, I always need to feel like I got an answer, an excuse, or that I can deflect their question, otherwise I feel treathened. I think it's because I need to feel like I'm on top of things, otherwise the other person will start having doubt in me, and I can't stand it. When I can't answer, I feel like a child who got caught up and who's being punished, even when I know there's nothing wrong with me not knowing the answer.And that means, I manufacture answers, truths, meaning. And when I just can't answer, I ghost, I flee, I do as if I never heard them asking the question.Anyone else feel like that?. EDIT : MattyPKing's solution did the job! Here is the result with the solution implemented : [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lTa68HCGosuSIYZpco5dxm6M4Wm49yBaTqAs8iGIuZk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lTa68HCGosuSIYZpco5dxm6M4Wm49yBaTqAs8iGIuZk/edit?usp=sharing)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_I'm working on a sheet for my job but I'm hitting a wall. I have made a dropdown menu which uses the value of another dropdown menu to change the content of the list. It works fine, until I change the order of the rows on the sheet. It's crucial for me to be able to change the order of the rows (A-Z) with filters because I need to be able to organize the sheet according to different type of information at a later time.Here's a copy of the sheet (EDIT : this is the old sheet, without the solution): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BW4NqEF2lzqlpTza5mtui8bohI0e2dKS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113008653468186078003&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BW4NqEF2lzqlpTza5mtui8bohI0e2dKS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113008653468186078003&rtpof=true&sd=true)So, I have a dropdown menu on cells N3:N1000 in the sheet "Composition" that use the value of the dropdown menus adjacent from L3:L1000 (so basically, Nx modifies what is shown in the dropdown menu Lx). The issue is, I need to be able to reorganize the order of the rows according to D3:D1000, while still making sure the dropdown menu Nx follows the value of Lx. But when I change the order, it breaks the formula in the rule validation of some of the cells of N3:N1000, specifically those that have changed order.To reproduce the issue, please select the row D of sheet "Composition" and rearrange it from A-Z.Please note that the values contained in N3:N1000 are dynamically produced on the corresponding rows on the right of the sheet, from row Y.&#x200B;Thanks already for the help.Everyone experiences it at some point, but I'm certain it's way worst for people with NPD. How do you deal with it? My city has tons of cultural events, including shows from worldwide artists every week, and since I'm very implicated in the cultural sector my friends too go to lots of shows and whatnot. I know in my core that 80% of the events I "want" to go to is only because of FOMO or because friends or "cool" people I want to impress go to them. I'm tired of feeling like shit for not going to these events. What can I do or tell myself? Preferably in a constructive way, I'd prefer not to have to look down on people who go, just to feel better.I just love their interventions so much. Maybe I'm taking them for more than they are, but they just explain how I feel so well, and as someone who loves to peer into my own mind, it's really great to have those ressources that talk about us in a compassionate, scientific way.Just wanted to get it out there. I you like them too please do tell and why. If you don't, I'd like to know why; I don't want to idealize them too much either since it's a recurring issue in NPD.I was supposed to go to a festival today near my city with a friend of mine. She told me this week she'd be there all weekend (friday to monday) and that I could come on monday, which was perfect since I had other plans for the rest of the weekend. Well turns out on friday she went with another friend (with whom there's kind of a cold right now), plus these two other guys who I've studied and but who are kind of dismissive of me now. She said on that morning that she thought they weren't going at all since she hadn't talked to them for a while. But then she didn't cancel on me until this morning. Plus it's basically the only 30C+ day in a whole summer of cold, fires, wind and rain. I'm so angry, in my mind she prefered to go with them and knew full well it would hurt me a lot if she cancelled on me but did it anyway. And with all this trying-to-understand-my-NPD journey at the same time it really takes every single piece of me not to make a whole thing out of it. I don't want to talk to them anymore but I know I'll need them some day to feel good, and I also don't want them to think badly of me which is my main reason not to lash out.I'm a gay man myself, and I sometimes wonder if we NPDs are more common among the gay community, since I see so many gay flamboyant, sassy, "mean-bitch" type of guys. No hate btw, I'm not here to judge, I sort of identify as such, and altough I don't necessarily look the part, I'm definitely the sassy, mean-jokes guy of my group.EDIT : thanks everyone for your kind and useful comments, these have really helped me soothe the anguish I was feeling over the last days. I am seeking a psychologist specialised with personality disorders. I will try to keep y'all updated. Trigger warning : I'm comparing NPD to "being evil" but not because that's what I think, but because that's what every online article or psychologist seems to think. I don't actually think everyone here is evil. Remember, as you may already know from yourselves : it's about me, not about you. ****Last monday, I (29M) was diagnosed with a Narcissist Personality Disorder. I had suspicions since last march, when I saw a video on YouTube about NPD and Complex PTSD. I think the psychiatrist that evaluated me is right, but I cannot live with the idea that I could somehow be an evil person or a non-human, as some articles tend to portray NPDs as. I always was depressed and anxious, and I've always been fixated on how people see me. I certainly like some positive attention, but it's never enough. I don't think I'm great, although I feel I have to be.When I was 18, I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, and, after a couple months of suffering, it eventually felt liberating, knowing that's what caused me so many pains in my life. Difficulties understanding others, feeling alone in my world, craving positive attention, etc.I have worked very hard to read people better, to seek friendships in a constructive way, but I still feel as if I'm not good enough, that people don't want me, that I should have been special in a way (being known, doing something great for society, being an upstanding citizen), but this hasn't manifested yet.I have many friends but feel lonely, my life feels like a mess, I have nightmares about people turning against me and thinking I'm a bad person even when I feel I'm not.But this week, I got the answer I was looking for. I was diagnosed with NPD, and now it makes sense. The issue is, everyone speaks about NPDs as evil people, people to avoid, people to cancel or denounce.I am wondering if I'm an imposter. I don't feel like I am fundamentaly evil, but at the same time, am I lying to myself just to satisfy my ego? When I'm doing something "kind", is it manipulative? Do I really understand what empathy is, or is it just a twisted game I'm playing?If I ever came to the conclusion that I am an evil person, actually, truly evil, I think I would prefer to die. Even saying this feels wrong, as I'm wondering if I'm manipulating people into reassuring me of the contrary. But I still feel that way for real, I am a deeply rational person and I couldn't live with this contradiction.What am I supposed to do? I don't think I'm doing evil things, but I don't want my existence to be born from evil intentions. Ideally, I would find solace in people with NPD who can share how they have found peace, or through testamonies of non-NPD people who have known or live with NPD people who have been kind and helpful.I just want to know I'm human, and that my life is worth living. I cannot bare the idea of my life being a fundamental source of harm for others. I don't know what to do.Sorry, my post is a mess, I just don't know how to deal with this fact. It's like my worst nightmare becoming reality.SCORES :NPI: 20Codependency: 13OCD: 13+. I've started playing Daggerfall Unity the other day and Jesus, whenever I'm goin around asking for a person or place, NPCs are just treating me like absolute sh\*t all the time, it's basically my IRL nightmares. NPC : "You should learn to how to speak properly to people" Me : "Okay then, please sir, do you know where I could find..." NPC : "Stop asking stupid questions you piece of sh\*t". Took me three months to assemble the parts. Not because they weren't available, but because I'm anxious about my choices and couldn't land on a definitive build. Finally decided to stop worrying and just enjoying.

Also I know this monitor isn't that good (and is 60Hz), but look at the price. As for the NVME space and the RAM, I'll get more down the road when the prices are even lower.I'm currently building a new PC, mainly for gaming and audio creation (Ableton Live, MaxMSP), and a bit of video editing (Adobe Premiere). BUT, I want to learn TouchDesigner (I'm a novice) and be able to create live 4k content for immersive experiences, for artistic and professionnal purposes.With that in mind, I still need to choose which CPU I'll get. My budget is flexible but anything from $300 to 650$ CAD is on the table. I was considering the i5 13600K ($420 CAD), the i7 13700K ($550 CAD), the 7700X ($460 CAD), the 7900X ($590 CAD), and the 7800X3D ($630 CAD).Which would you recommend for TD? Of course one advantage of the AM5 platform is that I'd be able to pop in a new CPU someday if I really need to, but ideally I'd like a CPU which can work great for 5 to 10 years...[Here's my parts list](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/bhNzJM) (assuming a 7800X3D for the moment).This weekend, I bought two Samsung M8 monitors for Canada Computers since they were available brand new for pretty cheap.Turns out, both have something on the panel. At first I thought it was dead pixels, but from what I read it might be dust that's stuck in the panel. One was final sale and the other one I'm not sure, both from Canada Computers (they told me it was final sale after I bought it, even though I specifically asked employees at both the store AND costumer service if I could return them in case I didn't like them...).So now I'm stuck with two screens with the same issue. What can I do? I'm trying to reach Samsung's costumer service. If I'm going to pay hundreds for repair I might as well resell them...**My situation**My 10 y/o's motherboard died a week ago. I don't have enough money to get a completely new build for the moment, so I'd like to keep some parts for the moment (see below). I'm open to paying up to $1000 CAD ($750 USD) if it helps the build in the long run (i.e. keeping it for 5-10 years or so).**What I use my PC for**I'm a part time gamer, but I also work in the interactive media business (realtime audio and video, music and video editing). Here are the kind of games and softwares I use :*Games (monitor + VR) :* Elite Dangerous / Flight Simulator 2020 / Cyberpunk 2077 / Half-Life Alyx with Oculus Quest 2*Softwares :* TouchDesigner / MaxMSP / Ableton Live / JackAudio (virtual audio routing between applications, 32 channels @ 48kHz sample rate) / Adobe Premiere (1080p up to 4096x4096)**Parts I want to keep (for the next year at least)***Monitor :* LG 23 inch 1920x1080 screen*GPU :* MSI GTX 1070 Sea Hawk*Power supply :* Corsair TX850I'm aware there's no second 8 pin power connector, but from what I've read it shouldn't be a problem until I get a better GPU...*PCIe sound card :* Asus Xonar Essence STX (x1 slot)**The dilemma**On one hand, I could get an AM5 build, which will let met change the CPU in a couple of years, when substancially better ones are out and at a better price, and make the build possibly way better than the Intel one.On the other hand, I could get a slightly cheeper Intel Raptor Lake build right now, which will outpace the AM5 one for the moment but will not be upgradable (if Intel's tendencies are to be trusted).**Selected parts lists**Here are parts lists I've come up with after days of searching. I've selected them based on reputation, VRM and power inputs (for a better CPU and/or GPU later on, with a new power supply too), number of M.2 slots, number of USB 3 ports, PCIe slots placements (at least enough space to put a GTX 4090 + my sound card) and network connectivity (at least LAN 2.5G + Wifi 6).[AM5 build, option 1](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/sWwgMb) : $947.93 CAD (+ taxes)[AM5 build, option 2](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/qpqRmr) : $884.42 CAD (+ taxes)[Raptor Lake build](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/bdshzf) : $902.34 CAD (+ taxes)&#x200B;So, what do you think is the best option in this case?. ***TL;DR :*** *motherboard blew up, looking for something similar (MSI Z77 MPOWER).*I've had the same PC for a bit more than 10 years, and it has served me very well. Unfortunately, something blew up on the motherboard tonight and it's kaput. It still fits my needs, and I don't have hundreds of dollars to buy a whole new, better computer; not because I don't want to but because I don't have the budget to do so.I'd like to know if you have suggestions for motherboards that would be similarly specced to my (now-dead) MSI Z77 MPOWER. Preferably selling for under $200 CAD ($150 USD), but that's my burden to bear so don't think too much about it; I'll look them up until I find something reasonably priced.Here's a bit more info on the motherboard :\- ATX-sized;\- LGA 1155 CPU socket;\- (4x) DDR3 RAM sockets **(2 used out of 4)**;\- (3x) PCI-E 16X (Gen 3) **(1 used out of 3)**;\- (4x) PCI-E X1 **(1 used out of 4)**;\- (2x) SATA-III, (4x) SATA-II **(all used)**.Here's the rest of the relevant hardware (i.e. compatibility-wise) in case you're wondering (everything else seems fine, but it's impossible to test for the moment) :\- Graphics card : MSI GTX1070 Sea Hawk (liquid-cooled);\- CPU : Intel i7 3770K;\- RAM : Corsair Vengeance Black 2x8GB, DDR3-1600;\- Power supply : Corsair TX850 V2 850W;Thanks already for the help.This might seem like a silly question, but I'll explain what I mean.**What I'm looking for**Open-back headphones for enjoying music on my computer (with a soundcard), between $200 and $500 canadian dollars.**The situation**I have an ASUS Xonar Essence STX (PCIe) internal soundcard. 124 dB SNR and able to drive 32-600 ohms.As the title suggests, I cannot hear over 15kHz. To be more precise, I cannot hear over around 14 875 Hz. This means I usually crank up the high frequencies to compensate.**What I like**As such, I tend to prefer brighter-sounding headphones. I'm also a bit sensitive to lows, so I tend to prefer a bit less bass than average. For example, with my Sennheiser CX Plus in-ear headphones (for those who know them), I bring the bass -3dB and the highs +3dB.My daily drivers are the Superlux HD681B, an $80 chinese AKG ripoff. They have a spectral profile I like, plenty of highs and are punchy enough (for the price). The thing is, I'd like something that's more resolving, more ''true to life'', and also more punchy (faster).I also own the ATH-M50, Grado 225e and Sennheiser HD-555.**Where I'm at now**I've tried the Hifiman Sundara for the first time a couple of years ago and fell in love. They are so transparent IMO it's as if there's little in the way between you and the source, and that's probably the thing I'm looking for the most in a pair of headphones. The only issue I had, trying them again last week, is I felt they lacked a bit of high-end (owing to my hearing limitations), altough they're known for being too bright for some people. You get the idea, I need brighter headphones, and worry the Sundaras might not cut it.So yeah I was thinking of buying the Sundaras, but I stumbled upon [this video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G10dZL6QHa4) in which the guy compares a couple of Hifimans by recording their output with microphones. Of course it cannot possibly sound like the real thing because it is not, but it helps comparing each model's sound profile.The thing is, I ended up liking the most the profile of the HE4xx, and didn't like the Sundara's as much. It makes me doubt whether I would prefer the HE4xx in real life, as they sounded more natural and balanced IMO (again, through this YouTube video) in comparison to the Sundara.**My question**I'd like to know your opinions on those two options, as well as other suggestions I might not have thought about.BTW : I have tried the Sennheiser HD-600, HD-650 and HD-660 a couple of times and I do not like them. To me, they sound muffled. The infamous ''Sennheiser veil'', if it exists, seems to be very present to me. So they are a no-go.**TL;DR : I want to buy headphones that are more resolving, more detailed and more natural-sounding, but the usual suspects (Hifiman Sundara, Sennheiser HD-650, etc) are usually not bright enough for me since I cannot hear over 15kHz. What's my best shot for $200-$500 CAD, with or without the need for EQ?**. So yeah, I was driving on a long journey (2000 km+) and all of a sudden, I fell trough the road onto the void. Got to almost 600 km/h. I called for towing, and when I re-appeared my truck glitched out, flailing like crazy, and I got 100% damage. It just cost me 90000$ to repair my truck for a trip that was supposed to reward me 117000$...Binance is down,BNB is up,F\*ck me.So I'm trying to figure out the name of an indie game (or rather a sort of tech demo) I found a couple years ago. You explored what seemed like an infinite number of rooms and corridors (into which you teleported from another by going through a door) of an alien city (procedurally generated maybe?). It had a distingtive lo-fi aesthetic to it, with a voluntary low-resolution and the use of sprites. Everything was monochromatic (so an alien for example would be a couple of pink, or green, or yellow pixels, etc), and from what I recall the walls and floors were mostly shades of grey, and there were few elements in each scene. Basically it looked like atari graphics in a way, but in a 3D world. The aliens did not talk but produced weird sounds and would stare at you if you got close enough. Finally, I think I played it somewhere between 2011 and 2014, if that helps.&#x200B;If that rings a bell I would very much appreciate if you could help me find it again. Thanks people!&#x200B;EDIT : Nevermind, just found it. It's **Bernband**, made by *Tom van den Boogaart*! My description wasn't exacly right but that's pretty close to what I remember. A nice little thing to explore! [https://gamejolt.com/games/bernband/34864](https://gamejolt.com/games/bernband/34864). Hello there.&#x200B;So I'm working on a school project using Processing 3.4 (which I'm fairly new to; actually I'm new to programming altogether) and I would like to declare a float value as such :&#x200B;`float v = 1/4;`&#x200B;But it seems I just cannot do such a thing. It let's me declare it with a multiplication like such `v = 2 * 5` for example (which is useless in my case because I'm trying to make the value of v smaller than 1), but not with a division (/). Why is that, and is there something to do about it?&#x200B;The thing is that "v" stands for "vitesse" ("speed" in French), and my program is using this variable as the speed to which it must process its different operations (mostly rotations and opacity changes), and it would be more convenient to write it as a fraction than as a number (ex: 0.25) in my situation.&#x200B;Thanks already for your help!. Hello fellow Raspberry Pi enthousiasts,&#x200B;I'm very new to the whole Raspberry Pi business as I do not have a programming past. Actually I am in my first semester of Médias intéractifs (Interactive Medias, or Computation Arts if you will) at UQÀM in Montréal, and I have to create a basic interactive installation using a Raspberry Pi to monitor sensors and another computer to output signals, such as sound and lighting instructions by DMX.&#x200B;I've been able to get readings from two IR sensors, albeit not to scale, by copying code made for other IR sensors (i.e. the IR sensors I got are do not have the same range as detailed in code I used, so I'll need to tweak the calculations).&#x200B;My issue is that I have a third sensor, an URM37 ultra-sonic sensor from DFRobot (aka SEN0001), which doesn't seem to work in the same way. From what I read, this sensor can output both analog and digital information, contrary to the other two (GP2Y0A41SK0F (4-30cm) and GP2Y0A710K0F (100-500cm)), and since those work on the Raspberry Pi by using a MCP3008 A/D converter chip, the code I have is rendered useless. Also, it has a gillion connectors so I have no idea what to make of it (10 compared to 3 for the GP2Y0A41SK0F...).&#x200B;Plus, it looks like the URM37 may be made specifically for a DFRduino card, but that's where I would need some help : is there a way to make the URM37 work with the Raspberry Pi, and if so, how? I managed to find a chinese website which explains parts of the process, but it doesn't help that much, considering I don't know how to write the code needed to interpret the data myself.&#x200B;Just so you know, I've managed to use python code using the LXTerminal on Raspbian with the other sensors, but I have no idea how to use javascript (which seems to be the prefered language for multiple sensors) even when already written, so I would need help with that too...&#x200B;Thank you already for your help!. Bonsoir,Dans un élan de nostalgie, j'essaie de me souvenir d'un site web où j'allais quand j'étais assez jeune, un peu après l'an 2000. On y trouvais quelques jeux primitifs et pas mal d'animations flash ou de cossins comme des jeux de devinette, de magicien, des feux d'artifices en flash, etc...Il me semble que le nom ressemblait à quelque chose du genre "Chez Malou" et le logo était un chien genre mastiff. Quelqu'un s'en souvient?Merci!EDIT : c'est "Chez Maya"!RE-EDIT : L'ancien site est accessible par l'adresse suivante : http://www.chezmaya.com/mailmaya/bienvenue-maya.html. Hi! So, I have this class for which I have to film a project with a Sony HDV270 camera. It shoots in 1080i on mini-DV, which I've never worked with before but I'm sure everything's gonna be OK.But anyway, does anyone know what color space (sRGB, Adobe 1998, NTSC, etc) is this camera using? I've been used to using Adobe 1998 with my T2i and other Canon DSLRs, and I want to know which one the HDV270 is using, so that I can edit my project with the right settings and know the colors will be reproduced correctly.I'm just scared it's sRGB, 'cause sRGB is made by and for the devil (or the internet, same thing).Thanks already!.
    I’m curious about how people reacted to realizing they’re a narcissist.I’ve been contemplating whether I’m a narcissist and I feel like the narcissist personality test are bullshit, because if your a narcissist wouldn’t the way you act towards people vs the way you think you act be completely different then resulting in a narcissist not answering the questions accurately? Also how are you supposed to answer the questions? For example when you ask a narcissist if they are confident. Are they supposed to answer the question based on how they feel or how the act? Because my understanding of narcissism is they act confident but are very insecure and protective of their feelings.For me It’s because i realized I’m abusive and have become aware of how long I have been abusive for, and how I have caused plenty of people to suffer for my own benefit, but would justify it by thinking the other person was just being a baby for taking it that seriously.Some examples of my narcissistic traits are:- the pride I’ve always felt for taking multiple peoples virginity’s. But would abruptly end the relationships when I got bored and would tell them how it’s their fault It was leaving them.- for a long time I felt valid for threatening my boyfriend with a knife because he wouldn’t let me go outside in -0(F) weather during an argument that I started because my cat ran away and I blamed him for leaving the window open.- I’m always annoyed by other people mental health and believe they don’t have it as bad as they wanna believe. Like I’ve told my boyfriend that if he was gonna keep talking about being suicidal then he might as well do it.- even though I’m annoyed by other people’s feelings I always take it extremely personally when someone doesn’t seem interested in mine.- have always believed everyone else in my life was the problem and the reason I’m not happy but now I’ve realize I’m the common denominator. - I once cheated so my ex would break up with me but I validated my actions by believing he always acted sketchy so he was probably hiding that he was cheating so I was better since I was honest about it right away. - I don’t leave relationships until I feel nothing for them and can move on like nothing happened. - I don’t know If i have a real personality because depending on who I’m talking to I’ll act completely differently.- I hate myself on such a deep level but I always try to come off as confident and like I’ve got it all figured out. Becoming self aware about how self destructive I am and abusive / toxic I am definitely feels devastating but at the same time now makes me feel like I might have a chance at happiness. NPI: 32Codependency: 3OCD: 4. When I was 14 I was molested and then from ages 17-19 I went threw a few traumas and developed PTSD. I was raped, then my mom who I was very closed to started dating an abusive drug dealer and started doing meth and one day texted me freaking out saying her boyfriend was hurting her and told me to call the cops (that was the first panic attack I experienced) I then started dating someone and on my 18th birthday I found out he was cheating on me with multiple people and instead of leaving him I moved in with him so we could be closer and try to heal from the cheating. But the cheating never did stop during the 2 years I was with him. On my 18th birthday I also had a conversation with my dad about being molested since he never believed me and had told me I was making it up for attention and on that day he said he did actually believe me but didn’t know what to do about it.A few months after being raped I took Acid for the first time and the trip went well but after I could only sleep for 30 minutes to an hour a day and went threw a rollercoaster of being depressed and manic for 2 weeks. It took me 6 months to accept that I was actually raped and I realized it because one day I specifically told my ex that I didn’t want him to finish on my face but when we had sex he held my arms down with his knees and did it anyways. I had a panic attack but once I calmed down I comforted him and told him it was okay and to just not do it again. I’m now 21 and finally accepted that it’s all had an affect on me. I’ve realized my constant irritability has come from me not willing to be hurt anymore and that my obsessive cleaning and needing things to be perfect whenever I’m stressed comes from me needing to feel in control of things.I’m also now in a better relationship and pregnant but it’s so hard reacting to everything in such an extreme way and knowing that I’m being irrational.My partner has been surprisingly understanding but I know he doesn’t deserve to deal with me like this. For example there was a day during winter my cat went missing it was -0(Fahrenheit) outside and my boyfriend argued with me to come inside since I had already been searching for an hour. I absolutely love my cats and I was feeling devastated so when he told me to come inside I was instantly pissed and yelled at him saying he doesn’t care about our cat and that I’m going to keep looking since he doesn’t care if she came back. Eventually I went inside and he tried coming to me to comfort me but I was still mad at him so I pushed him and told him to leave me alone. He kept insisting on being close to me and I kept getting more and more aggressive and feeling trapped so I tried leaving the house with only sweatpants and a teeshirt with slippers but he blocked the door saying it was way to cold and I snapped. In that moment I instantly felt like I was in danger since he wouldn’t let me leave and I went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and pointed it at him and said he better let me leave. It’s been hard realizing I was actually in the wrong that day. For the last year I kept telling myself I was valid for reacting like that because me made me feel like I was in danger and that he should’ve left me alone. And yes he probably should’ve given me some time to calm myself down but nothing about what he did validates me pulling a knife out on him and everyday I’m now wondering why he would stay with me especially since he has PTSD from being stabbed.It’s hard realizing that I have been abusive towards my partner but I believe I need to hold onto that guilt so I can be a better girlfriend for him and a better mom to my son once he’s here.I feel extremely alone with this and absolutely wish this was not a thing I have to deal with. But here I am on Reddit because this isn’t a common struggle that I can go to just anybody to talk to and I’m to embarrassed to talk to a therapist about. When I was 11 years old I started watching porn and the porn I originally was watching was incest porn, and that lead me to discover videos of males convincing unwilling females into having sex or males having sex with sleeping females. And that led me to gangbangs and videos that honestly could be rape. When I’m having sex I also cannot finish unless I’m imagining somebody being raped. I’ve told my boyfriend a little bit about my kink once but I never told him that I can’t finish unless I’m imagining it because I never want him to know that every time he’s given me an orgasm I was imagining someone being raped.When ever I’m not horny or right after I finish, I feel absolutely disgusted by those videos and extremely ashamed of it. But as soon as I’m horny it’s like a switch goes off and all it does is turn me on more. I know most people I’ve seen talk about this usually can say it was a result of them being sexually assaulted, but for me I was 11 when this kink started but I was molested at 14 and raped at 17.Me and my boyfriend have been together for 1.5 years and we are having a baby in 2024 and I figured since we’re having a kid I really can’t avoid fixing my faults anymore, and feeling uncomfortable showing him affection has been one that upsets my boyfriend. He struggles with insecurities and obviously having a girlfriend/baby mama who rarely initiates cuddling, kissing, sex and maybe says he looks good once a month isn’t helping at all. So my question is what are some things I can slowly start doing to stop feeling like a 8 y.o talking to her crush every time I say “you look good/handsome/sexy”. Also I wanna raise my son to feel comfortable expressing himself and I know I can’t teach him to be something I’m not.
    I’ve seen trends where narcissists target certain people/characteristics. Is that true?. I left my abuser over a month ago. Right now I’m focused on healing my nervous system since I’ve been almost crying with anxiety every day since my world shattered (it was a fairytale before) when I found out he cheated on me in January. Since that day he’s threatened to cheat on me (again), gave me bruises, one time said he wanted me to die, left me on the side of the road stranded, the list goes on etc. I’m starting therapy again this week but I wanted to get advice on dating after a DV relationship. Usually after breakups I get right back out there but I am truly, severely broken. I have a lot of PTSD from my mom/ have very extreme abandonment issues that were brought back to life by him. All I wanted was a family and children. When do I tell someone about my past when dating? How much detail should I get into? What are some asks I could recommend to help them help me? Is it unattractive to have an abusive past? Any information helps!. I left my abuser over a month ago.

Is it unattractive to have an abusive past? Any information helps!. I am terrified. Going into this relationship I was an unstoppable, outgoing, young woman with hopes and dreams to settle down and find a family. I found a charming, hardworking man with a lot of serious baggage (little brothers death, parents alcoholics, father unfaithful, and comes from a very wealthy family which I believe adds to the negatives). He sexually made me feel like no one else, brought me on trips, took care of me, and put me in my feminine. Everything went downhill when I had caught him texting another girl, then eventually texting prostitutes. It became so bad. He put bruises on my body. Threatened to cheat, told me he wanted me to die. Constantly called me a whore/slut. We had been in an LDR and never wanted to see me. I felt belittled, abused, forgotten, and abandoned. I am in SO MUCH PAIN. I had horrible thoughts in the relationship and now. I’m getting older and I’m so depressed because he broke something in my brain and I can barley function. All I want is a family but now that I have to find someone else I’m broken. He broke something in my brain but I can’t help but think “what’s wrong with me, why didn’t he want me”.Throughout my life I’ve never had sex AND love with one person. I’m a very very sexual person and he brought out another side of me that no one else had. Every time I think about having sex with someone else I cry. Every time I masturbate (which is now like once a month), I cry. How do I break this bond? I wanted a family and babies with him so badly. He was very abusive and I had to leave. I just can’t think about being close to someone like that again. Please help.My ex is a very dominant man and I want to stand out and makes sure he knows that he needs to be with me. Me and my girls don’t talk much about sex so I’m not really sure what the girls are doing these days in the bedroom. I’m really trying to win him over. Do you have any tips or websites that can help me learn the latest and greatest and maybe a little more unique moves?. I (28F) recently broke up with my narcissistic boyfriend (32M). I did it because I was in severe pain. I’m trying to get him back but I’m realizing it’s only because our sexual relationship. I’ve had a lot of sex in my life but it’s something with him and what he gives me sexually that makes me feel brainwashed. He was technically a dom to me. It is insane how strong this sexual bond is but I think a lot of is because he’s a narcissist. How do I break this? We are in a LDR so it’s an odd situation. Help.My boyfriend and I had a huge falling out in Dec 2022. I caught him texting/dming girls he shouldn’t have while in a LDR. Nothing horrible but definitely crossed the line. After this I had exposed that I had also texted an ex (very friendly) as well. In the heat of the moment we also expressed a few lies we told… nothing serious but definitely killed our trust. What we both did wasn’t horrible but since we both have past trauma it basically killed us. After this ordeal I could not take the pain of being long distance and dealing with him texting another girl. Every day when I woke up I called him having panic attacks. This happened for 4 months. I accused him every day of cheating - I was so scared I couldn’t help myself. Then in May 2023 he started flipping the roles and now thinks I’m a cheater. We both have incredible trauma (poor kid has been through so much) so our insecurities are heightened. He thinks that since I nagged and accused him for months I must of done something wrong (like I was projecting). We want to make this work 100% but we are so screwed up from our past it’s very hard. I’m not asking you guys to tell me to break up. BUT I need to know how I can’t build trust with my partner while in a LDR. Tips are needed… we have been fighting and in pain for 8 months now. HELP SOS.First off I absolutely despise the word Narcissist and feel like it is thrown around way too much. I (F28) am in a relationship with a full blown narcissist (M32). We have always been long distance and I get to see him every 5-6 weeks (only for 3-4 days). We both make very very good money and are more than able to make the trip as it’s only a two hour flight/tickets are cheap. I have been through the ringer with him ever since a girl messaged me on IG saying he’s been hitting her up. He’s left bruises on me, left me on the side of the road with no money/license, threatens to cheat on me, caught him texts other girls/ hookers, says he wishes I would die/ get hit by a car, he says he’s going to break up with me EVERY day, he calls me 50 times when I try to break up and fully does the love bombing/discard actions. They are SO PAINFUL. I have BPD so this triggers me beyond belief. He is my dream man (the side I first met/what he portrays to the world). He is handsome, outgoing, does well for himself, and is the best sex I’ve ever had (I am disgustingly addicted to sex with him so much that I would probably have to go to special therapy to break that bond). We have been dating for almost a year and he’s never posted me and I am NOT allowed to go to where he lives. He always comes to me. I am so depressed (I was the most outgoing girl ever/I was just so happy). I have multiple full blown anxiety attacks a day, I’ve lost 25lbs, I feel manic, and it hurts so bad I sometimes I have bad thoughts. I fully think I am ugly, unloveable, pathetic, etc. I don’t stop crying ever….. Since I have BPD and a HUGE fear of abandonment I get confused if it was me or him that’s the problem. I just need help. Him and I are are very social people and I get nervous because when we break up I know he’s going to fully have a free for all and that will kill me. I also think since we are in a LDR we never had a good shot.I HAVE SO MUCH LOVE TO GIVE. It’s so sad. HOW DO I BREAK UP WITH HIM?.

I feel like I know every mainstream sex trick in the book to make my man excited/obsessed. But what are some new and exciting tricks I can bring to the bedroom that maybe he’s never had done or said to him before? We both are very sexual people and very very advanced/open to new things in the bedroom. Anyone have any ideas or things I can do that are new/exciting? I want to be better than all the ones in his past.My bf (33M) and I (27F) have always been long distance from the start. I have a very high sex drive and it was so refreshing finding someone to match my needs and wants. After our relationship progressed I realized that his high sex drive (now worse than mine) may be detrimental to our relationship. After someone in his family passed away he started to sleep with sex workers (before me). He can get any girl he wants because he is hot, charming, has money …. a dreamboat etc. I believe he did this to cope with the loss of a family member and to abuse/satisfy his need to be in control. I am positive he used sex workers as an opportunity to own/hurt them (it gets him off for sure). I caught him texting sex workers once in our relationship when he was drunk and we were fighting (said nothing happened). I am having trouble dealing with this because my sexual side thinks it’s hot but my gf/relationship side gets crushed by this (confidence, jealous, safety, the lying). How can I cope? My mind races and thinks he will find another girl while LDR (if he already already hasnt) to satisfy his needs when we aren’t together? Im giving him as much sexy phone calls as I can. What if he has a problem? I am so hooked on him AND I know other girls from his past are too. Help.Trying to be safe as I see this comment under an app that keeps SW safe.I found out that Mr. Number is used to keep sex workers safe and they’ll comment an experience with a customer. I noticed that my boyfriend (M34)has “🪡” emoji under his number dated a few weeks ago. What does that mean? He has a past with sex workers and I don’t know what that means.
    Okay one time I ended up at a squat house with actual crackheads even though I do not do crack nor have I ever hung out with people who do. They were just hanging out in an abandoned building across from mine and I ended up knocking after 2 glasses of wine not knowing what was waiting on the other side of the door. I was just curious to hang out & see what was happening first row seats.One of the people was having a literal psychotic break in this crack house & another guy had a knife he was waving around. This though is totally not my vibe I’m not a badass street smart person but I later spoke to my psychologist who said this is all a part of my risk taking need..This is such a random story, but for some reason I’ve always had this itch that needs to be satisfied with doing something outrageous - anyone else?. Hello I have BPD & I know a lot of our traits are super similar. I’m still struggling to understand our differences so I’m curious about this... When I meet someone new, I often find myself moulding myself into what I think they want me to be. I communicate in a way to make myself the image of what they want, literally I’m so good at mirroring someone. I do this as I have such a need to be accepted & fear of rejection, so I do anything to avoid being rejected by people. I feel like I do this unintentionally though, but it is manipulative behaviour. I’ve had situations where I legit start (in my free time, alone) picking up hobbies of this new interesting person I met in order to be like PERFECT for them. What is this like for someone with NPD? Firstly - what causes do you manipulate? Is it fear of rejection or something else? If it’s rejection - What does rejection look like and mean to you? Also, what goes through your head as you are talking to this new person - do you think you do it intentionally?. When I meet someone new & they show me basic well manners & kindness ( which is just the norm). I tend to attach myself so quickly, create an obsession. Almost in my head, we are married - without any actual flirting going on , I startto feel like we are heavy flirting. Embarrassing, but I’ll literally think about this new person 24/7, imagine our life together & before bed literally fall asleep to scenarios of us together. Anyone else get this? How do you combat it? Another problem is that I will start to mould myself to their personality. Example is that one person who I had this with (we spoke 3 times at this point) is very much into literature, so after he asked me if I read I felt embarrassed I don’t. I lied to him about my interests and as soon as I got home I looked up books I could read. After that I found out he actually has a girlfriend for 3+ years which literally shattered my world - no joke.. my world broke down over a dude I saw 3 times by this point.I sometimes feel like even though I got diagnosed, have been through so many crisis’ - my best friends don’t really understand the gravity of the situation. My best friend will , when I’m in a crisis say things like “don’t label yourself” “everyone has those days”… i hate it..i feel like firstly me having a “ label “ has helped me so much & also feel like my suffering is invalidated by saying that everybody has those days..Everybody does have those days, it’s true. But for me, on the best day ever the slightest thing can set me off into a crisis...All I wish is for someone to say I see you, I see your pain, it’s real & tough but I’m here to support you how I can. Anything else just feels invalidating & I simply have to admit it that I need other people to validate my feelings to know that they are real…I know this is all a ME problem & I should crave internal validation but It’s hard…I’m just having a moan really.. :(. My mum once cut all my hair off as a form of punishment. I was 12. This for some reason of all the abuse I endured sticks out more than anything and there definitely was way more severe stuff…but as an adult I find the hair cut causes the most anger inside me. I don’t understand why ?.
    For context, I just received the list of selected people for a mobility to another country, we had to write a motivation letter and after some weeks, half of us got called for an interview in english to further develop our motivation and show our english skills (english isn't our main language, but we need it to communicate with the people in the country, so they needed to check). There was a total of 10 people selected, and I got put as the 4th substitute (if one of the selected people gives up, I'm the 4th one in the list to take that place). I've been pretty tense and kinda pissed of since I saw the email, because I know I was amongst the best they could have chosen (I'm saying this also because I stayed up until the last interview, and saw that the other ones were average at best). Anyone experienced something similar?.

Anyone experienced something similar?. For some context, I'm an art student and in my last year of High School and want to go to an Architecture University, I have everything needed, including the grades. The problem is that in my High School, in my course (Visual Arts, to be more specific) there was no Math besides Descriptive Geometry, but I obviously know that you need to know Math to study Architecture, so I want to study it on my own until there.As the title says, what topics so you think you have to know before being able to comfortably go through linear programming without having to worry about getting stuck in a part and having to go review it?. I am a high school student that is thinking about taking a course involving game development and design in university next year, however, one of the things I have to take into consideration is the job offer and how difficult it may be to find a job in the area.Do you think it's relatively easy to find one nowadays, or is it still pretty difficult to get started? Do you have any tips for when someone finishes university and wants to start working on the area?. For some context here, I'm an art student and I'm currently in 12th grade. Until this past week I had no concrete idea of what course to take in university and never really seemed to be interested in some of the options, until I stumbled across the course "Engeneering and Development of Digital Games", where after researching about it, I actually came to like it and want to pursue that course.However, the problem is, if I want to enter the said course I would need both Math and Descriptive Geometry exams (I already took the Descriptive Geometry exam, so I don' have a problem with that). I don't have math for almost 3 years, so if I wanted to take the math exam in june, i'd have to learn it on my own, with only having my afternoons free from classes.Another problem is, I have no study habits nor know how to study since I've basically never needed it to have good grades up until where I'm now, being able to retain information with only classes. Do you guys have any tips/methods to study math on your own? Without having to go classes or anything, if possible.So basically I've been taking arts for 2 years now, basically since 10th grade, with me being in the beginning of 12th grade. In about 8 months I'll have to choose which university I want to go to, and I honestly have no idea.I love arts, but I feel like going to a dedicated art university is basically setting myself up to failure when i have to go into the working world, given the difficulties that artists face everyday. One of my options is taking a course about game development and designing, combining art and informatics, course that i think would have more job opportunities when i finish university around 2027. Did anyone else have a hard time deciding, despite being on high school for some time? And if so, what, or how did you decide?. I need some tips on how to actually study when you have ADHD. I really need to self learn some contents of math in 8 months so I can take the exam and enter my dream university, however, I'm struggling with staying focused and gathering motivation despite wanting to pursue that course so much. I never developed study habits due being a gifted kid and just straight up loosing concentration due to my ADHD, so now I'm finding it extremely difficult to start studying, especially on my own.I'm thinking about taking an university course involving game development, and I want to start learning the basics beforehand, what programming languages do you think are most useful when developing a game?. For some context here, I'm an art student and I'm currently in 12th grade.

I don't have math for almost 3 years, so if I wanted to take the math exam in june, i'd have to learn it on my own, with only having my afternoons free from classes.Do you think learning high school level math in 8 months is achievable, or should I just start searching for another university course?. Yeah i get it, people like L more and were upset after his death, but calling Near a "L wannabe" is just dumb. The Wammy kids were raised to be successors of L so it's reasonable that Near was similar to L, of course him representing L's rational side and Mello his more emotional and risk taking side. I truly see no point in hating him imo (and not mentioning the annoying L stans that can't seem to let people who like Near enjoy a character in peace).
    And turns out she going to a diff party and didn’t invite me. I want to find out where it is bad and crash. She prob not my friend no more after I went after her weakest points over fb messenger for 4 hours until she said she won’t even enjoy the party now and is dreading going and only then did I let it go and started giving her the silent treatment. I want to find the party bad and show up and make friends with everyone and watch her see me steal her other friends. How dare she. I fucking hate her ass. Dirt under my shoe bitch. I know she’ll be miserable and was crying so I feel better. All my friendships end with these rage episodes then I gotta find new one. Either love me or fear me, no in between option honey. She learned her lesson.This subreddit used to be better than r/npd and now it’s cesspool of CRAP. I’m so pissed cuz I used to get so much value here from discussions about narcissism and npd but ever since that Reddit blackout the mods here have been babies and let the subreddit go to crap. Even the automod is a little bitch now. Can’t believe I have to devalue what was once a SAFE AND INTERESTING SPACE. Someone should take over this subreddit and make it back into what we DESERVE. High quality only. I’m tired of the useless waste of time sob stories that aren’t related to npd. And tired of non npds posting and commenting. Gtfo of our space. Mods need to fix this place up or give it the fuck up to people who actually care ughuggygg so annoying. Most of these people make comments and posts that a lot us with actual NPD diagnosis can’t relate to their experience but they insist they have npd. When we share how our experience with npd actually goes they can’t relate either. Are they just too dumb to realize it’s likely not npd they are dealing with? For example I saw a post on r/narcissism where someone finally got adhd medications and it stopped their narcissistic behavior, such as a rage. Well duh!!! They obviously weren’t dealing with npd at all and it was just adhd symptoms. I’m not saying all npd experiences is universal, but there are definitely similarities and a lot of posts by these undiagnosed and self diagnosed people are dragging down our safe space.Let’s come up with small ways we can start working on our entitlement!For example, I have a lot of entitlement in regards to food and expectations around food. This is exacerbated by my eating disorder. I’ve sent food back so many times for such “minor” (to normies) issues, thrown food when it doesn’t meet my standards and gotten banned from restaurants for cussing out the staff etc.These days I cook way more and am able to deliver the standards I want for myself. When I go out to eat I have a rule now not to send it back more than once, and if I feel a need to then ask for a to go container so my partner can eat it and not waste money. (Thanks therapy for helping me get here.)What are some examples of your entitlement issues and how can or how do you challenge it?. Long time lurker who finally had the nerve to create a private npd account heh. Hi.Since childhood I have only accepted that people love me or fear me. My family and school environment was abusive and i turned it around and became the bully and abuser. This behavior goes back to childhood, starting around age 8/9. It's cringe, but I was the Regina George of my elementary and middle school until we had to move and I struggled to start anew as the popular girl. This started a series of cycles where I would build up large groups of friends and communities only to sabotage them at the first hint of them criticizing or questioning me. I would nuke the bridges instead of burn them, move and start again. Now i am in my 30s with only a few friends left that I have to fake everything around because they are such normies. I have no idea where to go from here. Starting a new social group seems futile. Should I just work on maintaining the friendships I do have since i know they love me already? Why isn;t it good enough though? Why can't i tolerate anything between love and fear/hate? Anyone relate and have insight? I am diagnosed NPD/ASPD and have been in therapy for 7 years without much help if that matters (I live kinda in the country and we dont have very good therapists around here unfortunately, it is is what it is.Also I feel so naked and vulnerable posting here for the first time. Be nice please 🥺.
    Ok so I’ve never been diagnosed with ocd but I do have health anxiety which has symptoms similar to ocd and I do tend to have obsessive thoughts that I can’t seem to get out of my head.The most recent one of these is constantly imagining myself from the third person. And not voluntarily, like the image will just pop into my head. It’s really starting to annoy me bc it makes me feel like I’m outside my body looking in on myself which makes me feel depersonalised, and it gives me the same kinda feeling you get when you’re being watched, it’s really uncomfortable and unnerving. Has anyone else ever gotten this and how have you coped with it?. Ok so I’m doing a degree in commerce and I’ve never really been doing as well as I want to be, I’ve been in a constant state of “once I get my shit together”. Had some bad anxiety earlier this year that impacted my study and made me feel even worse abt my lack of success. Anyway so this friend is doing a degree in a field unrelated to business and she gets into the most prestigious consulting group in my uni. I actually felt sick when she told me bc how tf is it fair that someone doing a completely different degree is doing better than I am IN MY OWN FIELD! She has mentioned multiple times in a haha funny way that she just kinda makes shit up when they start talking abt super business stuff. And don’t get me wrong she’s smart but it’s unfair bc 1 her major is a lot easier than mine, I did a class in it and got a distinction without watching a single lecture and 2 she literally doesn’t have a job so of course it’s easier for her to do all these extra internships and get great marks. This literally makes me sound like the worst friend in the world but whenever she brings it up I’m just like 😀 greattttt so cooolAnyway I started going to a therapist for some unrelated issues but how do I bring this up without just like completely changing the subject out of no where. Obviously I’m not the first person here to criticise her but I can’t get over how narrow her vid on low grade npd is. She basically just describes someone immature and annoying. All the traits are the most surface level “they love social media”, “they don’t clean up after themselves”, “they care too much about there looks” “they’re obsessed with celebrities”. It’s actually cartoonish.Low grade npd can range from like she said a slack parent who only partakes in the fun parts of parenting to a overbearing parent who will go above and beyond to make sure their kid is perfect bc they are a reflection of themselves. It can be constantly needing a romantic partner for validation or avoiding romantic relationships out of a crippling fear of rejection. It can be slacking on “adult tasks” or micromanaging your household to prove your competency.I just watched healNPD’s video on how ppl with npd often get health/illness anxiety and I was wondering if any of you get this?Personally I’ve had a lot of health anxiety for a while, and I have always thought that it had something to do with my need for perfection, need for control, need to be be successful and incredibly high standards I hold myself to, bc obviously having a horrible disease or condition would hold me back from all those things. It makes a lot of sense bc I don’t have much medical trauma or anything else I could think of that would cause this obsession with my health.I often find myself hating teen dramas, especially set in highschool that are supposed to be “relatable” bc I get so jealous and insecure abt the characters having a more interesting highschool experience than I did. It’s actually an issue, I stopped watching stranger things when they all got into relationships bc how the fuck is eleven in a relationship yet I’m not, stopped watching sex education for the same reason, and there’s countless tv shows I won’t even try bc I know I’ll hate them for that reason. Also often when watching tv shows or movies I come to despise the “main character” or the person who is supposed to be the “good guy”. Some examples:- Aria from pll - Scott and Allison from teen wolf- Serena and Dan from gossip girl- Daenerys from got- rhaenyra from hotd- Spider-Man- Every single character in riverdale- Nancy and Jonathan stranger things- Rachael from friends- Jane from Jane the virgin (couldn’t get past ep1)-Rory from Gilmore girls (again couldn’t get past ep 1)- Haven’t even bothered watching vampire diaries bc I know I’m gonna hate Elena - Luke skywalker- Gabriella from hsm - Literally every single main character from any Disney or Nickelodeon show (especially the female ones for some reason)Sometimes I worry I have internalised misogyny but then I do have an unhealthy obsession with female “villains” or women with issues like Blair Waldorf, Cersei Lannister, Alicent Hightower, spencer Hastings, Jade from victorious, fallon carrington from dynasty and sharpay evensAnyway just rambling bc I need to get my hatred for these characters out somehow. If anyone has any show recommendations lmk lol. The way I become incredibly anxious, intimidated and basically just seize up around anyone who has a higher social status than me, or is in a position of power above me or who I view as higher up the hierarchy of whatever situation I’m in is so pathetic it’s embarrassing. Its as tho I switch from grandiose to vulnerable depending on how I view/the status of the ppl around me. It’s gotten better after highschool bc there’s less social hierarchy but it still sucks at work bc I can never be the confident outgoing version of myself, or have a decent relationship with my bosses bc of this. And I can never actually impress the ppl I care to impress, only looser I don’t particularly want to associate myself with 😂. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship so obviously I don’t have personal experience with heartbreak or relationships issues (apart from my best friend of 3 yrs ghosting me), and I dunno if it’s lack of empathy or something but I genuinely don’t understand a lot of ppls relationships issues. Like whenever someone get really upset abt their relationship I can’t help but think either it isn’t that bad and you should get over it or it is that bad and break up. Like currently my sister is heartbroken over some guy she never even dated and I just don’t get it? I know it’s wrong and I should never blame the victim but whenever someone starts talking abt the way they were treated in a past relationship I can’t help but judge them for staying in the first place. Like I saw someone on another sub post abt how their abusive ex straight up told them a month into the relationship that they abused every person they were with, and it makes it hard to even feel sympathy for them bc why tf would you even stay after that?. So it seems as tho ppl with npd often didn’t suspect they had it or self diagnose themselves with it, and that they can be in denial when they do get diagnosed with it. And ppl seem to blame this entirely on the narcissism but I can’t help feel as tho the way the media talks abt npd must be a slight contributing factor. Like if you search up npd on YouTube or tiktok or any other social media 90% of the results focus on spotting and diagnosing npd in others. Stuff like “how to tell if your ex is a narc”, etc. Contrast this to how bpd or adhd or bipolar is talked abt where it’s focused on whether you have it with stuff like “what it’s like living with __”. Like are we really surprised that no one is self aware when the way npd is talked abt doesn’t promote self reflection and instead just encourages ppl to point the accusatory finger at others?. Curious to see if there’s anything certain things that actually make you feel empathy?Like seeing other ppl emotionally suffering doesn’t make me emotionally suffer. (Although it does make me uncomfortable bc now I have to comfort them and I’m not very good at that) However there are some things that make me feel:1) physical pain, I hate seeing ppl get physical hurt, I hate watching “funny” fail vids where ppl get hurt, it just grosses me out.2) wholesome videos, like the ones that are supposed to restore your faith in humanity, they makes me happy3) movies, sad movies make me sad The more I think abt empathy the more it confuses me, why does a video of a child I don’t even know beating cancer make me feel but my friend crying in front of me doesn’t?. Ok so I have a very high opinion of myself. I basically think I’m better than the large majority of ppl overall. I definitely think I’m self righteous, and I do curse a lot (not sure how that relates).I’ve always been a chronic daydreamer, and the daydreams always involve an alternate universe where I’m super rich, famous and/or powerful, with a great partner and great friends. I often get a kick out of feeling powerful, like when I can tell someone is intimidated by me, or I’m put in a position of authority.The thought of living an average life where I never amount to much terrifies me. I recently turned 21 and I feel like I’m spiraling bc I haven’t achieved the level of success I dreamed of. I do feel entitled to opportunities I don’t have the grades for, but I understand why they can’t break the rules for me.I find myself getting incredibly jealous of ppl when they achieve something or get complimented, I don’t feel happy for them. I don’t resent them for their achievements but sometimes I do have to remind myself of their flaws just to reassure myself.I’ve also started questioning whether I actually feel emotional empathy, I definitely feel cognitive empathy, but I don’t actually feel sad when someone else feels sad. I have also always thought I was slightly emotionally stunted, like when I get bad news abt someone else I always feel like I’m more focused on how I’m acting than actually feeling.That being said none of this has ever caused me any issues externally. I’ve always been good at keeping friends, and my friends never have issues with me. I also hate loosing friends and see having a lot of friends as a flex so. I’m also genuinely interested in their lives. I guess I’m very conscious of how I’m perceived so I make sure not to boast, or put others down to bring myself up, not to show I’m envious of their accomplishments, not to show I think they’re just not as good as me. I’m also not very quick to anger, I’m not vengeful and tend to be relatively resilient. I can brush off criticism relatively easily although I’ve never had anyone say anything genuinely insulting abt who I am as a person so I don’t know how I would respond if they did. Anyway am I a narcissist or am I just going through a quarter life crisis lolNPI -28, codependency- 1, ocd-4. Basically the title. Is anyone here good at hiding their narcissism feelings or tendencies around their friends bc they know loosing friends would be too much of a blow to the ego. Does anyone keep a decent amount friends for a long time without getting bored of them? Does anyone have some interest in their friends lives even if they don’t majorly care?. Ok so what Kim said on that phone call was just wrong, period. But I can’t pretend that I wouldn’t be fed up if I was Kim.For one the whole issue abt d&g made no sense, and the way kourtney kept trying to turn it on Kim and psychoanalyse her to say that she was wrong for being ambitious and wanting to challenge herself was really weird and annoying. Especially when she wanted to have that useless conversation she wrote notes for, only for the notes to not include a single thing abt how she feels and to be basically be trying to give Kim a therapy session and once again imply there’s something inherently wrong with her bc she’s ambitious.Then with the phone call, kourtney brings up the looks and aesthetics only to argue that it’s got nothing to do with that two seconds later? Then go straight into calling her egotistical, selfish and attention seeking when the conversation up until that point had been relatively civil, and accuse her of not being happy for her at her wedding. I’m mot surprised Kim snapped when kourtney has been implying for ages that Kim is fundamentally flawed and unfulfilled for wanting to challenge herself.As an older sister I understand it can build resentment watching a younger sister become more “successful” than you, but I’d never demonise my younger sister for wanting to be successful. And the therapy doesn’t seem to be helping bc that’s the kinda thing they should be working on. If kourtney is as fulfilled and focused more on what truly matter than money as she claims, why did the d&g thing even matter? And why does it matter that Kim wants to challenge herself?. Just took my first dose of propranolol and now I’m freaking out thinking it’s going to kill me. Which is literally so stupid bc I have previously been on this medication for months and I never died. Like I can think logically but for some reason never believe it.If anyone is struggling with health anxiety I highly recommend Cherellethinks on YouTube. Her entire channel is dedicated to health anxiety talking abt her experience with it, physical symptoms from it, specific fears, tips on how to overcome it. She has loads of videos explaining basically every symptom you can think of and how anxiety can cause it. Her videos have actually helped me so much bc the more you understand health anxiety the easier it is to overcome.Ok so for the past month or so I’ve just had this semi constant dizzy/vertigo feeling, like I’m on a boat, or walking on a mattress, or like the ground underneath me in generally unstable. From what I’ve seen on here it’s not uncommon with anxiety but does anyone have any suggestions on how to get rid of it? I’ve seen ppl say that just trying to ignore it is the only way but its like trying to ignore a mosquito buzzing in my ear.I find myself frequently forgetting to do things I’m supposed to do often like ask the name of the person I’m speaking to on the phone, mention booking fees in emails etc. I tried putting post it notes on my computer to remind me but they kinda just blend into the background of my desk so I don’t notice them (if that makes sense).Ok the title probably doesn’t make much sense. Basically since March I’ve developed really bad health anxiety. I’ve always been a generally anxious person but this health anxiety especially the physical effects it has on me, isn’t like anything I’ve experienced before. In the past month I’ve gone from thinking I had a heart problem, to thinking I had Ms, to thinking I was going to have a psychotic break I’d never recover from, to some weird existential crisis, to thinking some medication has permanently damaged my brain. Anyway today I was worried that I wasn’t going to find a group for this uni group project. And it’s weirdly relieving that I even have the energy to worry abt uni. Given my anxiety at its worse causes me to completely disregard uni bc “what’s the point if I’m going to die”, the fact im worried abt is a pretty good sign. Hoping I get back to a point in my life where my anxiety is just over first world problems.Anyone else kinda worried abt when they’ll eventually have to move out of home? I’m 21 still living with my parents and they basically do everything for me (thank the lord). They do my washing, cook me dinner, do groceries, my dad even drives me to work. I actually don’t know what I’d do without them. How would I ever manage to do my own washing if I can’t even put my clothes away after my mum washes them? How am I going to feed myself every day if I struggle to make myself lunch? How am I supposed to get to work on time if I’m 15mins late every day my dad can’t drive me? How am I supposed to do the dishes if I can’t even remember to put my dishes in the sink? How am I supposed to keep a house clean if I can’t even keep my room clean? Not to mention paying bills, grocery shopping, house maintenance etc. And honestly I don’t know how much longer my parents will put up with me 😂. F21So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days? Is it safe to quit?I would ask my doctor but I can’t see her for another couple of days and I want to quit asap bc the longer I wait the more withdrawal symptoms I’ll get.So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days?. Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better. However now I’m scared of what happens when I eventually go off the meds. I’ve spent the entire day scrolling through “survivingantidepressants.org” and now I’m scared that the meds are going to permanently alter my brain and that if I ever try to go off I’ll have to endure months to years of withdrawal symptoms. Is this just my health anxiety talking or is this an actual valid concern? I’m tempted to stop now before I develop a physical dependency.Some extra context I only have very mild anxiety until March this year when I started spiraling thinking I had some terminal disease. Doctor said I had health anxiety. The anxiety subsided a bit over July but came back mid august. The main reason I wanted anxiety meds is bc I found it so hard to deal with the physical symptoms that came with the anxiety.Anyway if anyone has any advice, or can share their experience going through withdrawal that would be greatly appreciated.Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better.

It’s my 7th day on 25mg and I still have pretty bad brain fog, dpdr and just feel tired. Should I go up to 50mg or stay on 25mg until the side effects pass? Ideally I’d just go up to 50mg and get the side effects over and done with but I have to go to work and uni and if going up to 50mg makes the brain fog worse then I don’t know how I’ll manage.TLDR: my health anxiety keeps trying to tell me that these are brand new symptoms that I’ve never felt before when I know that I felt the same way last time I went into an anxious spiral.So I suffer from health anxiety, which got really bad abt 5 months ago where I basically spent an entire month thinking I had brain cancer. During that time I physically felt the worst: headaches, dizzy, fatigue, really bad derealisation which also made me feel like there was something wrong with my vision (there wasn’t I went to the optometrist), I kept feeling like I was seeing flashes of light or that my vision would black out for a millisecond (it was probably me just blinking 🙄), numbness down one side of my body, tingling, muscle twitches and jerks, a weird pressure at the back of my head and for some reason and ache in my leg. These all disappeared gradually after I got a clear mri back.Recently I’ve gone into another anxious spiral, started with vertigo which I thought was caused by the propranolol I take for my headaches, so I stopped taking it, which caused me to think I’d given myself heart problems, then I thought I had ms. Went to the doctor and she prescribed me sertraline. I know it’s supposed to make anxiety worse before it makes it better but I’m spiraling thinking I’ve permanently altered my brain, or that I’m going crazy. The derealisation is back in a big way, so is the numbness, pressure in the back of my head, tingling, muscle twitching and jerks. Anyway it’s like my brain can’t seem to wrap it’s head around the fact that I’ve been through all this before, that it was just anxiety, and that it passed when the anxiety got better. I feel like this is some brand new experience that I’ll never recover from even though I’ve been through this before and did get through it. I keep thinking “this is the worst I’ve ever felt” when I know for a fact it isn’t.Best way I can describe it is that I feel like I’m high. I’ve heard that sertraline works for depression before it works for anxiety and that anxiety gets worse before it gets better and I think that’s exactly what’s happening to me. I simultaneously feel happier and more anxious, basically how I feel after smoking. The same kind of emotional roller coaster of “I feel fine this is great” to “what if I never feel sober again” to questioning my own existence and the meaning of life. The kind of feeling where you’re mostly ok but constantly worried that you’re teetering on the edge of loosing your mind. Also feeling like I’m in a dream/ seeing everything through virtual reality glasses, dpdr feeling. Anyway I’m trying to stay positive and look at it as just a free high but I hate feeling like this 24/7, especially considering I have to study and go to work. Anyone else felt the same? And when does it go away bc I have uni tests soon and im finding it hard to concentrate while I feel like this😭Note I’m on this for health anxiety and some mild derealisation which is likely just a side effect of the anxiety.Ok so I started 25mg of sertraline 3 days ago for anxiety and the past two days have been alright, but today my anxiety has been way worse. I’m also getting pretty bad derealisation. I’ve had mild derealisation often from anxiety, but this time it seems to come with depersonalisation? Like I’ll look at my hand and I feels like I’m looking at someone else’s hand, as tho there’s some disconnect between me feeling what my hand is doing and me seeing what my hand is doing. It’s also making my anxiety wayyyy worse and sometimes I worry I’m going crazy or will never be the same again (catastrophising I know😂). Anyway did any of you have a similar experience and how long did it take to get better?. So obviously not everything has to have a point but is there any reason Daenerys is called Daenerys stormborn/ was born during a storm other than it being a fun fact and cool sounding name? As far as I know there isn’t any recurring motif of storms during her story, it isn’t related to any prophecy, it doesn’t have any symbolism etc. It is also more symbolic of house Baratheon in the same way fire is symbolic of house targeryen, winter symbolic of stark and gold symbolic of Lannister, so it seems weird that her nickname sounds more like a Baratheon nickname than a targ one. Does anyone have any theories on why it was included? Do you think it will be relevant later in the story?. Basically I have had pretty bad health anxiety for the past 6 months. When I get into an anxious spiral of thinking I have something I always get physical symptoms too. At the moment I’m getting pretty bad vertigo/dizziness. Like I feel as tho I’m on a boat and everything is moving slightly, and just a generally unsteady feeling as tho the ground I’m on could fall away at any moment. I went to my doctor and my blood test is fine, had an mri a few months ago which was fine, and she said there was nothing wrong with my ears. She prescribed me sertraline and I took it for a few days then started getting really bad side effects so I went off it. Has anyone else experienced this? Did medication help? Should I just push through the side effects?. Ok so I starting Sertraline 4 days ago for health anxiety. It was fine for the first 4 days, some anxiety, clenched jaw and sore eyes (could be unrelated) as a side effect but nothing major. But last night I randomly remembered that suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self harm were also a possible side effect and I just had this thought of “what if that happens to me and I hurt myself ”, and then my next thought was “you just thought abt it so it is happening to you”. Anyway ever since last night I keep having these recurring thoughts of self harm and it’s scaring the shit out of me bc never in my life have I ever thought abt it and really don’t want to hurt myself. I didn’t take the medication this morning bc I was scared it was going to make me loose my mind or something. Im booked into see my doctor in 2 days.Anyway has this happened to anyone else? Did these intrusive thoughts go away? It might just be one of those things where I’m scared of thinking abt something so i can’t stop thinking abt it so was I overreacting to stop taking the meds? Is it just my health anxiety convincing me I have mental health problems this time the same way it convinces me I have physical health problems? Is it even thinking abt self harm or is it just like intrusive anxious thoughts considering I don’t actually want to self harm at all and even the thought of it gave me a panic attack.Edit: if this is just a short term side effect I’d be fine to wait it out but, and this is probably just my delusional anxiety brain speaking again, I’m scared these intrusive thoughts will never go away.Some ppl believe that Rhaegars actions were misunderstood and that once we find out the real story and the real intentions behind his actions he’s going to be a way more sympathetic character and we’re all going to view him as some tragic hero. But I genuinely can not think of any big reveal that would make me like rhaegar as a person. If it follows the same “they were actually in love” story the show does it just makes him look stupid, reckless and irresponsible. If they pull some “he heard a prophecy and he thought he had to have a child with Lyanna to save the world” it just makes him look stupid and slightly delusional. How he treated Elia was shitty in literally any context. Unless it’s revealed that the whole time he was possessed by the three eyed raven I don’t see myself liking him. But is there any situation you could see yourself liking rhaegar?. So the great council that favoured viserys over rhaenys setting the precedent that any male relative would be favoured over a daughter. However was this precedent broken when all the lords swore fealty to rhaenyra over daemon? Obviously many would’ve preferred a son over rhaenyra but aegon wasn’t alive at that point so it’s kinda irrelevant.The other question is would targeryen precedent even matter? For every single other house in Westeros (as far as I know) a daughter would come before an uncle, eg. Cersei inheriting over kevan. Would the Baratheons stick to their rules of inheritance or would they follow the targ inheritance rules bc it’s the iron throne?Edit: another question? Say Robert dies without naming either as his heir would stannis ever swear fealty to the daughter? I know he considered rhaenyra a usurper so does this mean he would see his own claim as stronger?. Ok so watching hotd made me think abt how differently we view rhaenyra, her bastards and Alicent vs how we view Cersei, her kids and Ned. The difference probably just comes down to joffery being horrible but my question is what if he wasn’t. What if he was the picture perfect child, someone who would likely become one of the best kings in history. Would we still view Ned as this paradigm of honour, truth and righteousness? Also what if Joffrey didn’t exist and it was tommen who took the throne after Robert died? How would that change how we view things?. Ok I’m confused abt what the point of the hairnet was. Wouldn’t it have been easier and less risky for whoever poisoned joffery to just keep the poison crystal in their pocket or something? I assume they didn’t search everyone at the door, and if it was ollena who got the crystal when she fixed Sansa’s hairnet she would have had to keep it in her pocket for a while anyway. Also if anyone saw her breaking a crystal off Sansa’s hairnet it could look a little suspicious, so why take the risk and go through the hassle? Am I missing something?. I cannot stand when I hear ppl (mainly dany and sometimes Jon Stan’s particularly the ones on tiktok and tumblr ) try to argue about who the main character is or who is the titular character. I swear these ppl actually read a different series. Why would grrm create 24 povs, and a ridiculous amount of plotlines if the story was about one person saving the world. Why are they trying to reduce every other character to a side character and every other plot to a subplot. Also when they try and say the title is about a character, the ice and/or fire isn’t a person, it’s a broad plotline, a theme, an opposing force, a recurring motif.Ok rant over 😂. I hear ppl saying “she was homeless she was starving” etc. but was there ever a point where her and viserys were actually living on the streets?Ps: I haven’t read adwd yet so don’t get mad at me for not knowing. So GRRM said in an interview somewhere that there was 3 general plot lines: the “ice” plot line which is the wall, the others, the nights watch, bran etc., the “fire” plot line which is essos, slavers bay, dany and the dragons, then the kingslanding politics and war of the 5 kings plot line. Which out of the three is your favourite?Personally I prefer the kingslanding wot5k plot, and the essos and wall ones kinda bore me sometimes. Is that just me or is that a popular opinion?. I’ve seen a lot of posts recently comparing Daenerys to other characters recently and I think a lot of the arguments are pretty stupid.Basically most of the arguments go something like “when **insert evil character** does evil thing it’s not mad but when dany does it it is. “To me it’s not abt the actual action that make dany mad, it’s that her actions don’t match her words and the person she sees herself as. She constantly refers to herself as a liberator, a breaker of chains. She claims she wants to “break the wheel” and stop the cycle of powerful families fighting over the throne at the expense of ordinary ppl (which was a little dumb in itself bc she was just another powerful family fighting for the throne but anyway). Her entire thing was that she was different, that she was nothing like the ruthless tyrants who came before her, and that she was going to build a new and better world. However she then started doing things that went against this. Yes forcing ppl to kneel or die isn’t unusual at all, joffery did it after the battle of the Blackwater, stannis did it to mance etc. But she was supposed to be different, and there’s nothing liberating abt being told to submit or die. Now that in itself doesn’t make her mad, not being a liberator isn’t a sign of madness. The issue was that she didn’t change her view of herself to match her actions. She was still convinced she was a liberator and that she was nothing like the previous rulers despite doing the same thing. The madness was the disconnect between her actions and how she viewed herself not the actions by themselves.Ppl don’t consider Tywin or Arya or whoever else she gets compared to mad, bc their view of themselves is accurate. Tywin is not deluding himself into thinking he’s some messiah who’s come to liberate ppl. If he was he would 100% be considered an absolute basket case.Personally I wasn’t a huge fan of her going “mad”, I think it would’ve been better to see her make a conscious rational decision to be more ruthless and ditch the whole “break the wheel” thing.Also rant: I find it so stupid when ppl say stuff like “no one hated Cersei when she blew up the sept” “no one hated Tywin when he wiped out the reynes” bc those are literally some of the most hated ppl in the entire series, anyone who does like them likes them as a character not as a person.Ok so this guy decides he wants to get rid of Cersei and marry his middle aged fat abusive brother to a 16yr old. He decides the best way to do this is to convince his brother that the 16yr old looks like his ex crush who died almost 2 decades ago. He then goes up to the brother of the dead girl and straight up asks “hey does this girl look like your dead sister?” And he’s doing all of this bc he wants to suck off the 16yr olds brother.Then his brother dies and he decided he wants to make himself king seemingly just for the lols bc he has absolutely no claim.I mean obviously I’m simplifying it a lot and probably got some parts wrong but damn that’s absolutely deranged behaviour.Does anyone have any theories on how jaqen h’ghar ended up a prisoner? How does a faceless man get captured, they’re supposed to be the best assassins in the world it would be almost impossible to catch one. Was it part of some greater plan?. Ned bringing him back to winterfell would’ve been a huge risk if he looked like a textbook targeryen so would he have taken the risk and made up some story abt the mother being from Lys or something or would he have found somewhere else for Jon to live?. Obviously bran became the most useless and boring character when he came back from beyond the wall but the most annoying part was that his storyline and character development could have been super interesting. The idea of a young boy who all of a sudden has access to literally all information in the entire world has so much potential. I would’ve loved to see him struggle to figure out what to do with all the info, what to tell and what to keep secret, what is useful and what is useless, what is possibly an abuse of his powers and where should he draw the line on what he can and can’t do, struggle to actually convince ppl that he isn’t just making this all up, and realising that knowledge is unless you know what to do with it. Showing him as a young boy who’s is completely overwhelmed by all this info would have been so much more interesting than whatever tf they turned him into. It also didn’t make sense because knowing things doesn’t necessarily make you wise, so why did he all of sudden become a genius.Obviously it was an incredibly messed up “relationship” as dany was basically sold to him as a minor and assaulted, and she seemed to have some sort of Stockholm syndrome from it as she mostly looked back on him in a positive light and cared for him. What I hated was that they never showed her looking back and realising how messed up it was, and what a shitty, abusive person he was. They do have her speak abt the experience negatively in s7 when she first meets Jon, but then go back on that by having her talk to Sansa abt how he was one of the 2 men she’s ever loved. Which was just weird and contradictory. Showing her looking back positively on the relationship undermines how traumatising and horrible it was, and going through something like that would still be negatively impacting her. It gave a similar vibe as sansa’s “I’m grateful for my trauma” shit which was gross.To Tywin, his golden child as king would be the dream, and he could be hand. So he’d probably consider Jaime getting off the throne as the missed opportunity of a lifetime.
    It is useful terminology in my life and I was about to use the phrase and thought maybe it is offensive now. If you can use it who is socially allowed to use it?. This is controversial to say hence why I put a trigger warning, but I have no other way of explaining it. Do know if I am offensive, it is because I am trying to be truthful and well am neuroatypical maybe autistic.I have gender dysphoria and there is a scientific theory that there are two types of gender dysphoria in trans people who were born male.One type is the stereotypical hyper feminine from birth homosexual and the other type are non homosexuals attracted to being women which over time can cause worsening gender dysphoria. (note this theory hypothesizes about 3% of the born non homosexual males are autistic I am not saying they are all autistic or anything)I know I do find the idea of being a hot girl, hot.Throughout my life I have wanted to be other males I have looked up to.Just today I saw a transformers clip and imagined embodying one of the transformers thinking it would be cool to fly around and fight like that.It got me wondering if there was a connection between me wanting to be other people/things in a non sexual way and wanting to be female in a sexual way. I have also been questioning if I am autistic, with good reason as I have lived life clearly disabled but was diagnosed with something vague. I felt like wanting to be a transformer was kind of autistic and it got me thinking if people diagnosed with autism think in a similar way (want to be cool things).&#x200B;&#x200B;Do you often fantasize about being different people/things in a non sexual way and if so do you imagine being other people/things in a sexual way?. I have this disability that looks a little like Autism/ADHD [What is Non-Verbal Learning Disorder? | Child Mind Institute - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_ZkXeOT0Uk&ab_channel=ChildMindInstitute)I don't understand why something so serious wouldn't be in the DSM-5. Is it one of those kinds of fake disorders?In this case I would guess if it is fake, they use a fake disorder due to autism stigma.I am not sure of the exact details but I was diagnosed with NVLD as a little kid. My parents were told to put me on Ritalin but they did not.Growing up I was a "special kid" lowest of the low social status unable to handwrite etcI wonder if I would have been better or worse with it and or if I should take it now?. I've been reading the manga books and I on book 8 of the original dragon ball series so I am already seeing the "cannon" so to speak.I was thinking of also watching the show I don't like that the dub will presumably remove things such as rude jokes but I also find it annoying having to read subtitles.Should I watch dub or sub and why? Please don't consider my above preferences for the most part and just say what is better.I have a learning disability called non verbal learning disorder. On top of other things one symptom is to do with bad visual/spacial iq. I scored 70 on that. Unlike say someone with high functioning autism I'm not smart. My overall iq is 97.A guy I know with evidence claimed he increased his iq (if I recall right) by 13 points by playing an intense brain training game consistently over 2 years. Said game being quadnback not to be confused with square and back.Recently I got a condition that worsens over time. It's probably too controversial to talk about.I feel stuffed right now and I think if it were possible to raise iq it would be a good hand to play.I was diagnosed with NVLD when I was a little kid so I assume I have a fairly strong version of it to be noticed young.I think it effects social skills less but makes you struggle more in different intellectual capacities.The other day I read autistic people often lack motor skills so they walk differently, can't really play sport, handwrite etc This sounds like me and I thought it was a NVLD thing.Does anyone here have thoughts to do with NVLD vs autism?I get the sense maybe they are slowly redefining autism to cover NVLD.I ticked off a covert narcissist back in the day and I have seen them pretending to be me on the internet. They leave a kind of plausible deniability where it looks like me, but the accounts never admit to being me.Is this an attempt to slander me or more so impersonate me as a form of passive aggression? Have you done something like this before and why (were you covert or overt)? I know only narcissists are allowed to post here I may be a narcissist which is why I ended up ticking him off. I am socially retarded with some of my narcissism coming from being treated like a retard and not accepting myself (because I hated my disability and other things).Deleted txt More or less some guys sleep with 100+ girls a year could this out compete AGP as your AGP might be like one girl?. I haven't transitioned but I haven't lived as a man for over 5 years.Strengthening autogynephilia and worsening gender dysphoria has put me in the situation where I just frankly can't be my male self and all my male dreams are completely dead by now.It is like I have 3 personalities.Current fake self, I live as some kind of shut in depressed nerd but that doesn't feel like the real me.Motivated, sex focused, extravert that has a dash of narcissism. This is the real male me and the boy inside trapped under a damaged life and dysphoria is crying out today. I have reflected on some past memories and dreams it feels almost traumatic losing them.Female self, the woman I want to be which I suppose the more I think about it doesn't differ too much from the real me. In that I want to be much more sexual than typical women, social and more attractive than anyone else.&#x200B;The boy inside me mostly gone, it is very much the case that I almost always want to be a woman and this is a kind of flare up that happens from time to time.Regarding my post a couple days ago [Reading Death Note in Real Time: A Leap Year Synchronization and LARPing Experiment : deathnote (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/deathnote/comments/16uddnn/reading_death_note_in_real_time_a_leap_year/)My reddit account is presumably too new and too low in karma to set up a subreddit. Upon making a discord twice it was shut down for sus activity. Maybe due to being a new account.To get the ball rollingCan someone please create a discord server and if they plan on doing so comment under this post so we don't double up. Then post a permanent invite link.It would also probably be a good idea if someone did the same in regards to forming a subreddit.Hey everyone! As a dedicated Death Note fan, I had an idea that I think could add a fun twist to how we enjoy the series. Have you ever noticed that the date in the manga is close to today's date, albeit in a different year? Well, here's the kicker: if we start this journey soon, our upcoming leap year will align perfectly with the leap year timeline in the manga. This means that for the entire run, the dates will never be out of sync!The plan is simple: read Death Note in real-time. Each day in our lives will correspond to a day in the manga, and we'll keep up this pace until the story ends. To make it more immersive, I propose that we engage in a bit of LARPing (Live-Action Role Playing) as well. We can divide ourselves into various factions, such as Team Kira or Team L, and discuss daily developments from our assigned perspectives. This could entail sharing what our chosen faction knows, what their strategies might be, and so on.Now, the big question is how this subreddit would feel about daily posts. I understand that this could be a lot, so if it seems overwhelming for this space, I’m open to forming a separate community/group/subreddit dedicated to this unique experience.Lastly, a quick note: I got a little help from GPT-4 in writing this post. My English isn't the best, so I wanted to make sure my idea came across clearly. So, what do you think? Would anyone be interested in embarking on this real-time Death Note journey with me?Best, Substantial\_Gap\_872. Ron Iddles said a well-known crook told him that Norman Leung Lee did it and was crossdresser owning a collection of school girl clothes. Mr Cruel stole girl clothes from his victims and also told one victim he had "a school girl fantasy".&#x200B;Additional info I have that others including police may not know. I have this background info due to having gender dysphoria. For every attraction there is a potential attraction to being.The most obvious example being what I have inverted male heterosexuality. Most western trans women (90%) are sexually attracted to being the other sex this why MTF who are not hyper feminine homosexuals develop gender dysphoria.[Information for Health Care Professionals | On the Science of Changing Sex (wordpress.com)](https://sillyolme.wordpress.com/information-for-health-care-professionals/) &#x200B;Due to every attraction having a potential attraction to being. Being your own erotic target also causes inversions of paraphilias such as wanting to be another race, age, remove limbs wanting to be an animal etc.I suspect Mr Cruel is an auto pedophile aroused by girl clothes.&#x200B;He gets accused of being a crossdresser by an informant and he stole the clothes of underage girls which is just a perfect match. Stealing their moms/sisters clothes and secretly crossdressing is not uncommon behavior amongst people attracted to being women when they are young and may not realize crossdressing is actually turning them on/their behavior is wrong. &#x200B;I suspect there may be tons of behaviors associated with his sexuality that occurred in his life.
    I had BPD for many years but with time there's a lot of improvements , most of the symptoms are gone, I'm pretty stable, but still close relationships are not easy...I'm taking meds. I've reduced my risperidone(an antipsychotic) somewhat...and I've noticed my arrogance and my spoken narcissistic traits increased , while with full risperidone dose I was mostly internally narcisstic - just comparing myself to others in things I'm strong at and seeing how I was better.This(and more aloofness , and less rejection sensitivity ) of course made my relationships easier, much easier , but I've also been much more silent and withdrawn. And of course I've enjoyed life less, less motivation ,etc.So now I'm thinking maybe increasing the dosage... Maybe i could even find a partner... Idk. So I'm curious , how was your experience with meds regarding narcissism?.

And at least anecdotally(but it already happend 3 times in the span of 10 years, and in some of the cases it was diagnoses only due to luck) , from what happened to people around me, there seem to be a big delay, a few years, in detecting cancer and between the first big complaint and the first imaging being done.

    Besides being a malignant narcissist. When my grandmother died (my mom's mother) in the middle of the night and we got a call and they wake me immediately in the sound of my mother and sisters crying. I got up and walked to the room and behind me I heard my father shouting (in Arabic) something in the meaning "that's it. She's dead" to tell my mother and sisters to stop crying.My mother told us that in the same week after the funeral she was crying, mourning the death of a parent. And my father was walking by and he found her crying and screamed at her to stop.When I was 16, last year of highschool, I missed an unannounced morning pre school hours class. The teachers found some students who came early and decided to give them a 20 minutes lecture. When my father found out I missed it he yelled and hit me in the eye and literally directly called me worthless and exactly said why are we paying for your education and we are wasting money. And then went to work without driving me to school. I had to walk and arrived late. I was literally the top of the class and for many years. I was studying in the gifted school.I'm a bad person I know that but I will never scream in my wife mourning her mother. I know how to comfort a friend even if I don't feel it emotionally. I do it because cognitively I know it's right. Even if I didn't feel sad about my grandma dying and I had to force myself to cry by mental gymnastics because I thought it's the appropriate. I won't do such thing as my father and I don't care if that's a mask or being covert or even communal. My father never loved me. The only thing close to love is being a narcissistic supply for him when I scored high iq and entered the gifted program in 4th grade and came on top of the class. He got to brag about how amazing the school is to all our relatives. My mom said he never payed attention to me till I got to gifted school. I'm his favourite because I'm smart and well educated and highly interested in politics (he's a successful politician). I'm his favourite and I'm the one most affected by him as his only son. He did pay attention to me and therefore I got abused more. He neglected my sisters and was distant. The message I got from him is that if I'm not perfect then I'm worthless. I wish I was not his favourite.My father is a malignant narcissist according to my therapist. And I have npd according to her.Talking about the big five model. I read that a research found they can have hard time managing anxiety. They are also known for their severe rage and anger (and anger is one of the six facets of neuroticism) and they're hyper sensitive to criticism which I believe the reason dr Todd Grande said they have some vulnerable narcissism as well. If my theory is right, that what differentiates the malignant narcissist from a psychopath is they can/might have the anxiety facet of of neuroticism. Psychopaths are known for their high anger facet but low anxiety.Personal addition (don't read it necessary):The reason I'm thinking about this is because I have a psychopath profile in the big five, exactly the same in every facet except for achievement striving and anxiety (both high). And the stories that my mother and big sister says about my childhood are stories of a psychopath. I don't know why they didn't take me to a clinician. I think I gave my big sister some trauma and she still fawn me.Scored 20/40 (and 22/44 in another) in psychopathy checklist which is the edge of subclinical/borderline psychopathy (the average between 5 and six). On levenson test I scored 3.3/5 in primary psychopathy and 4/5 in secondary psychopathy. I really don't feel guilt.I got fired by the board from a presidency of a student union for abuse of power. I refused the firing and splitted the union into two unions competing for legitimacy. It's the best thing I ever did and I'm really proud of it which in second thought is weird.My extroversion is higher than the middle but not too high which is weird since I consider myself covert and I have autism (and adhd). It's just weird. My country went to war (civil war) and college is closed. I can't hangout with a lot of women and get the illusion of validation. I discovered all the relationships were superficial and no one checks on me. I have complex ptsd and the narcissistic supply mask my shame and fear but now without it I wake up in an emotional flashback. It's just hell.No amount of confidence, future planning, fantasy, remembering my good or great qualities; no amount can make up for the fact that at this moment of my life I have no supply and right now I'm nothing to the world.I've been meditating a self compassion meditation and mindfulness. When I do both and with a current supply I can read more than 100 page a day but without supply the meditation just reduce my dissociation and numbness and makes me feel all the trauma symptoms directly. I can't even read 5 pages now.I've been trying to work on my trauma by myself since I can't reach my therapist but without supply I can't read or learn skills. I'm almost on a freeze response. I also have adhd and autism and I'm on antidepressants. I don't know what else to say. I always think that if the other person is like me, they will feel they have more power in the relationship. Having power over me is so uncomfortable and triggering since that how I was traumatized in the first place. I'm a fearful avoidant on attachment style and a vulnerable narcissist.I know a lot of people in college. I spend my time with a lot a lot of women. But no-one checks on me on vacations. It's all superficial and honestly I use the time spent with them as a temporary pain killer for the emptiness. Once I leave someone or some group the emptiness comes back. I have diagnosis of both npd and bpd. My narcissism goes back and forth from vulnerable to grandiose and I have parts of both persistent at all times. I'm autistic and narcissistic. The narcissism mask my autism by putting on a show of being intelligent, successful, knowledgeable and creative. And maybe this is the narcissistic thing to say but those things are true but that not all of me. I feel if I became vulnerable I'll lose my image on the person eye of being the high on the league. For me relationships are a game to be won. I need to win the person and have power in the relationship.Pre:Loving kindness meditation or compassion meditation is ancient meditation where you wish love well-being and peace first to yourself then to a loved one, stranger, then to a person you have conflict with and finally to the whole world.Here 18 Science-Backed Reasons to Try Loving-Kindness Meditation: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/feeling-it/201409/18-science-backed-reasons-try-loving-kindness-meditationNow, when i practice it i feel strong intense anger even if I'm wishing peace to a girl that I really like and like me back. It's like the meditation sees through my narcissistic defences and connects me to my inner real self. I usually feel numb but this meditation brought in the past general and social anxiety (like I'm really connected to myself and others so i care about myself truly and about others and what they think) and now it brings sadness and anger. It looks like all my likes and dislikes about people are superficial and just a surface level where in my true level I only have hate and resentment to the a world that I'm entitled to but doesn't give me what I deserve. A despise to everyone which each at least has something I don't have. A desire for revenge towards these ppl who won't really like me if they know who I really am (I'm borderline) and who don't give me the power and recognition over them that i deserve.Npi: 29.
    That's all this is about. I don't really know that there's anything I need answered or want help with in particular. I'll answer questions first so I don't bore you.NPI: 20+ (Not sure how many I hit exactly, the description had a laundry list of bonus scoring. I want to note that several of these questions felt like a "yes" and a "no" simultaneously. A lot of these would switch from "no" to "yes" if I weren't terrified of failure. E.g I would do anything on a dare if it didn't end with me making a fool of myself, and compliments can simultaneously embarrass me, make me feel like a god, and also enrage me that someone would waste my time and point out something so obvious. I imagine if I retook this when I was in a different emotional state I'd get a completely different score, but that'd jeopardize the ability to answer this properly.)Codependency: 7OCD: 5 I swear more than I'd like to.I am self-righteous and vengeful.Yes, I can shut off my empathy. Whether it's voluntary or not depends. If you piss me off the answer is very much a yes, same story if you scare me or embarrass me, but the latter tend to be automatic responses. There have been times where I've been outside, ripping invasive insects limb by limb without a care in the world, only to suddenly think "OH FUCK WHAT IF SOMEONE SEES WHAT I'M DOING AND THINKS I'M A SERIAL KILLER" and I feel so ashamed I stop.**Here's where the stream of consciousness starts.**I've done such a good job at displaying a powerpoint presentation of how fine I am that it's become impossible to be heard when I try and say I'm doing terribly. If I could be honest to people about this where it mattered, I'd be too ashamed to speak to them again. And hell, even when I can be vulnerable and when I can open up to them and be totally honest about what I'm thinking, it doesn't always feel like it meant anything. Nothing I do or say is enough. Not enough to nail down precisely how I'm feeling. I didn't articulate it well enough for their empathy, or they didn't respond correctly, or I'm pissed that they actually cared at all. Admitting this in a way that isn't beautifully poetic and flowery makes me undeserving of compassion. There's always a disconnect from me, and my words. A wall between me and them. It's nothing, and it's everything. It's so annoyingly difficult to explain. And these rants typically end because I just stopped caring. Some sentence of mine was particularly pleasing. It clicked. There was nothing more for me to say, and suddenly all my problems are irrelevant. Solved. It was so silly that they ever bothered me at all.I don't consistently relate to myself and my behaviors. It's incredibly jarring. How I present myself to others is an inconsistent mess and I lie so much I've started to hurt my self-trust. Every presentation is an experimentation, none of them are good enough to please myself. There's no "Just me." I come in different flavors, and no matter what, a percentage of the population is allergic. I seem to be with them, a proponent of some mental autoimmune disorder. My mind is this contradictory mess of feelings that don't make sense existing simultaneously, of how I desperately want to act, how I course correct for how I'm supposed to act to avoid being an asshole, and then there's just this crippled, floppy thing in my brain that is desperately shuffling around like a snake having a seizure because it is horrified of making a fool of itself. Last time I did something stupid to a stranger in public by accident I just about had a panic attack. I didn't go outside for the next few days. I still haven't walked down that street again and it's been months.I've noticed I trend toward caring because if I don't do something I'll look bad. There's laser focus on me, how I feel. "I can't believe I did that, I must look so terrible, what if someone filmed that, what if it gets posted online.."There's no regard for how that stranger felt. I don't care about that. What bothers me is how I made myself look. He could've eaten pavement and I would've been ashamed that tripping him made me look bad, not that I hurt a random stranger. It was ultimately inconsequential and stupid. I doubt he even cares, but it still makes waves in my brain.I am simultaneously the angriest and most vengeful person on earth, and a I would only be mildly inconvenienced if you set me on fire. I care a lot, about every stupid fucking thing, and I don't care about anything, unless not caring is in my worst interests. I'm also so scared of stupid shit, I could see my own shadow and freak out so hard I'd backflip into a landmine across the world from where I was standing.At least when I fail, I fail spectacularly. That surely amounts to something!I do something perfectly once, that becomes the new standard. Everything gets ruined by perfectionism, otherwise there's something wrong with how I do it. A friend sending me a mission time in a video game that was better than my personal best is what got me to write all this. I was doing great, then someone I knew came along and did better. I can't draw, I can't game, I can't really enjoy myself. I feel intense jealousy over stupid shit like friends telling me they want to try the highest difficulty in games I introduce them to. I'm constantly picking myself apart. If things aren't exactly to my standards, standards I can't recognize or don't even have the faintest fucking clue how to fit, I'll become an anxious mess.So, I'm an anxious mess. Here's more on my empathy.I tend to have people in a sort of hierarchy. I don't know how much of this is normal, and how much of this isn't. If someone falls really low on the spectrum, more toward "enjoying their company" instead of "enjoying them" I won't feel guilt for what I did to them in a conventional sense. (If they don't fit either of these, that means they're very annoying and I try my best to not talk to them at all. Yes, that's harsh, but I'm far less mean if I avoid people who piss me off.)I can be friends with someone for months without realizing they see me that way until they tell me. Their feelings will be one-sided, and I will enjoy their company, but not them as a person. If we have a falling out, I will be focused on how my behavior made me look to everyone else, not how I hurt them.Then there's people I see above me. These people are the ones I tend to fucking despise. Pretty easy to hate people who are capable of shaking up your life if they decide they want to.I like bugs, animals that aren't annoying me or dangerous, people I see in passing that aren't tied to a humiliating experience. Everything is interesting until it inconveniences me. Then there's people I care about. People I love. They might move around in that hierarchy in my head, but it usually takes some serious shit for me to just stop caring about them, and that tends to be a temporary response.I can look at someone, tell them my favorite parts of them, things they could improve about themselves, but in moments where they've hurt me, they are the vilest creatures in the world, even if I know deep down they're not. I have black-and-white emotions paired with gray thoughts.I really don't want to hurt the people I love. And I'm sick and tired of being scared to ask for help or be honest with them because I'm afraid it will result in a character assassination. I know my violent thought patterns, apathy, whatever, aren't normal. Rather than getting rid of them or solving them I've just buried them. I can't just silence that misery in the back of my head purely because it's socially unacceptable.I'm terrified that hiding my thoughts and feelings will become more difficult. That the people I care about will find out about who I am at my worst and take off. That life will never get better. That I'll sacrifice answers in exchange for safety or the ability to receive medical treatment. I can't be open with them about myself, and I still struggle to accept that my concerns about my narcissism are even founded in reality.And what am I even supposed to do? It doesn't matter how much I don't want to hurt people if they can make me too angry or wounded and I just stop caring about them. At my worst I am horrifying. I can be a great person 80% of the time, but if I'm an asshole 20% of the time, they're well in their right to leave. Thanks for reading this to the end. I may delete my account, purely because of how embarrassing this is. It can be our secret.
    Update edit: his ear wound is looking less inflamed today. I was worried since it had not improved in 3 days... but it also had not worsened. I caught my other cat in a fight that punctured his ear yesterday morning as well. I'm not sure it was the same other cat for both fights but, the wounds are the same and the level of conflict is new. The other cat I saw yesterday was my neighbor's outdoor cat (he never took to the litterbox). They are all about the same age, neutered, and have been getting along for almost 2 years. I'm not sure what changed. I've been trying to keep my boys in more while Wildlife does winter prep and do the same in the spring. I hadn't seen any feral cats in almost a year. Maybe they are migrating closer to houses for the cold weather? Neutered Male domestic housecat age 2.5, Southeast.Cat ear damage https://imgur.com/a/EsGXCwJ3 days ago, my cat came in, looking like he had been in a nasty catfight. The wounds are mostly, if not all scratches and, they seem to be healing up okay. Every time I pet him, I find a new scab and they all appear to be healing fine.He has two wounds on his ear, one is so close to the upper edge, that it tore about a milimeter. I couldn't see that it was separated until the scab was cleaned off. I may need to get that snipped off at the vet if it does not fall off, since I'm worried it could get torn off, causing more damage. It's so minor, I would do it myself but, I don't think I can hold him still enough to garantee not making it worse.The second one seems superficial exterior I have been doing my best to clean it and keep it treated with antibiotic ointment and, I am hoping it only appears inflamed because the ear is so thin. It looks irritated and puffy at the location of the wound and about a half centimeter around it and hasn't changed over the past few days. The blood vessels in the immediate area are a bit more prominent but, otherwise there is no pus, rot or expansion of the inflammation. If it gets worse, obviously I will fly off to the vet but, I'd rather not do "just in case" oral antibiotics.I'm not part of r/raisedbynarcissists anymore because I was terrible at following their rules. I'm here because this might be the most appropriate place for the vent. Additionally, I recently had an interaction with someone, that brought me to the realization that some major behavioral symptoms of CTPSD and Narcissism overlap so well, that I may have been confusing the two for a very long time... Either way, learning about Narcissism got me through the hard stuff and, I'm not sure how much knowing the difference, makes a difference in how people treat people... socially... not medically. To elaborate briefly, it seems like both disorders have a similar reaction to criticism. Onto the story... TW physical assault.It's been 30 years so, I've had time to process my trauma. I've mastered the grey rock. My emotions take a back seat. I've already been through the chaotic n-plosion and 5+ years of no contact, "Missing my mommy," until she started to kind of get it. We are low contact but, I finally gave in to having her visit for a weekend. It's been a decade. At this point, I'm sure my mom is not all there in the head and I don't know if she ever was. She has nothing but time and smokes a lot of weed. I'll smoke with her since it dulls everything else of our time together. Keep in mind, my husband and I are sitting on the sofa together trying to watch a movie instead of having this conversation. For the most part, the visit was nice enough...She was talking about her neighbors and said the lady who just moved in nearby was the same person who lived across the street from us 30 years ago, on the other side of the state so, it's a relatively wild coincidence. At first, I thought, no way. The lady was so old she would need to be immortal to be the same person. No. No. No... It was the middle sister from the other family across the street. "Yes. I remember. That's wild." I was hoping that could be the end of that because I just do not care about the life of the sister of the boy who assaulted me 30 years ago and, I don't need my mom dredging this up to her... She will... if she remembers.This is a time before mobile phones. I knew she was at her boyfriend's bar. If she had left there, she was on her way back to her place or his. The phone book had the numbers, if I had not memorized them yet. She also did leave the number "for the sitter," IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. I was sleeping over at my friend's house because she wanted to get laid.She was trying to get me to remember by asking if I remembered random things in the front yard. I kept saying no. I said, Then she mentioned the name of the boy I was friends with... "I remember. I really just don't want to." Of course, she presses the "why?" I'm tired, high and wishing I had gone to bed an hour ago. Assuming I had told her at some point and, she has selective memory, I just blurted , "You don't remember the one time I slept over at his house and he physically assaulted me?" I just casually spill the tea like I swear we have had this conversation a dozen times and I don't fucking care.Of course, she looks shocked and asks why I didn't call... "I did. many times. For several hours. I was freaking out all night." Then she asked why I didn't come home... "Because I didn't have a key and you were not home." She tells me she was home... As if I didn't look out the window to check 100 times. Nobody was home. She stayed at her boyfriend's house that night. If she was home, she certainly didn't turn on the lights or answer the phone... and if she really was home... You know what you are doing right now, don't you? Narcissists never change.She has this pitiful face on... she puts her head in her hands like she's crying or something. "OH GOD! I DIDN'T KNOW. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING! I just knew you never wanted to go back there again." I'm friends with someone for 2 years and you didn't think you needed to do more to handle a situation for your 7 year old? I reassured her that it was not a sexual assault. He was 6 and pretending he was a Warewolf from some shitty 80s horror movie. I didn't tell her the next 2 paragraphs. My heart wasn't in it. Some sick part of me wants to deadpan play-by-play detail it for her, just to watch her faux grief but, I figure I'd spare my husband.I remember going to the bathroom and starting to wash my hands, when he started banging on the door and screaming like something was very wrong outside. I let him in and closed the door. He told me his sister and her boyfriend came home and, they were werewolves... then he said they turned him into one too... from there, he proceeded to snarl, punch and kick me until I escaped the bathroom... to find everyone living like nothing was happening. I was certain everyone heard what happened and saw me come out crying... Maybe his mom tried to console me for 5 seconds before tending to her little boy. That part is fuzzy. I remember feeling like nobody cared. Nobody wanted to talk to me about it. I remember thinking it was crazy that she didn't get ahold of my mom or figure out how to get me into my own house. He had bunk beds but, I chose to sleep on the sofa. It wasn't even dictated by the adults. It felt like this was... normal in their house... I remember the dad snoring extremely loudly so, I went to his middle sister's room on the furthest side of the house to try and sleep on the floor. She was asleep with the radio on. I was super overstimulated... Regardless of the trauma, there were times when absolutely every noise kept me awake. I basically spent the entire night awake, trying to find a place to be comfortable, which was impossible, periodically calling 3 numbers that never answered, aside from the bar telling me she was not there and checking out the window to see if she was home yet. I just wanted to hug my cats...SHE THEN ASKS if he sexually assaulted me... I told her less than 2 minutes before that it was not the case so, I casually said, "unless you consider kicking me in the cunt repeatedly sexual assault," and of course, she has another dramatic reaction and says she thought she was protecting me from experiencing or witnessing physical violence. I silently think about the times I watched her assault my father.Maybe she asked me what happened when I was 7. She asks the same frustratingly vague question now that she asked then. "What Happened?" Or, more specifically, "Has anyone ever touched you sexually?" Not, "Where did these bruises come from?" Connect the dots. I remember, that when real bad things happened to me, she acted like nothing happened. I remember when pointless, benign things, or things I could cope with happened, she lost her fucking mind. Now that I'm casually dropping this "news" with the same confidence a Porsche driver picks his nose at a stop light,Then she asked me if the boyfriend of one of her girlfriends ever SA'd me because he was a pervert... Honestly No... She asks if anyone else ever did this to me... I think about the guy I moved in with after leaving her, starting fights over nothing, 6' 4," towering over me and screaming in my face. I think about all the guys I didn't give enthusiastic consent. I think about all the things that happened I just say, "no." There is absolutely no point. I can't imagine how a child who "never stopped talking" and overshared everything, managed to miss sharing the time my best friend beat the shit out of me. Was never wanting to see the kid again, a hint? Were the bruises a fucking hint? Wonder why I stopped talking to her? Congrats lady. You win this round. I officially wasted the time writing this to get it out when I had more important shit to do.&#x200B;. How do you know when the dose is right?What is optimal vs. good enough? I just stopped feeling like I was ready to go back to bed, all day every day. Is that it or, is there more? I've been taking stimulants for like, 10 years and haven't played much with the dosage.I was on 30MG Adderal, then 20MG extended release.I just switched to Vyvanse, started at 40, trying 50... I don't know if I should ask for another increase or what.I've been diagnosed as Borderline at least once and was raised (painfully) by a narcissist. Is that permission to post? I'm not in the mood to take 40 questions tests to prove something I already know about myself. I am not a narcissist. I just picked up narcissistic tendencies from my mom.My husband of 13 years has been best friends with a woman (and a few other people) since college so, almost 20 years. He says she saved his life when he was that level of depressed so, he's felt obligated to be there for her in hard times. I trust them together so, if your mind went to "affair," I can assure everyone that is a non-issue. There have been ebbs and flows in the frequency of contact over the years, rare visits (sometimes years without) but, since the pandemic started, we've all done a lot more hanging out virtually. She was married for several years. When we did all hang out in person, we would break off and, I'd hang with her husband, because we are quiet people and, she and my husband are very talkative, loud people... I noticed her husband was often absent from our virtual hangs but, I knew he had hobbies that kept him busy. Sometimes he would make a brief appearance and then go to bed early. We'd hang out maybe once a month if that... If she could be bothered to show up to our 7pm scheduled meeting time before midnight.Over the summer, he told her he wanted a divorce. It wasn't out of nowhere. They had been in counseling for about 2 years. She needed to get out of the house and go on a cross-country friend tour. She stayed with us for the first few days, where we got to witness her shift from, "We knew it was coming. The separation is amicable. It's just an inconvenient time since I'm in transition (read chronically unemployed) and I wish he had waited a little longer," to "I'm going full scorched Earth on this motherfucking piece of shit."The "if that" monthly virtual hangouts became monthly, became weekly, became 2, 3, 4 days a week. I was increasingly noticing extreme contradictory behavior. Her problems were constantly being aired and, it was part of her demand that nobody ever have input or try to help. If you have known someone for a over decade and you would think there is a point where one achieves the level of friendship where there can be more value-added than, "Oh poor you! I'm so sorry everything in your life is a fucking cataclysm." Objectively, the situations are not that bad. Like finding out her ex husband ate at a restaurant that she boycotted after nobody intervened because another patron made her feel uncomfortable once. She found the charge on a credit card and decided it was a personal attack.For someone who demanded an open and honest, radically inclusive, judgement-free zone, she was doing a fuckload of completely unnecessary, harsh judging of others. I first noticed it if we were just watching TV and, whatever, it's just TV people or characters. We have similar interests and began introducing her to some of our other gaming friends. The judgement continued and got to the point where it was feeling like we would have to make choices between who we were going to hang out with, because there was going to be tension, a fight (if someone bit) and the rage quitting had already begun. Of course, I want our friend to thrive and, for years, I had also seen where she was impeding herself but, she didn't. She just kept using her ADHD diagnosis as a crutch for absolutely everything "I'm disabled. My disability." I have ADHD too, I am well aware shit is a struggle but, I don't use it as an excuse to dominate conversations for hours on end and make other people feel like total shit. It became a struggle for me to not address some issues, as hers were beginning to consume my mind in an unhealthy way. I kept hearing about her problems but, couldn't do anything and, they were in my face on a near-daily basis so I finally broke the barrier on one issue. Of course, a simple explanation, for a straightforward situation, is an egregious overstep of personal boundaries that demands an apology but, I did not want to apologize, if the issue is boundaries and she's never once apologized for crossing mine. She was insistent that we talk and, I had tried but, it was never a "we" talk... She would ask me why I felt some way, I would start to explain myself, and she would think I was done and "oh my turn," start to go on about her side of things and get upset if I interrupted her... I knew it wasn't going anywhere and, I've cut narcissists out of my life before. I just left the conversation and blocked her on multiple platforms. She proceeded to bombard my husband with messages, while we were doing other things and, she went on this whole journey of her own that ended with, OP must be having a psychotic episode. We've since ceased all contact. My husband has attempted to salvage their friendship but, after being talked at by her for the better part of 10 hours, getting nowhere, and speaking with a few of their other close, mutual friends... He's said "You can only draw so many lines in the sand before you box yourself in." He says, our relationship is effortless while realizing how much effort he has had to put into maintaining theirs... Of course, he values their friendship but, he doesn't want to spend another 3 hour chunk of his life, listening to her run in circles around this situation.Everyone she knows is recognizing that she sucks up hours of their days, that they could have been doing something constructive while she offloads her problems and demands their full attention. Some just stopped listening. If she can't see what they are doing, they just go on about their business and let her talk in the background. All they can do is say "I'm sorry that happened to you." This woman has been seeing psychiatrists and psychologists on the regular for decades... and there is nothing about herself that needs work. She is permanently disabled but also absolutely perfect.Species: domestic catAge: approx approx 4-6 weeks ("relatively new as of September 11")Sex/Neuter status: intact femaleBreed: just cat... Typical grey/brown TabbyBody weight: 15.7 ozHistory: she has been living outside of someone's home with siblings. Mom abandoned the litter over a week ago and her brother vanished 2 days ago (unknown). She has been living on adult dry and some wet food. She has been socialized to people and had an "auntie" older kitten. I have known her for about 4 hours and she was very active at first. I brought her home and immediately fed her wet kitten food, which she scarfed down a bit over half a can and made her belly very big. I gave her 15-20 minutes to relax with a heat pad before giving her a 100 degree bath with regular dawn to get the fleas off. I got her dry with a hair dryer and she has spent the past 2.5 hours in my sports bra, under a thick blanket, with a heat beanbag, coming back from shivering and having a long series of naps. She wakes up, looks around with her goopy little eyes, thinks about getting out, stretches a paw and passes right back out. I was most concerned because she hasn't pooped and, my experience with kittens around this age, is that they want to poop around pretty much the same time they eat. I've stimmed her back side, just in case and put her in her litter box and nothing. She's had a big day is probably just a tired baby and I'm overreacting to a kitten not pooping after 4 hours in my possession. I have a dewormer but, don't think I can give it to her until she reaches 2 lbs. Of course she will wee a vet soon but, it may be another week or two.Clinical signs: presumed underweight with worms and fleas, yellow eye goop, breathing is okDuration: unsureYour general location: southeastHere eyes had a bit of goop but, were brighter when I got her. I've since cleaned them several times. One time she woke up and they were basically glued shut.TLDR recap: New 21-ish year old neighbor backed into my mailbox, I said it wasn't a huge deal, pointed out how to fix it. We agreed he would that weekend...The update: I didn't hear from him at all that weekend. Come Wednesday the following week, I worked up an itemized list of materials and labor costs and went over to his house to give it to him. Of course he was shocked by the amount. It came to about $500. We said, that's fine. If he doesn't have it, we could go through insurance or, he still has the chance to fix it himself. He was all, "I'm sorry I didn't come tell you. My dad is going to come help me with it this weekend."Saturday, we were working in the yard and saw him come home in a truck packed with 6 people like they had been and were continuing the party. We caught eyes for a second and I heard him say, "Oh Shit." Whatever. There is still Sunday.4:30 PM Sunday, I'm coming to the conclusion that it isn't happening, reach out to him and he says, "Oh Sorry I didn't tell you. Something came up and my dad couldn't make it." So I say we just want to get things done before its too late to make an insurance claim... Wouldn't you know, the response is, "My dad will be here in an hour and a half"So his dad shows up to wipe his ass for him.My mailbox is fixed now.Edit: The Mailbox pics for reddit drama https://imgur.com/a/4Y1VpU5Edit for Clarity: I had just put in 8 hours replacing the post, refurbishing the mailbox, and refreshing the whole garden area around it, in June. My own labor hours of digging in clay and pulling up invasive poison plants were still fresh in my mind. I had zero desire to lift a finger over it again. Yes, the $500 total was petty (so you can save your breath) and, I would have settled for $200 if the kid wasn't willing or capable of putting in the work and attempted to negotiate. He didn't do that but, he did finally call a lifeline. All that mattered in the end was my not having to do any work because someone else screwed up and didn't feel like being a responsible adult.TLDR recap: New 21-ish year old neighbor backed into my mailbox, I said it wasn't a huge deal, pointed out how to fix it.

I do not know how this manager is handling having employees, whether they are having these other manufacturing employees come into their home or, meet them to manufacture at the public storage location. Either way, I try to convince the manager that they should not be turning their own home into a free storage and manufacturing facility if they are not being compensated AND, that if they continue to voluntarily operate like this, the owner of the company will never be motivated to pay for another actual physical location. I've been in the existing facilities. There is no way this is not a huge inconvenience or safety risk.So... Say you work at a company that undervalues your work... Wait... That's not how this one should start...Say you work for a small business that isn't run on militant disrespect... oh... yeah... that's a benefit...Say you work for a small business with a detached leadership that is overly involved yet still somehow has no idea what is going on... meh...OK. Let's say you figured out where the detachment came from and, it was someone in leadership's, very close, personal loss... and you are probably totally going to be noticed for not saying anything...Shit... what do you do when your superior has a death in the family?I feel like the answer should be something along the lines of, about as much as they would do for me...Say a line. Let me take a few days off... Is sending a card too much?&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;. I tried talking to a friend about how they are being difficult to talk to and I'm done expending the mental energy of keeping shit to myself when they have constant fucking crises and never want help. I reached my breaking point and walked away from the situation. They went off on some stream of conscious and came to the conclusion that, I'm having a mental break down and entering psychosis. Nice response to being upset at the assumptions I'm making.No. I'm trying to get you to turn your own judgemental bullshit mirror back on yourself. I'm fucking sick of listening to you judge people, judge me and go the fuck off, at the slightest bit of constructive fucking criticism because of WHEN it comes. I'm sorry for when said something you didn't want to hear but, I'm not sorry I said it and you were never going to want to hear it.Do you hear yourself?How do you not hear yourself?K. Bye.I can't get a pic because it went too high toward the sky for my camera to focus and give color. We are a bit North of Atlanta. The most common web spiders I am seeing are giant orb weavers and Joros... And this was maybe a combination of the two. It had Joro color and pattern plus the interesting exoskeleton angles of a Joro... But the body was shorter, wider and a wee bit rounder.Finally got a pic I could google lens. Arrowhead Spider - Verrucosa arenata. A new neighbor (renter) came by and told me he had backed into my mailbox and asked what I wanted to do. I went out and looked over the damage, it's easily fixable... I didn't feel like it was that big a deal. After I was like, "yeah, its not a full replacement, just fix xyz by doing uvw, no big deal. Work on it this weekend," we parted ways and what not, I realized that was probably a mistake and, I should go through his insurance or ask him for money...On one hand, I recently (3 months ago) refurbished the mailbox and post by using reclaimed materials and painting them. I only spent money on the foundation material, which now needs to be dug up re-poured, about $150 on the plants around it and, if we are going to pour new base, they should be dug up... I must have put in about 12 hours, between digging up monkey grass, digging a new post hole and finishing everything... I should put a value on my time and, I shouldn't expect a (probably 21 year old guy) to actually put in the effort or do a quality job... How do I handle this?. I have a pretty little tortie girl, who is about 5 months old now. She is barely 4 lbs but, healthy and small-framed, like most of the cats in the colony she came from. I picked her up for TNR along with 2 other kittens and a mama cat. She was 3 months old but, immediately different from the others, by the look in her eyes. I ended up realeasing the mom and hanging on to the kittens for a week, to see who I could convert to the life of a housecat. I ended up releasing the other two, who maintained their spice and gave her to another temporary foster, for a week, while I went out of town. I got her back, got her registered with a rescue and she has been up for adoption for about 3 weeks now.She was okay with being held early on but, It was more of a fear freeze than enjoyment. She just didn't fight it. The temporary foster I had her with, had to keep her in a cat condo for quarantine purposes but, she loved to be loved on when she was getting her daily doses of attentions. She still loves being pet, having her back side scratched and purrs particularly hard, but, has decided being held is not for her. Voluntary lap or cuddle times are extremely rare but, not nonexistent. Maybe once a week. She gets along well with my cats and, is very independent, especially for a kitten. After she got used to the house, there was a week where she followed me everywhere and cuddled more frequently but, she has since decided to be her own cat. She plays with toys by herself for hours. She sleeps by herself a lot. She occasionally comes to me for a pet or playtime and food. She plays with but, rarely cuddles up next to my catboys. She is picky about food and, insists on eating my adult cat's prescription food... they swap bowls if I'm not watching. If I lock her in a room alone, she just doesn't eat. The cat who needs the prescription food, throws up anything else and, their good is not high enough in calories to facilitate her development.. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with my handing her off for a week or, another cat I was sitting for a week, who decided they owned the place... I'm pretty sure she was the one who pooped in the dryer and in a pile of clothes (probably around the same time... we got behind on laundry, because my husband absent mindedly to ran clothes in the dryer with poop inside.) I've taken her for a couple of vet check-ups, vaccines and a few trips to adoption day at Petsmart... She hates going in the carrier. She hates transit. She hate's being in the display cage.... She's an overall sweet girl but, she doesnt showcase it when it matters. We don't have much of a connection. I'm finding it difficult to "sell" her personality. Maybe I'm numb from having 8 fosters in a year but, she definitely isn't nearly as clingy as previous fosters. I don't think she needs someone who is home all the time and, I hesitate to think she would be okay as an only cat. I'm sure these aspects are a positive for someone out there... the org has so many torti kittens available right now, she doesn't stick out and, I almost feel guilty that I don't want her and, regret not returning her to her colony. They have a great caretaker... It just happens to be off a busy highway.She's honestly the first foster I've had, that I felt was a perfect fit, for one of my friends, who has been talking about wanting a cat for several years. He has never had one before and, just lost his dog, however he is getting a new job that involves travel and, doesn't want to get a new pet because of it.Any other company I have worked with has had someone whose job was Administrative/IT to set up employee accounts, install software, fill out organizational profiles, set up their phone, link their email IMAP to the CRM and connect their calendar to all the apps that need to read across apps with calendars etc.... basically perform any back-end administrative tasks that most people do not have the technical skill or will to accomplish themselves. I work for a small company. It's "not my job" but, it is within my ability to figure it out. When I had the technical permission to do these things and was aware of their necessity, I did what I could for everyone. If I couldn't do it for them, I'd create a tutorial or walk them through it. Our VP is the "Super Admin" for our business software and is the only person with the ability to set permissions and access within the software. He complains about the"free-for-all" yet, refuses to document, mandate, delegate, or perform the necessary task. He is known for only granting access to certain areas of the software (when his boss tells him) and, revoking access, whenever he feels like it, resulting in a lot of necessary back-end administrative tasks not being done. He shared a screenshot on how to access an area and what needed to be updated... The issue is that none of us have permission to view, let alone update the information, regardless of our ability... Even if I were to get permission to update something in an individual app, it doesn't matter across the platform, because it isn't linked between the apps, at a level to which only he has access... I can send him a screenshot of the error saying something like "Only Super Admin can perform this action," or "you do not have permission to access this. Contact your administrator." It doesn't matter...Right now, we need to reset several connections because they randomly break... Email, CRM, Calendars, Scheduler, etc. so people can use this system the way it needs to be used. The problem is, that he expects everyone to set it up or fix it for themselves. Using the argument, "If we do it for them. They will always expect us to do everything for them..." Well, for the past 15+ years the result is broken things stay broken. I haven't been here that long but, I fixed what I could when I came in.I have his ear, to some degree and, I have the competency to accomplish the task but, he doesn't like to work with me because I am "combative and fight him all the time..." Nobody here gets fired or written up, they just get reprimanded for not doing a thing and get told to do it over and over. There are no teeth so, nobody bothers. I went into an application because I wanted to update the verbiage on something I did over a year ago and, found my permission had been revoked... I don't know how to express to this person... that doing these things is their job, because they insist on being the only person with the capacity to do it... I have NO PROBLEM being the person to do it but, if he doesn't want me to, I can't do anything about it.I'm so tired of this battle...&#x200B;. \*\*\*Ultimately, I need objective accounting assistance in deciding which plan makes the most sense LONG-TERM. I need objective accounting, based on the options in current circumstances, not opinions or suggestions on what I should do differently.\*\*\*You might be thinking, "Why doesn't OP just ask their loan servicer or the DOE for clarification?" I do not have the words to express my frustration with why they cannot provide that clarification. Basically, I owe the government an amount of money they can't figure out to be paid over an unclear amount of time, and just not paying isn't an option, because it's the government.My current principal is about $48k (my original principal was $39k) with an interest rate of 6.5% (.25% discount for autopay to 6.25%)I currently have about $11k in uncapitalized interest.If I went on a regular 10-year repayment plan, from this point, I would be looking at payments of "$508.37/mo". I cannot make these payments. This is not an option. Also, I don't know how I could currently owe more money than I originally borrowed, but the monthly payments be $200 lower for the same interest rate on a higher principal balance... My original 10-year plan was near $700/mo... Hence my increased frustration with the situation. \*I am currently on an Income-Based Repayment plan. On any of these plans, my payments will increase with my income, assuming my income increases. If I earn less, my payments could be $0... but I'll \*try\* to keep it as simple as possible with this insanely complicated mess...\*In all cases, the entire remaining balance will eventually be forgiven, HOWEVER, the forgiven amount would be taxed as income that year.\*\*Scenario A. If I stay on my current Income-Based Repayment Plan IDR "Generally 15% of discretionary income " (150% of the poverty line), the 6.25% interest accrues but, never capitalizes (assuming I recertify annually on time AND the servicer actually processes my paperwork on time - see: previously capitalized interest). My current monthly payment is $175/mo. If it matters, in this scenario, I have 4 separate loans, accruing identical interest individually. I have 15 years of payments remaining out of 25. \*\*Scenario B. If I switch to the new SAVE plan, the 4 loans "will be consolidated" (I consolidated before and they stayed separate so IDK), and existing accrued interest is immediately capitalized. The payments are "Generally 10% of discretionary income."(225% of the poverty line) Here is where this plan gets interesting: IF my monthly payment is lower than the interest accrued for the month, the unpaid interest disappears into the ether. No brainer, right? Here is where it gets muddy. Either it's the continuance of the remaining 15 out of 25 years OR the 10 years already passed plus 1 year for every $1k principal originally borrowed beyond $12k which, could be another 20-50 more years depending on the definition of original principal.Between Scenario A and Scenario B, which option makes the most long-term financial sense?The best Math I can do for myself is figure out the interest: In Scenario A. My monthly interest is about $250, paying $175 means my unaccrued interest balance increases by $75/mo and my principal never moves above $48k. Ultimately, total balance goes up; forgiveness is definite in 2038.In Scenario B. My monthly interest is about $307, paying $150 means I'm just paying interest, no more interest is accrued but, my principal becomes $59k. Ultimately, my balance never goes over $59k. The Total Balance could either be forgiven in 2038 or 2078 but, I'll definitely be dead by then.I do occasionally throw a chunk of money at these loans to kill accrued interest and have paid off some smaller loans... but I still owe more than I borrowed. I've paid about $20k since graduating. On one hand, the ability to sometimes pay more does make maintaining the interest uncapitalized more appealing. On the other hand, not accruing more interest and keeping the principal at a definite $59k (unless I can pay more sometimes) is also appealing. \*\*\*I'll not complicate the matter with the 13-year history or the possibility that some previously capitalized interest (undetermined amount from an undetermined time) could be uncapitalized and, that I could put an additional 2-3 years on the plan behind me or, that I am part of the Borrower Defense Case and by 2026, It could be ruled that I owe none of this money and, be refunded what I've already paid. Oh yeah... because I'm in that case, my loans are in a forced administrative forbearance until 2026, meaning the next 3 years (add on a lack of "qualified payments") don't count toward my "current IBR", that I am trying to "stay" in, after the COVID forbearance ends. I already had a servicer lie to me and say if I go back to my IBR and out of the Borrower Defense Administrative Forbearance, that my case would be closed, so they didn't process my IBR recertification that I might not have to process anyway because literally nothing makes sense. Isn't this so exciting?\*\*\*&#x200B;. I know it will all be over soon but, I'm just worried about how all this chaos and negativity is impacting everyone. Me from loss of sleep and all cats from their loss of "security."My boys are outside right now, making it a lot quieter. They seem to prefer that when it gets too much in the house. They aren't instigators. They just want some peace at the ripe old age of "I'm not a kitten anymore." I just watched big red walk across the yard. My dog is peacefully sleeps on the couch, which is 90% of his day. I assume my Foster kitten is sleeping in the cat tree on the other side of the house and the kitten I am watching for the week is sleeping in the cat tree next to my desk. This after what seems to be days of morning and evening growling, hissing and chasing and almost fights. I get a few daily hours of napping cat peace. These cats are all good people cats so, how to love on them is not entirely the question.Our primary bedroom is the foster acclimation room, with an attached bathroom for easy quarantine and cleaning. Since quarantine is the standard, keeping them in our room, means they aren't alone at night. We also have to go in periodically for reasons not cat specific so, they get checked on all the time. We have a king bed. There is room for everyone but, vacation kitty disagrees. Fortunately, our resident pets all have their own beds, but it doesn't mean they never want to come in for a cuddle either. To some degree, I knew what I was getting into when I agreed to watch this kitty. I had one foster similar to her before, about the same age and she just didn't like other cats. It was easier because the previous foster was a third wheel and, perfectly happy to stay in "her room." We could leave the door open and she would choose to stay in the room and sleep on the bed. All she did was grumble and growl at any cat who approached her and, she would hold her ground until they gave up and walked away. She was adopted out to be an only cat.The owners of this vacation kitten adopted her relatively recently and said she had an issue with one other cat, in their 4 cat household so, they didn't want to leave her unattended, which is completely understandable. Fortunately, I also know her previous foster so, several people know her temperament. I don't know if it was suggested she be an only cat but, I know her foster has something like 15 cats in the house at all times and, nobody has made it sound like she can't be with other cats. I kept the vacation kitten in the foster room by herself for a night and 2 days but, felt terrible about displacing my foster baby. My struggle now is, our current foster room was still technically my foster kitten's usual feeding and sleeping/human cuddle space. She was getting in the habit of eating in the kitchen with my boys but, she still slept with us and I still keep the extra food for growing babies separate in there.My foster kitten is a bit dejected and confused. She was a colony baby and, being the similar age, she wanted to be kitty friends. She has good manners when it comes to respecting other cat's space. She also wants my attention but, this other kitten is being territorial and possessive. They clash over the feeding area and the litter box in the foster room... I have multiple bowls, 2 boxes in there now but, it doesn't matter. Foster kitten will go in on her own, vacation kitten will follow her and be mad about it. Vacation kitten has free reign of the house and, her attitude is "This is all mine now!"I'm thinking about sleeping in the guest room and hoping that helps my foster. &#x200B;. I just commented something similar on another thread but, it was so deep down in comments on comments, I thought it worth sharing as its own post because so many people are like "EWW. WHY WOULD I TALK TO MY NEIGHBOR? I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYONE AROUND HERE!"I live in a small neigborhood, comprised of 2 streets and about 60 homes. I don't know ALL of my neighbors but, I do know, a lot of them. We've been here for almost 10 years now. It was supposed to be a "starter home" but, you've seen the markets. When we were looking to buy, I wouldn't say we had the luxury of taking our neighbors into account. This was the 3rd place we put an offer in on, after viewing 30+ houses back in 2014. There are a dozen or so homes that were or have become rental properties, a few sales here and there but, I'd say at least half this neighborhood is comprised of people who bought their homes new or close to it, back in the 80s and 90s.I know my immediate neighbors on either side, the 3 houses immediately across the street and the 3 in the cul-de-sac. I know a smattering of others I've run into when walking my dog or working on my own yard. There are varying levels of relationship ranging from dislike, avoidance, ambivalence with an occasional wave, borrowing tools, to hanging out and having a beer (or 5) and playing Uno. That's gone from almost weekly to once every few months or longer... None of us feel obligated to talk or hang every time we see eachother.There are age gaps that separate us and hobbies that bring us together. My husband and at least 3 neighbors have car hobbies. They borrow tools and troubleshoot together from time to time. I garden and the husbands that do car stuff, also have wives that garden. We occasionally exchange plants, excess veggies and gardening tips. My neighbors on the left, their house is kind of trash but, we are the same age and occasionally chat outside. My neighbors on the right are older, take slightly better care of their house and, sometimes she bakes an "extra" pie. The neighbors in the corner are nice people have their own painting business and, they painted our house. Their now adult daughter is still a garbage person who avoids me as much as I avoid her. I still get a giggle about the scene she made trying to avoid me seeing her with her then BF in the grocery store once. I was amused by the disney sitcom level of weirdness, on my account and didn't realize who she was for several days.A benefit of knowing my neighbors has been their taking us into account when deciding who to whom to sell their home if they do. Have you lost a bid on a home that didn't make any financial sense? It isn't always about money. I also know several of my neighbors who would never sell to an investor/flipper, because they care about what happens to the people here after they leave.Our neighbor immediately across the street turned down an offer, because that person would have been the type to bang on our door, complain endlessly, and call the police when my husband works on his car and listens to loud scary music on weekends (something you can't do in most HOAs). Instead, he sold the house to a college-age girl, who brought in 3 roommates. They would let us know when they were having parties so we were aware of the street parking and noise (which they never made). I got to know one of them and, we worked together to TNR the random feral cats in our neighborhood. The current owner has since moved out and is now renting the place to 4 college age guys. The worst issue we have with them is that they all drive giant, lifted trucks and, their parking situation is slightly inconvenient but, whatever... One of them is a landscaper, which helps with my next-door neighbor, who mows their lawn once a year, when we ask... after it hits 3 feet.Your neighbors knowing you, your family, your pets, and who is usually at your house, is a bit like having a free home security system. They might notice if something is abnormal and, feel comfortable letting you know and vice versa. My dog is super quiet and, I've had neighbors walk him back home when I hadn't even noticed he was missing. We know who should and shouldn't be here (how that sounds...) I mean, noticing someone creeping in their car, looking in windows around the Holidays. Maybe someone pulled up in their car in the middle of the night and stalked your house for 6 hours. Would you want to know? I don't own a Ring... but my neighbors do and I can ask for the footage. If they are on vacation, I know their regular house or pet sitter, if it isn't me.I know the kids in my neighborhood and their parents if someone talking to them from their car is familiar or not. Just walking my dog and acknowledging everyone, taking note of the car and, reporting it is enough to prevent an abduction. I know one family has a low functioning autistic adult daughter, I should let them know if I see her outside alone. My next-door neighbor's mom lived in another house up the road and, she started developing Alzheimer's. There was a transition period where they weren't sure about her ability to be independent or, if she needed full-time Memory Care. Another neighbor I've been chatting with on occasion has been developing dementia as well and, I had to make sure her house wasn't on fire at least once. If they know you have a drinking problem and, you haven't called them 4 times today, they might check in to find you nearly dead, half-naked on the back deck with a lit grill, and firey potatoes to call an ambulance for you. If they don't see you for a while, they might check in and be the first to discover your lonely decaying corpse after 3 weeks because they thought it would be nice to drop off some fresh tomatoes from their garden. Also, I know which houses have the largest legal and illegal gun and ammunition collections or who I can borrow some random, car tool or a cup of sugar from... They know my husband can help fix their lawnmower...All that said, getting to your neighbors and at least having any kind of relationship with them at all has its benefits and drawbacks but, think of it like this... You are more likely to be an asshole to someone you don't know, on the internet, than you would be if you met them in person. Why grumble in resentment to yourselves about each other behind closed doors when some conflicts or irritations can be resolved with a normal human conversation? Most people are alright... enough... I mean... You could be having a casual discussion for the 17th time in 6 years and suddenly the 70-year-old says something racist or homophobic and gently guide them to the realization... or call that conversation short... Or they say something general about youth Millenials and you remind them that you are almost 40.Having neighbors you talk to can lead to all kinds of fun stories...I previously posted about some TNR kittens that I wanted to try to socialize. I was having good progress until I let them into a larger room and, basically, they didn't have to put up with me. I did send the two now 11 week old brothers back to the colony last evening. I held the now 13 week old torti (the one with all the promise) to take back this morning. Last night, I cleaned out and sanitized the litter box from her brother's mess and, she watched me with curiosity the whole time. She didn't come close but, she had nothing better to do. Otherwise, she hid and wanted nothing from me.This morning, it was raining so, I decided to wait. I played stick toy with her until she "hid" but then I heard the sound of her eating breakfast in the bathroom. I closed her in, so the next move could be getting her into the carrier when I was ready to go. I'm in another room for a few minutes when I hear a big thud, like she knocked something big over and, I wanted to make sure she was okay so I went back to check. It was just a bottle of cleaner but, of course she was hiding. I gave her sweet verbal reassurance, showed her my hand she mewed, crawled forward sniffed, rubbed, rolled over for a belly rub, got up and came out for more attentions. This little kitty lets me hold and pet her all over. She did a bunch of purring and whole body rubbing up against me. She rolled over and let me rub her soft little belly. She looks into my eyes with all this love while she leans against me getting pets. She stretches her sweet little paws up my leg with that cute, clawless reach and lovable eyes looking into mine. I pet her until she wants to finish her plate of food.The next time I go in to check on her, she comes right out. She wants to be pet and loved. I give her a sprinkle of food and decide to leave the bathroom door open this time. She munches a few bits and goes back to check out the room she has been freely roaming in for the past 3 days... She sits down and looks around, goes under the bed and won't come back to me. She doesn't want the toy now. She just forms that little loaf and gives me that cute look. I'm not going to reach under for her. I know better than to try to grab a cat unless it's absolutely necessary. I left her under there to type this out... realizing I can be in the same room and do this, here I am, laying on the floor. She's still under the bed but, not under the other more claustrophopic furniture so, I guess that is okay... she just came closer to watch me...My dilemma is, I made an agreement with my husband that I could only keep these kittens if I could get them into the rescue's foster program. I had until last night to get an answer. They don't want more skittish kittens in the program, since they are so hard to get adopted out. I gave up on those boys but this precious little girl... the mixed signals are killing me. Tomorrow is the last day the rescue intake is open for the week but, I haven't able to get an okay from the intake coordinator. On Monday, I'm going away for about 2 weeks and won't be able to take care of her anyway. Besides her spay and vaccines, I haven't gotten her to a vet to test for diseases. I don't think I should just try to integrate her with my cats so fast and, my husband won't want to deal with it. I don't want to send her back out to a parking lot next to a busy highway. I know the colony caretaker does a good job of making sure they are fed and have shelter but, I'm just having such a hard time with the idea of putting her back out there...&#x200B;. It will probably take a 5-7 years and you will probably experience retaliation (spoiler alert: retaliation illegal and another lawsuit in itself).If you know for a fact that your employer attained PPP funds from the SBA and didn't tell the whole truth on their application (most didn't)... Like say... How many employees they had on payroll.Uncle Sam wants his money back. The PPP payouts and status are public information. You could file anonymously through the SBA's website but, I don't know why you would give up life changing reward money. The reward is 15-35% of the recovered money. The recovery is 3x the distribution. The government recovers it's money 95% of the time. Whistle Blower / Qui Tam / False Claims Attorneys will work on Contingency, meaning they don't get paid until the case is won. They aren't easy to find and they may expect 30-40% of the pay out but, I'm certain the reward for most of us, is still more than we would be paid if we just kept our head down and our jobs like good little worker bees for just as much time. The only catch is, you need to be the first to report the fraud and understandably, nobody likes a litigious employee. Fuckem.Edit: I thought I was making good progress so, I released them into a slightly larger room... As much as they are adorable, housebroken and fun to play with on the other end of a stick toy, they are less than interested in being touched. The one who let multiple people hold her, purred and napped on my lap, won't come close to me anymore. I can get them to come close enough to bump into me and eat within arms length but, as soon as I have my hand anywhere near them or, they realize they are touching me, they bolt off. They recognize me as food bringer, since I have been giving them less to graze on. Now I have to monitor them, since Hot Sauce has some minor food aggression and is becoming a little fatboy. I spoiled them for a week but, I'm just not going to have the time and, the rescue I work with does not want anymore skittish babies. I don't blame them. The difference between the fosters that have been placed with me and, these little community cuties, is stark. They aren't bad kitties; they won't be good human companions... Unless they go back to the colony and realize how good they had it indoors.I've done a couple of TNR, not many but, older cats I didn't have to question whether or not to attempt to socialize them. Last week, I caught what I was told, by the colony caretaker, was a mama cat and 3 kittens from the same litter. Mama was 10 months old. I'm not sure she was really mama but, the two 10 week olds had a similar coat (orange) and a torti, who ended up being 12 weeks. I already gave mama back to the colony caretaker for release but, I've held on to the 10 and 12 week olds, to see if it can get them into the foster system for a rescue I work with. They are absolutely tired of fosters bringing in difficult to adopt, spicy and skittish kittens so, I don't have a firm answer on intake just yet. I have had them in quarantine together for 5 days. I have caught them all sleeping in the same bed together and, separately. I don't really know what to make of their relationship as a collective. The 12 week torti (Heidi) is sweet as pie. I was able to take her out of the trap, with my bare hands, on the first day, with no fight or defensiveness at all. She hides a bit but, she is otherwise getting more comfortable in quarantine and will let anyone pick her up without protest. She has enjoyed a flea combing and, her body language is showing increased comfort, except for her random "meow attacks" where she will desperate meow for a few minutes throughout the night. She meows at me when I come in sometimes. Last night, after feeding them, she started meowing at nothing, meowing at the wall and, then grumbling at the spiciest 10 week old (Hot Sauce). She took a swat at him. He ran and hid. She followed him to his hiding spot and did it again. I have hard time distinguishing bullying from play in kittens. The two 10 week old orange boys, they came in the same trap and, I still am not sure if they are bonded or not (making the decision harder) I'll catch them sleeping together and separately. One, I call Cheddar Biscuit, has been coming around slowly. I was able to keep him on my lap and give him a flea combing last night. He was a bit hissy for the first few days and did give me the deepest claw when I tried to fish him out of a corner once but, he's cooled down a lot. Cheddar Biscuit and Hot Sauce do seem to ping off each other, when it comes to deciding what is or is not okay but, Hot Sauce does not appear to be coming around to my presence. I can't say he never but, after 5 days, the closest I have come is to him being okay with not being hidden. He is still jumpy and defensive to any move I make. He pulls back, hisses, hides and may swat if I try to touch him. I did have to take him on a separate vet visit since the surgeons found blood in his urine when prepping him for neutering. He was given an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory injection and, I am hoping the relief will cool him down too. We didn't test for the true cause, to keep the cost low and, considering I probably wouldn't be able to handle him to medicate him beyond that visit. I just couldn't bring myself to put him back out without addressing the issue. My struggle is deciding, if I do have to release Hot Sauce back to his colony, do I send him back with or without the support of Cheddar Biscuit? How would the colony react to one 11 week old being returned a week later? Would his brother's presence make a difference? Hot Sauce does appear to be "The adventurous protector," of the litter. He is always the first out of hiding, to see what is happening or attempt to escape, or eat but, it takes nothing to put him back in hiding. Additionally, I think Hot Sauce is being bullied by Heidi. She doesn't bother Cheddar. I don't know if the issue is just a personal preference or, possibly related to his health, which would also indicate that he might be bullied when returned to the colony. Maybe separating him from the other two or, just removing Heidi will help improve him socially... Any suggestions appreciated... Even if it is just "put them back.". I see lawyers who specialize in what I am looking for but, they aren't in my state. If it's a federal case, that probably doesn't matter so much. Either way, can I just schedule a consultation already? Not even a discussion of consultation fees. Just crickets. The case is so slam dunk, I probably don't even need one but, I would really love to pay an expert to support me.From a colony, I picked up what I am told is a mama and kittens from 2 of her litters, to take for spay/neuter tomorrow. I'm guessing their ages. I was told they are smaller than normal because they are feral. That could be true. If not, I estimate the oldest one is 10-12 weeks, younger two are 6-8 weeks and mama is 6-9 months. Obviously mama and the older torti are girls but, I don't know about the 2 younger ones.They aren't aggressive, or overly skittish, just scared and uncertain. I did pet the littles (kinda) and hold the oldest one for awhile earlier (I was shocked) but, they have grouped up. I touched mama, without her getting "feral angry" but, she wasn't happy either.Because of the littles and, being under the impression mama was dumped by people, I've let them all out in a bathroom I have set up to QT Fosters. It was cute when I brought mama in the room, she started meowing and all the kittens wanted to find her.This was a mistake, as I can't think about how I'm going to get them back into feral traps on full bellies (I still have 9 hours). I'm chilling in the room and they are all falling asleep. I noticed mama has an abcess on her back end, about 2 inches away from her butt. It's like an 1 inch open crater... Obviously she doesn't feel good about it and, I'm wondering if there is anything I can do for her now. She should be getting antibiotics and pain meds tomorrow anyway. I will inquire about additional care.I also welcome tips on wrangling cats that are semi feral. I think they can be socialized but, I don't really have time to work that out overnight, with the group mentality.Edit: I set up the traps in the bathroom and only had to wrangle 1 of the smol. Do didn't take much.Update: They read the chats and things escalated quickly. So off the rails, it reeks of absolute panic I honestly don't know what they are freaking out about.Edit: all of that and related comments are coming down... I always assumed everything in that chat could be read::popcorn time::Sweat harder, stretch.The top brass had this genius idea to "gamify" our busy work and the weekly "winner" gets an Amazon gift card. I want them to know just how stupid this idea is (because the software is trash) and maybe make $50 extra a week, out of the raises they didn't give anyone plus they already backed out of paying out the gift card once.They incentivized calls by making them worth 5x the points of any other activity. They want us to make outbound sales calls but, everyone else uses their personal cell phones (not compensated), then logs a call in the CRM. This makes me the only person who uses the actual internal phone system and NOBODY calls... Like... I might get 1 actual work call a day that hits a prompt... I don't want to call fucking anybody. I happen to be the only person who ever cared about getting our phones to work (because they don't pay for my phone) and, I've just had to ignore how every single inbound call counts as a minimum of 2 calls... Which now works to my advantage.Half the time the phone doesn't work anyway. Calls are not recorded because they are too cheap. I'm just looking for a few people to call customer service. You can hang up as soon as I pick up or, we can talk about absolutely nothing. I don't care, as long as I get to answer. It's not impossible that someone else will pick up but, it is unlikely. DM me and I will send you the phone number. Press 3 for customer service.The oceans are boiling. The planet is on fire. If it isn't on fire, it already burned. If it isn't on fire or burned, it's flooded or drowning in a mudslide. The Air and water is toxic... It's so hot where our food grows, we aren't going to have food soon. The oceans are so hot, we are going to have more, larger hurricanes than ever. It feels like I'm insane or, everyone else is, for going on with their lives like this isn't happening... I can still go to the grocery store and get ice cream, post on reddit, play video games. Water comes out of the tap but, it tastes like burning rubber today... I ordered survival books this morning and, it made me cry because it took this abstract concept that I've dealt with and gotten over... and made it real... because this time it is real... isn't it? Isn't it?. I have been on the IBR plan since 2012 and just put in my application to renew, with repayment restarting again. I accidentally ended up on the New IBR app page and, it insisted I consolidate loans that I had already applied to consolidate multiple times in the past and, for some reason, they never did. I won't do it now because I don't want the interest to capitalize.I went for the reapplication and the only option is IDR. The application says something like, my loan servicer will decide if I go on IDR, IBR or ICR, based on what they think is best... which makes no sense. When I finished the app, the FAFSA page stated that I need to send my app to my servicer then, they said they were forwarding it to my servicer, which they still think is still Great Lakes. I was converted to Nelnet, which is literally the same company anyway so... I don't actually know if they got it or not.I looked at the PDF Print out of the application, after being walked through generating it on FAFSA... and there are a bunch of questions that I was not prompted to answer and, are not filled on this app... vital things like WHAT KIND OF PAYMENT PLAN I AM APPLYING FOR.I don't know if this recertification is considered done or, if it was done correctly... It's just frustrating.Today, I get an email inviting me to register on Nelnet, which I had done weeks ago... and I can't even log in... Presumably because that email blast means their servers are bogged down with people trying to do the same thing.Edit: Oh. Fantastic. SAVE was not an option on FASFA but, I checked Nelnet and was referred back to FASFA, only to find that the REPAYE Program is the conversion to SAVE AND I happen have been on the only IDR plan (IBR) that is legally required to compound interest, when converting to SAVE... unless I had converted to IDR, which is not clear because the IDR is both a plan and a class of plans...I suffered severe depression from single digits, up until I was about 27 and started getting the right medications finally. I've had about 10 years of being okay. A little depression creeps in for a day or 3 but, nothing I wasn't able to crawl out if with relative ease. The past few weeks, I've felt unstable and more depressed than I have in a long time... It's not going away. I'm converting a lot to apathy, which I know isn't great either. From my social groups, it seems like other people are experiencing something very similar... Maybe it has something to do with the well...fuck. Blame the wildfire smoke but, why not blame.. (dives off into a spiral about Climate Change, societal collapse, corporate greed, the loss of basic human rights and clear end of days.) Antarctica spends entire days above freezing... It's winter there.I applied for Borrower Defense about a year ago but, not in time to make the first or second wave of wipe outs and, my school was not losted in Sweet Vs. Cardona (though it has a shot at being added). My loans were with Great Lakes, which was bought by Nelnet and, they officially moved to Nelnet last month. Ultimately, Nelnet and FSA both show my loans. They could be in Forbearance during the Borrower Defense review period but, I'd prefer to stay on my IDR repayment plan. Nothing was mentioned about removing them from my credit report, in any case. Supposedly they have been with Nelnet since 2018 and this is just a website migration. I don't know what is going on but, I am tempted to take advantage of not having them on my credit report anymore. I had no negative marks against the account but, still couldn't do something like... Get a mortgage.... 5 years ago. I had a long series of things written out but, I couldn't post and the browser erased it. TLDW...We have been in our home for 9.5 years. Our deck has needed to be replaced since before we moved in but, it's a luxury item. There are higher priority repairs that have taken precedent. After all this time, pro crawl space waterproofing 5 years ago, window replacement 7 years ago, a bathroom replacement half a year ago, roof replacement a couple of months ago, and countless other other pro and DIY fixes later... The crawl space is moist.To make a long story short, the one "Luxury" replacement we put off, after all this time... Means we now have no choice but to replace it, as well as the interior and exterior of the 2nd bathroom it makes contact with. I have also "wanted" to make updates to that bathroom but, it was not "necessary." Now, it might be dire. In the meantime 🤣 I've put painters tape over where there should be flashing and, stuck an insanely high velocity fan in the crawl space, pushing inside air out through the exposed areas. It's working... We had the crawl space waterproof and sealed. That job also involved installing an exhaust fan, that should have been enough to keep things dry. Tldr: The seal was broken so, the water damaged, rotten area was pulling in the worst moist air from outside, rather than inside the house.Species: catAge: 2 yearsSex/Neuter status: male neuteredBreed: catBody weight: 9lbs?History: He has a history of throwing up completely undigested food. It has been suggested that he may have some type of lymphocyte issue that causes intestines to become inflamed and not allow food to pass but, we have not pursued the intestinal biopsy.Clinical signs: Vomiting frequently. There are periods of time when I don't think he throws up but, it seems like almost every day. For the past week, multiple times a day. Typically undigested food or bile, now what looked like green/brown thin pudding diarrhea with grass in it. I'm posting because of the new type of vomit. It wasn't in the litter box and didn't smell like poop so, must be vomit. Duration: This type of vomit is new today but, he has had issues keeping food down for 2 years... We have had him since he was 8 weeks old. I don't know how he keeps his weight up since he almost never seems to keep food down. He has been seeking more cuddle comfort for the past 3 days and throwing up more frequently. He tends to force cuddling when he doesn't feel well. He does also overeat when given the chance. He has prescription food but, he eats almost anything he finds, like a dog. He does eat the foster kitten's food sometimes. It may also be relevant that we have a foster kitten with FHV. My cats had FHV as kittens and, it was mild. This foster was so bad at 3 weeks old, he needed an ocular enucleation on one eye, which happened maybe 9 weeks ago. He's been with us for about 2 weeks. I figured after 2 months, he wouldn't be seriously contagious. I had them separated for a little over a week but, they were in each others faces under the door. He still sneezes snot, sounds funny when sniffing around and wheezes when he has a lot of activity. That may be a permanent issue from how bad his infection was.Your general location: SoutheastLinks to test results, vet reports, X-rays etc.I have never received anything that has showed anything significant.Every door jam in this house is not square. I had foundation work done but, it didn't stick because they just filled cracks after baiting and switching me into waterproofing, which wasn't the worst investment but... yeah... There are more cracks. I think they are being caused by tree roots, the trees are 40+ years old and, killing them will just make things worse when the roots decay so, I'm going to leave that be. The other probability is this land being on an incline and shifting over time. I can see greening in the septic leach field. We already had the field repaired once and, it's all from landshift. We are built on cinder blocks, with a crawl space. I've been under there a thousand times (9 years) and, when I go looking for something specific, that's when I notice the weird stuff... The joists are supported by cemented cinderblocks. Fine... I finally found where the floor dips in the hall, someone squeezed shims in between the joist and the sub floor at some point. Then, on the cinder block supports, I find what looks like cut deck boards wedged in... is this the answer? I need to replace exterior french doors, want to replace them with sliders, and desperately need to replace the ancient carpeting but, the foundation is probably more important. If I replace the floor, I want to fix these uneven areas but, don't feel like shims are the answer. I don't know who is paying attention and, will go through my history or, make suggestions but, we did just get our roof replaced so, that is out of the way. We renovated a bathroom, which became it's own challenge for the contractors, because apparently our rooms are not squared either. Now I feel like I have to worry about how shifting or settling will affect any other updates we might make, if any repairs to the foundation or attempts to square the house will damage other renovations and, if they will last until resale or death... (This was going to be a starter home but, ya'll have seen this economy. I think this is it for us for the forseeable future.). Been in this house for 9 years and I've never had an issue with a centipede invasion until the past month or so. I have a set of exterior french doors that needs to be replaced that big black racer roaches come in off the deck. I've almost always had carpenter ants, which told me I have leaks that need fixing. I have occasional spiders. I leave them be for the most part because they and the cats take care of the other things.I had the roof replaced less than 2 months ago. Since then, I've seen a significant increase in carpenter ants and centipedes. I don't know what it means or what is left to fix... yes, the foundation needs work. I could use some help with figuring that out, since I got sold a completely different service, (crawl space water proofing) last time I tried that. They filled the cracks in the foundation at the time but, there are new ones now. I'm not even sure the drainage that was installed at the time is doing anything... We have a scrawl space sump that is bone dry at all times.Edit: I went down into the crawl space and it smells damp. I looked for signs of moisture and only found condensation in one place, where there is no rhyme or reason as to how it got there, It's not under any of the HVAC spots that drip sometimes and, they are not currently dripping. The space is sealed and, there is a fan that blows air out. I had the humidity set to 30% and just bumped it down to 20% to see if that helps... but it feels and smells like 70% down there...Nobody has to be trapped in a terrible, abusive relationship with insecure, controlling human garbage anymore. Nobody needs to experience a legal or religion based lock-in with trash. Nobody needs to get baby trapped. Shitty people are outing themselves left and right. There are no more dark "family secrets." People can't just be asshats and say, "Oh. I was just joking," because no you weren't, you backpedaling buffoon and go fuck yourself. No decent human being has to worry about being stuck with the underling they thought was "the best they could do." Dating profiles are a filter for never having to speak to or set foot in the same building as someone you wouldn't give the time of day, if you knew what kind sad excuse of human garbage they are. No wonder certain types of people are getting more lonely, more angry, more bitter and a greater danger to society at large. They can't just trap someone to abuse in secret and show a nice face to the rest of the world. I'm not saying it doesn't still happen... But it's getting better. Decent people are smartening up and terrible people are afraid of being alone with themselves. They might have to do some self reflecting.It was my understanding that the contagious period for FHV is 2-3 weeks or symptomatic... and snot may be symptomatic.I am kitten sitting a 13 week old void, for their foster, for 2-3 weeks. He had FHV so bad when he was brought into the org, he needed an eye enucleation. It's been almost 2 months since he started getting treatment (he was a SMOL) but, he is still congested and has some snot when I get him running around with a toy. Apparently his regular foster had not been giving him his L-Lysene supplements. I don't know about nebulizer treatments. He is going in to the vet for one tomorrow. I've had him for a week now and, he is absolutely mentally done being quarantined. I went in to clean the bathroom yesterday and, noticed that there are droplets on absolutely every solid surface from him sneezing. If he is contagious, my entire master bedroom is a kitty biohazard. He I wash my hands all the time but, he rubs on my ankles and, I didn't even think about sanitizing my feet and ankles between cat exposure.All the cats sneeze once or twice a day. The kittens are regularly in each other's faces under the door jam. The FHV baby hisses so, I'm sure he has been sending some droplets. One of my homeboys had watery eyes for about a day but, he seems fine now. He was the one who brought FHV in originally and, he refuses the L-Lysene. I've been giving it to everyone I can get to take it for the past week.This regular foster said he was playing with their regular cats and they are fine. I know both of my homeboys (2 years) had been through FHV when they were younger. The rub is, I have another foster kitten, who is now 4 months old and, the org vet does not want them to mix, to avoid infecting her, since she is going to the weekly adoption events. I do understand the need to keep them separated for liability's sake but, I feel absolutely terrible that I have to leave him completely alone for so long. I don't know if the separation is physically or mentally necessary at this point...Well, maybe a specific type... The one's that call in about a thing and have a long, super detailed story adjacent to the thing but, they give you a hard time, when you ask for actual information about the thing, then it turns out there was no problem and then they get extremely upset that you aren't going to do anything about nothing...What does this mean to you? How does it make you feel?.
    I used to think this disorder was a blessing. Not having to deal with emotions and only caring about myself seemed pretty sweet to me. Ha ha.I now realize how wrong I was after having yet another mental breakdown that no one will ever know about. My sense of self is nonexistent. I don’t know who I am. I am completely empty. My emotions are very limited. People love the act that I put up whenever I’m in public or dating, but it’s not real. I’m an amazing speaker and I use this power to my advantage whenever I need to or feel like impressing people for validation/ego boost. My ego is so huge, yet so fragile. My entire self worth and grandiosity are based on superficial things like money and status. It got to a point where small financial setbacks are sending me into mental hell and destroy my entire self image. If I’m not financially succesful, then who am I? I feel like I’m a nobody if I’m not succesful. I can just be honest now and say that I hate this. I’m not a sane person and will try to look for help for the first time as mentioned before by some other people on here. Thank you for that. I understand it now.It feels like most of the time I’m just trying to mask the emptiness by pleasure seeking or work. I can try to act like it’s not there, but in reality it’s always lingering in the back of my mind. I feel like when I get to my core and strip away all the artificial bullsh*t I created around myself, it’s just emptiness. It seems like there is no way to fill the void. I get very very close sometimes, but it’s always just ever so slightly out of reach. Do I have to live like this forever? It doesn’t make me all that sad, but it worries me to some degree. It’s the restlessness that comes with it. Anyone here that understands this?. After trying many times, I came to the conclusion that relationships are just not meant for me. I’m running into the same old issues that I’ve always been running into with other women and I’m already devalueing my new girlfriend after only a few months. It’s quite evident that I am the problem here. The unsuccessful relationship doesn’t seem to bother me that much. Hurting her feelings on multiple occasions doesn’t affect me either. What bothers me more is that I can’t just be normal and experience the things neurotypicals experience. The human condition, or whatever you’d like to call it. What it means to be content with someone and sticking together. It’s tiring to always look for more. It’s never enough and I just want peace. I need the validation from other women, which leads to me cheating yet again. I absolutely love the chase. I love new and exciting things. I don’t feel remorse for anything. When my girlfriend cries to me, I just feel blank. I can’t connect with my girlfriend because I don’t feel her emotions. All my responses to her intense emotions are robotic. She complains about me always being emotionally unavailable and disregarding her needs. She is right, but I honestly don’t care.I’m curious if anyone else here managed to make a relationship work. It doesn’t feel possible for me.I feel like I have no real personality. The way I act, speak and present myself completely depend on who I’m with and where I am. It seems like I fit the mold perfectly no matter where I go. Sometimes everything I do is so smooth that it’s off putting for other people. To the point where one of the girls I dated literally asked me if I was a real person. She told me the way I speak is like out of a movie. She even asked me if I was a psychopath because she noticed my emotionless gaze. I genuinely don’t think I am a psychopath. However, it surprised me that she knew something was off after spending some time together. It was the first time this happened. She even jokingly called me a narcissist at some point. Jokes on her. She fell in love with me nevertheless. I just wonder if this is common for pwnpd. Just for clarification, I am not bothered by this at all. Me being like this has benefitted me greatly in life. I’m just really curious as I’m trying to understand my weird brain.I realised that I don’t particularly like it, nor dislike it after sleeping with yet another woman that I just met. I find way more enjoyment in everything that comes before sex. I love how it gives me the feeling of power, control, being admired, lusted after, etc. The fact that I can easily get women to sleep with me gives me a kick. I’m very apathetic when it comes to the act itself. It’s just something that has to be done. After the act I just want to move on the next to repeat the cycle. It feels like I already completed the game at that point, so why bother anymore? The supply that it gives me is on another level. I do realise that it’s quite a shallow way of living. For me it’s more like chasing this ego boost drug feeling than forming an actual relationship with somebody. I think it’s also because I have trouble forming real deep relationships with people in general, especially romantic relationships. I just wondered if anyone else here experienced/experiences the same thing.I feel like I’m walking a tightrope at all times and I might lose my mind at any given moment. I’m not sad or depressed at all it’s just that sometimes I feel extremely disconnected from the real world. I look and act normal, but I severely lack real emotional depth. It’s just an act. I have trouble genuinely caring about other people and the things they tell me. Like when someone is telling me something that means a lot to them (e.g. moving into a new home, new job, marriage, etc.). I’d tell them how happy I am for them and that I’m excited, but in reality, I feel nothing. It’s just blank. Matter of fact, I try to make the conversation about me again. I hate it when the conversation is not about me. Honestly, I can’t stand most people and usually feel like smashing their face in. But I don’t. I just smile and they love it. People have no clue that I’m actually like this. I visited my mother yesterday and I tried to tell her how much of a piece of shit I am to most people, but she wouldn’t even believe me. I gave up on that. People really believe that I’m a good person, when in reality, I’d ruin their life for money if I got the chance. If only I got the opportunity to do so. My life revolves around money and status. My ego is so big that it sometimes ruins dates with women.I talk to as many different women as possible and tell them about my accomplishments for supply and sex. If I feel like they can’t give this to me, I just instantly cut them out of my life without notice or hesitation. A simple example of my mental state: Today my card declined, because I used the wrong one. I was literally sweating and shaking by the idea that the cashier might have thought to herself that I’m poor (which I’m not). I told her I have 4 cards that’s why I picked the wrong one. I seriously thought of not going to that particular store anymore. Everything I do and chace is superficial and shallow, but I love it. I think I’m destined to live this way.
    [Post in question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/178g9wa/atm_i_hate_everything_including_this_sub/)I'm a bit drunk right now, but I calmed down and don't really feel cognitively impaired by the alcohol, but I tend to be a bit dramatic. There is no TRUE reflection, there is always a lense distorting my perception.*" I hate being self aware. It fucking sucks."*Being self-aware actually gives me mixed feelings. It sucks knowing who you are and seeing yourself make the same mistakes. Knowing your anger, jealousy etc. is irrational and getting even more angry at that fact. On the other hand, it gives me the possibility to intervene in those processes. I definitely saved friendships because of it and I managed to sometimes "catch" what was happening, preventing negative spirals. My anger etc. also seems to not last as long anymore (on average), so there are some major upsides to that.*"I feel like a caged circus lion. I JUST WANNA BE A FUCKING LION, but if I am, I'm gonna get put down."*I still feel like this to some degree. Not with as much seething rage, but it is definitely a fucked up situation. I don't feel "sick", I don't see myself as having an "illness". It just feels like I am this way. I'm selfish, arrogant and distant, and unfortunately, those are negative things for others around me. Spin it how you want it, on the inside we will probably always be assholes. I put on masks, fake empathy, fake emotions and lie about who I am, because nobody wants to *truly* see me the way I am. It's easy to say "I still like you" on Reddit, but experiencing who I am daily is an entirely different beast. Why would you want someone like this around? LIKE SERIOUSLY? Our internalized shame might be an exaggeration of how people would see us, but there's a reason we hate ourselves. Even the most self-aware of us, those who are truly doing their best, are faking shit. That little "sorry to hear that, that sounds difficult" when someone tells me something sad, that little smile when a kid smiles at me whilst I'm annoyed at its existence, that little "I love you too", when I know full well I only love the imaginary version of this person, and will never truly care about them the same way someone else could.*"What is "recovery" even supposed to mean? WHAT IN THE FUCK DO YOU RECOVER FROM? BEING YOU?"*Still don't really get that one.*"I get being narcissistic has really bad sides like shame, anxiety etc. I like to complain a LOT about it. But the truth is that our grandiose selves are INSANE at what they do, whilst all the others are just crying in a corner for the most minor of bullshit, whilst we shrugged off things they would have a mental breakdown from."*I guess most people aren't that fragile, grief, crying etc. actually seem to be relatively good ways to work through emotions. There is still a weakness in it that my entire being gets repulsed by.As for the "grandiose self": Certain things, like some types of criticism, rejection etc., are things I am much more weak to. That being said, it is also a type of strength that many people simply don't have. Staying functional and confident in situations others would get an anxiety attack in, being so used to acting people don't even suspect it to be faked and our ability to be rutheless are advantageous and can lead to very positive outcomes. There's a reason high funtioning narcissists tend to climb corporate ladders, it's not just because we manipulate people, it's because we have skillsets that go beyond most neurotypicals in certain situations. In the worst case I might feel ashamed when having to make difficult decisions like firing someone, but I'm certainly not gonna cry about it, and the ego is going to restore itself most likely to ensure functioning in high-stress environments.*"Why can't I just insult people for having stupid bullshit problems, have them insult me back, and then pretend nothing happened 5 minutes after?"*I still don't see that happening for most people at least. It's manageable, but damn sometimes it would be nice to just tell people what you think and NOT have to live with the consequences.*"Then you have to work with people who SO beneath you, it is an insult that they are even in the same UNIVERSE as you."*Very hyperbolic, but idiots *are* frustrating. *"I just had a friend write me a msg that a pet died. "WHO THE FUCK CARES, SHUT THE FUCK UP" is what I'd like to say, but I know people are whiny bitches"*I don't need the message to be this aggressive, but yes, I don't care about your pet. I understand you're sad, but crying about that to someone would make me feel pathetic, so I resent it in you as well. Come to me when there's something to fix, I can't fix death. If I'm not a close friend of yours, don't even think about it.*" "Ohh the narcissist lies and manipulates" YES BECAUSE YOU DUMBFUCKS ARE INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SOMEONE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CAR BREAKING DOWN."*Extremely based. Past me is great.*"LOOK AT YOURSELVES YOU SHITS. YOU CANCER TO SOCIETY. Where the fuck was your flower dress made? How many people are ACTUALLY ENSLAVED because YOU can't humble yourselves to buy some 2nd hand shit. How many of you empath-fucks ignore EVERY homeless person, because you're "too busy" because you've gotta go home and watch TV. How long ago could you empaths have solved world hunger? How many diseases could we have eradicated if you actually voted for ALTRUISTIC THINGS instead of your fucking wallet?"*Even more based. I'd say it in a nicer way, but goddamn those empaths really don't have a lot of empathy outside their own circles. Most people could do a lot more for the world, but they don't really care, just like us. It's just that us not caring affects them.*"And now to this sub. This fucking disgusting sub. I KNOW some of you will understand, but then there will be those people who will say I'm not being EMPATHETIC AND INSIGHTFUL ENOUGH, NOT TRYING TO "RECOVER" ENOUGH whilst talking in a forum for NARCISSISTS.* *(...)**Those people who will give ACTUAL narcissists advice like "oh you gotta be better, you're hurting others" like DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CONDITION MEANS? FUCK OFF, NOBODY CARES. Tell me what* ***I*** *get out of it, tell me why* ***I*** *should care about your words."*I like the sub (mostly). A lot of you are great, insightful and just fun. I would, once again, choose less inflammatory language, but goddamn even in rage mode I'm just dropping truth bombs left and right. Becoming better people is generally a good thing though, even if it's just for us in the end.*"I will go back to being pro-social, it's best for me. But I fucking hate feeling sedated all the time by the expectations of others."*If I'm honest, people hate me. If I lie, people love me. Here I am, riding that fine line again, giving enough truth to not go insane and wearing enough masks to control people's opinions. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best I can do? Probably also no. But I guess it's better than my past self, it's better for others and it's better for me.*I'm not in the greatest emotional state rn, I'm aware I'm externalizing shit. Don't say I didn't warn you.* I feel really frustrated. I had a really shit day recently, it fucked me up. Now I feel like I'm almost back to the "real me" (which only feels real in this state anyways but whatever).I hate being self aware. It fucking sucks. It sucks that I'm sitting here, trying to throw a pity party, knowing I'm doing that. I just wanna call a friend, tell them to go fuck themselves for something random they did a year ago, but I KNOW I'll regret it.I feel like a caged circus lion. I JUST WANNA BE A FUCKING LION, but if I am, I'm gonna get put down.I'm scrolling through this god-forsaken sub, seeing post after post about self improvement, self awareness and "recovery" knowing I'm participating in that shit. I know it's necessary, but for fucks sake did someone come and castrate all of us at some point?What is "recovery" even supposed to mean? WHAT IN THE FUCK DO YOU RECOVER FROM? BEING YOU?All my problems may stem from trauma, abuse and god being a fucking bitch, but my problems RIGHT NOW stem from ME. Who I AM. Not from a "defense mechanism", not from some "mental disorder", no, it's from from WHO THE FUCK I AM. I CANNOT BE ME, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. HOW FUCKING DARE ANYONE TELL US WE CAN'T BE US?I get being narcissistic has really bad sides like shame, anxiety etc. I like to complain a LOT about it. But the truth is that our grandiose selves are INSANE at what they do, whilst all the others are just crying in a corner for the most minor of bullshit, whilst we shrugged off things they would have a mental breakdown from.And then they tell you about it. And they care about your reaction to their bullshit. HOW COME YOU CARE I DON'T FEEL SAD FOR YOU? How is that a problem to YOU? Why can't I just insult people for having stupid bullshit problems, have them insult me back, and then pretend nothing happened 5 minutes after?Then you have to work with people who SO beneath you, it is an insult that they are even in the same UNIVERSE as you. "boo hoo you called me a dumbass for being unable to do something after you explained it 5 times, YES I KNOW WHAT I DID DUMBASS FUCK YOU FOR BEING STUPID, STOP WASTING MY TIME, IT IS ACTUALLY VALUABLE COMPARED TO YOURS".I hate peoples emotional neediness SO much. I just had a friend write me a msg that a pet died. "WHO THE FUCK CARES, SHUT THE FUCK UP" is what I'd like to say, but I know people are whiny bitches, getting sad if a fucking bird flies against their window. I say GET FUCKED BIRD, FREE MEAL (okay I won't actually eat it though) as long as it doesn't take away from MY time by smearing blood all over the glass.I despise my own emotions, I don't cry about bullshit to people, except on reddit but you don't count (no offense). If I don't expect people to do that shit for me, WHY DO I NEED TO BE A NORMAL HUMAN FOR THEM? FUCK OFF!I feel like people don't actually care about the truth that much as long as you don't show it. I told a friend I had basically no affective empathy, and they were fine with it, BUT GUESS WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T SHOW ENOUGH EMPATHY FOR STUPID SHIT IN THEIR LIVES? "You're being so cold to me" YES, I TOLD YOU, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I MEANT YOU DUMBASS - is what I'd like to say, but OF COURSE I gotta keep up the mask and tell them "I was distracted, sorry" because if I don't it will spiral into an avalanche of people hating me for LITERALLY EXISTING AUTHENTICALLY."Ohh *the narcissist* lies and manipulates " YES BECAUSE YOU DUMBFUCKS ARE INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SOMEONE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CAR BREAKING DOWN. Because YOU expect everyone to be like YOU, and if they aren't YOU will fucking hunt them down, you empath bitches. LOOK AT YOURSELVES YOU SHITS. YOU CANCER TO SOCIETY. Where the fuck was your flower dress made? How many people are ACTUALLY ENSLAVED because YOU can't humble yourselves to buy some 2nd hand shit. How many of you empath-fucks ignore EVERY homeless person, because you're "too busy" because you've gotta go home and watch TV. How long ago could you empaths have solved world hunger? How many diseases could we have eradicated if you actually voted for ALTRUISTIC THINGS instead of your fucking wallet?I DONT GIVE A SHIT, BUT I DON'T PRETEND TO OUTSIDE OF TALKING TO YOU. I KNOW I didn't give a shit for a long time, but when my time comes I will GLADLY die with that knowledge.But "*the narc*" is the problem. WE are because we "lack empathy", because I don't pity you because the fucking hamster died, after KNOWING DAMN WELL MOST FOOD ITEMS HAVE A LONGER LIFESPAN WHEN KEPT IN A FREEZER.And now to this sub. This fucking disgusting sub. I KNOW some of you will understand, but then there will be those people who will say I'm not being EMPATHETIC AND INSIGHTFUL ENOUGH, NOT TRYING TO "RECOVER" ENOUGH whilst talking in a forum for NARCISSISTS. The people who sit on their high horse who really relate because they were rude to their coworker once, and they "totally are narcissistic" because they felt superior to others that one time they won a medal at school. Those people who will give ACTUAL narcissists advice like "oh you gotta be better, you're *hurting others*" like DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CONDITION MEANS? FUCK OFF, NOBODY CARES. Tell me what **I** get out of it, tell me why **I** should care about your words.If you relate, THAT'S FINE! BE A PIECE OF SHIT WITH ME.And guess what: Ff you hate this post, THAT'S FINE! Tell me that my seething rage is weakness. Tell me that my inability to be authentic is pathetic. Tell me I disgust you. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT, THAN SOMEONE SAY: "But what about the others uwu?"I don't want advice. I just wanted to complain. Maybe some people will *actually* relate, atm I don't care. I will go back to being pro-social, it's best for me. But I fucking hate feeling sedated all the time by the expectations of others, and being myself not being "okay", especially since those people aren't fucking worth my time anyways.If you offer me "insight" I will straight up insult you, I'm well aware of what I'm doing and what I need to do.I was texting an irl friend, and thought I'd try to be a bit vulnerable. I told them that a text of theirs offended me a bit, because they (correctly) assumed something was making me insecure. I also told them they were right and it's not a rational thing.They didn't even react negatively, just said they got to know me over the years a little bit, but I got overwhelmed by REALLY strong anxiety and got nauseous for letting the mask slip just a little. My hands were shaking, I couldn't think and I'm still on edge. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST FOR ONCE IN MY GODDAMN LIFE TO SOMEONE THAT KNOWS MY FACE. FUCK THIS.Edit: Not my proudest moment. Went to sleep afterwards. Gonna leave it up, but yikes I hate having that on my account (esp. the comment lol).I just learned that a friend of mine finished his Master's degree. I quit university instead lol.That friend invited us to celebrate that. I know rationally that they're great, worked hard and deserve it. But I feel so insecure right now, I fucking want it to be me. All I wanna do is shittalk that, and I would probably be very sarcastic and rude at the party whilst destroying the mood. I hate that I think, that they think, they're better than me. HOW AM I MEANT TO GO TO A PARTY FOR SOMEONE ELSE, WHO JUST ACHIEVED SOMETHING I DIDN'T? THIS IS CRUEL.I don't wanna ruin this friendship by being a giant asshole. Please what the actual fuck do I do to not hate myself this hard rn and be a normal human being for once?Edit: I guess the advice by Bath\_Kol pretty much fixed it, I just repeated that for a while lol. That was quick.I remember being a fairly young child. I remember seeing the beauty of the world. Loving people and animals. Being sad when a pet died. Being disturbed when another kid would hurt a spider. Wanting to help people just because I can.I remember being overly emotional even. Being fragile.Then, years of trauma. Being abandoned by everyone who took care of my emotional needs. Being ignored except if I got good grades at the end of the year. Hating life. Hating people.Now there's nothing. Whoever I was is gone, replaced by this strange emptiness. A feeling I need to avoid. A hole to fill (hehe sexual joke here).I don't miss that person. I don't miss being honest even if it hurts me. I don't miss caring about other's needs. I don't miss being fragile. But I miss feeling secure, at least sometimes, with someone who cares. Knowing who I am without asking.I wouldn't trade my current state for what was, I just wish this would have never been necessary in the first place. Ironic how "empaths" caused this, isn't it?Berry dramatic vulnerability, 7/10 on the "pity me scale".Hi! Sorry about the long post. New account for obvious reasons.Ever since I was a kid, I knew something was wrong with me, but the only thing I really understood was that I had a lot of social anxiety.I have been in therapy and on meds for depression + social anxiety. I took meds for only about a year (i forgot to take them and decided to just stop lol). The anxiety meds did nothing, the antidepressants were pretty good though. I was also diagnosed with ADHD by a psychologist, and then a psychiatrist but I don't take meds for that so it doesn't really matter.Anyways I was in therapy for about six years with 2 different therapists. I stopped after I felt I wasn't making progess, so right now I'm not in therapy.The problem is that my therapists, though probably pretty good with some patients, never really understood me (to be fair, I didn't either). We talked about some traumatic experiences and my emotional state, but I felt like my core symptoms (anxiety especially) never improved much. I told the second therapist that I don't have a lot of affective empathy, but despite that, it never amounted to much.There was one thing that therapy (unfortunately) did for me though: It made me realise I felt shame. I had a bit of a mental breakdown at that time, realising I don't know who I am etc. and prying into trauma and my mind all the time seems to have caused that. It was very unsettling and alien to me, I never felt that before and literally had to google what that emotion was since my next appointment was almost a week away. Shame is the worst feeling I ever had.I was in therapy for about 9 months afterwards. The shame never got significantly better (though I had a hard time confronting it, can't blame it all on the therapist I guess). But it did make me realise it was at the core of my anxiety.**Now to NPD / Pathological Narcissism**Since I had a lot of anxiety all my life, my narcissistic tendencies are really well hidden. I'm definitely grandiose on the inside and think that I'm better than most people (except those who I respect and who respect/admire me as well), but I never saw that as a problem (I still don't really care lol). If people who I respect slight me, that changes and they become part of the "beneath me" pile, paired with vengeful feelings etc. The anxiety taught me to mask well though, I can even admit flaws (usually things that aren't important or get sympathy).I try to control how people I interact with view me. Especially if someone has a negative opinion I discredit them (or what they might say) preemtively or try to ensure they don't interact with people "who matter". This is something I do, but it feels semi-conscious (I know I'm doing that, but it's pretty automatic). I also change how I act and what I say depending on the person or group, but usually in minor ways (I won't invent a new personality or some shit, but keep certain opinions to myself, agree with things I might not do on my own, get a bit more introverted/extroverted etc.). Basically I tend to modify reality with exaggeration / undertatements a lot, often times I omit some information, sometimes I flat out lie. This usually doesn't cause many problems since I mix in enough truth or make it believable / hard to disprove if I lie. This usually feels automatic, but I do it as a planned thing sometimes as well if I got myself into trouble / caught for something.My anxiety symptoms and depressed moods are VERY tied to how people view me. If I get praise/respect, or I'm the (positive) center of attention I become very confident. If I don't get that for a while I become very anxious, self hating and ashamed (thanks for that last one therapist, very cool!). I need regular reinforcement of people admiring me.I had a time where I was socially fairly isolated due to anxiety for prolonged periods. This was when I got prescribed depression meds. I believe the core reason was NPD, and not getting validation, but it *looked* like a regular depressive episode. The antidepressants worked really well, I became more outgoing, and when I stopped taking meds I never got even close to that level (I think I unconsciously built a network for validation aka a good social circle, so it wasn't possible to get there anymore).Criticism tends to make me very angry (except from the people "who matter", they can somewhat criticize me since I respect them enough. I still get a bit angry, but I know they respect me), though I rarely lash out since my anxiety is keeping most of my symptoms hidden. If I enact revenge it is usually in a covert, backstabby way.I fantasize about being rich / famous every single day, and that seems to be the basis for some of my grandiosity (I'm bascially entitled because I will be successful, but also because I'm smart etc.).I have no idea who I am, everything I do is to improve myself (to be successful), and to be successful so that people will admire and envy me. What exactly I do to achieve that doesn't matter much as long as it's respected.I can have hobbies on my own, but I always have an imaginary audience I perform for. E.g. I sometimes make music. I don't share it (it is bad), but I fantasize about how people will respect me for it, interview me, etc.I don't care much for most people, I don't feel bad for them if something bad happens to them (like their parent/dog dies etc.), I can actually get kinda annoyed and bored talking about their feelings and their life (but sometimes I find certain things very interesting, as I want a great understanding on how humans work). I still listen to them, since I know it's required for friendships and I understand that they are suffering, but I don't get very invested. If I hurt someone (and it has consequences, esp. if it might affect my relationships / status) I can feel shame. I am not sadistic though, so I usually have no reason to hurt people. If I do it's one of those semi-conscious self defense tactics to protect my ego & status. I try to be conscious of and avoid them since it's better for myself not to hurt people and I don't want to feel shame for the (mostly social) repercussions.One last thing (that kinda makes me question some things about it being NPD): I tend to have weak boundaries when people ask for help. I expect praise of course, and if they aren't thankful they become part of the "hate list" and then the "beneath me list" so to speak. But I feel like they will judge me negatively if I say "no", which causes a lot of anxiety, so I usually go along with it. On the other hand if people try to hold me accountable for things I should have done / fucked up I might actually lash out, so idk, seems like there are some boundaries that get heavily enforced if it threatens my self-esteem, but I have a hard time being as selfish as I actually feel on the inside.I'm gonna cut the symptoms here, there's more but the post would become the length of a book.Anyways I'm fairly certain it's NPD (I certainly have high levels of narcissism). I'm open to other suggestions on what might be going on, but I don't feel like the other cluster B things fit very well (I would have preferred ASPD but that's just not the reality lol). I kinda tend to mind-fuck myself and others, so I could also be too biased with this to make an accurate assessment, but this behavior and the feelings have been very consistent. I became aware I might be narcissistic about a year ago and things haven't changed much, so I think I'm probably not just mind-fucking myself.The question is whether I should get a diagnosis and if you agree it might be NPD or if I'm missing something. I feel like I can handle a lot on my own since I became more self aware, but I still struggle with shame and anxiety. Those 2 feelings are the only reason I would consider therapy, but past therapy didn't do much for that.I also don't want people in my life to find out. Narcissism has very negative connotations even if you're trying not to be a dickhead unnecessarily. Not sure if a diagnosis could fuck me over. At the same time, I want some confirmation to finally figure out what is wrong with me since, whatever my condition is, is not fun at all (except the \[supposed\] grandiosity, it's the best).Anyways some questions:\- Do you think this is NPD?\- Do you have a suggestion on how to "reality check" my internal experience?\- Do you recommend getting a diagnosis? If so, why?\- Do you have any tips on anxiety and shame that aren't "confront them and self love"? I tried that for almost a year with almost no effect.Thanks for reading my post (if you did). I know it's a lot of words but it is the culmination of years of self reflection. I just wanna know what's wrong with me and how to tackle the 2 worst emotions in my life.I will do my best to be cordial in the comments, but I'm kind of narcissistic about being narcissistic if that makes sense. Please forgive me if I get defensive if you question that lol, I really am trying to have an open mind though.Edit: Btw I'm 25 yrs old, I'm not going through a teenage identity crisis lmaoAdditional things in case you're interested:[NPI Results](https://psytests.org/result?v=dtrbVE0j)[PNI Results](https://psytests.org/result?v=dtriWp5ar1SQ)NPI: 30codependency: 6OCD: 1.
    I (37M, big dick, *hot*) used to date this bitch (30F, floppy tits, poor, ugly) for some reason. I guess she was good at sex or something because we ended up having a kid together who I will call Fuckface. Unfortunately my bitchy skank wife wasn’t loyal and she let some other dude fuck her while they ended up having another kid together, i will nickname this kid CheaterCum. FF is a boy and CC is a girl btw.Because I have a big dick and I’m hot, I make sure to buy the manliest clothes possible for fuckface, because if he’s going to carry my DNA he needs to start acting like it. CheaterCum unfortunately has become a little feminist and complained that these clothes are too hardcore manly for her, and that she wants some unisex or girly clothes and toys. She is currently manipulating her ugly golddigger mom to get her to blow up at me, which did eventually happen unfortunately. My ex wife called me selfish for only caring about fuckface and not cheatercum as well. I snapped back and called her every misogynistic name I could think of. AITA?reference post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/s/iFoR8veNFH. if anyone remembers me from my other posts here you would know my mom isn't really a good mom or a good person in general. i worried about this future but now that my mom has vaguely talked about it i worry my suspicions are true. i refuse to let myself be in that kind of housing as long as i can avoid it and i refuse to be in my mothers control or the control of anyone who isn't my lover. my life plans were to be with her, and now i feel like those plans are being threatened... i need to escape how do i get out. i really only feel love for my dad who i am practically the splitting image of. i feel no love for my mom and wouldn't care if she ended up dead. maybe it's just cuz of my trauma but who knows. my mom's been a very difficult person to get along with since i was 14, so much that i cut contact with her for 10 months and lived with my dad until he died and i was forced to move back in with her. no family members that i trust are willing to let me live with them because i struggle with self care that they aren't willing to help me with.anyways this is a list of things my mom has done in the last couple of years\- threatened to kick me out multiple times. i'm pretty sure this is a credible threat as my old therapist has told me that my mom was considering it. and it's because i can't work due to my disabilities and i'm not enrolled in school\- going off of the first point, she hasn't enrolled me since my dad died. it's been 2 years since i've been in school and i am severely behind for kids my age\- claimed my insurance is broken in a way that i later on learned is literally not possible, just to avoid taking me to doctors other than my old therapist who stopped being able to accept my insurance. \- has told me multiple times that i don't have empathy or compassion (i have very limited amounts of it due to my disorders but those feelings are still there) because i forget to clean up my cat's litter boxes\- has accused me of abusing her\- this was more than 2 years ago, but my stepdad would sexually abuse me a lot and my mom refused to believe me until after my dad filed a police charge, claiming that i didn't "seem distressed"\- constantly accuses me of being selfish whenever i forget to do chores\- once berated me in public about forgetting to do chores, got mad when i started crying and told me i was "playing the victim". i have autism and i am very prone to misunderstandings. especially when i am talking to people who don't have or understand social difficulties, sometimes when i nicely ask them to clarify what they mean by something (ie. what does 'ftw' mean) some people sound annoyed. or when i ask if they are being sarcastic they sound annoyed. why is that?. i'm AFAB and i am a relatively feminine person and i've identified as FtM before and found that wasn't a fit. i enjoy presenting as feminine, having breasts and all that. i don't want to be a manbut i identify with he/him and i desire bottom surgery... it feels strange to be like this. i don't fit in with cis people yet i feel like a poser coming here in a way. i considered HRT but i realized the only thing i don't truly like about my body is my genitalia, but i don't want to present as masculine at all. ever since i was 13 i wished i was born male but also still wanted to be able to transition as female if that were the case. it's a strange thought, i know, but it's just how i felt.my dysphoria has evened out but i do say i find discomfort with the idea of having female genitalia. but i don't feel dysphoric about most of the stuff that makes me unmistakably feminine and i enjoy being a girly girl and all that.gender is a confusing mess and i dont know anymore. would this actually make me trans or am i just odd?. i'm AFAB and i am a relatively feminine person and i've identified as FtM before and found that wasn't a fit. i enjoy presenting as

hello. i am about to be 18 in january and live in florida for some context. i also have special needs, primarily autismduring the past two years i have basically been severely isolated from the outside world due to my mom. i have not been enrolled in school for 2 years and my last completed grade was eigth.i desire to have some level of social interaction and to get the high school experience that my mom cheated me out of. i don't know if schools i reach out to will accept me and i would like to avoid CPS involvemen if possible. i want to avoid having to go down the GED route if possible but i don't know if it's even avoidable at this moment. do i have to go GED route or is it still possible to go to a typical public high school at this point?. a few years ago i moved out of my moms house to live with my dad due to my mom's abuse starting to make me feel unsafe. it was something i had considered for years but after that point i decided to just.. do it and get awaymy mom reported me living with my dad full time so that she wouldn't keep getting what would have been fraudulent child support checks, because my dad was the one who had me full time so he had no reason to be paying child support to someone who i did not live with anymore. she claimed that when she did this she no longer had any control over my insurance and that i would have to book appointments myself. i was and still am a teenager so this didn't make full sense to me.well since my dad died a couple of years ago i had to move back in with her and during that time she's somehow managed to get me a therapist but every other medical complaint was ignoredi just found out that the way she described my insurance being broken is not possible and that she lied to me... and i've been needing to get checked up for over a year and have asked to see a doctor multiple times, just for her to ignore me and lie to mei hate her. i just want to get out of here but i don't know where to go. to start i want to clarify i am a minor, so naturally my mother is supposed to have control over my health insurance since she is currently my sole legal guardian in december of 2020 i decided i wanted to live with my dad full time due to issues going on in my mom's home. my mom claims she told someone regarding child support about this so that she wouldn't be responsible for fraud regarding child support (before then, my dad was paying child support). she claims she was taken off of my insurance and i was listed as my own adult after that, which i have no clue if it's possible because i was a teenager at the time. my dad has never had paternal rights over me due to the fact that my parents were not married when i was born and he never bothered to seek them out. my dad died in october of 2021 and ever since i have lived with my mom full time. what i find confusing is how my mom has been able to get me a psychotherapist under this insurance without me having to do anything, but for everything else my mom has claimed that my insurance is broken and that she cannot get me a doctor because i am listed as my own adult. i have not seen a PCP in 2 years or anyone else other than someone from this specific office that my therapist worked at during that time period. i have no clue if my mom is just telling me lies to neglect me or if this is a legitimate issue that can happen with child support.to start i want to clarify i am a minor, so naturally my mother is supposed to have control over my health insurance since she is currently my sole legal guardianin december of 2020 i decided

the original mod team did. it's my most ethical way of getting supply. i wonder if anyone else does this.
    I am seeing a psychologist right now. I have become aware of my mental health issues. I believe I might have a mental illness. I was feeling very anxious this morning. It explains why I have been single my whole life. I probably have borderline personality disorder or factor 2 psychopathy. I don't commit any crimes though.. Unfortunately, I don't feel any emotional connection to anything. I don't have a sense of Self. I feel like other people are trying to control me all the time. Many times they succeed in controlling me. I don't have any mental boundaries. I am vulnerable. I don't create any image of other people in my mind. They only exist outside my mind. I still have emotions and empathy. I just recently started to look for a girlfriend. I am 5'8, 128 lbs, and 32 years old. Looking back, I might have been able to date more. However, I didn't take the opportunities. I only went on 3 dates in the past. It's awkward when strangers ask me because it is a hard question to answer. I have lived a chaotic lifestyle.. I am anti-feminism, but I'll talk about why I am anti-redpill and blackpill in this post. The redpill is a PUA worldview, and the blackpill is an incel worldview. I cannot relate to either of them. The redpill is toxic because it says most women between 18-29 sleep around with a small percent (20%) of "alpha" males. Then they seek a "beta" male provider after turning 30. It also says men have to dominating to keep women interested and attracted to them. They cannot be nice to attract women. It might apply to some women but not all. The blackpill is toxic because it says attracting women is based on looks. They believe the "alpha" males described by the redpill are successful because of their looks. The 80% of men women don't find physically attractive are doomed. I am a voluntarily celibate virgin. I participated on the virgin and ForeverAlone(FA) subs on Reddit. I wanted to see if I could relate to the people there. Most users there are involuntarily celibate. I couldn't relate to most of them. I made a post on the virgin sub about why I might get rejected in online dating. I said I might get rejected by some women for having a low income. One woman who commented on my post, has a disease called Parry-Romberg syndrome. She said she was bullied for being ugly in high school and insulted by customers at her job. It was definitely wrong for people to bully her for being ugly. She became a toxic person because of that. In my post, I said I was downvoted on FA for saying, "It's very rare for a man to be rejected by 100% of women he asks out." She said, "I do agree it is VERY rare for someone to get rejected by 100% of people, but you need to think about the intentions of those that accept. If you get rejected 95% of the time, what do the 5% see that the 95 don't? It's just a bit odd." I said I won't be suspicious of women who date me, without a valid reason. Then she said, "If you have no suspicion, then honestly I wish I lived your life because it's a fairly naive outlook. If 95% of people reject you and 5% suddenly don't, it s a pretty valid reason to be pretty suspicious of them. If you know you're completely undesirable (which frankly you need to be to have that split), then the few people that DO like you, it's fair to question. What do they want / see." This is how incels view dating. I told her I only need one woman to like me. I can tell if a woman likes me for myself, or for other reasons. If someone gets rejected by 95% of people it does not make them undesirable. She was trying to make me paranoid of women.Most involuntarily celibate people on those subreddits are toxic like this woman. The reason for their toxicity is not misogyny. The mainstream media and feminists are wrong about that. According to Professor Sam Vaknin, most incels are covert narcissists. He says that in this [video](https://youtu.be/KDrcf4ZVPNg?si=7A0DGtnOZ5xJvXh6), around the 1 hour 9 minute mark. Most incels haven't been diagnosed yet. I think Professor Vaknin's analysis is pretty accurate. William Costello's research also points in the same direction. Covert narcissists also suffer from anxiety, depression, and loneliness. They are more toxic than normal men who feel lonely. I don't think it's wrong to help lonely men find friendships and relationships. However it is difficult to tell whether someone is a covert narcissist incel or a lonely person without mental illness. Why did I write this? There is a sentiment in MRA spaces of wanting to help incels. Most MRAs want to give them the benefit of the doubt. They think incels are good men who have been rejected by 100% of women. I don't buy into that. I have no intention to help incels. If others want to help them, fine. I wish them luck! &#x200B;. I'm against the red-pill and black-pill. I've noticed some men in MRA spaces subscribe to those worldviews. Some black-pillers have become MRAs because they think it will help them get laid. I think both of those pills are toxic, but feminism is still worse. The red-pill is toxic because it says women who are 18-29 sleep around with "alpha" males. Then they seek a "beta" male to settle down with. It also says men have to be dominating to attract women. They cannot be nice. The black-pill is similar to the red-pill, but it says the "alpha" males are all good looking. Men cannot improve their chances if they don't have the genetics.. The main reason I might get rejected in online dating is having a low income. I don't think I will be rejected based on my looks or personality. In the ForeverAlone sub, I said, "It's very rare for a man to be rejected by 100% of women he asks out." I got 17 downvotes for saying that. I think men who get rejected by 100% of women are very rare. I think it's normal to be rejected by most women. Good looking guys will also be rejected by 80-90% of women.. Abstract:Gender discrimination is often regarded as an important driver of women’s disadvantage in the labour market, yet earlier studies show mixed results. However, because different studies employ different research designs, the estimates of discrimination cannot be compared across countries. By utilizing data from the first harmonized comparative field experiment on gender discrimination in hiring in six countries, we can directly compare employers’ callbacks to fictitious male and female applicants. The countries included vary in a number of key institutional, economic, and cultural dimensions, yet we found no sign of discrimination against women. This cross-national finding constitutes an important and robust piece of evidence. Second, we found discrimination against men in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK, and no discrimination against men in Norway and the United States. However, in the pooled data the gender gradient hardly differs across countries. Our findings suggest that although employers operate in quite different institutional contexts, they regard female applicants as more suitable for jobs in female-dominated occupations, *ceteris paribus*, while we find no evidence that they regard male applicants as more suitable anywhere. Gunn Elisabeth Birkelund, Bram Lancee, Edvard Nergård Larsen, Javier G Polavieja, Jonas Radl, Ruta Yemane, Gender Discrimination in Hiring: Evidence from a Cross-National Harmonized Field Experiment, *European Sociological Review*, Volume 38, Issue 3, June 2022, Pages 337–354, [https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcab043](https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcab043) Abstract:Audits of tenure-track hiring reveal faculty prefer to hire female applicants over males. However, audit data do not control for applicant quality, allowing some to argue women are hired at higher rates because they are more qualified. To test this, Williams and Ceci (2015) conducted an experiment demonstrating a preference for hiring women over identically-qualified men. While their findings are consistent with audits, they raise the specter that faculty may prefer women over even more-qualified men, a claim made recently. We evaluated this claim in the present study: 158 faculty ranked two men and one woman for a tenure-track-assistant professorship, and 94 faculty ranked two women and one man. In the former condition, the female applicant was slightly weaker than her two male competitors, although still strong; in the other condition the male applicant was slightly weaker than his two female competitors, although still strong. Faculty of both genders and in all fields preferred the more-qualified men over the slightly-less-qualified women, and they also preferred the stronger women over the slightly-less-qualified man. This suggests that preference for women among identically-qualified applicants found in experimental studies and in audits does not extend to women whose credentials are even slightly weaker than male counterparts. Thus these data give no support to the twin claims that weaker males are chosen over stronger females or weaker females are hired over stronger males. Ceci SJ, Williams WM. Women have substantial advantage in STEM faculty hiring, except when competing against more-accomplished men. Frontiers in Psychology. 2015 ;6:1532. DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01532. PMID: 26539132; PMCID: PMC4611984. I wanted to see if there was discrimination against men in job hiring. Five women were hired in my department this year and no men. I work in a lab. I live in the U.S. Some studies also said women are discriminated. It depends on which industry. I'm not sure if men are truly discriminated or not.. When I got a blowjob, I lasted for 5-10 minutes. I don't know if it would be different for vaginal sex. I know some men here think they won't ever get laid. I'm just asking hypothetically. How long do you think you would last during sex? Premature ejaculation is less than 3 minutes.. I created a profile on an Indian dating website. I'm an Indian American guy. I got messaged by two women from India. I didn't respond to them. One woman was kind of hot, but she was 40. Both of them probably wanted a greencard sponsorship, to move to the U.S. I only prefer an American citizen.I noticed some other things about the women's profiles. Some of the profiles were created by the women's parents. Those profiles had higher standards for their partner's income. Most profiles created by the women didn't have such high standards. I will make profiles on other dating websites too.. I started going to therapy in March this year. My first therapist abandoned me. Then I found a psychologist. I see him once per month. I started therapy because I got violent thoughts towards my uncle. He passed away in 2021.My parents got divorced when I was 10 and father got custody of me. I haven't seen my mother since the divorce. My parents were physically abusive. They slapped me when I misbehaved. My father passed away when I was 17.Then I went to university. I had a hard time deciding what to major in. Another uncle suggested I should major in biomedical engineering. I didn't like his idea. I was pissed off that he was trying to control me. I chose nursing. Then half way through, I switched to biology. I also took some time off. I graduated with my degree in 2020.I don't have any long term goals. I am not able to plan for the future. I've had like 8 jobs since I started working. Now, I want to stick with one job for a long time, if I can. I do things impulsively a lot.I've never been in a romantic relationship. I don't have casual sex either. I have decided to wait till marriage for sex. I briefly dated one girl in 2015. It didn't work out between us. Now, I have changed my preferences as well.I have a hard time keeping friends. I got rid of one friend because I lost respect for him. For example: when I was dating that one girl, he asked me if I was in love after the first date. He also called her my girlfriend after a couple of dates. He asked me if I thought she was "the one." I don't fall in love that quickly. He thought there was nothing wrong with watching porn. I didn't want to be addicted to porn. He was addicted to tobacco as well.I haven't talked to some of my aunts in over a year. Last time I saw them was in 2021. They were at my uncle's funeral. The uncle who I mentioned earlier died from cancer. I was happy to hear that he died. If I had to live with him, I might have gone to prison for assaulting him. I knew he was abusive and others in my family did not.The reason I don't talk to my relatives is because they disagree with me on some important things. They disagreed with me about what major to select in college. They will disagree with me about who I should marry and what career to have. I just prefer they don't give me any unsolicited advice.I think I have some narcissistic traits like grandiosity. I'm not sure if I am a narcissist. I think I have emotional empathy. I don't curse a lot. My life has been pretty chaotic.Edit: The uncle who suggested I should do biomedical engineering is not the same as the other uncle who died. LolNPI score: 6/40Codependent score: 3OCD score: 3&#x200B;. I started going to therapy in March. My first therapist abandoned me. Then I got a different one. My current psychologist is pretty nice. I've been feeling emotionally unregulated recently. Some memories from my past trigger me. I experience a bunch of emotions throughout the day and I can't control them. I watched a video about Borderline personality disorder and resonate with some it. I also have emotional dis-regulation like them. I don't have other traits that borderlines do like abandonment anxiety. The video said borderlines have trouble forming introjects. An introject is a representation of people or an object in the mind. I also have trouble with that. It's hard for me to form an image of others in my mind. It's harder for me to maintain relationships because of that. &#x200B;. I'm 32, and I never had girlfriend. I believe in waiting till marriage for sex. I have dated before. I've also had girls ask me out. I rejected them. I am seeing a psychologist. I don't have any mental illness.. As an MRA, I don't believe in supporting incels. Both incels and feminists are toxic. In another sub, I made the following comment:"Incel is a meaningless insult because it's used against married men and women who are sexually active. It is also used against anyone who disagrees with feminists because they don't have arguments. Most of the time it's used against non-incels.Yes, it is true that society doesn't care about men's suffering. However, I think most self identified incels are covert narcissists. Professor Sam Vaknin said incels are covert narcissists in this [video](https://youtu.be/KDrcf4ZVPNg?si=K68Pjaxn06xAVAQ5), around the 1 hr 9 minute mark. I agree with Professor Vaknin because he has studied narcissistic personality disorder for 25+ years. William Costello's research is pointing in the same direction.I think it's good to help lonely men get into relationships and friendships. However, it is difficult to tell the difference between incels (covert narcissists) and lonely men. Covert narcissists also have loneliness, depression, and anxiety. They are a lot more toxic than people who are merely lonely. Covert narcissists want to use people for "narcissistic supply."I don't think anyone can help self-identified incels. Covert narcissists don't like to get rejected because narcissists think of themselves as God. God doesn't get rejected. Narcissists don't want help from other people. I think many feminists are also narcissists. Their narcissism is accepted by society.I don't think any single or lonely men should identify as incels. Most lonely men are not narcissists." &#x200B;. I was briefly friends with a girl in college. She called me gay one time. She also said I am passive. I was confused why she said that. We agreed to only be friends. I wasn't attracted to her. One day she called me and yelled at me. I was confused about that. I had not done anything to her. We stopped being friends after that.I think it does. I would have to ask a lot of women out. Most of them would say no. Then go on dates with some who say yes. Then decide which one to be in a relationship with. It does require lots of time, money, and effort. My dating pool is also small. I don't identify as FA. I just have a realistic view of dating. Some men might get lucky and the first woman they ask becomes their girlfriend.. I wouldn't lie to someone I am dating about being a virgin because if I lied, it would mean I care about what she thinks. I don't feel like I am being vulnerable if I tell a woman about it, because I have a good reason to be a virgin. Some women might look down on me, but it's fine.&#x200B;. https://www.youtube.com/live/lPR-Bnfandg?si=SCmWvLSwkqiH3ylt. I dated a girl in 2015. I was 24 back then. I had a friend who was in his 40s, divorced, with two sons. He started calling her my girlfriend after the first date. I thought that was weird. He also asked me if I was falling in love with her. One time we were hanging out, and he asked me if I thought she was the one. I was confused by what he said. I told him no.My friend knew I was a virgin. He also knew I wasn't dating anyone else at the time. He probably assumed that I would fall in love very quickly. Being an older virgin doesn't mean I would fall in love quickly. It didn't work out between me and that girl. Now, I have different preferences in women.One of my classmates in high school role-played with me about what I would say to a girl in college. I thought that was weird because I am not autistic.One girl in 9th grade asked me if I had girlfriend. I said no. Then she asked me why. I told her I was too young for a girlfriend at the time.Another classmate asked me if I wanted to go to a sex party. I told him no.. In my old Reddit account, a feminist messaged me and told me I have a sadistic hatred for women. She read my posts from here. I don't hate women, but I dislike feminists as a group. I dislike feminists for being misandrists. Feminists include both men and women. I have a neutral view of women. I think some of them are good and some are bad. I don't think *most* women are good because that is **unrealistic**. Society believes most women are good. I think that is a wrong view to have. We cannot know how many are good and how many are bad. The same goes for men. As a group, I dislike feminists because I don't know which ones are good and which ones are bad. Some prominent feminists were openly misandrist. For example, Andrea Dworkin believed all sex between men and women is rape. It was pretty clear she hated men. Probably she wasn't getting laid much. LolI don't think most feminists know much about their own religion. Anti-feminists know more about feminism because they were feminists before. Feminists support an evil agenda without being aware of it. I'm not a MGTOW. I don't think avoiding women is the solution. It is definitely possible to find a good woman to marry. People can also be in a relationship without marriage.. I used to post here under my old reddit account. I deleted that. I might delete this one too, after a while. I think it's awkward when people ask me, "Why haven't you had a girlfriend before?" In my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/comments/16xdutt/why_was_my_coworker_shocked_to_hear_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), my coworker asked me why. Some people ask it because they want to get to know you. Some people ask it to make you feel uncomfortable. I think my coworker was toxic. I was asked that by a few other girls as well. They were just trying to get to know me. I have briefly dated before, but never had a girlfriend. I believe in waiting till marriage for sex. I can do other stuff like kissing. I've become a little pickier as I got older. I think I'm less shy than before. I think "normal" people should already know the reason why any guy has been single or is currently single. I know the reasons for people being single in general.. In 2018, I worked at a nursing home. I was working in a kitchen. One of my coworkers randomly asked me if I had a girlfriend before. I said no. She was shocked to hear to this. I told her I had not met the right person. I was confused about why she was shocked.I have an idea why she might have gotten shocked. I want to hear from you first. What do you think is the reason she was shocked?. I watched a couple videos by Shoe0nHead ([video 1](https://youtu.be/rQv8VuLpKN4?si=wS8lXkYGGMH6WYQW) and [video 2](https://youtu.be/qVKvEaokV6I?si=veat4ynhhFJQ8Xi6)) about men's loneliness. In the first video, Shoe talks about why men might be lonely. She gives the following reasons: technology, social media, news media, porn, dating apps, capitalism (low wages), housing crisis, social alienation, lack of community, left not speaking to men, and no purpose. In the second video, she gets hated for making the first video. The misandrists came out of nowhere. All the feminists on social media are misandrists and mentally ill in some way. If a feminist says they believe in equality they are delusional or pathological liars. I agree with most of the factors Shoe listed. I disagree with her about technology and social media. I don't think those contribute to male loneliness. I would add misandry to the list. Not everyone hates men, but there is a bias against men. The media has feminist narratives. There is also the empathy gap. My criticism of Shoe is that she uses feminist terminology. In the second video, she used the word "incel" as an insult against some men who criticized her. I think those men were wrong for criticizing her but she shouldn't have used feminist terms. I don't know if she is a feminist or not. In the first video, Hunter Avallone said men don't have friends because they aren't vulnerable enough. I disagree with that. There's a difference between vulnerability and openness. Most men I've met don't have trouble expressing emotions. Vulnerability should only be shown to a few people, after getting to know them. It is important to be open to make friends.I watched another [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/yd0kDoMY3-E?si=lrx2gIC3QLnzsFZs) from the Honey Badgers. They said good men don't approach women because they don't want to make them feel uncomfortable. Men read messages from women who said they don't like being approached by strangers. At the same time, men get shamed for not approaching. I agree with the Honey Badgers about that. Incel stands for involuntary celibate, but it is debatable who really is an incel or not. If someone self identifies as an incel, but others think they can get laid, are they an incel? I haven't seen too many men who I think would qualify as an incel. Maybe a lot of men subjectively feel like they are. I read a [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-016-9478-3) about involuntary singlehood. Voluntarily single people reported lower levels of romantic loneliness, less mental health problems, and better mental health. They still had a few issues. Women reported more romantic loneliness.I read some comments on another sub. There was a post about the double standards of misandry and misogyny online. The poster said misogyny is not as common online as misandry. Women can say misandrist things in some subs without getting banned. I agreed with the poster. I didn't comment on the post. Guess what happened? A lot of ignorant left-wing feminists commented. They wrote very dumb comments. One of the commenters assumed the poster was a conservative. The poster didn't say he was a conservative. They also said dumb things like misandry doesn't kill. Why do people assume someone is a conservative when they call out misandry? I am a liberal and I notice misandry all the time. There was misandry in that thread. Feminism is not really left wing or right wing. This [video](https://youtu.be/zJr4rZazQy4?si=-5Win3XK11u8dKPg) talks about all the political ideologies on the left and the right. Feminism is not listed in the video. As a liberal, I can agree with conservatives on some things. I am still a liberal. Being against feminism doesn't make me a conservative either.. The left doesn't care about men's issues because they have been brainwashed by feminism to believe women were oppressed in the past. They believe women are still behind in some ways. Feminists think the wage gap is still real. Feminists think 25% of women are raped or sexually harassed, at least once in their life (in USA). The right also doesn't care about men for other reasons. They believe men's problems can be solved if men act like strong masculine motherfuckers. In feminist theory, women are less powerful than men. Men cannot have issues because the patriarchy benefits men. Feminists also say the patriarchy harms men. The patriarchy cannot benefit men and harm men at the same time. It's gotta be one or the other. I think feminism is similar to left-wing authoritarianism. Left-wing authoritarianism is about destroying the group that is oppressing another group. The oppression can be real or imagined. In one study, left-wing authoritarianism was associated with sub-clinical narcissism and psychopathy. The study uses self reporting assessments. Here is the abstract:"In two pre-registered studies, we investigated the relationship of left-wing authoritarianism with the ego-focused trait of narcissism. Based on existing research, we expected individuals with higher levels of left-wing authoritarianism to also report higher levels of narcissism. Further, as individuals with leftist political attitudes can be assumed to be striving for social equality, we expected left-wing authoritarianism to also be positively related to prosocial traits, but narcissism to remain a significant predictor of left-wing authoritarianism above and beyond those prosocial dispositions. We investigated our hypotheses in two studies using cross-sectional correlational designs. Two nearly representative US samples (Study 1: *N* = 391; Study 2: *N* = 377) completed online measures of left-wing authoritarianism, the Dark Triad personality traits, and two variables with a prosocial focus (i.e., altruism and social justice commitment). In addition, we assessed relevant covariates (i.e., age, gender, socially desirable responding, and virtue signaling). The results of multiple regression analyses showed that a strong ideological view, according to which a violent revolution against existing societal structures is legitimate (i.e., anti-hierarchical aggression), was associated with antagonistic narcissism (Study 1) and psychopathy (Study 2). However, neither dispositional altruism nor social justice commitment was related to left-wing anti-hierarchical aggression. Considering these results, we assume that some leftist political activists do not actually strive for social justice and equality but rather use political activism to endorse or exercise violence against others to satisfy their own ego-focused needs. We discuss these results in relation to the dark-ego-vehicle principle."Krispenz, A., Bertrams, A. Understanding left-wing authoritarianism: Relations to the dark personality traits, altruism, and social justice commitment. *Current Psychology* (2023). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04463-x?trk=public\_post\_comment-text](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04463-x?trk=public_post_comment-text)In another [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20200212024710id_/http://indianmentalhealth.com/pdf/2019/vol6-issue1/OR10%20SANYA%20PRERNA.pdf), feminists scored higher in narcissism than non-feminists. They also scored lower on tolerance for different opinions. The sample size was small. I haven't found studies about the mental illness of feminists. It's probably a taboo topic in academia. As a liberal, I don't believe all hierarchies cause oppression all the time. Sometimes some people are oppressed, but not always. For example, my company has a hierarchy and I don't believe I'm oppressed by the CEO. It's just a stupid way of looking at the world. I also hate people who pretend to be victims. It's bad for people who are real victims because it makes it harder to believe them. People will start to suspect if the real victims are lying. &#x200B;&#x200B;. I have read a lot of comments from feminists on social media. In my old Reddit account, I was messaged by feminists who said they hated men. Feminists have created a negative image of themselves in my mind. Now I can't think of anything positive about them. I associate negative adjectives in my mind to describe them.When I meet women in real life, I still treat them as individuals. It's hard to figure out how many are misandrists in society. One of my coworkers was talking shit about her ex-husband. I think she was also at fault for getting divorced. She did take responsibility for choosing the wrong man. She also made a few generalizations about men.I have read a lot of comments from feminists on social media. In my old Reddit account, I was messaged by feminists who said they hated men.

She also made a few generalizations about men.I recently watched this [video](https://youtu.be/zJr4rZazQy4?si=Yt7veCWfG1QqDhpM). The guy in the video does a good job of explaining all the ideologies. There are at least 50 ideologies on the left and the right. I identify as a liberal democrat, according to the diagram in the video. It falls under left-libertarian. Then I watched other videos about American [liberalism](https://youtu.be/mCPeNXzf7Dw?si=of5qPSA6j0gfjKS4), [Marxism](https://youtu.be/BFEeHPYp7sg?si=XBV0vo8S7tHH_FNS), and [wokeness](https://youtu.be/4JX4bsrj178?si=Wdj63xjuwZH8M0My). The video about wokeness said Marxism is against liberalism. Wokeness is rooted in Marxism. As a liberal, I hate Marxism. I think it's a very toxic ideology because it says the upper class is the oppressor of the lower class. In the video, Ryan also talks about feminism in the context of Marxism. Feminism in the context of Marxism is: The power dynamics in patriarchal society necessarily means men are the oppressors and women are the oppressed. I think the core ideology of feminism is Marxist. There are different branches of feminism, but the core ideology is still Marxist in my opinion. There is no such thing as "liberal" feminism. Marxism and feminism are both narcissistic ideologies. According to the DSM, narcissists fantasize about unlimited power and or success. They feel entitled to special treatment without doing anything for it. Marxism and feminism seem like empathetic ideologies superficially, but I don't think they are. They are mostly about acquiring power. Marxism is a type of left wing authoritarianism in my opinion. I read a [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04463-x?trk=public_post_comment-text), which said left-wing authoritarianism is correlated with narcissism and psychopathy. Some [studies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13815841671629714702&hl=en&as_sdt=0,36) say feminists are less tolerant of other perspectives and score higher on narcissism. There aren't too many studies about the correlation between feminism and narcissism yet. As an American liberal, I believe in equality. I think misandry is rooted in Marxism, Feminism, left-wing authoritarianism, and dark triad traits. Those ideologies have no place in liberal societies. It's possible for some people to be misandrist without identifying with those ideologies. I'm talking about cultural/systemic misandry.I read an article today about misandry. It's on [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com) for free. Here is the abstract:"No published science paper demonstrates misogyny exists. Data on both implicit and explicit gender attitudes shows males substantially favouring females – philogyny – or, at worst, gender neutrality.

The mode whereby sexism supposedly causes harm -- stereotyping (stereotype threat) -- has been debunked; likewise inter- sexual dominance, removing any theoretical basis.

I won't be on Reddit very often. I think learning about men's issues is bad for mental health. If you are a man, it definitely is. Feminists don't care about men's issues. If they did, there would be more positive changes occurring for men. It's a futile exercise to debate feminists. It's better for them to wake up by themselves. I identify as anti-feminism, not anti-feminist. Anti-feminist sounds like I am against a group of people. I'm not against any group of people's rights. Anti-feminism sounds like I am against the ideology, which I am. I guess that's the proper term. I have been reading articles from New Male Studies. It is a journal about men's issues.

    Hi, I'm 26F, and was diagnosed with bpd about two years ago and have been on mood stabilizer meds ever since. I've always had little to no empathy. I don't have sympathy either. I just don't feel it and I don't know what it feels like. Intimacy makes me feel repulsed and i know I have ego issues. I feel powerful when I inflict pain in others. It boosts my ego. I used to beat up my cousin and friends when I was a kid. I pushed my cousins stroller into a tv and he has a permanent scar from that. I know at that time I felt nothing but I have apologised now but not out of guilt or remose Just because logically I thought that was true right thing to do. I have problems with keeping friendships but no problems making friends. I get bored of people really easily especially when they show me love. When they don't, I consider it a challenge to get them to love me and they usually do. I am conventionally attractive and am I doctor so up until now no man has ever denied me which I guess has further boosted my ego. I have only felt guilty once in my life when I cheated on my husband. I'm also a serial cheater where I've cheated on each and every one of my relationships. I like seeing people in emotional pain. I can't stand people crying Infront of me especially men. They come off as losers but at the same time I consider it a challenge to make them cry. I like manipulating people to get what I want and I'm only nice to people so they like the fake facade I put up. I love when men tell me I've ruined their lives and most of them never date after me. I know things are wrong with me more than just my bpd. I used to have a fearful abandonment but I just ghosted my last boyfriend because he was being very clingy after I cheated on him so now I'm single. NPI 39Codependency 8Ocd 2. I'm going to be completing my housejob in August and giving my part 1 in November. I think in the middle of that, AKU is going to be conducting their residency admission exams. Can someone please tell me what to study for that? The course outline? I really want to get in so I want to start preparing earlyAny groups I can join?. I'm on month 2 of leaving but I'm still experiencing fogginess when it comes to my memory. I do have a mental illness which could be a big reason for it but I'm medicated for that so I wonder if it's the weed's lingering effect. I also have been waking up multiple times in the night since I quit when before I would sleep like a log. Is this normal? What else can I expect?. So I'm appearing for my psychiatry exam hopefully in August. I'm currently doing my hj. Can someone please tell me what books you used and how you managed your time? I'm confused on whether I should do systems from first aid or brsI'm an average student but I've done attachments in psychiatry so I know a bit beforehand. I have a friend whose been my friend for 8 years. They were struggling with studying and they've already got 2 year backs in their mbbs (med school). Recently they got diagnosed with ocd and it made everything make sense, the not being able to study, stuck in the bathroom for hours, not being able to sleep at night cos of the compulsive thoughts. They have exams coming up and if they don't study, it'll mean another year back. They got prescribed meds for the ocd which they skipped taking in the middle which made their condition worse. I want to help them, and they really rely on me but they don't have the motivation to study. They have deficits in the wards and if they don't complete them then their examination form won't go and the exams are just around the corner and they haven't completed the course at all. Idk how to help tbhIts taking a toll on me cos I'm getting stressed for them. Their parents don't know about their second year back. I don't know how to convince them to attend wards and study. They rely on me in the sense that they'll call me in the middle of the night cos they can't sleep because of their ocd or send me 50 text messages completely bashing themselves and I just can't...I really care about this friend but I'm at odds on what to do.I (25F) was having a discussion with my boyfriend (31M) about what my boundaries should be concerning a friend who had feelings for me. Since I have a history of cheating, (which I'm not so proud of and want to actively work to not do in this relationship, but my boyfriend knows about it and wants to help) he advised that I cut the friend off. My said friend recently got diagnosed with OCD so I felt guilty cutting him off but at the same time he made moves on me even though he knew I had a boyfriend. Both my boyfriend and I came to the conclusion that I like seeking validation from men. Moving on with that thinking, we decided to put strict boundaries with each other. My boyfriend is basically a hermit and doesn't go anywhere. We decided that I wasn't going to meet men alone and that I wouldn't entertain men who would just gravitate towards me because I'm pretty (not being full of myself, stating a general opinion based on multiple people). He keeps giving me examples of how I would feel if he met a girl alone and how it would make me feel. Ngl it does make me feel jealous. In my previous relationships, men would just let me be friends with whoever I wanted. Mind you, I never cheated with my guy friends, only random people. So I find these boundaries a little unfair. But at the same time, I feel that might be my bpd because it doesn't like boundaries. And I'm getting paranoid that boyfriend is trying to control me and it'll only get worse from here. My ex husband was a narc and I'm still not over the paranoia that came after it. Can someone please tell me if I'm overthinking this?. Whenever I think about my childhood and all the stuff I went through, I can't help but feel pity for myself. It goes from feeling sorry for myself back when I was a kid to feeling sorry for myself as an adult. I'm 25 years old and my bpd is still in full swing. I want to learn how to look at myself differently without crying over how bad my life has been. I keep thinking that I've lost so much time and so many friendships because it's only recently that I got my diagnosis and started medication. My medicines keep increasing, right now I'm on prozac, another SSRI, an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. It's just all really hard.
    One of my good friends birthdays was yesterday and I was a little low on money because I spent it on some shoes earlier but I still wanted to make an effort for them. So I wrote a little note and got a picture of me framed and gave it to them as a gift. I thought it would be really nice so they could put it on the wall in their house or something. Well they ended up saying it was weird and narcissistic. Why? I don't see what's wrong with that.Before you think that is not possible, well too bad it is. Behold I am here and you have to take my word for it otherwise you're doubting my reasoning. Could I be unreasonable? Of course not! /sOkay but seriously what do I do now because I've read up on all the functions like comparing Ne/Si to Ni/Se and I hate comparing them because I just understand Ni and Si the most. Basically every function makes more sense to me when It's introverted.Yes I tend to be obsessive over my identity but please I'm not an INFP I'll commit sudoku if that was the case. Anything but INFP, please.Can we just study by ourselves until we feel comfortable enough and then buy an exam voucher and take the exam, resulting in passing because we're based, and then we get the CompTia A+ Cert. Or do we need to buy the CompTIA A+ certification training course which is like thousands and then take the exam?Pardon my ignorance this is an off the whim question - I have no IT experience just some young 20's noob trying to get an entry level position in tech because I'm tired of working at fast fashion retail.I don't think some INTJ's understand that using more Fe can be the reason you end up building a connection with someone and get that 'dream job". Just having qualifications won't cut it most of the time. Having Fe can you put you in advantageous situations **(EDIT: I'm not talking about manipulation)** and that would make you more successful. You could go up to someone who has cool shoes and you decide to openly compliment them and then turns out they're this CEO of some company that fits into your career path, had some positions available or could offer you the work experience you've been looking for.Using Fe can get you a better income, provide things to you and just benefit you in many ways. So logically, why would you not use Fe more in life? There's really no cons to using Fe, it seems most logical to use it because of how much it can offer you experiences and knowledge that you could gain from.As soon as I think "oh this job is interesting" I'll start researching about it, at first it seems fun and I'm curious to learn more. Then eventually I'll start seeing only negative things about it like I'll go on Reddit and look for topics about x job and people will be like "oh this sucks stay away you'll die I hate my job" and then YouTube stops recommending me the good things about the job and instead recommends me "top 5 reasons why this job IS NOT FOR YOU" "why you'll HATE this job!" and then I think damn okay..maybe this isn't for me.I'm left just feeling empty after finding a job I thought was cool...and history recycles. I don't know how to handle it. Any advice?. When I study the cognitive functions I feel most similar with INTJ but also with ENFP sometimes as a close second. In fact I've done some tests just for fun and they seem to predict me as INTJ with a close second being ENFP. However aren't these types..more or less far apart from one another? I don't really get how you could fluctuate between both.I feel like a walking contradiction, like my ex. Which is why we broke up. He didn't like carrot cake even though he said he liked all foods so to me that really destroyed our relationship because if he doesn't like carrot cake then how could I trust anything about him? Anyway the point is I don't really understand how this is possible because they seem rather different.I'm INFJ and I can not relate to media representations of INFJ's as the "can't say no" personality type meme, or that we do not have boundaries. I'm more than happy to speak up if needed to and I do have boundaries, I say no everyday. I am not afraid to disagree during arguments. I keep thinking I'm INTJ for this reason because it seems they're much more able to speak their mind, disagree with people or say no but then I realise how Fe blind they are and know I'm INFJ.So there have been studies done that men find red on women most attractive, while another study showed that women loved blue on men. So I'm wondering, **what colour do you, as a woman, find attractive on other women?**Now obviously there isn't a scientific defining answer yet but I thought it would be a fun post to make to discuss.So many of my friends or people I know love to complain about things that don't affect their life every day, then they will tell all their friends and I about it while providing no solutions. Why are they telling me this? They're lucky I haven't complained about them existing as it is.Is self control such a hard thing to accomplish for others? I feel like complaining every time I walk down the street in my gorgeous flowing purple skirt and pink heels as I look across the street only to witness one man not lusting over my existence. Yet guess what? I don't! Because I respect others. I never complain, and would not want to burden people with that type of behaviour. How can we navigate this behaviour when we notice it happening?. I swear whenever I see men online complain about women only wanting money and how "she won't date them if they're making under 6 figures" is because they only care about dating those perfect models that want the traditional house wife boujee Kim K lifestyle.Like no shit they want money use your brain and look at their life. Go settle for a solid 7/10 who you met through friends, owns a cat, does pottery, isn't extremely superficial and wants louis bags 24/7 which by the way is like a majority of women and I swear to god these men would shut up with this hypergamy "she for the streets" alpha male stuff.If you want some superficial queen then pay the price, otherwise stop complaining.Melbourne daily weather observations released by BOM for September in 2022 was 15.6c average, with the highest day of the month being 20.8c. This September? So far the average is **19.6c** with our highest recorded day being 28c!!! It actually took up until November last year to reach 28c yet we've already reached it now a week ago.Nobody seems to be talking about how concerning this is for our summer. If we're already hitting high temps, not to mention it has barely rained at all this year. In fact I get surprised when it rains this year due to how odd it has been. I can't remember the last time I've needed an umbrella for the day.Do cis women not notice this or is it just my issue? Guys are so much more giving and willing to talk and listen to you when they think you're a (cis) woman.Let's talk online, I have made SO MANY more friends since transitioning whether socially online or online games, and have been given so much attention from guys WAY more before I transitioned. Given gifts, everything. Friends I would hang out with for MONTHS and thought really liked my company. Friends I trusted, friends I genuinely cared for....**Until they found out I was trans**Suddenly? They don't give a fuck anymore. You're just dropped. Their entire personality was a front just because they thought you were a cis woman. I don't know if actual cis women realize this or not but from my experience most men that want to be friends only do so because they get to flex they're friends with a female and It's like some confidence boost to them. Whether they're subconsciously aware or not. **They. Treat. You. Different** because I've never been treated with such attention when I was a guy.This has been happening all year and while I know there are definitely cis men out there that just want friends no matter what their gender, I find it rather rare and I think more women should be paying attention to this if they haven't already....It hurt a lot finding this out. I don't trust men who are nice to me anymore, I'm very much convinced they just want to talk to me for my gender they perceive and not because they want real connections. Seriously nobody wants to see their gross feet, why do they all run around shoeless? Have you ever seen a bosmer player with shoes on? I certainly haven't. Even if they're in the Deadlands with volcanic lava everywhere.The people I do find interesting and like, don't like me. The people I don't really think too much of or want to really be their friend, do like me. While I appreciate being liked of course, I find this rather frustrating. I just want to be liked by people as much as I like them, but it is very rare. Then it causes me to get upset and if I can't be liked by them then I would rather them hate me so I start just acting polarising around them as some sort of last resort in hopes I can conjure up a change in them.I understand this is unhealthy. It feels very difficult to accept the fact I can't be liked by everyone, especially knowing I put so much effort in to be likeable. Why wouldn't they like me? It feels so undeserving. How can I accept that I can't be liked by everyone?. In ESO Summerset Isle DLC, there's this loyal champion of Meridia named Darien who basically does everything for Meridia and she promises him to be free from this life (petty Tamriel) if he's loyal to him, he eventually dies but all that happens is he just gets sent back to the void only to (probably?) be recycled into the next life on Tamriel? I mean technically she did free him, but he got used basically, no reward nothing just a pawn. Surely Darien would have asked her about what the specifics of her promises though to be so convinced? If not well skill issue I guess.Anyway the POINT IS, at least Azura rewards you with an afterlife. Sure you'll be half blind in her realm but at least you'll be happy there, who would want to get recycled back to Nirn? Or sent to the Deadlands? Sounds bad. Every Daedra doesn't seem to promise an afterlife, at least not a happy one. Except Azura.I've noticed in my life that if someone is attractive to me (doesn't mean sexual, they're just nice to look at) I seem to feel more connected to them as friends and enjoy being around them more. Two of my close friends are like that, but they're also very caring and interesting. However I don't know if their personality is really that great or I just view their personality as more great because they're attractive?Either way, I struggle to develop deep connections with friends I don't find that attractive. I've tried to, but my brain raises the standards of what draws me into developing that. It's just how my brain works and it sucks.I've had experiences in the past where I've got upset at people I've considered good friends with a connection because they just didn't want to hang out with me like I would expect them to and....they all happened to be what I considered attractive people, so I seem to value the relationship more with them I think?I am open to becoming good friends with anybody **no matter what they look like or where they come from!** but feeling that connection? It's different. How come other people can feel that connection but I can't? I hate feeling this way.Looking back on some of the relationships I have formed, I've noticed that I have some friends which I personally don't think we have A LOT in common. Some things, they're not particularly super interesting or anything but I do like them. However they are attractive, and they make me feel good (an attractive person is talking to me) and they make me look good in front of other people.Obviously this isn't the **only** criteria, but what I am saying is that I think it plays a part in me enjoying being friends with them. Is that wrong?. Claims to be a support group without any way to verify who is actually clinically diagnosed or not with a subreddit filled with almost 900k people continuously making topics involved in armchair diagnosing any abusive person with mental health or personality disorders (without a psychology license) as a way to dehumanize the person, while stigmatizing mental disorders in the process and reinforcing the idea that **abuse = mental disorder**This subreddit conjures up the most darkest stories imaginable while blatantly labelling people who have been abusive towards them with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) as it just isn't fathomable to these people for an abusive person to **just be** an abusive person **without** a mental health disorder, like the majority of the world.I don't know why but there is something absolutely hot about the times we will get into a debate and she'll just start arguing as she defends her side stating why I'm wrong with reasons, facts and evidence. Just calling me out on my bullshit.. I don't take it personally. I actually go smitten over her. I never start arguments on purpose and really It's the last thing I would want to happen. However I must admit when we do argue, deep down I really want her to just straight up demolish me with her intelligence.You could have a best friend you've known for years and you meet up every fortnight or month depending on how busy you guys are and it is normal. However if you start dating someone then it's generally expected for you to see them at least like once a week, fall crazy in love through some magical spiritual awakening and even move in with them within months, *even though* some of your friends are:* **WAY** more trustworthy* have known you for way longer* seen you go through crazy shit your partner has never experienced with you* more long term reliabilityYet they're not visiting you all time, they have their own lives right?This normalised soulmate narrative of being with your romantic partner constantly sounds like a great way to ruin a relationship before it even has a chance to blossom. So I'm wondering why do people do this with people they start dating, at least so quickly?. In the game if you have any of the scrolls, guards don't comment on you carrying it like they do with some daedric artifacts (e.g Azura's Star) you have. Now I was thinking obviously Bethesda just didn't think to add much immersion dialogue when it came to equipment to begin with but that got me thinking...If you carried around a giant aedric artifact scroll on your back would some citizens or guards know about it? Who would know about it? Would it just mostly be only high ranking wizards like Neloth or people who practice the arcane arts that would know?. There's this guy at my uni where we've been okay friends for a year now (mainly just for project works and stuff) but I have been an asshole in the past, apologised for it and told him recently I've been diagnosed with NPD and thought he should know. One time he was ignoring me when I was talking to him and I told him how I HATE being ignored that's the worst thing you can do to someone with NPD.Now? He just ignores me on purpose sometimes during school work. It pisses me off so much, like I want to become a draconian dictator and imprison him for life with 0 remorse. I hate being ignored and I regret telling him about my NPD because he now has taken advantage over me being open to him.I get a kick out of telling people I'm a narc and I don't know why, it just feels really good. I can't tell if that's even narc related or some other toxic trait about me that is unhealthy. As much as I am aware it is probably not a good thing and I should change...deep down I admit I'm not sure if I really want to..and I have no idea why.. I feel really bad for typing this but I wanted to see if anyone else has been in my position before and if they wanna share their thoughts for discussion. Last year I discovered I was bi and feminine presenting (AMAB). Both guys and girls are hot, however for some reason I just...find it hard to trust men, or almost anyone AMAB masculine romantically.If I'm walking down the street in my cute dress, when women look at me, I know it's most likely because they like my dress or they think I'm pretty or something. When men look at me however...I just assume they see me as some sexual object. So I've only liked other women, because I feel they're going to love me for me and not my body. I've tried going on dates with men and no matter how hard I try and get to know them my brain refuses to trust them. I don't trust their intentions other than they think I'm hot and they would just settle with that as long as I'm not too annoying for them.It sucks a lot. I don't want to feel this way but....I know what it was like to be a cis guy at one point. I know how men tend to view women, how I use to view women. So my brain is just constantly bombarded with that type of thinking and it feels like I project it on every man if this makes sense?Anyone else feel the same way or? Any opinions on this?. What's a fruit you love smelling in fragrances and what comes to your imagination when you smell it? I love plum. In my country plum is rather exotic so it is not common everywhere. It also comes across feminine yet, dark or sophisticated if that makes sense? At least to me. Sexy but like a mature sexy. Think Decadance by Marc Jacobs or Plum Japonais by Tom Ford. Both rather "dark feminine" fragrances. So whats your favourite fruit scent?. It seems like no matter what country you live in when it comes to the west, stay there long enough and you'll realize almost everybody thinks their government sucks and feels like it's all doomed. France, USA, UK, AUS, Canada etc people are furious in these countries about their politicians. So...do these western countries actually have a bad government or do these countries just think they have a bad government but they're actually fine?. literally one of the hardest verses in his song CREMATIXN what do you guys think? like what the hell bro, he made an entire song that basically disses us fans because a lot of us kept telling him to "go back to his old music", then he says he is going to put god in danger because thats how angry he is. It seems like when a fragrance has a sweet profile (think Ultramale or Scandal, both by JPG) it tends to be seen as a "younger person" fragrance and/or something to go clubbing with. Why? Does someone hit 35 and all of a sudden they wake up and decide that they're going to put on Dior Fahrenheit so they can start smelling like gasoline and leather?Are sweet fragrances something people tend to grow out of or am I missing something here?. Hi all, I have found many italian pop singers like Laura Pausini and while they're cool, I'm looking for more modern, todays-trendy, pop music.I really enjoy Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eillish I mean I think just those 3 alone is a good idea enough of what I would like. Any recommendations? Thank you so much! (:. I'm aware there are men/AMAB NBs that probably expect AFAB NBs to "act a certain way" too, but I can only talk from my experience.I mainly go on dates with/hang out with AFABS that present mostly feminine (whatever their gender is I dont mind). Yet I still am expected to make most of the decisions with friends, or especially on first dates for example. I'm always asked what place to eat, whats our plan, what day/time we're meeting etc. If it is a date, I can tell they want me to "make the move" so to speak like initiating holding hands or kissing.Like I'm not a man so why am I expected stereotypically to be "always decisive" like I am one? Having help with decisions means a lot, it can get exhausting.I say this because despite us breaking gender norms as being who we are, we still have been influenced and socially conditioned to a certain extent, to act like our traditional gender role. Whether we do it subconsciously or conciously I notice it a lot, and that's okay, I do it too. It just can be rather frustrating sometimes.Back in 2008, I made my first gaming name. Princesspeachfan6242. I was a straight male and homophobic. After discovering myself now in 2022 as bi and transfeminine, I was completely oblivious to such a sign. Why didn't I see this coming!? My life has flashed before my eyes. I am a potato.I'm from Australia and most of my teenage/early adult years I have spent on the computer. Pretty much gaming and socializing. I've thought to myself *"If I'm going to be on the computer so much I might as well get paid for it"* so I went to study a bachelors of IT.I failed the whole year. I studied again this year at a different university for a diploma of IT instead, and just couldn't seem to want to invest any time at all so I dropped out. IT does interest me, I do find it somewhat compelling. I just find disciplining myself to do the work very difficult and stressful. What does this mean?There are some other well paying/secure jobs I think are interesting, but I don't feel compelled to want to really study them just like IT.Yet Psychology? I feel it suits my character as a person. I would say I have a good discernment of others and great social skills. I'm very curious about people and want to understand everyone. I can see myself studying this degree more than most other subjects including IT.**So what's stopping me?**Everyone says there is no money in psychology. Lots of people have degrees with huge debt, the job security sucks, I'm going to spend all my 20's studying only in the end to possibly not even being able to find a job in that sector.It just annoys me. Why can't I find something I feel more compelled and interested to do, but also has job security and reliability? Why do I have to choose between a job that offers money & security but I'm not that interested vs a job that offers less money & less security but I AM more interested?No matter how hard I think about what job I want, I can never find something I'm both very interested in and It's secure at the same time. It's like I have to choose happiness and huge risk over money or money over huge risk and happiness.I know it is early, but looking back on the 2000s (I can't speak for women's) I know the cool water scent was very popular, and in 2010 when Chanel released Bleu De Chanel the ambroxan bombs were a sight to see in the perfume industry through the following years.So what about in the 2020s? What predictions do you have of scents/notes or even fragrances released since 2020 that you feel will be influential or will dominant this decade?. I would love to read books about the journey of self-love and preferably it offers advice too.So I'm playing a new character that is a follower of Mephala, and I find worshipping the daedric prince kind of hard to sort of roleplay as other than just being some complete psycho succubus and going around murdering people who trust you to please the daedric prince.I mean how would a follower of Mephala act in situations like relationships? Could they ever find true love and get married? What about their family? Could they ever be friends with people without stabbing them in the back? I mean how would these followers treat people in society and just general social situations, it sounds pretty tough.I have read God Is Not Great by Christopher Hitchens. Fascinating book, that is all, and am open to more.Hey everyone, I'm really open to give anything a shot. I understand trap obviously has it's own place in the music industry but I am hoping I can find something similar to what I like in trap to be used as a sort of parameter for suggestions.T**o give an idea on what kind of "sound" I like:**I really love artists with a energetic/bubbly/child-like sound that they tend to portray either through their personality on stage as an artist or just in their production in general. Hyperpop also tends to be another genre I listen to as well. I like to describe this feeling as "jumping on your parents bed at 5 yrs old without their permission."To give an example of some of my favourite songs that I believe match this "sound" I'm looking for:[New Patek by Lil Uzi Vert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PczuoZJ-PtM)[Jealousy By Yuzion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0F-geXB4L0)[Carolina Girls by Belis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrMqxjAZ0X8&list=RDGMEMHDXYb1_DDSgDsobPsOFxpA&index=10)I'm open to anything EDM, Ambience, Pop, Jazz, Rock/Metal I mean the list goes on really I don't care what it is as long as the personality/vibe is the same.

    Besides being a malignant narcissist. When my grandmother died (my mom's mother) in the middle of the night and we got a call and they wake me immediately in the sound of my mother and sisters crying. I got up and walked to the room and behind me I heard my father shouting (in Arabic) something in the meaning "that's it. She's dead" to tell my mother and sisters to stop crying.My mother told us that in the same week after the funeral she was crying, mourning the death of a parent. And my father was walking by and he found her crying and screamed at her to stop.When I was 16, last year of highschool, I missed an unannounced morning pre school hours class. The teachers found some students who came early and decided to give them a 20 minutes lecture. When my father found out I missed it he yelled and hit me in the eye and literally directly called me worthless and exactly said why are we paying for your education and we are wasting money. And then went to work without driving me to school. I had to walk and arrived late. I was literally the top of the class and for many years. I was studying in the gifted school.I'm a bad person I know that but I will never scream in my wife mourning her mother. I know how to comfort a friend even if I don't feel it emotionally. I do it because cognitively I know it's right. Even if I didn't feel sad about my grandma dying and I had to force myself to cry by mental gymnastics because I thought it's the appropriate. I won't do such thing as my father and I don't care if that's a mask or being covert or even communal. My father never loved me. The only thing close to love is being a narcissistic supply for him when I scored high iq and entered the gifted program in 4th grade and came on top of the class. He got to brag about how amazing the school is to all our relatives. My mom said he never payed attention to me till I got to gifted school. I'm his favourite because I'm smart and well educated and highly interested in politics (he's a successful politician). I'm his favourite and I'm the one most affected by him as his only son. He did pay attention to me and therefore I got abused more. He neglected my sisters and was distant. The message I got from him is that if I'm not perfect then I'm worthless. I wish I was not his favourite.My father is a malignant narcissist according to my therapist. And I have npd according to her.Talking about the big five model. I read that a research found they can have hard time managing anxiety. They are also known for their severe rage and anger (and anger is one of the six facets of neuroticism) and they're hyper sensitive to criticism which I believe the reason dr Todd Grande said they have some vulnerable narcissism as well. If my theory is right, that what differentiates the malignant narcissist from a psychopath is they can/might have the anxiety facet of of neuroticism. Psychopaths are known for their high anger facet but low anxiety.Personal addition (don't read it necessary):The reason I'm thinking about this is because I have a psychopath profile in the big five, exactly the same in every facet except for achievement striving and anxiety (both high). And the stories that my mother and big sister says about my childhood are stories of a psychopath. I don't know why they didn't take me to a clinician. I think I gave my big sister some trauma and she still fawn me.Scored 20/40 (and 22/44 in another) in psychopathy checklist which is the edge of subclinical/borderline psychopathy (the average between 5 and six). On levenson test I scored 3.3/5 in primary psychopathy and 4/5 in secondary psychopathy. I really don't feel guilt.I got fired by the board from a presidency of a student union for abuse of power. I refused the firing and splitted the union into two unions competing for legitimacy. It's the best thing I ever did and I'm really proud of it which in second thought is weird.My extroversion is higher than the middle but not too high which is weird since I consider myself covert and I have autism (and adhd). It's just weird. My country went to war (civil war) and college is closed. I can't hangout with a lot of women and get the illusion of validation. I discovered all the relationships were superficial and no one checks on me. I have complex ptsd and the narcissistic supply mask my shame and fear but now without it I wake up in an emotional flashback. It's just hell.No amount of confidence, future planning, fantasy, remembering my good or great qualities; no amount can make up for the fact that at this moment of my life I have no supply and right now I'm nothing to the world.I've been meditating a self compassion meditation and mindfulness. When I do both and with a current supply I can read more than 100 page a day but without supply the meditation just reduce my dissociation and numbness and makes me feel all the trauma symptoms directly. I can't even read 5 pages now.I've been trying to work on my trauma by myself since I can't reach my therapist but without supply I can't read or learn skills. I'm almost on a freeze response. I also have adhd and autism and I'm on antidepressants. I don't know what else to say. I always think that if the other person is like me, they will feel they have more power in the relationship. Having power over me is so uncomfortable and triggering since that how I was traumatized in the first place. I'm a fearful avoidant on attachment style and a vulnerable narcissist.I know a lot of people in college. I spend my time with a lot a lot of women. But no-one checks on me on vacations. It's all superficial and honestly I use the time spent with them as a temporary pain killer for the emptiness. Once I leave someone or some group the emptiness comes back. I have diagnosis of both npd and bpd. My narcissism goes back and forth from vulnerable to grandiose and I have parts of both persistent at all times. I'm autistic and narcissistic. The narcissism mask my autism by putting on a show of being intelligent, successful, knowledgeable and creative. And maybe this is the narcissistic thing to say but those things are true but that not all of me. I feel if I became vulnerable I'll lose my image on the person eye of being the high on the league. For me relationships are a game to be won. I need to win the person and have power in the relationship.Pre:Loving kindness meditation or compassion meditation is ancient meditation where you wish love well-being and peace first to yourself then to a loved one, stranger, then to a person you have conflict with and finally to the whole world.Here 18 Science-Backed Reasons to Try Loving-Kindness Meditation: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/feeling-it/201409/18-science-backed-reasons-try-loving-kindness-meditationNow, when i practice it i feel strong intense anger even if I'm wishing peace to a girl that I really like and like me back. It's like the meditation sees through my narcissistic defences and connects me to my inner real self. I usually feel numb but this meditation brought in the past general and social anxiety (like I'm really connected to myself and others so i care about myself truly and about others and what they think) and now it brings sadness and anger. It looks like all my likes and dislikes about people are superficial and just a surface level where in my true level I only have hate and resentment to the a world that I'm entitled to but doesn't give me what I deserve. A despise to everyone which each at least has something I don't have. A desire for revenge towards these ppl who won't really like me if they know who I really am (I'm borderline) and who don't give me the power and recognition over them that i deserve.Npi: 29.

    Ok so I’ve never been diagnosed with ocd but I do have health anxiety which has symptoms similar to ocd and I do tend to have obsessive thoughts that I can’t seem to get out of my head.The most recent one of these is constantly imagining myself from the third person. And not voluntarily, like the image will just pop into my head. It’s really starting to annoy me bc it makes me feel like I’m outside my body looking in on myself which makes me feel depersonalised, and it gives me the same kinda feeling you get when you’re being watched, it’s really uncomfortable and unnerving. Has anyone else ever gotten this and how have you coped with it?. Ok so I’m doing a degree in commerce and I’ve never really been doing as well as I want to be, I’ve been in a constant state of “once I get my shit together”. Had some bad anxiety earlier this year that impacted my study and made me feel even worse abt my lack of success. Anyway so this friend is doing a degree in a field unrelated to business and she gets into the most prestigious consulting group in my uni. I actually felt sick when she told me bc how tf is it fair that someone doing a completely different degree is doing better than I am IN MY OWN FIELD! She has mentioned multiple times in a haha funny way that she just kinda makes shit up when they start talking abt super business stuff. And don’t get me wrong she’s smart but it’s unfair bc 1 her major is a lot easier than mine, I did a class in it and got a distinction without watching a single lecture and 2 she literally doesn’t have a job so of course it’s easier for her to do all these extra internships and get great marks. This literally makes me sound like the worst friend in the world but whenever she brings it up I’m just like 😀 greattttt so cooolAnyway I started going to a therapist for some unrelated issues but how do I bring this up without just like completely changing the subject out of no where. Obviously I’m not the first person here to criticise her but I can’t get over how narrow her vid on low grade npd is. She basically just describes someone immature and annoying. All the traits are the most surface level “they love social media”, “they don’t clean up after themselves”, “they care too much about there looks” “they’re obsessed with celebrities”. It’s actually cartoonish.Low grade npd can range from like she said a slack parent who only partakes in the fun parts of parenting to a overbearing parent who will go above and beyond to make sure their kid is perfect bc they are a reflection of themselves. It can be constantly needing a romantic partner for validation or avoiding romantic relationships out of a crippling fear of rejection. It can be slacking on “adult tasks” or micromanaging your household to prove your competency.I just watched healNPD’s video on how ppl with npd often get health/illness anxiety and I was wondering if any of you get this?Personally I’ve had a lot of health anxiety for a while, and I have always thought that it had something to do with my need for perfection, need for control, need to be be successful and incredibly high standards I hold myself to, bc obviously having a horrible disease or condition would hold me back from all those things. It makes a lot of sense bc I don’t have much medical trauma or anything else I could think of that would cause this obsession with my health.I often find myself hating teen dramas, especially set in highschool that are supposed to be “relatable” bc I get so jealous and insecure abt the characters having a more interesting highschool experience than I did. It’s actually an issue, I stopped watching stranger things when they all got into relationships bc how the fuck is eleven in a relationship yet I’m not, stopped watching sex education for the same reason, and there’s countless tv shows I won’t even try bc I know I’ll hate them for that reason. Also often when watching tv shows or movies I come to despise the “main character” or the person who is supposed to be the “good guy”. Some examples:- Aria from pll - Scott and Allison from teen wolf- Serena and Dan from gossip girl- Daenerys from got- rhaenyra from hotd- Spider-Man- Every single character in riverdale- Nancy and Jonathan stranger things- Rachael from friends- Jane from Jane the virgin (couldn’t get past ep1)-Rory from Gilmore girls (again couldn’t get past ep 1)- Haven’t even bothered watching vampire diaries bc I know I’m gonna hate Elena - Luke skywalker- Gabriella from hsm - Literally every single main character from any Disney or Nickelodeon show (especially the female ones for some reason)Sometimes I worry I have internalised misogyny but then I do have an unhealthy obsession with female “villains” or women with issues like Blair Waldorf, Cersei Lannister, Alicent Hightower, spencer Hastings, Jade from victorious, fallon carrington from dynasty and sharpay evensAnyway just rambling bc I need to get my hatred for these characters out somehow. If anyone has any show recommendations lmk lol. The way I become incredibly anxious, intimidated and basically just seize up around anyone who has a higher social status than me, or is in a position of power above me or who I view as higher up the hierarchy of whatever situation I’m in is so pathetic it’s embarrassing. Its as tho I switch from grandiose to vulnerable depending on how I view/the status of the ppl around me. It’s gotten better after highschool bc there’s less social hierarchy but it still sucks at work bc I can never be the confident outgoing version of myself, or have a decent relationship with my bosses bc of this. And I can never actually impress the ppl I care to impress, only looser I don’t particularly want to associate myself with 😂. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship so obviously I don’t have personal experience with heartbreak or relationships issues (apart from my best friend of 3 yrs ghosting me), and I dunno if it’s lack of empathy or something but I genuinely don’t understand a lot of ppls relationships issues. Like whenever someone get really upset abt their relationship I can’t help but think either it isn’t that bad and you should get over it or it is that bad and break up. Like currently my sister is heartbroken over some guy she never even dated and I just don’t get it? I know it’s wrong and I should never blame the victim but whenever someone starts talking abt the way they were treated in a past relationship I can’t help but judge them for staying in the first place. Like I saw someone on another sub post abt how their abusive ex straight up told them a month into the relationship that they abused every person they were with, and it makes it hard to even feel sympathy for them bc why tf would you even stay after that?. So it seems as tho ppl with npd often didn’t suspect they had it or self diagnose themselves with it, and that they can be in denial when they do get diagnosed with it. And ppl seem to blame this entirely on the narcissism but I can’t help feel as tho the way the media talks abt npd must be a slight contributing factor. Like if you search up npd on YouTube or tiktok or any other social media 90% of the results focus on spotting and diagnosing npd in others. Stuff like “how to tell if your ex is a narc”, etc. Contrast this to how bpd or adhd or bipolar is talked abt where it’s focused on whether you have it with stuff like “what it’s like living with __”. Like are we really surprised that no one is self aware when the way npd is talked abt doesn’t promote self reflection and instead just encourages ppl to point the accusatory finger at others?. Curious to see if there’s anything certain things that actually make you feel empathy?Like seeing other ppl emotionally suffering doesn’t make me emotionally suffer. (Although it does make me uncomfortable bc now I have to comfort them and I’m not very good at that) However there are some things that make me feel:1) physical pain, I hate seeing ppl get physical hurt, I hate watching “funny” fail vids where ppl get hurt, it just grosses me out.2) wholesome videos, like the ones that are supposed to restore your faith in humanity, they makes me happy3) movies, sad movies make me sad The more I think abt empathy the more it confuses me, why does a video of a child I don’t even know beating cancer make me feel but my friend crying in front of me doesn’t?. Ok so I have a very high opinion of myself. I basically think I’m better than the large majority of ppl overall. I definitely think I’m self righteous, and I do curse a lot (not sure how that relates).I’ve always been a chronic daydreamer, and the daydreams always involve an alternate universe where I’m super rich, famous and/or powerful, with a great partner and great friends. I often get a kick out of feeling powerful, like when I can tell someone is intimidated by me, or I’m put in a position of authority.The thought of living an average life where I never amount to much terrifies me. I recently turned 21 and I feel like I’m spiraling bc I haven’t achieved the level of success I dreamed of. I do feel entitled to opportunities I don’t have the grades for, but I understand why they can’t break the rules for me.I find myself getting incredibly jealous of ppl when they achieve something or get complimented, I don’t feel happy for them. I don’t resent them for their achievements but sometimes I do have to remind myself of their flaws just to reassure myself.I’ve also started questioning whether I actually feel emotional empathy, I definitely feel cognitive empathy, but I don’t actually feel sad when someone else feels sad. I have also always thought I was slightly emotionally stunted, like when I get bad news abt someone else I always feel like I’m more focused on how I’m acting than actually feeling.That being said none of this has ever caused me any issues externally. I’ve always been good at keeping friends, and my friends never have issues with me. I also hate loosing friends and see having a lot of friends as a flex so. I’m also genuinely interested in their lives. I guess I’m very conscious of how I’m perceived so I make sure not to boast, or put others down to bring myself up, not to show I’m envious of their accomplishments, not to show I think they’re just not as good as me. I’m also not very quick to anger, I’m not vengeful and tend to be relatively resilient. I can brush off criticism relatively easily although I’ve never had anyone say anything genuinely insulting abt who I am as a person so I don’t know how I would respond if they did. Anyway am I a narcissist or am I just going through a quarter life crisis lolNPI -28, codependency- 1, ocd-4. Basically the title. Is anyone here good at hiding their narcissism feelings or tendencies around their friends bc they know loosing friends would be too much of a blow to the ego. Does anyone keep a decent amount friends for a long time without getting bored of them? Does anyone have some interest in their friends lives even if they don’t majorly care?. Ok so what Kim said on that phone call was just wrong, period. But I can’t pretend that I wouldn’t be fed up if I was Kim.For one the whole issue abt d&g made no sense, and the way kourtney kept trying to turn it on Kim and psychoanalyse her to say that she was wrong for being ambitious and wanting to challenge herself was really weird and annoying. Especially when she wanted to have that useless conversation she wrote notes for, only for the notes to not include a single thing abt how she feels and to be basically be trying to give Kim a therapy session and once again imply there’s something inherently wrong with her bc she’s ambitious.Then with the phone call, kourtney brings up the looks and aesthetics only to argue that it’s got nothing to do with that two seconds later? Then go straight into calling her egotistical, selfish and attention seeking when the conversation up until that point had been relatively civil, and accuse her of not being happy for her at her wedding. I’m mot surprised Kim snapped when kourtney has been implying for ages that Kim is fundamentally flawed and unfulfilled for wanting to challenge herself.As an older sister I understand it can build resentment watching a younger sister become more “successful” than you, but I’d never demonise my younger sister for wanting to be successful. And the therapy doesn’t seem to be helping bc that’s the kinda thing they should be working on. If kourtney is as fulfilled and focused more on what truly matter than money as she claims, why did the d&g thing even matter? And why does it matter that Kim wants to challenge herself?. Just took my first dose of propranolol and now I’m freaking out thinking it’s going to kill me. Which is literally so stupid bc I have previously been on this medication for months and I never died. Like I can think logically but for some reason never believe it.If anyone is struggling with health anxiety I highly recommend Cherellethinks on YouTube. Her entire channel is dedicated to health anxiety talking abt her experience with it, physical symptoms from it, specific fears, tips on how to overcome it. She has loads of videos explaining basically every symptom you can think of and how anxiety can cause it. Her videos have actually helped me so much bc the more you understand health anxiety the easier it is to overcome.Ok so for the past month or so I’ve just had this semi constant dizzy/vertigo feeling, like I’m on a boat, or walking on a mattress, or like the ground underneath me in generally unstable. From what I’ve seen on here it’s not uncommon with anxiety but does anyone have any suggestions on how to get rid of it? I’ve seen ppl say that just trying to ignore it is the only way but its like trying to ignore a mosquito buzzing in my ear.I find myself frequently forgetting to do things I’m supposed to do often like ask the name of the person I’m speaking to on the phone, mention booking fees in emails etc. I tried putting post it notes on my computer to remind me but they kinda just blend into the background of my desk so I don’t notice them (if that makes sense).Ok the title probably doesn’t make much sense. Basically since March I’ve developed really bad health anxiety. I’ve always been a generally anxious person but this health anxiety especially the physical effects it has on me, isn’t like anything I’ve experienced before. In the past month I’ve gone from thinking I had a heart problem, to thinking I had Ms, to thinking I was going to have a psychotic break I’d never recover from, to some weird existential crisis, to thinking some medication has permanently damaged my brain. Anyway today I was worried that I wasn’t going to find a group for this uni group project. And it’s weirdly relieving that I even have the energy to worry abt uni. Given my anxiety at its worse causes me to completely disregard uni bc “what’s the point if I’m going to die”, the fact im worried abt is a pretty good sign. Hoping I get back to a point in my life where my anxiety is just over first world problems.Anyone else kinda worried abt when they’ll eventually have to move out of home? I’m 21 still living with my parents and they basically do everything for me (thank the lord). They do my washing, cook me dinner, do groceries, my dad even drives me to work. I actually don’t know what I’d do without them. How would I ever manage to do my own washing if I can’t even put my clothes away after my mum washes them? How am I going to feed myself every day if I struggle to make myself lunch? How am I supposed to get to work on time if I’m 15mins late every day my dad can’t drive me? How am I supposed to do the dishes if I can’t even remember to put my dishes in the sink? How am I supposed to keep a house clean if I can’t even keep my room clean? Not to mention paying bills, grocery shopping, house maintenance etc. And honestly I don’t know how much longer my parents will put up with me 😂. F21So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days? Is it safe to quit?I would ask my doctor but I can’t see her for another couple of days and I want to quit asap bc the longer I wait the more withdrawal symptoms I’ll get.So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days?. Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better. However now I’m scared of what happens when I eventually go off the meds. I’ve spent the entire day scrolling through “survivingantidepressants.org” and now I’m scared that the meds are going to permanently alter my brain and that if I ever try to go off I’ll have to endure months to years of withdrawal symptoms. Is this just my health anxiety talking or is this an actual valid concern? I’m tempted to stop now before I develop a physical dependency.Some extra context I only have very mild anxiety until March this year when I started spiraling thinking I had some terminal disease. Doctor said I had health anxiety. The anxiety subsided a bit over July but came back mid august. The main reason I wanted anxiety meds is bc I found it so hard to deal with the physical symptoms that came with the anxiety.Anyway if anyone has any advice, or can share their experience going through withdrawal that would be greatly appreciated.Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better.

It’s my 7th day on 25mg and I still have pretty bad brain fog, dpdr and just feel tired. Should I go up to 50mg or stay on 25mg until the side effects pass? Ideally I’d just go up to 50mg and get the side effects over and done with but I have to go to work and uni and if going up to 50mg makes the brain fog worse then I don’t know how I’ll manage.TLDR: my health anxiety keeps trying to tell me that these are brand new symptoms that I’ve never felt before when I know that I felt the same way last time I went into an anxious spiral.So I suffer from health anxiety, which got really bad abt 5 months ago where I basically spent an entire month thinking I had brain cancer. During that time I physically felt the worst: headaches, dizzy, fatigue, really bad derealisation which also made me feel like there was something wrong with my vision (there wasn’t I went to the optometrist), I kept feeling like I was seeing flashes of light or that my vision would black out for a millisecond (it was probably me just blinking 🙄), numbness down one side of my body, tingling, muscle twitches and jerks, a weird pressure at the back of my head and for some reason and ache in my leg. These all disappeared gradually after I got a clear mri back.Recently I’ve gone into another anxious spiral, started with vertigo which I thought was caused by the propranolol I take for my headaches, so I stopped taking it, which caused me to think I’d given myself heart problems, then I thought I had ms. Went to the doctor and she prescribed me sertraline. I know it’s supposed to make anxiety worse before it makes it better but I’m spiraling thinking I’ve permanently altered my brain, or that I’m going crazy. The derealisation is back in a big way, so is the numbness, pressure in the back of my head, tingling, muscle twitching and jerks. Anyway it’s like my brain can’t seem to wrap it’s head around the fact that I’ve been through all this before, that it was just anxiety, and that it passed when the anxiety got better. I feel like this is some brand new experience that I’ll never recover from even though I’ve been through this before and did get through it. I keep thinking “this is the worst I’ve ever felt” when I know for a fact it isn’t.Best way I can describe it is that I feel like I’m high. I’ve heard that sertraline works for depression before it works for anxiety and that anxiety gets worse before it gets better and I think that’s exactly what’s happening to me. I simultaneously feel happier and more anxious, basically how I feel after smoking. The same kind of emotional roller coaster of “I feel fine this is great” to “what if I never feel sober again” to questioning my own existence and the meaning of life. The kind of feeling where you’re mostly ok but constantly worried that you’re teetering on the edge of loosing your mind. Also feeling like I’m in a dream/ seeing everything through virtual reality glasses, dpdr feeling. Anyway I’m trying to stay positive and look at it as just a free high but I hate feeling like this 24/7, especially considering I have to study and go to work. Anyone else felt the same? And when does it go away bc I have uni tests soon and im finding it hard to concentrate while I feel like this😭Note I’m on this for health anxiety and some mild derealisation which is likely just a side effect of the anxiety.Ok so I started 25mg of sertraline 3 days ago for anxiety and the past two days have been alright, but today my anxiety has been way worse. I’m also getting pretty bad derealisation. I’ve had mild derealisation often from anxiety, but this time it seems to come with depersonalisation? Like I’ll look at my hand and I feels like I’m looking at someone else’s hand, as tho there’s some disconnect between me feeling what my hand is doing and me seeing what my hand is doing. It’s also making my anxiety wayyyy worse and sometimes I worry I’m going crazy or will never be the same again (catastrophising I know😂). Anyway did any of you have a similar experience and how long did it take to get better?. So obviously not everything has to have a point but is there any reason Daenerys is called Daenerys stormborn/ was born during a storm other than it being a fun fact and cool sounding name? As far as I know there isn’t any recurring motif of storms during her story, it isn’t related to any prophecy, it doesn’t have any symbolism etc. It is also more symbolic of house Baratheon in the same way fire is symbolic of house targeryen, winter symbolic of stark and gold symbolic of Lannister, so it seems weird that her nickname sounds more like a Baratheon nickname than a targ one. Does anyone have any theories on why it was included? Do you think it will be relevant later in the story?. Basically I have had pretty bad health anxiety for the past 6 months. When I get into an anxious spiral of thinking I have something I always get physical symptoms too. At the moment I’m getting pretty bad vertigo/dizziness. Like I feel as tho I’m on a boat and everything is moving slightly, and just a generally unsteady feeling as tho the ground I’m on could fall away at any moment. I went to my doctor and my blood test is fine, had an mri a few months ago which was fine, and she said there was nothing wrong with my ears. She prescribed me sertraline and I took it for a few days then started getting really bad side effects so I went off it. Has anyone else experienced this? Did medication help? Should I just push through the side effects?. Ok so I starting Sertraline 4 days ago for health anxiety. It was fine for the first 4 days, some anxiety, clenched jaw and sore eyes (could be unrelated) as a side effect but nothing major. But last night I randomly remembered that suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self harm were also a possible side effect and I just had this thought of “what if that happens to me and I hurt myself ”, and then my next thought was “you just thought abt it so it is happening to you”. Anyway ever since last night I keep having these recurring thoughts of self harm and it’s scaring the shit out of me bc never in my life have I ever thought abt it and really don’t want to hurt myself. I didn’t take the medication this morning bc I was scared it was going to make me loose my mind or something. Im booked into see my doctor in 2 days.Anyway has this happened to anyone else? Did these intrusive thoughts go away? It might just be one of those things where I’m scared of thinking abt something so i can’t stop thinking abt it so was I overreacting to stop taking the meds? Is it just my health anxiety convincing me I have mental health problems this time the same way it convinces me I have physical health problems? Is it even thinking abt self harm or is it just like intrusive anxious thoughts considering I don’t actually want to self harm at all and even the thought of it gave me a panic attack.Edit: if this is just a short term side effect I’d be fine to wait it out but, and this is probably just my delusional anxiety brain speaking again, I’m scared these intrusive thoughts will never go away.Some ppl believe that Rhaegars actions were misunderstood and that once we find out the real story and the real intentions behind his actions he’s going to be a way more sympathetic character and we’re all going to view him as some tragic hero. But I genuinely can not think of any big reveal that would make me like rhaegar as a person. If it follows the same “they were actually in love” story the show does it just makes him look stupid, reckless and irresponsible. If they pull some “he heard a prophecy and he thought he had to have a child with Lyanna to save the world” it just makes him look stupid and slightly delusional. How he treated Elia was shitty in literally any context. Unless it’s revealed that the whole time he was possessed by the three eyed raven I don’t see myself liking him. But is there any situation you could see yourself liking rhaegar?. So the great council that favoured viserys over rhaenys setting the precedent that any male relative would be favoured over a daughter. However was this precedent broken when all the lords swore fealty to rhaenyra over daemon? Obviously many would’ve preferred a son over rhaenyra but aegon wasn’t alive at that point so it’s kinda irrelevant.The other question is would targeryen precedent even matter? For every single other house in Westeros (as far as I know) a daughter would come before an uncle, eg. Cersei inheriting over kevan. Would the Baratheons stick to their rules of inheritance or would they follow the targ inheritance rules bc it’s the iron throne?Edit: another question? Say Robert dies without naming either as his heir would stannis ever swear fealty to the daughter? I know he considered rhaenyra a usurper so does this mean he would see his own claim as stronger?. Ok so watching hotd made me think abt how differently we view rhaenyra, her bastards and Alicent vs how we view Cersei, her kids and Ned. The difference probably just comes down to joffery being horrible but my question is what if he wasn’t. What if he was the picture perfect child, someone who would likely become one of the best kings in history. Would we still view Ned as this paradigm of honour, truth and righteousness? Also what if Joffrey didn’t exist and it was tommen who took the throne after Robert died? How would that change how we view things?. Ok I’m confused abt what the point of the hairnet was. Wouldn’t it have been easier and less risky for whoever poisoned joffery to just keep the poison crystal in their pocket or something? I assume they didn’t search everyone at the door, and if it was ollena who got the crystal when she fixed Sansa’s hairnet she would have had to keep it in her pocket for a while anyway. Also if anyone saw her breaking a crystal off Sansa’s hairnet it could look a little suspicious, so why take the risk and go through the hassle? Am I missing something?. I cannot stand when I hear ppl (mainly dany and sometimes Jon Stan’s particularly the ones on tiktok and tumblr ) try to argue about who the main character is or who is the titular character. I swear these ppl actually read a different series. Why would grrm create 24 povs, and a ridiculous amount of plotlines if the story was about one person saving the world. Why are they trying to reduce every other character to a side character and every other plot to a subplot. Also when they try and say the title is about a character, the ice and/or fire isn’t a person, it’s a broad plotline, a theme, an opposing force, a recurring motif.Ok rant over 😂. I hear ppl saying “she was homeless she was starving” etc. but was there ever a point where her and viserys were actually living on the streets?Ps: I haven’t read adwd yet so don’t get mad at me for not knowing. So GRRM said in an interview somewhere that there was 3 general plot lines: the “ice” plot line which is the wall, the others, the nights watch, bran etc., the “fire” plot line which is essos, slavers bay, dany and the dragons, then the kingslanding politics and war of the 5 kings plot line. Which out of the three is your favourite?Personally I prefer the kingslanding wot5k plot, and the essos and wall ones kinda bore me sometimes. Is that just me or is that a popular opinion?. I’ve seen a lot of posts recently comparing Daenerys to other characters recently and I think a lot of the arguments are pretty stupid.Basically most of the arguments go something like “when **insert evil character** does evil thing it’s not mad but when dany does it it is. “To me it’s not abt the actual action that make dany mad, it’s that her actions don’t match her words and the person she sees herself as. She constantly refers to herself as a liberator, a breaker of chains. She claims she wants to “break the wheel” and stop the cycle of powerful families fighting over the throne at the expense of ordinary ppl (which was a little dumb in itself bc she was just another powerful family fighting for the throne but anyway). Her entire thing was that she was different, that she was nothing like the ruthless tyrants who came before her, and that she was going to build a new and better world. However she then started doing things that went against this. Yes forcing ppl to kneel or die isn’t unusual at all, joffery did it after the battle of the Blackwater, stannis did it to mance etc. But she was supposed to be different, and there’s nothing liberating abt being told to submit or die. Now that in itself doesn’t make her mad, not being a liberator isn’t a sign of madness. The issue was that she didn’t change her view of herself to match her actions. She was still convinced she was a liberator and that she was nothing like the previous rulers despite doing the same thing. The madness was the disconnect between her actions and how she viewed herself not the actions by themselves.Ppl don’t consider Tywin or Arya or whoever else she gets compared to mad, bc their view of themselves is accurate. Tywin is not deluding himself into thinking he’s some messiah who’s come to liberate ppl. If he was he would 100% be considered an absolute basket case.Personally I wasn’t a huge fan of her going “mad”, I think it would’ve been better to see her make a conscious rational decision to be more ruthless and ditch the whole “break the wheel” thing.Also rant: I find it so stupid when ppl say stuff like “no one hated Cersei when she blew up the sept” “no one hated Tywin when he wiped out the reynes” bc those are literally some of the most hated ppl in the entire series, anyone who does like them likes them as a character not as a person.Ok so this guy decides he wants to get rid of Cersei and marry his middle aged fat abusive brother to a 16yr old. He decides the best way to do this is to convince his brother that the 16yr old looks like his ex crush who died almost 2 decades ago. He then goes up to the brother of the dead girl and straight up asks “hey does this girl look like your dead sister?” And he’s doing all of this bc he wants to suck off the 16yr olds brother.Then his brother dies and he decided he wants to make himself king seemingly just for the lols bc he has absolutely no claim.I mean obviously I’m simplifying it a lot and probably got some parts wrong but damn that’s absolutely deranged behaviour.Does anyone have any theories on how jaqen h’ghar ended up a prisoner? How does a faceless man get captured, they’re supposed to be the best assassins in the world it would be almost impossible to catch one. Was it part of some greater plan?. Ned bringing him back to winterfell would’ve been a huge risk if he looked like a textbook targeryen so would he have taken the risk and made up some story abt the mother being from Lys or something or would he have found somewhere else for Jon to live?. Obviously bran became the most useless and boring character when he came back from beyond the wall but the most annoying part was that his storyline and character development could have been super interesting. The idea of a young boy who all of a sudden has access to literally all information in the entire world has so much potential. I would’ve loved to see him struggle to figure out what to do with all the info, what to tell and what to keep secret, what is useful and what is useless, what is possibly an abuse of his powers and where should he draw the line on what he can and can’t do, struggle to actually convince ppl that he isn’t just making this all up, and realising that knowledge is unless you know what to do with it. Showing him as a young boy who’s is completely overwhelmed by all this info would have been so much more interesting than whatever tf they turned him into. It also didn’t make sense because knowing things doesn’t necessarily make you wise, so why did he all of sudden become a genius.Obviously it was an incredibly messed up “relationship” as dany was basically sold to him as a minor and assaulted, and she seemed to have some sort of Stockholm syndrome from it as she mostly looked back on him in a positive light and cared for him. What I hated was that they never showed her looking back and realising how messed up it was, and what a shitty, abusive person he was. They do have her speak abt the experience negatively in s7 when she first meets Jon, but then go back on that by having her talk to Sansa abt how he was one of the 2 men she’s ever loved. Which was just weird and contradictory. Showing her looking back positively on the relationship undermines how traumatising and horrible it was, and going through something like that would still be negatively impacting her. It gave a similar vibe as sansa’s “I’m grateful for my trauma” shit which was gross.To Tywin, his golden child as king would be the dream, and he could be hand. So he’d probably consider Jaime getting off the throne as the missed opportunity of a lifetime.
    A fortnight ago I was finally happy. I was finally healthy. I was finally *better*. and now its back to the same fucking shit.&#x200B;I don't know what to do anymore, i have no drive, no motivation and i hate myself. I can't stand looking at myself and perceiving myself. all I can seem to do now is sabotage and punish myself, i'm doing things to my body I've never done before and I just can't function any longer.&#x200B;And I'm so lonely, i feel so empty and unloved, i don't feel seen, needed or appreciated. my friends don't text me, they cancel last minute on plans and I'm so fucking single. I just want ease in my life for once, but my mind is constantly depraving me of that. I want someone to talk to, i want someone to care and i want someone to want me. but no one does. i hate my life.online, for free.They say you have to read it to know if you are a satanist, i feel like it could be my vibe so I wanna read it to find out.. i know i'm awful in a relationship and i only ever see it working if the person i'm with is obsessive, that's the only way i see them loving me as much as i deserve to be and as much as i love them. anyone feel similarly?. surely there's smt abt u that ppl seem to resonate with or like, what is it? and do you agree with them?. ig this goes for anyone that plays vocaloid games, but are there any songs you like to listen to but don't touch in the game? or vice versa? for me there's plenty and i have no explanation for it.. Okay so i totally knew Fukase existed, he could never replace Len for me, but I had no idea that he was so damn epic, and ik i can't be the only one that thinks this. Their duets are so freaking great and underrated too, i was looking for a Len and Kaito Cendrillon cover and found one for Len and Fukase, it's so freaking great.. i know people are gonna have a lot to say but like please just be genuine if you do the same thing. I know I'm apathetic and narcissistic and have a personality disorder of sorts, but idk when it started but my happiness and whole personality is turned on and off like a light switch. I can have a really involved conversation and constantly get complimented for my "confidence", but the second i'm done talking with someone my face will instantly change to just blank. TLDR: I don't need to know why or how, just if anyone else does it.Who are you dying to talk to? what was left unsaid? why do you need to talk to *them* right now? tell us your story.It always irks me when people ask questions like "what questions do you have for the opposite gender?" and "what's a mystery about the opposite gender?" Men and Women aren't opposites, the only opposite considering gender is people who feel gender and people who don't.so the opposite of a man is an agender person. the opposite of a demigirl is an agender person. The opposite of an aporagender person is an agender person. what are y'all's thoughts?. Just played *The Game of Life* for the first time after coming out, my options were a blue peg or pink peg. but you see, we have the version of the game with pets so I could also be a dog or cat. Today a cat felt the most gender but I'm considering painting a peg purple. Anyways, what are we all feeling today: Blue, pink, cat, or dog?. You hear the term "I'm so happy for you" said when someone shares their good fortune or just something positive that happened to them, but i don't actually feel happy for another person. I know I feel jealous if they have/achieved something I want, I will feel negatively towards them for boasting, I feel like I too could have easily achieved what they have, or I just feel indifferent and don't care for what they're sharing.I just want to know if anyone else experiences this.My mother (call her x) forces my younger sibling (call them y) to choose between me and my mother.My younger sibling looks up to me, and I love it. I find it really hard to form relationships with people where I actually genuinely care about them and Y is lucky enough to be one of the few people I want around me. However, recently my relationship with X has been absolute shit, she hates me for a million reasons and wants nothing to do with me. And yeah I've grown used to it and I'm far beyond changing anything for her to start liking me as her child again. The thing I have an issue with is that X is constantly telling Y that they are either on my side or X's side.X has a "you're either with me or against me" attitude and as we aren't on the best terms i am, in her eyes, against her; by this philosophy Y must have nothing to do with me either. Whenever I do anything with/for Y they get told that they must not love X and they've chosen me over X; and I am told that I'm trying to 'out parent' X. But I'm not, I'm trying to be the sibling for Y that I never had, and I'm trying to support them to be themselves, but any time I do I get berated for it.Y is a child with autism and X thinks this makes them a child forever, an insight into this is how no one can speak anything of the LGBT+ community to Y and I cannot begin to teach Y about me being bi and enby. X says that it will confuse Y and will make them queer bc I'm a role-model for Y and X doesn't want another gay kid. I know I've just rambled on but the point I'm trying to make is that Y is being made to feel guilty for loving me and wanting to be around me, they share my interests but can't express it around X bc she finds it weird and thinks it makes Y a target for bullying (e.g. Anime, Vocaloid, Kpop–to name a few–). But I can't be wrong to think that you need to stop telling the poor kid that they don't love you or that they love me more than they love you, the kid loves us both and it immeasurable and there are some things X can do for Y that I have no capacity for and vice verser. We're both carers for Y and my goddamn mother needs to see that we both have Y's best wishes at heart and it isn't a competition.. When telling a story or just asking a question people add their age and M or F, as a non-binary person I'd rather just not, so is it weird if I just mention my age? how relevant is it for people to add their sex?.
    Hi girls!After reading a post by the redditor u/Elegant_Main_7751 about setting goals, where she mentioned creating a socialite calendar of events to attend this upcoming 2024, I felt inspired to create this post. I loved the idea and thought of creating this so we can all build a calendar together by picking events we are interested in (although I know this is something that´s sometimes advertised on the sub, I think this post is a great way to get more specific). **All high-end events (art, sports, business, tech, real estate, fashion etc) are welcome here, from all over the world.** I will write the events I have an eye on in the comments. Thanks in advance for all your input! <3. So… maybe it´s because of the rainy day or that time of the month arriving, but I kind of need to vent.I have been in a level up journey since I was 14 or 15: reading, taking care of my body, dieting, exercising, self discipline… all you can think of. Ever since discovering Shera, (I take what´s applicable to me, I don´t follow her advice strictly), I left my ex and my life has reached a new high. Reaching this new point of self love and a sense of fulfillment, came with good and bad things. The good: i don´t rely on external validation and I am extremely detached from mundane things. The bad? I´m so detached from mundane things, I´m only driven by money, power, success and being prettier. I am now more aware than ever of the psychology and power dynamics of the world, and while I am grateful to know this and not live in infinite innocence like the majority of the population, life often feels… empty? Almost like a game. I can´t hang out with anyone without reading their body language. I can´t help but feel disgust when men stare at me in the street. I don´t believe friendships are real, since they are always lowkey driven by interest and what the other person gets out of you, and you get out of them. I don´t believe men are capable of truly loving me, they can only love how I make them feel, or what I can do for them. Often times, I believe my family only loves me when its convenient to them, they only seem to be proud of me when my ideas succeed, but never when I have to sacrifice time or take risks to get that success. I feel like an outsider to society, everything seems so empty, and there´s no way back out of this rabbit hole. **I will always want more and I feel like it will poison me**. I despise the life that the majority live: be born, school, uni, get married to an avg. Joe, work to pay taxes all your life, kids, grandkids, death. **But deep inside, I admire how people can be happy with that life.** My days Monday to Friday revolve around working, looking the best I can, self improvement podcasts, reading. I wake up, take like 15 supplements, have coffee and a cig, work from 8 to like 22:00, see my grandmother and have OMAD dinner. I believe she´s the one woman who loves me purely for who I am, and now she barely remembers me. On weekends, I try to have fun and go to bigger cities where I have friends to basically live like Blair Waldorf. I also go on dates with like 5 men in 2 days, fine dine, act like I´m so innocent and interested in their meaningless finance jobs while I know they just want me for sex and none of them will ever love me. I´m only 21. Why does it feel like this? I have never had a great relationship with my mother, but I have always wanted to have a daughter and be the mother I never had for her. I think this is the one thing that will bring me real joy and satisfaction one day, but I´m so young it´s more like a daydream other than a "plan". I used to love kids, I don´t so much anymore.I watched Karine Alourde on YouTube, where she does biographies of famous women across centuries. A common denominator in many of them, is that often times they dealt with depression and mental health issues. I´m not there at all, I´d say I´m happy and bubbly 98% of my days, but my thing is that I can only get happiness and a sense of fulfillment from starting another business, making money, being more successful, earing power, being skinnier, or buying new clothes. Men don ́ t even interest me, unless they are very successful and powerful. I feel like this community has helped me tremendously, even when I´m just scrolling down reading other women´s stories. We are all in very similar journeys, trying to get better at everything we can, and for me, this sub isn´t so much about men, other than becoming the woman of your own dreams. I love seeing there´s so many of us in this path, and how most of the posts here are focused on leveling up, and not men. But I can´t help but feel like this sometimes… Does anyone else feel the same? What do you do to escape the blues? What are your sources of true happiness and joy?&#x200B;Thanks for reading, love you all! :). Hey girlies!I don´t think this topic has been talked about a lot, but I think it's kind of needed. **We all hear those things about jealousy and how the best thing we can do is to stay unbothered** but I know a lot of us wouldn´t want to lose lifelong friendships if we could avoid toxicity from getting in our circles. I am now at a point in my life where I have things pretty much together thanks to my own efforts: i´m in uni, have a job, a business running and another one on the way. This would make a lot of people my age envious, but I´m very private and careful with who I let in my circle, so it has never bothered me too much. Thanks to having these businesses and things, my agenda has been busier with networking events, business lunches and business trips. I enjoy being introduced to influential people, but I can never talk about it with anyone since I feel I´d awaken the wrong feelings in people. My parents don´t even seem to be that happy for me, especially my mom, so telling my friends about many of the things going on in my life doesn´t seem like the right thing to do, I´d rather keep conversations lightweight and only bring up these things if I have a resource or contact that can be of help for my friends. Recently I have been dating more actively, and since my last relationship (a guy my age, good internship, in uni), I noticed I´m mentally not really 20, and dating guys older than me makes a lot more sense, can relate to my current life situation a lot more than guys in their 20s and actually treat me like I deserve; nothing is less desirable to me now than building a man up... Dating older guys while being so young has its pros and cons: i´m pretty sure when I go out with a guy in my rotation who is 38 people assume I´m sugaring, but tbh I don´t care too much. The good thing about older more stablished men, is that they are super eager to show me their world and treat me really really well. So well **I can´t talk about my dates with my friends because I think they´ll become salty or jealous. They are good friends regardless, and I understand jealousy can be a somewhat natural reaction, so I´d rather save the headache and keep most things to myself.** I do bring my best friend, who is also very much into self-improvement and dating smart, to some dinners and outings (known her since we were 11, we´re both from a great background and she goes to a top uni), and although I still don´t tell her **all** about my life or dating experiences, for safety I sometimes just have to. A couple of days ago, this guy on my rotation (38) offered to take me on a trip for my birthday. My friend only knows basic info about him (his age, occupation and area he lives in), but I´m going to have to tell her i´m going on this trip for my own safety, just in case something happens it´s always good to have someone know who you´re with and where you´re going. I feel like even though my experiences are benefiting my friend, since she´s also getting to know cool people and we´re brought to private clubs and such for free, this won´t stop people from potentially becoming salty or jealous. **I don´t have many friends I trust, and I would really want to be careful to keep this friendship healthy.** Maybe I´m making a bigger deal in my head than it is, but I don´t want a competition kind of friendship (Blair and Serena). We have a lot in common and I value her advice a lot, she also wants a well-off partner, although in our circle that´s kind of natural, it tends to be a bit classist. **For me, I just want to date and make the most out of the guy´s connections for my own good, and marry filthy rich in the way of doing so (I very obviously don´t openly discuss this w her lol).** Since this last thing is a bit of a diabla tactic, **I basically don´t want a Lauren Sanchez situation to happen to me.****So girls... has anything like this happened to you before?, have you had good friendships turn into toxic ones? why did you think that was?, how can i keep jealousy out of my circles and still share good moments with them?** Thanks in advance babes! I hope your day goes amazing <3. Yes… I knowI started my fast today (Monday) and plan on finishing it this Friday at around 21:00. I have done 3 day fasts before which turned out to be great and pretty easy to do for me. When breaking these 3 day fasts I always ate keto and veg, but I have never done such a long fast as im doing now. Something came up on Friday and im going to a fine dinning restaurant for dinner with my best friend and a couple of other interesting people, we will probably end up going out that night too. The purpose of this fast is to both cleanse and reset my body, and loose the last couple of kg I need to loose. Im F20, 175cm and around 64kg for reference. How can I enjoy the night without fucking up my digestive system or feeling like crap? I don’t eat a lot but I’d like to enjoy food and maybe a couple of glasses of wine. I thought of ending my fast a couple of hours earlier with combucha and something light, to prepare my system. Thank you all for your help! 😊. Hi girlies!I have the said question for all of you, and I will explain myself better here. I am sure we are all on the same page with certain boundaries or requirements to move past certain stages of a relationship. These may look different from person to person but to me, some of these boundaries look like no kissing on first dates, no texting or calling late at night, no sex without a previous STD test, or no sex without being in a serious committed relationship (him being the one to ask, for sure). Of course, these limits make it hard for manipulative men or those who want to take advantage of you to end up in a relationship with you, or ever getting too close to intimacy when they aren´t really looking to commit. But, even with the boundary of "no sex unless in a committed and exclusive relationship", **I know men are capable of faking wanting to be exclusive only to get sex from you. This got me thinking... Do I need an extra boundary to make sure a relationship isn´t just a synonym for sex to them? Because part of me thinks that good men are happy to hear that you limit access to your body, but others will take it as a challenge to get intimate with you.** **If we give up the most sacred part of our body, what do we get in return? Just commitment?** (Even Stephen Hawkings cheated on his wife, so getting commitment from a man in exchange for the most intimate part of me doesn´t sound like a deal lol). It´s honestly not that hard to make a man pay for things and, by the time you´re in the stage of wanting to move forward with both sex and commitment, he would´ve already spent a generous amount on trips, restaurants and cultural outings without being exclusive, so monetary investment doesn´t always equal commitment as many dating gurus suggest. **Investment from a man it´s a necessary, but not sufficient condition to a relationship.****We all know the clear differences of the benefits and the different roles we acquire when dating, being bf & gf and marriage, but what do these differences look like for men?** Because honestly, we see women everyday giving wife or girlfriend benefits to a guy that despises her, but I have never heard a man tell another: "Dude, you´re doing too much, that´s husband behavior!". **Then how "expensive" should our exclusivity be? What are the extra efforts a man should make to get me to be in a relationship? If I´m rejecting all of the guys on my rotation and potential partners for you, what do I get in exchange?** Should we be entitled, for example, to his phone password when he asks to be his gf? I´m just giving ideas lolI´m really looking forward to hearing from you all ladies!&#x200B;. I have stumbled across this interesting podcast about social status, genetics and mobility, and what makes a person move up or down social classes. The researcher throws some very insightful and controversial views, some quite opposed to the mainstream dialogue. The full podcast can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh7X8LBjIO4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh7X8LBjIO4) What do you think of his research? Do you think this applies to women the same way? I´m excited to know your views since there is women from so many different backgrounds on this sub.. Hey girls!The other day I was thinking of what separated the 10s from the 8s or 9s, or the 8s and 9s from 7s, and **I personally think it´s just about the tiniest and smallest details that add up to your style and the way you carry yourself.** These details might look different for everybody depending on your style, but I think there are certain things that elevate the look of a woman and add to the "je ne sais quoi" vibe. I live in Europe and I think it´s important to say that because fashion changes a lot from country to country. Also, implement details that will make your style and personal identity elevated, never implement something you don´t resonate with or you´ll look like you´re trying too hard or wearing a costume. (Kinda cringe).My personal style is elegant and classic but fun, think of 2010s off duty model (Rosie Huntington) with mean french girl vibe (Jane Birkin). This is the best way I can explain lol. Some of these small details I´ve noticed and I´m implementing for fall and winter are: \- Wearing your hair inside your coat: just a vibe, specially if it´s a long and structured coat. \- Big dark sunglasses that kinda let your eyes show through dark faded lenses, also wearing sunglasses in winter is so incredibly chic.\- Belts. Whatever I´m wearing I´m going to start adding a belt to it. I think they´re low key statement pieces. (Does anyone have good leather belt reccomendations? trying to start a small collection :))\- Jewlery stacks. I have lately been super into niche and vintage jewlery, and I love those pieces so much more than any Van Cleef or Cartier... Figure out if gold or silver suits you best. Personally, I want to make a necklace and watch+bracelet stack to wear everyday without having even to think about it. I especially find mixed metal stacks so so so sexy. \- Instead of overlining lips, line them naturally and smudge a little bit the liner so the cut between your skin and lips is more faded, they will naturally look bigger. I do this with Chanel lip liner in shade Pivoin and... orgasmic. \- Square nails, although almond shapes are all you see today, I find these so timeless and chic. \- Total black looks: I mean, do I even have to explain?\- Not wearing foundation (if you don´t need to). \- Loose undone buns + turtle necks, but no claw clips pleaseeee! Use a chopstick or a french pin. \- Hair with a lot of volume on the roots \- Unisex niche fragances: I love smells that leave you wanting to smell the person again and again but are kind of masculine too, they kind of add character. Think of spicy cherries, almonds, whiskey and liquour, oriental smells... For Fall, I love roses vanille by Mancera and Lost Cherry by Tom Ford. Open to more reccomendations!These small things are great because they make you kind of unreadable: they contribute to a unique image, personal style and way of carrying yourself, so people will never be able to point out what is exactly the thing that makes you different and effortlessly put together. I have implemented some of this and I´ve gotten a lot of compliments :) Am I missing something? What are those things you notice elevate anyone´s presence in subtle ways?. Hey girlies!The post title is pretty self-explanatory but... what are your views on this?The evidence on how couples that move in before marriage end up with higher divorce rates gets thrown around a lot, and tbh I think this is just correlated to religious people being a lot less likely to divorce. Correlation isn´t equal to causation so...I´m a bit contradicted, I live in a small town and would want to move out asap. If possible, by my own means, but if I happen to meet someone from a big capital and things evolve, I wouldn´t be sure of what to do. Needless to say, with or without a ring it´s important to not depent on him 100% and have an exit plan for whatever could happen. Part of me really supports the idea of living with a man before marrying him to see how lifestyles and habits coordinate between the two, but I also am conflicted on relationship dynamics and giving him "wife benefits" with no ring... What do you girls think? I´d love to hear from engaged and married girlies!. Hi girlies! I thought of starting this thread to discuss some serious topics we must have in mind when dating. Taking into account a lot of us are very young and we are all interested in dating up, this thread makes a good opportunity to give each other advice. I’d recommend everyone to listen to the FDS podcast and Reddit threads on vetting strategies, it’s made me very sensitive to BS and know when to cut things and part ways fast but appart from the average red flags, are there any you look out for when dating a guy? I also think it’s very important to discuss boundaries when dating men in comfortable positions, this is specially important for women that come from less privileged backgrounds and could be easily impressed by a man offering to fly her out and such. I have noticed a lot of wealthy men are just former sugar d’s and don’t change their ways, only water them down. These transactional habits can come off to less experienced ladies as “provider minds get men” when they’re just trying to buy a girlfriend. What are some important boundaries to inforce specially when only starting to date someone and offers for trips and such? What are things you do to protect yourself from being love bombed? How do you do about dating with men that travel often or live in different cities?Last but not least, we discussed in a previous post what age gaps we would be comfortable with. This is of course very personal, but what are some red flags you look out for when dating older men? I feel like, while generally men are attracted to women younger than them, when talking of age gaps (+ 8 or 9 years appart) there is a risk of coming in contact with some… rather weird individuals. There’s a rethoric out there that says that older men date younger because they have become unbearable for women their age. I personally don’t think this is true, as I have met men that work in jobs that require them to travel all the time, or have built their own businesses and just haven’t had the time and stability to form a long term relationship. On another hand, older men that have a long history of age gap relationships are kinda… creepy. It gives me predatory vibes and just makes me think that I’m just one of the many eternal placeholders (see Leonardo do Caprio), I genuinely don’t think these men ever want to settle down. Let’s discuss all of these ladies! I’m eager to hear your views and experiences on this juicy topics! ☕️. Hey everyone!September has started and with that most sports clubs and associations launch new programs and start new groups. I have been focusing on my physical and mental level up like crazy this year, and figured I now have the head space to start new hobbies and use them as a means of networking and meeting new friends as well. I live in Europe and I know there are many niche sports depending on the country, weather, geographical location etc, and wanted to hear which of these niche sports or hobbies you have heard of/practice. On a personal note, I have always been a very active child but in my teens I became a gymrat and never left the gym since. This year I´m jumping back on tennis and horse riding classes, as well as pilates sessions. I think we would all agree that there are some popular "rich people" hobbies all over the world, to me golf, tenis and skii come to mind. **Are there any other hobbies or sports that aren´t as famous but you know about/have practiced?**Where I´m from I would also add polo (only in specific locations with clubs), sailing and regattas, hunting (although this is mostly for men), and also horse riding. Some social events that could also be considered hobbies and gather big groups of fans are bullfights and maybe horse races. I´m curious to know, it´s always good to expand one´s knowledge on these things!. Hey girlies! We all agree that to be hot you need to be fit. I think this holds a different meaning for everyone:more or less muscular, more or less fat, leaner or more “bbl-ish” legs… I have always been very sportive and tend to put on muscle quite easily. That together with my height and love for food can make it extremely easy for me to literally look like a bulky giant, which is SO not what I want. My starting point right now is normal weight: I’m 20years old, 175cm and weight around 63kg, BMI 20 aprox but after years of powerlifting my legs hold quite a bit of muscle. I want to go after the model skinny look: I know I have to be in a calorie deficit but I wanted to share views with other girls that have this same goal body and get advice on how to best sustain this for the long run. I have started taking supplements to fix some needs that could be causing more hunger than natural, fixed my sleep schedule, hormone balancing and intermittent fasting, but struggle most with keeping things sustainable.Edit:A lot of people seem to be getting ED vibes from my post, for some reason… It’s the body that I want to have and no, I do not have any underlying health or psychological issues.Hey girlies!The question of "How much is enough?" sparked up a few weeks ago, but I have been thinking about it more lately since I read a comment on a post from a girl saying she´d much rather marry a software engineer making 100-200K with family values and great stability than a cheating billionaire. The first thing that came to mind when questioning myself about this, is that with different levels of wealth, come different perks and also disadvantages. You will also be expected to be a different woman when dating men in these different levels of wealth, and I think the differences and expectations that old money vs new money men (and their families) have upon women are also quite significant within the wealth "levels". I come from a comfortable family, but never cared too much about designer items, superyatchs or exotic trips. We do well and are somewhat well-connected. I personally focus on men that make at least 1M a year, which being in Europe and with the current cost of living isn´t very extravagant I believe. I find it attractive when men put great interest into investments but those take time and I´m focused on guys 30-35, so don´t have a number for this. I prefer old money because of certain mannerisms of the new money that I don´t really identify with and I really wouldn´t mind relocating to the USA, although life quality here is superior. **I'm curious to hear from you girls! How much is enough for you? What´s your background? Do you come from money and career-driven families already? Do you prefer old money or new money? How do you think your personality and look appeal to your type? What level of comfort do you value most/aspire to? (if say, exotic vacations once a month are non-negotiables for you, or on the contrary you´d be happy with being a housewife, having free time and being able to afford good schools for the kids). Also, very important, where are you from and/or would like to live? This can very much affect our views.** I would love to hear your views on this. For better understanding, please let´s refer to yearly income and net worth digits in dollars.. Hey girlies!While taking into consideration that these might be generalizations and can´t be applied to all, I do think that social climate, culture and environment are the most influential variables that affect relationship dynamics and how a significant other will treat you. Part of this is, of course, culture. I live in South Europe and, with the exception of some traditional Italians, men expect you to go 50/50, even those in comfortable positions. Don´t expect them to plan surprises or gift you flowers out of the blue, not to talk about the gifting. Men here have bad taste, if any when doing thoughtful things for their women. There are always exceptions, but 95% of men in these countries will be like this. No provider mindset whatsoever, and women will still be held to very high standards regarding beauty, kids and household chores, although with younger generations (we have been very influenced by socialism and feminism) family values or roles aren´t even brought up, 50/50 is automatically accepted. Central Europe is a no-go for me as well, with very similar equalitarian culture.On the contrary, men in Eastern countries have been great to date! Lots of effort, text messages throughout the day (good Lord even poems!), weekend getaways, showered in compliments, future-oriented... I have talked to Russians, Serbians and Bulgarians.I am texting Americans and they also seem to be very attentive, I´m curious to know about how relationship dynamics are there. Also, has anyone had experiences with men from countries like Lebanon, Georgia, Israel...?Let´s discuss, I am super passionate to learn about other cultures and more so if it helps with dating!. Hey ladies! For some background: I am a 20 year old girl from Spain, currently in college, working in marketing and about to launch my own business. I take my looks extremely seriously and am often asked if I model (blonde, tall, green eyes...) I don´t look like the avg Spanish girl so that also catches people´s attention. I live in a small town (a few big corporations, not much wealth), so I am not really hoping to find anything here nor am I putting out myself out very actively to be fair, although I do engage in corp events due to my job and attend one of the best gyms in the area. Something I have been able to experience is that men that I´m attracted to (at least 30), look and even stare at me, but don´t approach me at all. In the gym I have gotten lots of attention from PTs and college students, but no older man has ever asked for my number or approached me, despite having made eye contact, but when dating online I get SO much attention from older guys, they´re just usually in other countries or the USA, and don´t know how I´d go about distance dating to be honest.I will be moving out of the city to a bigger one in a year or so for more startup opportunities, and I wonder if there is something I am doing wrong or should be doing. I have never been a fan of giving the first step, but **it seems like they don´t expect me to consider them even an option...** All help is much appreciated! <3&#x200B;. I have recently started rotational dating with a few guys that I’m interested in. Depending on the day, I like one more than the other 😂, but this is not a problem since I’m not on a rush (I’m 20) and some of this guys live abroad although they travel for our dates and sometimes we meet in other countries. Though I’m marriage minded for sure, my purpose isn’t really to get married straight after dating since I’m so young and not even out of college, but I was wondering how will I go about telling the other guys that I’m not interested anymore after picking the one I like most. It’s my first time doing rotational dating, and breakups have never been my thing, I used to always blame it on “growing different ways” and honestly would like to be more assertive in this regard. Thanks in advance!. Hey all! Thanks for reading 😊As the title says, I am curious on hearing any experiences you might’ve had with integrative and holistic therapies. I am taking my pcos seriously (finally), starting by diet and clearing toxics from my lifestyle (BPA water bottles and containers, cosmetics with endocrine disrupters…) and including 2 herbal infusions a day (spearmint, raspberry leaf, lemon verbena, licorice root and lavender). My next step is going to be looking into evidence based supplements (I know this subreddit has big fans of Ovasitol, so I’ll be looking into it!😊). I have also heard acupuncture works quite well with conditions like this, and I was wondering if any of you had experiences with natural ways of healing like this.I’m so glad to be in this subreddit, it’s being amazing to have a community that truly understands. Thanks ♥️. Dear all, thanks for reading!It´s truly been so nice to find this group, I am beyond happy to have a small community to talk about these things. I am a 20-year-old that, after my first OBGYN check-up 4 years ago, got told that my ovaries had cysts and was put on BC, which I ended up quitting after 5 months. I have always been very active and we eat very healthily in my family, so my weight is normal though it fluctuates more than I´d like. Lately, I have been having irregular but frequent periods (I almost never go a month without a period) and together my maternal instincts waking up (I know it´s too early, but my boyfriend and I want to have kids in the future and fertility in truly important for me), has made me go back into the doctor´s office for answers and guidance on PCOS. I had read about glucose, insulin, PCOS, fertility, and all before going to the doctor´s, so I knew what we would be discussing. After visiting 3 different doctors looking for some knowledge or advice, other than "you? PCOS? Not at that weight...", I have decided to go the more holistic route. I do have a small background in medicine, although not directly related to this subject, and initially thought I would get blood work done, along with some nutri genetic tests, to then try and heal with food and supplements naturally. I do wish to contact a holistic or integrative OBGYN, but for now, I have had enough disappointments with the medical system and want to get bloodwork done ASAP. I had thought of checking: \- Cortisol\- Insulin\- TSH, T3, T4\- Testosterone (free and total)\- AMH\- FSH\- LH\- Progesterone\- Vits. D + E\- Iron, Calcium, Zinc, Chromium, and Magnesium\- Estradiol\- DHEA\- SHBG\- Prolactin\- Insulin resistance test(Needless to say, if any of the previous markers shows to be too far high or low from the average recommended amounts, I will go ahead and arrange a doctor´s appointment)Is there something I might be missing? I want to get a blood test that is as detailed as possible to be able to solve specific issues, instead of going from one doctor to another or visiting scientific papers for days looking for generic answers. **I would appreciate getting all sorts of advice, I am especially worried about fertility since being a mother truly is my dream.** I don´t have a family history of infertile women (quite the opposite, I come from big families and my mom had her last at the age of 41), but I can´t stop but worry since I have seen this is a rising issue and professionals advice to tackle infertility from the soonest possible. Thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart!.
    I am in divorce and while by normal standards it is a complete disaster I figure I am doing good for BPD divorce. Children will be living with me, right now we are debating how supervised visitation can be restarted.Following her violent discard I developed a 'narcissistic adaptation defense'. Which is quite fascinating but healthy extreme human behavior. You basically (instantly) generate a narcissistic false self against the stressor (and nobody else). This rendered her instantly powerless and she went no-contact herself after several failures to get any kind of control or even reaction. Under cover from an effective defense and several other levels of emotional shielding I healed over several months and she would probably be powerless now anyway. The narcissistic adaptation defense still activates though anyway.However... the divorce, my lawyer is doing very well thank you. I know 90% sure where this will end, I am pretty sure exwBPD knows this as well given her court filings acuse me of a dark interpretation of that endpoint. If I can calm her down, regulate her mood in e-mail exchange to settle this legally, then I am going to save a lot of money.I have been 'engineering' an e-mail to her:1. Long-winded opening about good things, but notably something great she set to do and achieved but probably doesn't realize yet.2. Telling what my intentions are, these obviously conflict her narrative. But her narrative is being struck down in court and beginning to collapse everywhere, this might be a good time to save face.3. Setting boundaries/requirements: no accusations or characterizations, but she can address her distrust and fears through open questions.I am only taking one shot, and I would like some advice. I feel I need to hack BPD to communicate.Not really about pwBPD, but about me and neurotypicalish people... ADHD. So pwBPD abused me and children for years, violent discard, and then much more suffering from smear campaign. Can't really blame insane person, likewise, she and others cannot blame me for protecting our children and myself.Now, while I already knew 'Suzan' (fake name) was siding with exwBPD and treating me unfairly, naturally I assumed that I deserved it. However, I recently realized the legal term for Suzan's actions is "forgery" and I can definitely prove 3 instances. I'm using this information calmly and rationally, which is to start with a conversation with her employer. Not USA by the way, damage claim would amount to €150k at best.I've had many sleepless nights over not being able to cope with the horrible situation. Now... this is over, why does blaming someone make this problem disappear?. We engaged in BDSM, her dominant, frequency increased over time. Kink in my experience is moreso awkward and complicated than amazing and wild.However, she has never been abusive or scary during. When something complicated and frustrating went wrong, ropes are tricky, she just dealt with it calmly. Afterwards there was true accountability and nuanced views. I never felt so safe with her. I would say it probably gave her sadistic and narcissistic supply. It might also allow her to follow micro impulses, so they don't exceed her micro-coping nechanism. It didn't stick after sessions, I recall an incident 2 minutes (enmeshment) after... But she would be significantly more stable in anticipation. It worked much better than therapy, but then therapy was the worst and most physically dangerous thing we tried. I should note she was physically stronger than me, so it didn't matter for physical safety. I wouldn't 'walk away' anyway if she ever got violent (in the same room), let alone run away with all the children.Simple: Blindly follow the advice of selected people, ignore your feelings.pwBPD knows you, pwBPD has been mentally rehearsing these battles against you for months or years. By changing the 'you' you effectively burned pwBPDs battle plans and war doctrine. Now pwBPD is out there, powerless, without a plan, and without you to regulate their emotions which is catastrophic.You 'just' need to ignore your feeling and blindly follow others. My core thought to stay the course was: 1. *"Whatever happens, I can't go back to how things were"*2. Can I trust myself to react assertively? - No...3. Then I shall do what others tell me to.Guided by fear and my parents advice, I did everything right without having watched any of the YouTube videos I did over the past months. After roughly 4 months my feelings seemed more or less healthy, and I felt that guiding my own actions produced better results than continued blind obedience.*Small caveat: my parents are narcissistic and my impression is that pwBPDs are very vulnerable to narcissistic strategies, so with neurotypical advice the results may be less spectacular.*. I don't know if it is normal, but aside from seeing things that are not there and attacking me for it, pwBPD also saw things that were truthfully going to be there months later. 2 weeks before this started, something changed that caused me to begin seeing clearly. After a few months I would have decided I needed to take action... She assumed this action was going to be X, which would have been likely. She initiated countermeasures... She initiated **countermeasures against something I was going to think** AFTER going through a development that was **yet to happen**.I haven't had a single "with the benefit of hindsight"-scenario that would have stood up to this precognitive countermeasure.Is this common, or was my pwBPD just really smart?. I think I had quite narcissistic traits up to age 23, notably grandiose thoughts, machiavellianism, and a fear of being destroyed when I was caught out. Also notably, I turned out to have hyper-empathy officially established, though I would say I had to learn to be consciously aware of other peoples emotions, emotionally I have always reacted appropriately if somewhat excessive to empathy input.At age 21 a psychologist effectively challenged my fear of being destroyed. From age 23 to age 25 I became aware of hurting people and suffered narcissistic injuries at an increasing rate. I became unable to hurt others in any way and showed my weakness... And was accepted... and socially underdeveloped and temporarily diagnosed with autism, later retracted as symptoms disappeared and were attributed to narcissistic parents trauma. This could be explained as False Self hiding behind True Self perhaps?For a while I was annoyed by intrusive grandiose thoughts but these weakened. My biggest current complaint is that I still struggle to hurt others when it is appropriate and am generally 'weak', yet act with enormous manipulative effectiveness and machiavellianism when this is objectively justified.Could I have failed narcissism or some weird variant?NPI: 18Codependent: 5OCD: 1. I notice videos and comments talking or warning about this, but I genuinely wish my ex the best, not just because that means she might leave me alone.I spent so much, too much, energy and health on making her happy. Why would I not be happy that maladaptive goal was ultimately achieved without me?. Before the discard I received therapy to decouple though in other terms. I was close already and then a mandatory reporter said I needed to stand up to her **now** or she would be forced to report to 'CPS'.Losing power triggered a sudden and literally violent discard, I lived in fear until she was briefly institutionalized. Fear has been a good and proportional companion in that journey. As the smoke cleared not only was all love and coercive fear gone. I couldn't even really reactivate my awareness of her thinking when asked explicitly to predict negative things she might say so a child therapist could prepare.When she messages me I immediately notice all attempts at manipulation, but no panic, no fiery nervous system... Just amusement at her blatant attempts and predictability.I do worry... Is the simulation of her repressed, ready to return, or did it collapse to destruction? It seems plenty is destroyed in terms of my ego and identity, possibly temporarily possibly irreversible.She likely had petulant BPD, on poor grounds we assumed ASPD for years... So fair chance for both. Anyway it is scary how textbook our relationship was, except the ending. Due to external factors I became aware and assertive literally overnight. This was completely unexpected for her, shortly after she left and escalated violently. Another complicated random-ish event caused by her took control out of both our hands rendering her unable to do much of the things I see in YouTube videos post breakup. What happens to her now... Standing to lose everything, unless a dark miracle happens?. I haven't always been aware of this... But I developed this mostly emotional proces that activates when I am vigilant or hypervigilant, but I can also activate it at will.I don't know *what* I am doing exactly, it seems to be an emotional/right-brain affair, but I do know I am consciously doing a lot of analysis of dubious statements in service of this proces.The end result is that my nparents, slick job interviewers, and people in board games who project or are manipulative... Somehow see evidence for whatever they think of me and run with it. Sincere and analytical people are not affected by this, and as this proces basically runs on fear it cannot activate anyway usually. But... NPD and HPD fall for this completely.It really helped my nparents give up on manipulating me 'for being too stupid', I was curious if more people have a similar defense.I'm in a divorce with an abusive narcissist. Things are going well in the courts, outside of that I have been drawn, quartered, disembowled, re-embowled, stitched together by authorities and victorious. My lawyer did good work, I did things well... had things gone differently... I would still have been victorious thanks to her, not necessarily slower.This is because she did 3 of these silent unseen surgical micro-defeats. In between tirades about rights being violated a single unseen administrative act that is legally private assured she probably could not have won a particular battle. During a long verbal tirade in a meeting, one declaration, hidden by a crying cannonade of insults that followed it, again assured defeat for her... I can't remember the other.&#x200B;Are these failed attempts to draw out the conflict?Or is there some good in her that seizes protects people against herself?. Answer: because I have empathy, guilt, and could be at peace knowing I was worthless.But sorry, need to rant/vent. Though please react, also feel free to contest and challenge things I say (politely), it really helps my thinking..My parents and brother are narcissists. My ex-wife was possibly a covert narcissist, but definitely someone who committed narcissistic abuse for psychiatric reasons. After my wife had her literally violent (narcissistic) collapse I lost empathy for her as I needed to protect myself and the children. I miraculously did everything right without having watched all the YouTube videos that told me to do exactly what I had done spontaneously.I had a phone call with my nbrother where he said that showed I had the same power as him and our father, and I should learn to use it earlier. This played a bit into my old fears of being a narcissist myself. Which I discussed at great lengths in the past with a humored psychologist.My parents sent me to this psychologist for autism diagnosis at 20, he determined I had narcissistic parents trauma. He noted I had grandiose fantasies, we explored this and it was the only way to get approval from my father and didn't work to get traction socially (hence autism suspicion on my end) - after therapy: just telling people about my day was much easier without first needing to embelish it. I only occasionally use grandiose fantasies as thought experiments with tangible benefits, such as making a choice or to develop a story for a (board)game.I am still horrified about what I did to an ex-girlfriend. She offered to start wearing high heels for me, I initially said no need not wanting her to waste money on that, but later I offered to buy them for her. Easy, I just acted naturally, but things went wrong somehow... She felt guilty somehow, and at some point she felt defeated when 'we' should have felt triumphant... I felt terrible immediately, I still know where I was and even the weather, and here I really failed at narcissism. I concluded either that my approach was wrong, or that this okay approach just doesn't work for her and I should have known. - I adjusted, said I was sorry how badly this was turning out, and asked what she wanted... She still wanted them and had an idea; we had a good and successful shopping trip. Only later did I recognize this was not being socailly clumsy, but the application of narcissistic methods.To this day I can be very sensitive also, feeling ashamed easily... But when I do: A quote for me (from Enron documentary) "Would you rather be shot as a crook or as an idiot?" - "idiot, ASAP" - When I feel bad I think, "I know I am worthless, but once you stop fearing I am a crook I hope we can still work together so please judge(shoot) me as an idiot so we can move on."I learned to be comfortable being worthless, possibly as a defense against abuse? Had my parents treated me better maybe this would not have prevented me becoming a narcissist... but I see no way how you can become a narcissist if the things you do hurt others so much you yourself still painfully remember them decades later.TLDR: 1. Grandiosity observed, was attempt to get approval.2. I guilt tripped and gaslighted once, empathy terminated that habit.3. If I am worthless I need to accept it and move on, if I am not worthless I need to move on, so it doesn't matter.Grew up with narcissistic parents, this gave me a number of problems some of which explicitly put me at risk of being targeted by Cluster-B's... which I found out after getting into an abusive relationship. My ex-in-progress was diagnosed C-PTSD, but the abuse was clearly narcissistic abuse. Whether the narcissistic abuse was a part of C-PTSD or if she also has NPD doesn't really matter, what matters is the damage or rather finding and repairing it.Before you say therapy... yes, I'm on a long waiting list.Anyway, she left herself, did things, I could get full custody almost immediately. Proof-based institutions like the courts side with me, while 'soft' more useful authorities for arranging therapy for the kids believe her story and are paralyzed and they 'attack' me in their confusion. Some friends and family also briefly sided with her until she inevitably 'demonstrated' her mental problems to them.Today I received an admission from one involved person from such a 'soft' authority who misjudged the situation. He said the way in which I conduct myself made me not so much suspicious or unbelievable, but simply made it much more convenient to go by her story until things got clearer. He was sorry and I see he made the mistake, but everyone made the same mistake so I must be a factor in making this mistake.I'm clearly damaged in some way. Where do I even start to assess all these damages so I can Google what to do about it?. Not sure what to make of it, but it is my own conclusion through discovery not pressure...My childhood was terrible and scarred me for life through their actions. Same for my sensitive little brother, but much less so for my other brother and sister. My sister by the way is entirely in agreement that they are narcissists.However, after receiving medication for ADHD, and treatment to become assertive they didn't seem as bad anymore. My nparents don't respect boundaries, they do have empathy but are not limited by it. They cannot resist getting their way or their fix, despite the consequences for others. Except that they do seem to have an "effort limit", they just quickly stop manipulating when results are not worth their efforts once or twice.After developing significant resistance, which I didn't consciously apply, things just got better with them and now I figured out why. I can trust them if I put up reasonable and sustainable resistance. So weird.I struggle to find a balance between relevance and sufficient information, as this topic does not concern the abuse itself... I hope I strike the right balance.**Accidental abuse**I have been with my wife almost 10 years. We have 4 kids, I do 95% of childcare and 80% of household, she is breadwinner but I also work part time. I managed this workload easily until I was burdened by her emotionally. My wife has a (self-diagnosed) personality disorder affecting her empathy and guilt. Lacking proper empathy and guilt it is easy to accidentally abuse someone it seems.Recently due to long covid she became "accidentally abusive" a lot for half a year. I receive professional help from a social worker and psychologist, my wife is now getting an official diagnoses and hopefully treatment after diagnosis if possible, for what it is worth they want to pursue our self-diagnosis first as it seems to fit the symptoms best in their opinion. This is all ongoing and not subject of this thread.I should also point out that it was only after I began seeing a psychologist a few weeks ago that I began to consider her behavior to be real abuse, albeit accidental.**System (family?) therapy**Mostly unrelated to this, my son (4M) developed a mysterious issue that was in essence really minor but with severe ramifications. One partial cause was found to originate in family dynamics, so we received system therapy. This involves the case worker Suzan (\~35F), system therapist Fred (\~35M) and psychiatrist Gerard (\~55M). The condition has been completed cured, but they recommend we continue to receive system therapy which I am (very) happy to continue... except offcourse the reason why I post this.**I am vulnerable**I was raised by 2 narcissistic parents, had undiagnosed and untreated ADHD until this year, developed even more unhealthy (and enabling) behavior as a result of those 4 months of abuse by my wife in the past. When someone mistreats or disrespects me I blame myself and feel bad, only after prolonged attacks/abuse will I begin to identify the agressor as being an agressor and possibly needing to defend myself.By the way: The self-diagnosis of my wife in question is Anti Social Personality Disorder. I hate to mention it too early to avoid people responding just to this disorder and not the whole post.**The build up**Suzan creeped out my wife (who was then heavily long covid brain fogged), and she completely shut down every time aside from already being pretty "disarmed" when coming to these appointments. Suzan completely didn't believe anything of her self-diagnosis, I didn't consider this to be a problem, she might be right, so I didn't think too much of it.These appointments with Suzan were at the time where abuse really peaked. My manager noticed seeing me once per month... It somewhat saddens me they didn't notice it, but not their job.At one point she brought up she was really concerned that I supported this self-diagnosis as she saw no indications of it... instead she thought it was autism and my wife was just overstressed given this condition. We briefly spoke on it, and later I sent a message where I qualitatively described how she had been extremely ruthless and hurtful to me, but also with much finesse which in my amateur opinion didn't fit with autistic people I knew.Later we had some sessions with Fred, who was a lot more friendly by the way. His on-case findings were very helpful, but he also commented on my wife not coming across as our self-diagnosis but autistic. Again, I didn't think too much of it. Ultimately I don't care what she has, she needs to control it.**The breakdown**The most recent appointment was with me, wife, Suzan and Gerard. Gerard by the way mostly reviewed the case needs to perform the ultimate diagnosis, this is the second time I saw him.We had already pointed out she was already seeking professional help for a diagnosis and that I also saw a psychologist. We didn't say anything else as it was not relevant to my sons case.At some point Suzan said: "I know this is not my business, but..." - and she went off on a 10 minute monologue/attempted discussion with my wife pointing out how she was very stressed and I was causing it. She gave no openings for me, and when I thought to interject she proactively blocked it.Gerard noticed me slowly losing it and ultimately helped me to interject. I asked my wife permission to mention the abuse (coded), she allowed it, and began to tell it and broke down. My wife confirmed what I said, but struggled to say much, but it was enough and they believed it. This was confirmed by them (finally) asking questions they are legally required to ask as mandatory reporters when there is a risk of child abuse/neglect.Suzan masterfully dropped her earlier point, thanked me, and told this explains it. My wife is stressed from desperately trying not to abuse me, she was very happy this was now clear. Still, I could see she was rattled a bit... Gerard took over, again saying a lot of right things, but off-hand referred to it as "what is now dropped on the table". I could NOT have mentioned the abuse earlier as I didn't realize myself I was abused... and I did mention her problematic behavior both directly to both Suzan and Fred, but maybe I had made too little of it?**I feel bad, sometimes worthless, and very insecure**How many people also incorrectly deduce I am burdening and possibly abusing my wife, while she is abusing me? How can I now trust Suzan to take me seriously next time I mention something that is invisible to her?I think I need to have a call with Fred to know how he considered/dismissed my/our statements.I spoke to my own psychologist and he said that while therapists take seriously the abuse of men by women, they are so used to seeing men abusing women... abusive men also convince victim women they are the abusers themselves. He recommended I move past it, it should not happen again and we should be less subtle about it. The statements of my psychologist didn't really help my mood... it made me feel even more insecure and scared to be considered an abuser myself.These kind of horribly painful things happened before, often I find myself, at these times, wishing to be a woman preferring to suffer from gender dysphoria over this. Also minor inconveniences like schools etc always calling my wife first, not me, until the slowly learn I am the primary caregiver.**So, I need to move past...**Apparently, it is up to me to communicate very intensily I am abused to be taken seriously. Until a mandatory reporter ask child abuse/neglect questions I should assume they are not taking me seriously.I now need to continue working with Suzan and Fred. They did good with my son, and I expect my daughter to require us to engage in system therapy again / more.Update:We talked... With my psychologist I already established the situation did not favor me. I felt and looked guilty as I believed I deserved the abuse at the time, she was really scared about hurting me and being caught as abuser, and I was "manipulating" the flow of conversation so she wouldn't be triggered.Suzan says she is sorry, not showing it emotionally, but her actions were perfect. Fred was much more emotional, but pointed out he saw us very little... And he did learn to take (self) diagnosis seriously as a message of possibly serious problems.Edit: her treatment progresses... it is not ASPD. She has PTSD and she dissociates from empathy, guilt, most of her emotions... So functionally a sociopath when triggered, but not generally and importantly treatable. I'm married to a high functioning sociopath, long ago she had an emotionally abusive period until she realized what she did... but long covid turned her into a low functioning sociopath.I do 95% of childcare, 80% of household, she works full time and but has been unable to work most of the past half year... luckily our European employment contracts have unlimited paid sick leave and prohibit firing when sick. She has been home a lot though.She has been "accidentally emotionally abusive" most of the time, also needing unsustainable levels of emotional support otherwise become more abusive and less able to work. What I mean with accidental abuse is basically this pattern:1. We agree I don't do X for her, instead prioritizing myself or the kids for example.2. Confronted with X not having been done for her, she loses it and lashes out or at least burdening me with massive requirements for emotional support.3. She consciously actively prevents me from doing X and does not accept me making it up to her in any way.Despite there not being effective manipulation, and the relationship as a whole not being abusive. This was too hard on me and it felt like it was killing me, at least my blood pressure became unmanageable.I sought help, at first from a social worker. I managed to take steps to basically restore her emotional support and care for me, in creative and sexual ways, within the confines of her symptoms. This basically got me through the summer. However as her long covid symptoms improved so unfortunately did the frequency with which she (accidentally) emotionally abused me. She tried to compensate by improving her emotional support and care, the good parts of our relationship have never been better as a result... but I still couldn't keep it up. Work, childcare, household, supporting her, enduring abuse...She has always resisted seeking professional help, as she dealt with her ASPD by herself for decades. I demanded she either seek professional help for ASPD now, or find a way to unburden me. She agreed, to seek help but a 3 month waiting list was too long. So I needed help from a psychologist too, which feels unfair as she has the problem and she abuses me.Anyway, it was helpful. Up to that time I didn't want to call this emotional abuse, as she was not effectively manipulating me to achieve anything. He not only 'sold' me on "accidental emotional abuse" but also got her to accept she was "accidentally emotionally abusing" me. That was last week. Since then emotional and abusive incidents halved and show signs of continuing to rapidly disappear. Apparently she needed to accept she was emotionally abusing me, albeit accidentally, before she felt the urgency to really address it.So in summary:* Her investment in relationship has never been higher, and is objectively better than ever.* She seeks professional help for ASPD now.* She recognized she is emotionally abusing me.* Emotional and abusive burden on me is rapidly decreasing.&#x200B;So why do I now feel worse than before these things improved?* I can't sleep.* Close to crying at work more frequently than before.* Feeling more stressed and hypervigilant than before.* *(blood pressure has returned to normal)*. I (37M) was diagnosed with ADHD this year by a center dedicated to diagnosing and treatment for autism and ADHD. A lot of questions clearly looked for autism and there were also explicit conversations about autism, I did not think I had autism but was somewhat open to it.My only frustration was that I had been previously misdiagnosed with autism before that diagnosis was retracted following therapy for trauma that apparently caused autism like symptoms until it was treated. Had I been diagnosed with autism now, I only would have had frustrated questions about this history.However, they were convinced among themselves, no autism only ADHD.Enter a brother in law and wife, both diagnosed ADD who keep saying and implying I must also have autism.Enter an aunt and uncle who draw endless parallels with their autistic children (18-22), parallels that are very shortsighted and basically wrong in my opinion.Is this normal? 🙁. First of, not depressed, in fact I think I am immune to depression. I feel down and sad plenty of time but I'm really easily distracted from that. Also, my life is massively stabilized by the fact that the worse I feel the more I do. It feels like being a rocket powered bouncy ball in a concrete maze, as you increase the speed it inevitably will bounce out the exit at some point.This "being happy" thing has always seemed metaphorical to me. It seems that for me the best state of mind is the "flow state". Over the years we have been having children now ending at 4, and as my workload increases (I do 95% of childcare) I reliably achieve this "flow state" basically every schoolday. I also feel pride often enough... I enjoy what I do especially in flow...This is also how I get out of sadness. I feel sad, impulsivity increases, I see something that needs doing and I cannot resist doing it... this causes a period of "flow" and the sadness is reduced and who knows, the sparkling kitchen does something too.But there does not seem to be anything close to how "happiness" is described as a some sort of persistent emotional state that carries from day to day. If I have 4 good schooldays with "flow" followed by a terrible saturday with chaos unproductivity insults and stress there is no sort of buffer from those 4 good days that I still feel. Is this normal with ADHD brain?&#x200B;Or is this caused by being raised by 2 narcissistic parents, who in particular destroyed the foundations of healthy self-esteem and made me afraid of love?. Since I joined this sub I was unsure if I could even post here. A critical part that is missing in my "accidentally abusive" relationship is malicious intent and malicious planning. My wife has ASPD. Outside of the numerous incidents and the fear I have of these, she is actively helping maintain relationships with my family and helping me take care of myself and be assertive. However a significant part of the incidents does seem more than accidental allthough they absolutely serve no goal for her, quite the opposite, they tend to hurt or devastate her own short and medium term goals. I read the mentioned fable https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_FrogAn important interpretation to me:> "The psychologist Kevin Dutton saw the scorpion as a metaphor for psychopaths, whose impulsive and vicious personalities frequently get them into unnecessary trouble, often hurting the people they depend on, such as their own families."I am beginning to think that sometimes she just cannot resist stinging me, she is sorry if it happens on land... But she will just as easily sting me if it causes her to miss a day out she was looking forwards to. I should stop treating her as a high functioning sociopath who will do good if it serves her goals, and start treating her as a scorpion who cannot be put in a position where stinging me will significantly hurt me.Edit: not ASPD but PTSD with triggered dissociation during which she can be bad. Things at home are not fair, I do almost all childcare and two-thirds of household. There are a number of very good reasons for that. Notably she has ASPD, this is known to our pediatrician and actually following advice from this sub I have regular contact with a professional. Given the way we deal with her condition, notably me doing all childcare, and her cooperating in all care they are confident things will work out well.An injury she suffered that might heal in a year, maybe more, explains why she does less household chores.&#x200B;This is unfair, which sometimes gets to me, but right now I am succeeding a bit in thinking this might not be so bad... given that.1. She wanted 2 children, I wanted 4. She agreed to 4 when I made clear I was intending to take ultimate responsibility for childcare and household. 1. So... it could be argued the fair balance would be 75% of workload for me. 2. She wanted to do 50% of 2 kids, I wanted to do 50+% of 4 kids. 3. So the "Unfairness" is not doing 100% more housework, the unfairness is doing \~25% more.2. I have ADHD, impulsivity and hyperactivity is actually really useful, especially because it gets stronger when you are tired. 1. If I see something needs doing my impulsivity makes it difficult to NOT do it. 2. Hyperactivity is a consequence of getting (too) little gratification from doing something (good), so I need to do a lot to feel remotely satisfied. 3. If I don't have anything to do and I fail to let a computer game absorb me or something like that, I end up thinking myself into unhappiness, I cannot do nothing.&#x200B;So, if I wanted to do more anyway, doing near 100% isn't so bad if I basically aimed for 75%?Would Equity vs, Equality suggest it might be unfair if the non-ADHD partner was expected to just as much as the ADHD partner?&#x200B;As I said, copium attempt... I needed to vent and hope to make it stick well enough that I hold on to it when I feel sad :). I suffer from hyper vigilance, hyper empathy, have a high IQ (not a definite boon or bragging item for those who don't know) and my ADHD fuels excessive analysis. Thankfully this combines into exceptional insight in people, I have foreseen relationship beginnings and endings with high accuracy... And I identified 4 sociopaths, 2 confirmed themselves after asking, and a third was confirmed by one of those 2.However, if I am confronted with narcissistic behavior either by my nparents or other people I know well I am completely blind and might take months or years to notice let alone develop a response.When I received professional help for the issue that resulted from having nparents, I was diagnosed with a "neurotic disorder". Sadly this condition no longer exists with DSM updates, being split into depressive and anxiety disorders. It blocked memories thoughts and observations that I was "not allowed to have". The issue was treated successfully save from one semi relapse as an (effective) defensive against a sociopath. It is seemingly still on standby.Further professional help is not worth it, too busy, too little benefit. It is unlikely to even be covered as there is nothing abnormal about someone falling victim to a narcissist.Does anyone have advice or experience with combating these blind spots?. This is a big recurring annoyance for us. It is very important we help our children process what happens and what they do, and to maintain good energy levels so they can stay in control of themselves. Suffice to say there is a diagnosis and developmental professionals are involved, but they mostly just comment we are doing good. Other parents and teachers are not a problem, they might have an opinion or think there is something they don't know and that is fine! We know some of them think our children might be a bit autistic and that is fine too. They understand it is none of their business. Friends and (most) family are the problem. They constantly try to encourage us to do more with the children or don't worry so much. They mean well, we have let ourselves be pushed sometimes with the expected bad results. Aside from my mother we cannot tell them what is really wrong. They think it is their business to 'help' us and for 9 out of 10 kids they might be right.Every time they escalated we ultimately shut it down on just our parental authority, but is there a better way? + just venting. Background, not needed, but if you want to know more it's better to read this one I think: [https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/rhpa45/staying\_sharp\_and\_focused\_on\_myself\_dealing\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/rhpa45/staying_sharp_and_focused_on_myself_dealing_with/)So my wife is a sociopath, high functioning. She is in no way trying to control or isolate me, on the contrary. Problem is basically "accidental abuse". As a sociopath she feels no empathy or guilt, so when you have an emotional confrontation (I mean a minor fight), there is no emotional feedback limiting her responses - which is not to say she goes all out. We all might confront someone with a certain approach which turns out to be too harsh, which we recognize via empathy to adjust our approach possibly before saying the first word. I tend to deal with her through diplomacy:1. Appease and de-escalate. I'm dealing with the bad part of a sociopath.2. After 5 minutes, cancel any ongoing appeasement and have a rational discussion. This is completely normal.3. Possibly draw conclusions on how to handle this next time. Should this be possible to frame as (benevolent) manipulation, she is exceptionally good at this.On paper this works great, we rarely have the same confrontation twice and she is actively trying to be nice and supportive. Problem is that step #1 is terrible for my emotional well-being. From the view of my emotions it is:1. Be wronged.2. Apologize and appease for... accidentally offending about being wronged?3. Emotions don't really connect with all this diplomacy.&#x200B;I want to develop an assertive reaction, I discussed this with her too and she supports it. Problem is while it is within her capability to avoid personal attacks and humiliation. What is not within her capability is avoiding snarky responses and she will probably be unable to maintain her rational empathy, so after getting some nasty responses she will go emotionally blank for hours while she processes her frustration... which sucks.The idea is that as these assertive reactions cause really painful encounters, I can learn to get used to this. We can identify clear instructions for her on how to react, probably something like "Instead of defending your frustration, wait for an opportunity to manipulate by \[something\]". She can recognize the benefits for me in facilitating assertive reactions. - At the most times she really cares a lot for me, at the worst times she still sees my mental and physical health as essential to remain happy-ish.&#x200B;I would love to react assertively, but getting away from that addictive diplomatic response that is both reliable and provides good long term results will be hard. Can anyone give me some encouragement or pep-talks to wither this storm, learn, and become happier?. Briefly the good:* As high-functioning she is a safe and productive member of society* 9 out of 10 weeks our relationship is mostly healthy* I have her full confidence in judging her abnormal behavior* Professionals are involved and aware of the situation in regards to the children, the children are doing very wellThe bad* She accidentally emotionally abused me \~5 years ago, for 1 year - once she understood what she did was bad she stopped with no relapse* I cannot rely on her in regards to childcare, as she always needs the option to withdraw should she experience unhealthy frustration.&#x200B;**One challenge for now**I'm not writing down my life story and life struggles... just the thing I am focusing on now.Her empathy is not real but rational or faked, this is an essential effort, but also inferior to real empathy and unreliable - she might forget to be empathetic when distracted or emotional. She will constantly misjudge the emotional impact of small things, some of these get habituated and affect me negatively for a long period until I figure it out months or years later. Example: she asked me to be more comfortable in communicating with her on sensitive issues, despite many types of conversation generating unhealthy and abnormal frustration in her that I can feel (and fear).How can I get on top of it.1. There has been no emotionally abusive incident for 5 years, disproportionate and emotionally unstable incidents happen maybe 3 or 4 times per year, importantly we discuss every single one and she accepts her wrong and apologizes. **Why am I affraid if it always ends well?**2. While I can trust her on "big things", I cannot trust her on the small things. How can I be "efficiently" distrustful of her while we are happy. So if she thinks she can safely do or ask something small I need to be sharp and think how it will affect me, but not needlessly think about everything.... I also fear (too much) to become very controlling.I'm struggling where to post for support and get coping advice. If this is unsuitable for this subreddit then just delete it.I may have ignored a few red flags and married a high functioning sociopath, she herself didn't know at the time. I suffered mostly emotional abuse for 6 months, at which point I finally got her to understand what she was doing and how it affected me. The abusive behavior as directed to me immediately and permanently ended, but the same things that triggered her to attack me now caused self destructive meltdowns at her end. This lasted for a while and sort of became better, I'd say it had a half-life of 6 months (50% less every 6 months). This later triggered self-destructive behavior further reinforced the abusee behaviors I developed.Many years after that it turned out she has ASPD, anti social personality disorder, in other words a sociopath but a high functioning one. The abuse was an honest mistake in that sense, without empathy or remorse it is difficult to pick up on how far you really go emotionally.&#x200B;That was years ago, nothing bad happened since. However, I struggled a lot for a few years with panic attacks, flashbacks activating behavior from that bad year and generally too much submissive and pleasing behavior. It is also at this point that we learned she had ASPD.I will point out we also have kids, but our pediatrician and via her a few others have been made aware of her condition. Even during the emotional abuse I defended our kids (emotionally) successfully. Our kids development is monitored as part of a government program aimed at preventing the development of CD and ASPD and I have someone to talk to.I realized recently though, that I still have a large number of behaviors I developed to survive/defend against abuse. I recently spoke with a psychologist who saw numerous red flags in my behavior towards my wife, the consult was for a referral for something else so I cannot consult him again without a waiting list.&#x200B;My wife is very thankful I didn't abandon her or worse, and is very helpful in fixing things. Whenever I identify an issue where some "bad behavior" still exists she works with me to fix it. The problem is however me seeing those behaviors.As a sociopath she doesn't pick up very well on those submissive and pleasing behaviors. I get almost-panic attacks if I get close to identifying them and my brain generally tries very hard to hide them.How can I find all "abusee" behaviors I developed, and know what is normal if it isn't obvious?&#x200B;And the biggest problem... If she fucks something up justifying some frustration or anger on my side she still gets highly frustrated, her fake empathy and social behavior is replaced by a blank stare, I get a panic attack and don't confront her...Edit January 2023: Long Covid made things much worse, but she is in therapy now. It turns out she is probably not a sociopath but dissociates from empathy, guilt and most of her emotions in stressful and many other situations... Importantly it is treatable so we are heading for better times.My own therapist says that the panic attacks should disappear or be treatable, especially when she gets further in her therapy.My wife has a pretty serious personality disorder that doesn't prevent her from working a good job full time. I am the primary caregiver doing 80%-90% of child duties and 75% of household including mental load, while working part-time. Twice in a row now she failed at watching the children for a few hours (with me at home still able to come and help), she needed to cook for once and broke the pan in a dumb way (not bad luck). All incidents were things she could do well given her disorder, but her disorder predisposes her to not giving enough fucks and being shortsighted in certain matters.Lesson learned: I should do everything myself and not be "lazy" and try to get away with doing less than 90%...Which is possible, I have a lot of energy.I noticed that aside from pumps, (ankle) boots are a type of shoe that has a heel more often than not unlike sneakers and sandals.* But is it that on a given day you want to wear a heel and the (ankle) boot is the most suitable/versatile option to wear a heel?* Or do you want to wear an (ankle) boot with your outfit, and many ankle boots have a heel and you don't mind?. I am the primary caregiver at home... and the DIY is burning me out.**Background**Due to a mental disorder my wife's ability to assist with the kids is somewhat limited but most importantly unreliable. It does not negatively affect her work so for work and care this was easy to solve, we prioritized her career where I would burden my employer with all family leave etc. This helped advance her to breadwinner, while damaging my career very little.We have a 4th child on the way and we moved since the last baby 3 years ago so we need a new baby room among other outstanding DIY work. I cannot leave the kids with her all day while I work on DIY - I need to check up on everyone and relieve her often. So I try to take as much kids with me during DIY as I can which doesn't improve speed. Added to that I have a minor physical issue that impairs my DIY ability negatively and causes up to 5 days of pain.I might spend the week working, cooking, childcaring suffering from last weekends DIY only to build up new DIY pain next weekend - and with the weekends filled with DIY and minor rests I get no real relief - like gaming an entire afternoon (childfriendly, with kids engaged with me).**Current situation**I do delegate DIY work to my wife when I can, which with her pregnancy is less than usual, but the "mental load of DIY" stays with me as offcourse is 100% of mental load of children and family. We also cannot hire anyone to do stuff, there is such demand for contractors that there is a 6 month waiting list for almost anything. We made plans to give her a DIY course after pregnancy so long term we have good plans......but now I have no rest and a lot of DIY to do, and a lot of pain to suffer.**Social pressure**Lastly, while my wife is very understanding and respectful, she has really learned to be cautious with DIY requests and see what she can do herself. It really doesn't help that family and colleagues, and even strangers, do automatically think DIY is the man/fathers job. Aside from constantly facing the expectation that it is my job, whenever I complain a bit I get back I should toughen up and just get through it. - by now my parents know and don't do that anymore, but families are large :(Already a 32 hour \~50 k€ primary caregiver, but it is not good enough and I need to do more until my house is also in order.I posted about this before: [Anyone else whose partner has a personality](https://www.reddit.com/r/SAHP/comments/ibdew0/anyone_else_whose_partner_has_a_personality/)My wife has a personality disorder: Anti Social Personality Disorder (ASPD), but she is High Functioning. You may know this as "sociopath", so in this case "High Functioning Sociopath". **I'm not here to have people go crazy and yell at me**, please don't. Child care professionals are also involved, see spoiler below for some calming explanation.**Calming explanation (feel free to skip, not relevant to story)**>!Lack of empathy makes it more difficult to know what is right and wrong, and to know when you are hurting someone. However, a high functioning sociopath succeeds in knowing this despite lacking empathy, with rational analysis and rational thought. !<>!Our pediatrician was told about it, didn't bat an eye, and explained that "high functioning whatever" is by definition not an issue. I was quite anxious, but she explained that they don't care why a family works as long as the children are healthy and developing normally. She said our children are doing really well, with no kind of reports on our file. They have noted that she cannot be the primary caregiver though on my request, should something happen to me (yes, I'm really scared of Covid).!<>!By now two different child psychologists have been involved, and I can't describe how little they cared about the particular disorder. They were happy though that we pro-actively sought out help long before any issues could emerge. They told it only starts to become slightly relevant around puberty - there is a government policy where at-risk children are screened for CD (precursor to ASPD), and offered treatment to prevent it if needed.!<**Things are extra hard now anyway**Not to pile on the bad stuff... but we miscarried a few months ago :( - we are mostly over it and trying again (for a 4th). I'm still stupid wanting another child, but I lost a lot of other ambitions in life... I had to stop working because of failed government childcare policy, permanent damage from infection preventing re-entry in workforce, no local politics anymore because of hostile online climate... I cannot give up my dream and goal of large family too (she is still all for it too).Edit: I should mention that with reasonable cutbacks she can be the sole breadwinner, and while I still receive ~~welfare benefits~~ government disability insurance payout those cutbacks are not necessary yet. We checked with our budget & Excel, and there is no way we can get into financial difficulties in the next 3 years... we stopped detailed planning after that, probably 5 years including savings. - excluding promotions. My wife is doing well professionally.Also the government had a terrible covid response in particular in regards to the second wave. The new lockdown they implemented is the absolute worst piece of governance and politics I have ever seen and it is hurting us unnecessarily badly and clumsily. At the same time, they also refuse to take responsibility for the disastrous childcare policy that affected me and other tens of thousands. I have never ever been cynical of our government before, my wife and family are somewhat shocked to see me cynical.**Update from last post**So since the last topic we did a number of things that worked:* Got in touch with child psychologist, also for me to talk with someone.* She cooked dinner once per week, first a regular day, now when asked (which is better)Few things that didn't work, and caused the ***Dark Weeks*** we are in now:* She had the children more often for a large part of a day, this emotionally drained her* She did some night shifts when I was desperately tired, this exhausted herShe needs mental energy to rationally process empathy, and she needs more of it when she is upset. Also being nice and considerate is the same mental effort as manipulating someone is to us, so she really needs mental energy.**Dark weeks... this is so unfair**For months it is easy to forget my wife is a high functioning sociopath... but now and then it is the top priority in our household for a few weeks, like now, I call them ***Dark Weeks***.The efforts to better share the workload led to this, we saw too late it was wearing her down in bad ways. My wife is emotionally self-destructive during dark weeks, she might lash out at me emotionally but didn't happen this time yet, never at children yet.*They say sociopaths care only about themselves, this is in one way completely wrong... as they don't care about themselves either and are often their own first victim.*On top of dealing with the kids who are really struggling with a sudden lockdown and holiday season... I need to deal with my wife too, and she is more or less top priority because she recovers in 1-2 weeks, and then she can help me again and I can rely on her again.* I need to shield her from children-stress, this is a big workload.Normally she does like 40-60% of children tasks, now like 5%* I need to help her deal with her emotions, the less frustrated she gets the sooner she can control her emotions again.* She needs her rest, her mental energy is needed to interact with the household in an optimal and pleasant way. * Until then, she needs to often excuse herself. * I am no longer afraid of light abusive behavior, last time it happened is many years ago with no relapse since.**It is worth it**You would be wrong to think a high functioning sociopath is all bad. Most people need to mind their behavior better and show more consideration for others, despite having empathy. Imagine what skills a high functioning sociopath has, she learned to process empathy, charm people and sometimes manipulate them. The children learn these skills from her, while also possessing healthy empathy. It is noticeable to everyone, ourselves, grandparents, teachers, pediatricians, how good their social and emotional skills and behavior are.Even when she is in a dark week, she can still be really good with the children for activities or tasks. Put bluntly, a sociopath can do many things better than a normal person, just for a limited time per day because then they are tired and lose their mental focus. She can entertain them better than I can, and some things, mostly social, she can do better than me.**I can do "anything needed", but can I also be happy while doing that?**I need to cook, manage the children, do homeschooling, care for my wife... long hard days. I somehow always generate enough energy to do it nicely and do it well. I feel exhausted, but the exhaustion disappears when I need to do stuff, and then it returns.I just get so perfectionistic and negative toward myself. Having to choose between sleeping, private time, stress-eating (which usually triggers gastric condition, otherwise weight gain)... This is just not a good choice.I want to be happy and proud to work my butt off like those cliché never-existed housewives from ye olde movies, commercials and illustrations (all in impractical shoes too usually). However, the more housework I do, the more I feel like I am not doing enough and am worthless.***> How can I self-care with these long hours and dark weeks?***My wife pointed out I struggle with allowing myself to feel entitlement, possibly because my mother is an entitled narcissist. How do you do that, work hard and feel entitled to a break or special treatment? :(. I grew up with narcissistic parents, lots of issues, most resolved... Had a bad year with my wife due to an external event affecting her, she did not handle it gracefully - but everything is resolved and explained now.A big problem for me is trusting peoples emotions. Example:Wife: "tell me, I won't get angry"Me: *tells*Wife: *visible frustration* "Okay..." Me: *panic attack*Wife: "I told you I wouldn't get angry and I am not..."In this example I fail to trust in her control, and obviously in reality it is mostly in much more subtle situations and mostly not leading to full panic attacks. That one year however, my response would have been "well adjusted" because panic and fear seemed to disperse both my parents and her anger.Still, it is very difficult not to give in. Though the outcome is now mostly hypervigilance. Anyone who can help with this step?. I had 1 or 2 narcissistic parents, my mother for sure, my father possibly.Especially in retrospect I noticed that I had a lot of narcissistic behavior traits, from roughly age 16-22. From the grandiose (fantasies) to entitlement, and in one relationship I slightly hurt my short-time gf with a few instances of guilt-tripping and gaslighting.However, notably I feel (hyper)empathy, feel genuine guilt I, don't hide my shame... The manipulative acts in the previous paragraph were all one-offs that were never repeated because I felt it was wrong after doing it. I felt a lot of shame and humiliation for my (narcissistic) behavior overall, adjusted my behavior over the years, and things got better educationally/professionally and socially.(I am glossing over the the trauma, therapy, and the problems I still suffer)This brings me to the topic title. I stopped manipulating my partner because I felt bad, I saw my entitlement was ridiculous, I felt ashamed of grandiosity. My parents are utterly incapable of this, and it seems like that incapability is the "NPD" to sustain narcissistic behavior.I (father) am primary carer to 3 children, 4th on the way, oldest being 5. From the start we agreed I would take ultimate responsibility, and I got my wish in family size. We were planning to split (parenting) tasks evenly on paper, with me taking the unexpected on top of that.My wife however, struggled to take on her parenting tasks - she really tried, she could apply things I taught her, but just couldn't do it outside a well-defined and short window. Last year we discovered she has a personality disorder that explains it all, but she is high-functioning. She can hold a (good) job, and she isn't dangerous which is nice.My career kinda crashed last year because of my childcare and house duties, I'm trying to set up a business from home. Our household finances are salvageable anyway though, savings, possible cuts, etc.Normally over the year things go well, though sometimes I struggle with the "unfairness". Had she not had a personality disorder the division of tasks would be considered unfair especially when I still worked. On the other hand, even with all the work, I struggle less than she does with her disorder. But then, after a hard day with the children and chores I might need to help HER out emotionally, leaving me with zero free time some days. I should also acknowledge this all has put me mostly in charge of everything, though I don't know if that is a good / neutral / bad / mixed blessing thing. She is also very appreciative and supportive I must emphasize.Anyone else struggling with a poor balance at home, and/or a personality disorder? Or is this fair anyway, if we consider her to be the provider and me a willing SAHD without income? Or is it still better than most because, aside from being useless with the children, she is appreciative and supportive as a partner? - Sometimes, like now, I struggle with how I should look at it and deal with it emotionally.My wife has aspd, we have children, doing fine though obviously we have made some adjustments. We have also read sych stories here and elsewhere. So there are definitely sociopaths that can have stable relationships and family. But this seems to be underrepresented at least on the public internet. It seems the mental health system in my country does know "something good", as they do not seem to assume a sociopath is dangerous by default, only if there is a criminal record.But every other article I read on the internet names (all) sociopaths as extremely dangerous and the people in their life "victims".I have no doubts about the intentions and priorities of my aspd wife, but when talking about it is difficult that I don't know if 7 out of 10 aspd are like her, or 1 out of 10... Do people here have any idea on the real numbers?. Don't even know where to start... it was obvious from when I met her that she was manipulative and lied easily and shamelessly, but I resisted manipulation and basically took it as "asking nicely", and I saw right through the lies and she didn't seem to mind. I grew up with parents with their own "cluster B" personality disorders, guess that trained me to deal with manipulation and lies from the start.Only recently did we learn about my wifes condition (antisocial personality disorder). It has changed very little... - Also I should point out she is high-functioning and has successfully avoided illegal actions, addiction and other common pitfalls.I wanted a big family, she was okay with that as long as I took ultimately responsibility for the kids. We were planning to share plannable childcare duties equally, with me taking all the unplanned and "nightwork" stuff on top of that. However, she struggled with that and herself, which was ultimately explained by her condition when we found out. Now I do everything planned and unplanned, but ask her to do as much as possible as her focus allows, which is over 50% some weeks.Luckily with my support she does very good at work, but my career is beginning to suffer. I hope to freelance from home, maybe it works, averaged \~10 hours per week from home over the past year. However, now with the coronacrisis, it is scary that I can only work if she works (if all parents work you get subsidized daycare here, otherwise it costs more than I earn). So our finances are in her (capable) hands, I can only earn on top of her income.So... my life turned out... interesting... children are safe and doing good, they seem to have my wife's charm and manipulative ability, with my awareness, empathy and conscience... if we maintain at least the latter two, then things should turn out well in their future.So, anal toys are an important part of how my wife dominates me. Various toys have their own effects.We are curious about those super-long anal toys, names I have seen are "hose", "snake", "slink" and are easily 19 inch long. While we have actually gotten the tip of two different toys in (not really through) the second sphincter twice, we have no idea how it would feel and if it would fit into our games.I can imagine such a toy will quickly become uncomfortable, giving a strong desire for it to be removed - which would lend itself great to our bdsm play... but I am hoping someone has experience with them and can tell me about it.**Update:** We have decided not to reveal as benefit for me and my wife is limited, we are looking if we can get the children checking/care for "at risk of ASPD" for another reason than ASPD parent.&#x200B;My wife has self-diagnosed ASPD. We have children and are generally doing well, I am more or less neurotypical, but put simply I have developed rational empathy during a rough childhood. My ability to feel other people's emotions and translate them to logic helps us a lot. I can see through her lies and manipulation, but cannot resist if she uses bullying and intimidation - but we have a good balance, as I said all is well.&#x200B;We are considering seeking professional help and, if the diagnosis is confirmed, revealing it on need-to-know basis to people involved with us and the children. Key reasons:* It helps the children when (school) councillors are aware and watch out for developmental problems.* Wife can get professional help dealing with her condition.* It helps if I can disclose this to my own psychologist&#x200B;We already did our homework in regards to unwanted attention from child protection and custody issues. Our countries laws and recommendation:* ASPD in itself is not something that can be reported to child protection * Professionals are mandated to report children THEY BELIEVE to be at risk, so we must avoid low-knowledge professionals who think "ASPD=sociopath=danger"* Scientific advice from government (scientific bureau), recommends to dokters etc: * parents should be pressured to cooperate with checks and treatment for their children * judicial steps to force cooperation should be avoided, except when child abuse is proven and there are serious concerns about the childs development&#x200B;So we know why we would want to do this... but this would be an irreversible step. We are looking for advice, considerations, warnings and experiences of others. Mostly to avoid tunnel vision on the benefits of revealing ASPD.I'm invited to an escape room (with my colleagues, by employer), but I'm afraid.My emotions seem to have trouble separating play-acting from reality, and a visit to a prison museum with a small bit of roleplay by the hosts once really upset me.Also, I'm afraid to show my intelligence and stupidity.All in all quite some neuroticism leading mostly to after-stress.Are my fears justified, and given these characteristics should I better skip this? - or is my view of what an escape room is a bit too dramatic? (Fake threats, real exposure of self).
    Met this ESTP a month ago and I'm sure he is one. Like I'm 99% sure he is one. But there's something really unusual about him. I've met other ESTPs before and he has all the qualities of them except for being a really big people pleaser? Is this normal ESTP behaviour? He also acts like a total doormat just so people could give him attention and then he's off to doing what he does. He would engage with people, surround himself with toxic friends. He's also vvv nostalgic and talks about the past all the time. He has a whole list of exes he has idealised that he "supposedly can't get over". He's definitely an Se dom but also quite past oriented? I'm very confused. He's much more emotionally vulnerable than other ESTPs I've met. He also victimises himself as if the above-mentioned exes really wronged him. (Has a bit of a tortured artistry vibe to him). But also a very strong Ti so ESFP is ruled out as his identity is never static but his opinions are. He gives away a seriously uncomfortable level of information to newly met people and is really weird with boundaries.I think social media and the like have really romanticised the NPD-BPD relationship.

Even if they do, they recognize people in order to seem more likeable.But how does that affect communication? I've noticed covert narcissists that I've met IRL and they would really go out of their way to boast, brag, talk about their lives and the badass things that they do. It could exceedingly reach to one-upmanship.But some, including me (I'm comorbid), make the entire meeting about the other person. I ask questions constantly, make them feel intimate, sometimes talking about their childhood on the first date and rarely talking about myself. I think I get real validation from when people finally say in the end that our meeting felt like a therapy session to them. It's like I get a high from wanting people to see how understanding and welcoming I am. Can both of them be narcissistic traits?.

I feel like I'm more emotional than how ESTP stereotypes state and I feel a rush of emotions sometimes that I'm never able to understand but feel intensely. State yours...Ya'all ever feel alone in a crowd? Like you're there with a bunch of people and laughing and just something creeps up in your brain and you just kinda mentally dissociate? You'd still respond though, while a totally different dialogue plays in your head?. It's not a symptom obviously, it's just a modern term for idealization. But I've realized that pwNPD are completely unaware when this happens and pwBPD are more in control and realize that this is too much too fast.How can you guys even believe that you fell in love within a week? I get the infatuation but NPD really associates it with love. They be literally going out there saying "I love you" in a week and making them meet their moms in a month. How on earth??. Just learnt about fraysexuality. Someone asked this question in the BPD sub and I was wondering if other fellow Cluster-Bs relate to it.It's like being sexually aroused only by people you know from afar or even in a relationship, people who feel relatively unknown or feel closed off? For me, as soon as I settle in with someone and feel like I completely know them now, I still love them but more like a brother or a friend and the sexuality kind of evaporates. Does it resonate with y'all?. Just learnt about fraysexuality.

Does it resonate with y'all?. I've had two ENTPs in my life, both diametrically opposite in terms of mental health and here's my take on them.Healthy:✓Confident of their opinions but not condescending✓Uses Fe to emotionally connect with people✓Organised✓Chooses a career that speaks to them and excels✓Know that they're smart and uses that to help othersUnhealthy:✓God complex✓Uses Fe to manipulate and test boundaries✓No sense of values and has a group of friends they consider inferior to them✓Ghosts people then expects them to stick around✓One upmanship in everythingIs there something else to add?. I read somewhere that Se PoLR in INFPs and INTPs results in them being careless of how they look physically. I understand how Se manifests in other ways. I'm completely oblivious to how I come across in social situations as I'm either too loud or too quiet. There are a few questions regarding this that really makes me question my INFP-ness though.I. I'm hyperfixated on my looks. I really love to look good and I wear clothes that I love and I really make sure that I dress well and do makeup. So it's a huge part of my personality. If I don't look good in the public, I feel a bit ashamed.II. I get inappropriately extroverted in social situations. It's like I push all my resources on that one social gathering and I act like the centre of attention for God knows what reason. I'm still not "sensing" it. It's just that I get into my shadow mode if I think about it. My entire attention turns to other people and I become hugely accomodating but really broadcasting how quirky and crazy I am. In retrospect everytime I think about those moments, I feel like they were unlike me. And I can't even fathom how embarassing it must've been to act in such an attention seeking way.Anyone relate to this? I'm super confused.Edit: Also socialising for me feels like an extreme dissociation episode.I guess it pertains to the Fi blindspot and the inability to perceive what we actually want.I had an INFP gf and we were highly toxic but I was addicted to her and loved her for the most part. We became very unhealthy together and I hated to love her. But in between the relationship I met an ISFJ girl who literally felt like the woman of my dreams, totally in contrast to what I had seen in my INFP gf. For comparison, in terms of caring and warmth, ISFJ> INFP.But I've had much more fun and my intellect expanded with my INFP ex. Regardless, so the story goes that I left my INFP gf for my current ISFJ partner and I regret it now. I feel like I never really loved her and I tried to compensate for the level of hurt and betrayal by jumping into a relationship within a week of being dumped by my INFP ex. She also has a lot more money and payed my rent (which I didn't mind since she volunteered). I believed I was in love with the ISFJ because she gave me the love I needed but I realise how dry and forced it feels now. Any ESTPs relate?. Have you ever had your heart broken? If yes, what happened and how did it make you feel? Does it still hurt?. Have you ever had your heart broken? If yes, what happened and how did it make you feel? Does it still hurt?. Is it just me or sometimes you too do a reading for a specific question or situation but you get an entire timeline instead? Like if you asked for a particular event in a day and you get the precedent and the leading of the events and the consequences therof. Or am i just reading it wrong?. I've been diagnosed with BPD and I haven't been getting therapy (because of the expense) but i plan to sometime in the future.One question that has been bothering me for some time is that people diagnosed with BPD report Shame or Guilt as a symptom especially with regards to the aftermath of an episode or a behaviour or an act done in the past. But I have never in my life experienced guilt for something that I have done, even if it involved acting out crazily, being physically abusive, verbally violent or even when I cheated on my ex partner. I feel no remorse on my part, which feels odd when i compare myself with other pwBPD.Have you guys ever trauma bonded with anyone? What does it feel like to you? It's shitty that there's a disbelief out there that Cluster B's can't trauma bond and it's just them being abusive to healthy people that traumatises neurotypicals out there, which is obviously not true. So please share your experience with it. Have you guys ever trauma bonded with anyone? What does it feel like to you?

So please share your experience, if any. What are y'all's MBTI Type?. So i have a theory from what I've observed in myself and other people and would like to know if you guys agree.I feel that whenever we're distressed or something truly bad happens to us, we first go into a phase of Grip. This can last for a few days to a month but probably not more than that since we're not too comfortable in this position so soon we transition to the Loop which can last a lot more, perhaps months or even longer (if we really are self destructive). This transition depends on the gravity of the situation. I think the grip is easier to get into so it can be triggered in the most minor inconvenience. However, loops are a whole different ball game that really have to take a lot to be triggered but they imo never come in isolation and are always preceded by a phase of gripping.What do you guys think?. Would it be more hurtful if a partner met someone new while you were in a relationship with them and monkey branched to them before breaking up with you? Or a partner who breaks up with you only to go back to their ex they monkey branched from onto you?Just wondering what would be more hurtful. Let's forget for a second all that you've learnt since you've been aware and how you're cognitively able to know what you're feeling. But how would you truly describe what love felt like to you? How do you actually feel? Forget about terms like idealizion and devalue. But let's talk about what your definition of "love" really is and how you see your role in it.Let's forget for a second all that you've learnt since you've been aware and how you're cognitively able to know what you're feeling.

For instance, how superiority complex and inferiority complex exist in the same person but just act in different phases. So is masochism (even revelling in emotional turmoil with an abusive partner) a trait in vulnerable NPD?.

For instance, how superiority complex and inferiority complex exist in the same person but just act in different phases. So is masochism (even revelling in emotional turmoil with an abusive partner) a trait in vulnerable NPD?. I'm here to ask if anyone understands Carl Jung's theory of projective identification in both partners in a relationship. I mean I've understood parts of it like what it would be like if only one partner projected parts of them on the other? But what would happen if two people in a relationship engaged in it at the same time? Would they subconsciously end up switching roles?I read about it and from my own experience Cluster B's usually end up mirroring and projecting. So if there are two people in a relationship (both cluster B's), would they end up imitating each other?. i.e., a person with BPD might end up showing more Narcissistic traits while a person with BPD would become more disregulated, I suppose?. How would one differentiate between a borderline and a vulnerable NPD because there seems to be an overlap between the two. Considering both disorders have grandiose traits and mood lability. How do they differ?Even assuming they are high functioning and worse, men- because the expression of emotions is much more suppressed in men than in women and thus more distorted, if any.Is it true that ESTPs are surprisingly concerned with how they come across in society? My personal experience showed the same and I think ESTPs are a walking contradiction in that sense- wanting to do whatever tf they want impulsively but also being really affected by other people's opinion of them. Is this true?. Can estp's date someone without being in love with them? Say for the sake of reasons of material or societal fun? Or to boost their own self-esteem? Or make their ex jealous? Basically any number of reasons that coordinate with their Ti but them being devoid of feelings for their partner..My ex boyfriend was an ESTP. He made a friend (Z) while we were together who he had been hanging out in the end months of our relationship. We had a lot of issues going on in our relationship back then and I broke up with him abruptly.Ofcourse things didn't end practically and it took us two months to finally call it quits. I slept with a lot of guys and told him about it. He cut me off and started dating Z behind my back but never admitted it to me. He kept me on the edge as well and told me he loved me and what not. As soon as I got to know about them dating, I ghosted my ex completely and shut the doors. He however kept contacting me and telling me he doesn't love her at all. He went to great lengths and threatened to expose some things about me if I didn't talk to him for one last time where he cried a lot. Suddenly one day he sees me having fun with my friends on social media, and that day itself, he posts a picture with her with *heart eyes*. I'm not sure if he actually loves her or is only soothing his insecurity to prove something to himself or to me. Is this normal ESTP behaviour?.
    Totally from left field. What was that all about, the two of them falling into each other's arms and insisting how much chemistry there is between them? How they "naturally" gravitate towards each other?. Didn't watch it live yesterday, caught up with this morning, but frankly, I don't see the point. It's like watching a game with the rules changing every five minutes.Peggy never got called out, George is like lamb to the slaughter, soft piano for JJ and Ella, and Erica fucking milking it! Just absolutely milking it!The "experts" are a joke, the dishonesty on their faces is impossible to miss.Since absolutely anything can happen, and anything can be dropped or skimmed over, there is nothing really at stake here, so there are no real surprises either.With all its relentless, and frankly obscene chasing of high drama, the show has actually just fizzled out.&#x200B;. Whether you are one or not; do you consider Narcissists to be unique, beautiful and smart?. I think the main issue is how MAFS identifies itself, as opposed to what it actually delivers.It claims to be a social experiment intent on finding out whether well-arranged marriages might actually work if both participants put in rigorous effort; find their own identity, exercise kindness, and cultivate an open-minded approach. Honestly, I would watch something like this, gladly.In practice however, the producers appear to handle the show as a cheap, run-of-the-mill hate-baiting exercise, with zero consistency, or even the vaguest attempt to stick to the advertised premise.I'm not sure what we are seeing here; whether it's sudden changes in ownership, panicked decisions to ramp up viewing figures? In any case, the result is rather catastrophic, unmistakeably dishonest, engineered, and frankly, just taking the piss out of us, viewers.Thoughts?&#x200B;. Is it casual entertainment? Perhaps the drama? Psychological interest? What is it that particularly appeals to you?I'm really curious because I don't have a history of watching reality shows, dating shows; hell, not even soaps. Some time ago I stumbled upon Couples Therapy on iPlayer and I thoroughly enjoyed it; I just loved trying to figure out the participants, the elaborate puzzle of their dynamic.It's mostly why I started watching MAFS UK, hoping for a similar experience. It's not like that at all, of course. I think there is a lot of manufactured drama, and the deliberate casting of disruptors, but the potential is certainly there.Thoughts?.

    I’m 19 years old. Diagnosed with autism. People keep calling me a narcissistPersonally, I don't think I am. I see how sometimes people can view me as self serving or arrogant, but not a narcissist. It's a cruel world and you have to put yourself first, because who else will? Exactly. Nobody. It's not narcissistic, it's just me using my head to be the best I can be.How is knowing I'II be successful a bad thing?Surely it's ambition.My ex broke up with me over this. They said 'I can't be with someone who loves themselves more than me' It's not that I didn't love them, I just don't know how to express love.Apparently I talk about myself too much, which maybe I do. But that's because my life is interesting, it's exciting. It moves fast and I've always got something going on. I've got mates as well, but a lot of my friendships end badly. With big arguments or physical fights. Not via my doings, I must just have a punchable face.I'm not self obsessed either. I'm very critical of myself. The other day I was looking in the mirror and noticed I'm getting a bit of a belly, so l'm punishing myself by going to the gym. I'm not even fat, l'm around 65kg. I just want to look good for my own sake, not anyone else's. NPI - 20 codependency- 1 OCD-0. I love acid. I’ve done it that much now that I can have 4/5 tabs and not really feel anything - no visuals or nothing. Been on a T break for 2 months but I wanna feel the euphoria again. What can I take?. So basically I’ve got court coming up bc I got pulled over after smoking a joint, positive for weed. I am also a coach and need to drive my team around, so having a licence ban could potentially end my career. Is there any way for me to not get banned??. so i’m not scared of sex, it’s just like whenever it comes to the point of you know, ‘getting it in’ never works. is this a mental block? or is it like a thing for anyone else with Autism? i dont know if i can even link the two together it’s just very embarrassing. So basically i was at my university the other day and only really my tutors and relevant people really know about my autism. however this one girl yesterday was talking about the green flowery lanyards, for people with medical conditions and stuff like that. anyways, she turns to me, in front of the whole class and says ‘oh well you can technically wear one, because of your (wait for it) ADHD’. adhd? i was shocked. i froze up. i don’t have adhd? why would she presume that?? i really didn’t know what to do, i kinda froze up and went red and ignored the comment. it really caught me off guard too. i could have easily turned around and punched her in that moment. it was like she was calling me out but all she did was say i have something that i haven’t. so the point is… are adhd and autism that hard to differentiate between? could i have been wrongly diagnosed?. Ok i have my assessment tomorrow- should i be nervous? idk what to expect at all.
    Besides being a malignant narcissist. When my grandmother died (my mom's mother) in the middle of the night and we got a call and they wake me immediately in the sound of my mother and sisters crying. I got up and walked to the room and behind me I heard my father shouting (in Arabic) something in the meaning "that's it. She's dead" to tell my mother and sisters to stop crying.My mother told us that in the same week after the funeral she was crying, mourning the death of a parent. And my father was walking by and he found her crying and screamed at her to stop.When I was 16, last year of highschool, I missed an unannounced morning pre school hours class. The teachers found some students who came early and decided to give them a 20 minutes lecture. When my father found out I missed it he yelled and hit me in the eye and literally directly called me worthless and exactly said why are we paying for your education and we are wasting money. And then went to work without driving me to school. I had to walk and arrived late. I was literally the top of the class and for many years. I was studying in the gifted school.I'm a bad person I know that but I will never scream in my wife mourning her mother. I know how to comfort a friend even if I don't feel it emotionally. I do it because cognitively I know it's right. Even if I didn't feel sad about my grandma dying and I had to force myself to cry by mental gymnastics because I thought it's the appropriate. I won't do such thing as my father and I don't care if that's a mask or being covert or even communal. My father never loved me. The only thing close to love is being a narcissistic supply for him when I scored high iq and entered the gifted program in 4th grade and came on top of the class. He got to brag about how amazing the school is to all our relatives. My mom said he never payed attention to me till I got to gifted school. I'm his favourite because I'm smart and well educated and highly interested in politics (he's a successful politician). I'm his favourite and I'm the one most affected by him as his only son. He did pay attention to me and therefore I got abused more. He neglected my sisters and was distant. The message I got from him is that if I'm not perfect then I'm worthless. I wish I was not his favourite.My father is a malignant narcissist according to my therapist. And I have npd according to her.Talking about the big five model. I read that a research found they can have hard time managing anxiety. They are also known for their severe rage and anger (and anger is one of the six facets of neuroticism) and they're hyper sensitive to criticism which I believe the reason dr Todd Grande said they have some vulnerable narcissism as well. If my theory is right, that what differentiates the malignant narcissist from a psychopath is they can/might have the anxiety facet of of neuroticism. Psychopaths are known for their high anger facet but low anxiety.Personal addition (don't read it necessary):The reason I'm thinking about this is because I have a psychopath profile in the big five, exactly the same in every facet except for achievement striving and anxiety (both high). And the stories that my mother and big sister says about my childhood are stories of a psychopath. I don't know why they didn't take me to a clinician. I think I gave my big sister some trauma and she still fawn me.Scored 20/40 (and 22/44 in another) in psychopathy checklist which is the edge of subclinical/borderline psychopathy (the average between 5 and six). On levenson test I scored 3.3/5 in primary psychopathy and 4/5 in secondary psychopathy. I really don't feel guilt.I got fired by the board from a presidency of a student union for abuse of power. I refused the firing and splitted the union into two unions competing for legitimacy. It's the best thing I ever did and I'm really proud of it which in second thought is weird.My extroversion is higher than the middle but not too high which is weird since I consider myself covert and I have autism (and adhd). It's just weird. My country went to war (civil war) and college is closed. I can't hangout with a lot of women and get the illusion of validation. I discovered all the relationships were superficial and no one checks on me. I have complex ptsd and the narcissistic supply mask my shame and fear but now without it I wake up in an emotional flashback. It's just hell.No amount of confidence, future planning, fantasy, remembering my good or great qualities; no amount can make up for the fact that at this moment of my life I have no supply and right now I'm nothing to the world.I've been meditating a self compassion meditation and mindfulness. When I do both and with a current supply I can read more than 100 page a day but without supply the meditation just reduce my dissociation and numbness and makes me feel all the trauma symptoms directly. I can't even read 5 pages now.I've been trying to work on my trauma by myself since I can't reach my therapist but without supply I can't read or learn skills. I'm almost on a freeze response. I also have adhd and autism and I'm on antidepressants. I don't know what else to say. I always think that if the other person is like me, they will feel they have more power in the relationship. Having power over me is so uncomfortable and triggering since that how I was traumatized in the first place. I'm a fearful avoidant on attachment style and a vulnerable narcissist.I know a lot of people in college. I spend my time with a lot a lot of women. But no-one checks on me on vacations. It's all superficial and honestly I use the time spent with them as a temporary pain killer for the emptiness. Once I leave someone or some group the emptiness comes back. I have diagnosis of both npd and bpd. My narcissism goes back and forth from vulnerable to grandiose and I have parts of both persistent at all times. I'm autistic and narcissistic. The narcissism mask my autism by putting on a show of being intelligent, successful, knowledgeable and creative. And maybe this is the narcissistic thing to say but those things are true but that not all of me. I feel if I became vulnerable I'll lose my image on the person eye of being the high on the league. For me relationships are a game to be won. I need to win the person and have power in the relationship.Pre:Loving kindness meditation or compassion meditation is ancient meditation where you wish love well-being and peace first to yourself then to a loved one, stranger, then to a person you have conflict with and finally to the whole world.Here 18 Science-Backed Reasons to Try Loving-Kindness Meditation: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/feeling-it/201409/18-science-backed-reasons-try-loving-kindness-meditationNow, when i practice it i feel strong intense anger even if I'm wishing peace to a girl that I really like and like me back. It's like the meditation sees through my narcissistic defences and connects me to my inner real self. I usually feel numb but this meditation brought in the past general and social anxiety (like I'm really connected to myself and others so i care about myself truly and about others and what they think) and now it brings sadness and anger. It looks like all my likes and dislikes about people are superficial and just a surface level where in my true level I only have hate and resentment to the a world that I'm entitled to but doesn't give me what I deserve. A despise to everyone which each at least has something I don't have. A desire for revenge towards these ppl who won't really like me if they know who I really am (I'm borderline) and who don't give me the power and recognition over them that i deserve.Npi: 29.
    As someone who's on the spectrum and is also a Cis straight man, I just can't keep a male friendship going. It's so much harder to find a male friend to do stuff with. I've tried bumble friends and everyone is either gay or isn't interesting. Why is it that I can charm a women into bed through dating apps, but I can't charm my way into friendship? Is it because I see value in charming women (sex) and I just don't get any physical reward from men? I'm tired of just hanging out with my gf and other women I'm dating. I just want male friendship. It's even worse cause my gf thinks I've no male friends... which is true but I've other gfs but I can't tell her that.I feel like I can't stop myself from ruining her life. She has been through so much physically and emotionally and she's looking for love from me, not knowing I'm not who I say I am. It's a train wreck that I feel like I can't stop. I legit cannot stop the pain and suffering that she'll have to go through if we continue our relationship. Why can't she see through me? Why can't she ghost me for her own good? For her own sake why can't she understand it's all a facade?I don't want to hurt her emotionally but I feel like I have to continue. She has been through so much and she's still brave enough to look for love, but I can't help her.The title pretty much explains it. I've been with my 1st gf for over a year now but sex has always been pretty bland and she has always annoyed me extremely so I've looked for a side gf who is really hot but also wants to spend weekends with me which I can't since I'm with my 1st gf.How do you manage to have the boundary talk with the 1st gf about maybe not spending the weekends together? I want to spend time with my 2nd gf too since she's more fun but I just feel like there isn't enough time.Also breaking up in not an option. I can love both of my gfs equally and they don't need to know about the other.So with my lsat and GPA being above 75% of the median of a school I'm interested in means more than likely that I will graduate from said school with roughly $50-60k in loans, and those scholarships are non-conditional. The school is very respected in the region and many firms I've spoken to have their lawyers hired from the schoolI've no prior legal experience but I am planning on networking extremely hard and working as a PD for at least the first summer because it has always been my passion. I am not interested in BL and more into boutique firms.So my question is that is the loan amount fine for me to make the decision when admissions come in?. My 2 schools are Duq law and Pitt law, and my stats are 3low GPA and high 150 LSAT. My question is does anyone know my chances at Pitt and how much scholarship does Duq offer since my Lsat is above their 75%.Thank you. I've noticed that the debate re: women settling down in their 30s and men having more power always comes down to the argument that "women lose their youth or that guys are attracted to women who are past their 20s", and I would like to offer another argument that is never mentioned: women losing friends and becoming lonely combined with the societal expectations of being grown up means family and a partner. Women in college have soooo many friends, and they always talk about how they had sleepovers every night and they had no free time to go out with guys. Why would any women go on dates when she has 20 friends she could go out with every night? But that friend group always dies, and that's a good thing for men. When friends in the group start partnering up with men they hang out less and less with their friends, which creates the pressure of finding a whole new friend group for the single friend or attempting to seriously find a man in order to not be lonely, which is much much easier than finding friends after college. The point is that women who have no friends are easier to date, because they're lonely. And the odds of a friend group being broken due to marriage and children or due to career creates an opportunity for men. One can also infer the reason for why abusers attempt to cut their abused partner from their friends and family in this post, but I won't go into that. The main point is that lonely women are a necessity for men to date, and it's a very good thing that women become lonely as they age.Hello to all,I'm a new player who downloaded the game yesterday and like the mechanics and game play a lot, but I'm worried about the future of the game. I would like to know what the chances are that the game will be shut down vs. going global because I don't want to waste my time playing a game that will be shut down?Thank you!.

    Greetings, I am kind of on the fence about if I should consider myself a narcissit / if it is valid to pursue the idea of being one more profoundly. This is a question to all of those amongst you who have achieved a self-reflective grasp of their inner life over the course of their struggle with NPD. Can a person in your eyes suffer from NPD / be a narcissist without consciously experiencing an excessive need for admiration, envy, jealousy, shame, worthlessness, and entitlement How would you refer to some one that is egocentric, obsessed with power and wealth, interpersonally exploitative, lacks Empathy and who frequently is perceived as arrogant or antagonistic, but doesnt has trouble regulating his emotions / has a very shallow affect in general? This question has been very difficult to phrase, I hope that you understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks in advance, and I'm thrilled to hear your thoughts.NPI: 21Codependecy: 3 OCD: 7. Greetings, I am kind of on the fence about if I should consider myself a narcissit / if it is valid to pursue the idea of being one more profoundly. This is a question to all of those amongst you who have achieved a self-reflective grasp of their inner life over the course of their struggle with NPD. Can a person in your eyes suffer from NPD / be a Narcissist without consciously experiencing an excessive need for admiration, envy, jealousy, shame, worthlessness and entitlement? How would you refer to some one that is egocentric, obsessed with power and wealth, interpersonally exploitative, lacks Empathy and who frequently is perceived as arrogant or antagonistic, but doesnt has trouble regulating his emotions / has a very shallow affect in general? This question has been very difficult to phrase, I hope that you understood what I'm trying to say. Thanks in advance and I'm thrilled to hear your thoughts.I recently tried to take the Sakinorva Questionnaire to get a comprehensive assessment of my MBTI Type, bc other tests failed to provide me with one and I don't have the profound theoretical knowledge to see why. Unfortunately I scored a magic level of 38, despite having answered all the questions calmly and to my best knowledge of myself. I am also a bit confused about this bc I already took two extensive test about personality structure unrelated to my discovery of MBTI, which contained a system to control for validity and both times I got attested with a very high score for validity. ( a Big5-Test and the Multiphasic-Test if anyone might be curious) Accordingly I was pretty confident that I could answer the questions in an unbiased manor.My Question is, are there any MBTI Types or Constructs that are more prone to be "function magicians" or is this majorly a problem with the pervasiveness and intangibility of my Personality / self-deception?.

    my idea was that he recognized his last name from henry, meaning henry is mike and abby’s dad, and that’s why his brother just sat in the car when he got kidnapped, because he KNEW afton. and that’s why afton was so willing to give mike the job, basically begging him. what do you guys like to put in empty spots around your park to make it look like real nature? all i’ve been doing is making it textured and painting it with the rock paint. what else is good to do? i hate when my parks look boring. so i’ve just started playing, how did all of this start? i mean the BTs, time fall and whatnot. how did it all start?. so in the scanning thing at theta, simon figures out he’s basically imogen. his body is imogen, but his mind is him. and after he says “that’s disgusting!” you hear catherine say “hey! don’t say that, she was my…. she was nice to me.” was catherine with imogen or am i reading too much into it?. I was wondering, what are some traits of covert narcissism? One of the people that used to be in the house i live in had a few traits but i don’t want to self diagnose them. he had trauma as a kid so it is likely had a personality disorder. it seems like he might have narcissism OR bpd. bpd seems unlikely because i have it, and he doesn’t seem to be like me. (im not sure, im not a psychiatrist) what are some traits to narcissism? mostly covert? or even other types?. they’re like.. nowhere. i’ll look all around mount hothead, caldera, and hot springs? but there’s usually ZERO, or at least ONE. are they THAT rare?. I need someone to help me with the mansion basement/library, it’s a little confusing and i have nobody else to help ! i’m on part one atm. i’m usually a gunner main, but i started engineer, and HE IS NOT GOOD!!! his shotgun does barely any damage, and secondary doesn’t do much either.when fully upgraded, do his weapons do more damage? somebody please tell me it gets better 😭 and if it does get better, what are your recommendations for weapon classes!!? i always have trouble figuring out what upgrades to put on the guns. ALSO, what are the best overclocks for the guns??. is hazard 3 harder than hazard 2? i haven’t played in forever so i’m starting back at the beginning. i had hundreds of hours on PC, but got a PS5, and had to start all over again. i haven’t played in so long that i forgot how much harder it was. is there a huge difference between hazard 2 and 3? i’m trying to move up.

Je veux pas partir trop loin avec de la philosophie mais ça serait quoi la vraie personnalité d'une personne du coup si un simple changement d'hormone crée une toute nouvelle personnalité ?! Peut-être que je confonds humeur et personnalité.My brain needs dopamine ? It will make me suffer with boredom...My brain is hungry ? It will make me suffer in my tummyMy brain is scared ? I must confort it or else it will make me suffer too.I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING, THIS IS NOT ABOUT DEPRESSION, WHY MUST I FOLLOW THE ORDER OF MY BODY FROM WHICH I NEVER ASKED TO BE BORN INTO ?!Being a rock is cool, you're not conscious, you have no problem, you don't have to skip time with movies or series, you don't have to earn money at work.I see so many people still being delusional about life and the happiness they missed. If you think about it deep enough, you will see death (if it's nothingness) is actually the ultimate solution to every futile problems.Est-ce que nos nerfs se mettent en mode "agréable" et n'envoient pas de signal desagréable au cerveau ?. Un peu de dopamine pour s'exciter le cerveau. Can we talk about the fact that life has so much suffering in it ?Just thinking about school/work is so much pain and stress. When I talk to people about it they will be like "It's life, don't make it a big deal" actually it is a big deal, so much useless suffering. Yes you have to work to earn to money to live, eat, drink... THAT'S THE FUCKING PROBLEM: WHY DO WE VALUE LIFE ?!I was good, at peace in non existence and then I had to meet all these assholes, learn about the cruelty and indifference of the Universe, animals being eaten alive in nature, possibility of reincarnation and so on....I fucking hate existence/life so damn much.Avant l'avènement des techniques de chasse sophistiquées, nos ancêtres humains avaient recours à une méthode de chasse primitive mais efficace. Ils poursuivaient leurs proies, telles que les antilopes ou les bisons, sur de longues distances, jusqu'à ce que ces animaux s'épuisent. Cette technique, appelée "chasse à l'épuisement" demandait une endurance exceptionnelle de la part des chasseurs qui suivaient les proies pendant des heures, voire des jours, jusqu'à ce que l'épuisement les rende vulnérables.Et encore, "calme" est un grand mot. Ce que j'entends par là c'est que notre cerveau, notre cerveau et tout ce qui nous constitue est à l'état naturel une machine de survie.J'ai pas d'exemples concrêt, il suffit de voir des vidéos youtubes de combats d'animaux, de prédateurs qui chassent leur proie, les mutilations et la façon dont ils les dévorent vivant sans pitié.Dans notre cerveau on a carrément hérité d'un système d'adrénaline qui est stimulé quand t'es en fuite ou combat et il te felicite quand tu as survécu... Mais putain on est en 2023, on vit dans un Univers où on a encore les vestiges d'un cerveau d'animal primal... Ce post est pauvre en argument mais pourrait être enrichi à l'aide de pleins situations dans lesquelles on pourrait se retrouver si la civilisation n'avait pas pu vu le jour.La séléction naturelle a gardé le trait "flemmard" car si on imagine un humain toujours actif, toujours dans l'action, toujours dans l'effort : il en fait trop et ne se repose pas assez... (conséquences : fatigue, blessures musculaires, articulaires, tendineuses, système immunitaire affaibli).On peut aussi imaginer que si il est trop actif et qu'il finit tout ce qu'il avait prévu de faire, il tombe dans un ennui chronique et devient dépressif par manque d'activités intéressantes.Supposons que quelqu'un marche 5km, y a t il une unité en physique qui quantifie les efforts fournis par la personne pour effectuer cette tâche ?On imagine un piéton qui va d'un point A à B, chaque mouvement de jambe, de bras et compagnie.J'ai l'impression que comparé aux anciens, ils volent lentement et ils se fichent de prendre des risques. On les sent avant atterir avant même qu'ils ne piquent...Il faut quand même avoir de bonnes raisons pour faire naître un être vivant.À force de me faire détester par des gens (amis/famille), j'ai fini par les détester fortement. C'est pour dire que j'ai peur que ma vie soit une boucle et que je vais devoir me retaper mon existence avec ces **** pour toujours... Bref leurs simples existences m'écoeurent.J'ai vraiment la haine au point de m'en mordre les doigts, comment vous faites pour vous soulager vous ?. J'ai l'impression que je suis fais pour être détester et malheureux.Ça montre un réel manque de confiance en moi mais dites moi si j'y ai le droit ou bien non des personnes n'y ont pas le droit.Ok donc supposons que tu sois quelqu'un à risque cardiaque, un bruit sonore strident arrive dans tes oreilles puis dans ton cerveau, cela te fait extremement peur donc le système nerveux panique un grand coup et envoie des impulsions éléctriques au coeur mais il ne supporte pas et fait un arrêt cardiaque...Je trouve ça si débile, pas vous ?C'est littéralement une auto-mort puisque si la personne avait les oreilles bouchées, le message sonore n'aurait pas été transmi au cerveau.I think we will be unlucky so no (lol what an argument!). Lol not like a simulation but like a mathematic matrix.Everything is a process, you can predict, see, understand how patterns worksThe thing is all these reactions and numbers are neutral, they are neither good neither bad. Every configuration is neither good neither bad.It's human who puts this binary/dualism'observation of the world...But I don't see the point of this matrix. Even if you want to be a Ubermensch and surmount the absence of God then it is still meaningless. Being free would means death.People at works are either stressed out, tired or bored People who don't works are either poor, bored or depressedNobody is happy everywhere I look. Everyone looks like a NPC following their program without even questionning their actions... Why bring a child in this depressing existence ?The relief of the suffering of existence lasts 1 milisecond and then hours of neutral consciousness or suffering.Si la personne en face ne m'aime pas, j'ai l'impression de n'être rien, de pas mériter d'être aimé.How the fuck I'm supposed to know what I like if I'm confused/If I have very low libido ?. Maybe it's because I hate myself and I project onto him but for real tho I really hate this guy.The way he talks, walks, his outfits, his eyes...The last straw was when HE confronted Maeve and instantly went and sleep with Ruby. And at the end, he just end up being a lonely loser (like me), I really hate Otis so much it's insane. (I hate myself that's why lol).Moi (19H) va toucher l'AAH pour multiples soucis mentaux et physiques. J'ai retenté la fac une deuxième fois mais à nouveau, impossible pour moi.Ma mère est un chouilla narcissique, mon père s'en fout mais serait déçu aussi j'imagine.Je ne leur parle jamais de rien, ce n'est pas une relation de confiance. Et si je devais leur parler de mes problèmes, ils finissent anxieux et déprimé donc bon... Je n'ai pas envie de me sentir mal du fait que je vais mal, je n'y gagne rien.Là je veux juste leur annoncer que je vais toucher l'AAH et que les étude c'est en stand-by pour l'instant. Comment feriez-vous ?. Personellement, ça me débecte. Et je sais qu'il faut bien des travailleurs pour qu'une société fonctionne mais pour moi c'est une soupe d'ennui, de stress, d'anxiété, de contraintes et compagnie.Le matin j'ai envie de chier mais c'est trop tôt pour pousser (une sorte de micro constipation du matin lol)J'ai des litres de morves qui sortent de mon nez, je dois utiliser un paquet entier et je dois respirer par la bouche, c'est désagréable dans le nez aussi.J'ai l'impression que la peau de mon corps est trop "serré", je suis pas à l'aise. Passé midi c'est bon mais j'en ai bavé depuis l'école primaire, j'ai toujours détesté me lever le matin de force...Yes my mother had a bad breath too (the same odor) and gave it to me!. "On pue tous un peu de la gueule, c'est pas grave mais brosse toi les dents ça sent...". La paix n'a pas duré longtemps...Tired of this shi, I'm so bad at social. Ça m'arrive parfois d'être paisible et de me sentir bien.I'm so tired that I've been on my bed for 3 hours, but since I can't get up, I'll playfully slide off to "have fun"... Lol, it's like the only way I find enjoyment is by pretending to go down a slide because it requires the least effort. And then I'm on the floor like a homeless but I found it peaceful to "let go" of my body when I slide.Lol it's not that deep but it's funny to me.Ça m'a fait bizarre, je me suis vraiment rendu compte que sans nerfs on ne souffre pas et que c'est vraiment le système nerveux qui engendre la souffrance (douleur).Look somewhere else, you want my pic or something?. C'est tout bête mais chaque jour je sors faire du vélo parce que je m'ennuie comme un rat mort sauf que je suis tellement fatigué (mentalement) que je reste assis sur mon vélo même quand je dois lever mes fesses (un trottoir ou une bosse). En gros je m'en fous de ma santé.Du coup là ça fait 2 mois que je fracasse ma colonne vertebrale à force de prendre des bosses compagnie et maintenant j'ai mal au bas du dos. Hier j'ai pris une fourchette en main et mes nerfs ont laché d'un coup net, ça m'étais jamais arrivé mais j'imagine que j'abîme mon corps de plus en plus. Sauf que je m'en fous, j'en ai marre de vivre.I'm in constant fear, I feel a small pain in my heart and I start to imagine the worst, like it's the end and death.And I'm so scared of death too so that's why I can't even imagine death being something peaceful.But no my brain forces me to stay at home. My own body is a jail.Panic attacks and anxiety are no joke...
    I don't understand why when someone is obviously narcissistic, addicted to negativity and living miserably, why not just accept their sickness and euthanise? We don't want sick animals to live on in misery and affect others too, so why require that for humans? It is a choice of their own of course, but allow the suicide to happen without the stigma and unnecessary suffering that loved ones would have to go through.The whole process is trial and error. If we are to stay in touch with pdoc about side effects and concerns, what is the expectation about response time and making changes outside of appointment sessions?I can only see mine once a month due to availability. How do you usually communicate in between and how available are they to have a conversation about trying something else? Its so ridiculous that I know my latest prescription is not giving good effects and I still have three weeks till next appointment.Is this normal? Pretty depressed and I didn't have the music or thinking in my own voice. Is that a sign of hypomania by any chance? Cause its only been three days its supposed to take weeks for these meds to work. (Taking lamictal; been a while on it). Before I started Zoloft I was not hearing the thoughts in my head as much or hearing music. More just dulled out. Now it's started idk what to make of it. I'm on Lamictal which is why psych said I can try antidepressant. I did some things that came across as creepy when I was bipolar but in my head I was doing things like it was the matrix and also to cut ties with some people. But while I was doing mental gymnastics to make sense of my actions, externally all people saw was me being a creep. I think that still happens, like my worldview is so distorted but I'm just more restrained when I'm not manic.Self-improvement videos are either entertainment, intellectual fodder, or a form of procrastination or overthinking. What good is that ? Might as well watch some show or documentary if you're going to waste time consuming content that does not make much difference to your life anyway.Another thing is consuming self-improvement content over and over just reinforces self-obssession. When you watch movies or sports or shows it's a way to get away from thinking about yourself and learning new things or enjoying art and stories / new perspectives.it's at 5 am. lol. which means i should leave at 4.30. which means i should aim to be up by 4 to make sure I'm ready.&#x200B;Yikes.&#x200B;It's such a simple job (produce) but being unemployed my sleep schedule has been wake up much later and then stay in bed.I feel scared of how it's going to affect my mental health. I already feel a sense of dread because of all the change coming from tonight itself.At the same time I want to push through it and get used to it. I won't be working more than 20 hrs/week, so I have plenty of time to rest as long as I make it there on time tomorrow. I know I can do it. I'm scared of how sustainable it will be. I just have to go and do it and keep doing it.I want to post here to share what I'm feeling. Don't have anybody I feel comfortable talking to about it. Thank you for reading if you're here. My psych wants me to get to 100 mg so he's starting me on 25 mg for three nights, 50 mg for next three nights, then 100 mg. All within six days and from 50 straight to 100. Is this okay or would it be better to space it out to avoid any adverse effects?. Specifically because of meds to help you get started Pretty much looking for success stories cause I am failing to launch. Looking to find the right med and early in the journey. hoping the next one works. I haven't been able to work for long bouts of my life, and the only time I was able to was because of smoking cannabis daily. Antidepressant sent me manic, and now next week I will be able to start on lithium, maybe an antipsychotic. and whatever else the doc cooks up. Can it save me from being dysfunctional? Get a job and keep it? Actually study something and not change my mind about it two weeks in or two months in? I have no grip, i have no issue isolating myself to be in my addictions. what does it take to change? how quickly is change possible? sigh.It can't be easy as taking a med, right?. If you watch Doctor Ramani's videos on bipolar and narcissism, substance abuse, so on, she says it all goes hand in hand. I remember seeing a comment on a bipolar subreddit about golden children commonly being the type to turn out bipolar. This all seems to be the case for me.I'm finally going to start getting proper bipolar treatment from next week, so I'll see how the next few years go in terms of my grandiosity dying down and overall personality if anything changes.Especially hair and hair styles please. Thank you. Also, if wanting to try 100mg, is it better to go to 75 first and see how it is? It's rough going through the side effects of increasing dose, so if I can avoid it twice that'd be nice.Thank you.
