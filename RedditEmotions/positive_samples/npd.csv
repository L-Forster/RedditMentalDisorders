One of my first memories of my narcissistic traits was thinking I’d grow up and be a celebrity because I was special/different than my peers. So I’m curious.Funerals, pet dying, physical injury, etc. I’d try so hard not to cry. I couldn’t stand it and especially anyone seeing me cry. I still refuse to cry in front of others, although I don’t cry much anyways.Starting physical therapy 3X a week. After 4 years the job is catching up to me. This only happens to me in relationships but man oh man do I get abandonment anxiety. Enough anxiety this evening I popped a Valium. This is why I do my very best to push people away, especially romantic partners. I don’t let anyone in, and when I do, I get the intense fear they’re going to abandon me or not love me anymore. I think it’s because I’ve shown them a part of me under the mask and it would crush me if they rejected that little bit of my true self under my mask that I’ve allowed them to see/know. Either way, it’s crippling and the main reason I run when I start to feel like this. It makes me feel weak. I absolutely hate anyone having control over my emotions.I wear sunglasses a majority of my day. I feel more comfortable in conversation with sunglasses on. Almost in a way it makes me feel like they can’t see who I am if they can’t see my eyes. It’s hard to explain but I always wondered if other NPD folks have this habit.I’ve struggled with them a lot the past few months and wasn’t sure if having NPD has a relation to it.I am 11 weeks clean from meth :) I am very proud of myself but - I have suffered from severe panic attacks since getting clean. I’m on Buspar, for obvious reasons, my doctor won’t prescribe me a benzo for the attacks. It’s making me feel very isolated and is taking a toll on my social life. They will hit me out of nowhere. Sometimes no trigger at all. Today, I was attending our state fair and had a full blown panic attack. Awful. I’ve never had anxiety like this until I got clean. I just wonder if this is my brain chemistry because of the meth use or if anyone else had this struggle?Edit; grammar. Why the fuck am I like this? This was the first day I noticed myself anxious when I didn’t hear from him in a few hours. Scared the shit out of me and did what I always do. Sabotaged something good. Told him I couldn’t handle him having control over my emotions and I needed space. I swear I was meant to be alone. I cannot be vulnerable.I am content again. I wake up and have clean energy. I feel like myself more and more everyday. My concrete belief everyone will devastate me and nobody can be trusted has led to me living an extremely lonely life because I cannot open up to anyone enough to create meaningful friendships/relationships. Is there hope or is this something permanent with NPD?. Last time I tripped I heard my name repeated several times and wondering if anyone had a similar experience.I can always tell I’m shifting to a different identity depending on what genre I’m interested in at the time. I’d say my favorite is 90’s rock because it’s the only genre I feel like my actual true self discovered and enjoys, not something I absorbed from someone else.Been hooking up with my guy bestie for about two months now. Over the weekend he asked if I wanted to stay the night, but when I attempted to get intimate with him he rejected me. Oh boy have I collapsed. It’s made me fucking hate him and I text him yesterday and told him I never want to speak to him again. It just confirms my own belief that I’m worthless, unlovable, and nobody wants me. I wish I could handle rejection but man it sends me into a rage.I can’t afford therapy and don’t think I’ll ever permanently remain sober until I get professional help. I feel stuck.3 weeks and 4 days clean from meth. My anxiety is so bad. I went to dinner with friends last night and had to be picked up by another friend because I had an anxiety attack. I’m assuming my anxiety is from the stimulants screwing up my brain chemistry. Does this resolve with time?. Am I the only one?. I’ve got two friends & not close with my family. I’ve cut off the friends I used with and I feel so alone. It makes staying clean so hard.I relapsed last night. I’m devastated but I’m just trying to keep fighting. Feeling shame and guilt will only drive me farther into it, so I’m choosing grace instead. Dusting myself off today, getting my head on straight. Journaling, reading, & going to speak to my counselor. I will never fully recover until I accept the fact there are people in my life that I love, but who can no longer have a place in my life because they use. Foolish of me to think I could hang around it and say no. I got overly confident. Here’s day one. I’m determined to win this battle.I’ve lost 85 pounds, 5’3 and went from 220 to 140. The past 6 months I have slacked and gained 10lbs. I’m not happy about it and ready to jump back on the wagon. I was doing 18:6/20:4 before I started slacking. I want to attempt a 48 hour fast but I’m hesitant because I run, jump, and lift a majority of the day, also in the summer heat. I’m a delivery driver. I want to make sure before I do it that it’s safe. I’d rather not pass out on the job.We recently went on a mini vacation together to the ocean. We were sitting near the beach when a homeless man on a bike asked if we had money so he could grab some things from the store he needed. Before my best friend could respond I said “Nah we don’t have any cash.” She just looked at me. He rode off and she says “We both have cash, I feel bad for him.” I slipped out a “I don’t.” Her facial expression was priceless. I accidentally let the mask slip sometimes and think “oh shit” to myself. I felt nothing for that guy, and she expressed how bad she felt for him. I told her I wonder what it’s like to be empathetic. I truly wish it was a trait I had. I don’t know if I can ever be empathetic and I think that’s what I hate the most.This book has truly helped me. I highly suggest it. Has anyone else read it or have book recommendations?. Wether it be helping a friend out or going to a social event, I always have an agenda behind it. Something has to benefit me in some way or I won’t do it. I just wish I could be genuine but it’s not in me. There’s a guy I’ve liked for a bit now. I enjoy running into him at social events. A lady in my hometown had a fundraiser to raise money for her cancer treatment. I didn’t show up to donate or to support because I care about her treatment, I just knew the guy was going to be there. I hate admitting this stuff but it’s the truth.I woke up early, made coffee, and spent the day at my daughters softball tournament, after getting a very nice 8 hours of sleep. I was sober, with energy, a clear mind, no comedown, no shame and guilt. Just happy to be spending the day watching my daughter. The moments that remind me why sobriety is so worth it.I was giving him a blowjob while he was on his back, stopped - sat on his dick and rode for about 10 seconds, then hopped off and continued giving him a blowjob.Not sure what I was thinking but it felt right lol never done that before.I posted yesterday about battling the fatigue. I’m a little over two weeks clean but today has been rough. When I decided to quit, I had just had a drug test scare at work and the apathy/depression was consuming me and it gave me the motivation to quit. Now that I’m a few weeks out, and the fog is lifting, it makes me “forget” the negative effects of being high. I’ve been saying to myself “I can use it casually” “I don’t see what’s wrong with a small dose every once in awhile” These thoughts scare me and honestly I’m choking up writing this because I truly don’t know if I can ever stop long term.I’m 15 days out and the fatigue hasn’t subsided. I can easily sleep 12+ hours a day. I force myself to get up and be productive. (Work, house chores, etc.) but it is rough. Any advice on supplements or things I can do to help with it?. I used to be a very driven person. I kept a spotless house, exercised daily, put 100% into my career, dressed up often, and had hobbies. After battling an amphetamine addiction for a year, I am 10 days sober. Slowly over the course of 12 months I slacked on house work, stopped exercising, look like a slob, and stopped participating in my hobbies. The fatigue has been a battle but I’m pushing through. I just want to feel motivated again. Any tips or advice on how to get back to the driven person I was before drugs?. I was a rebellious child, hyperactive and talkative and often got me into trouble at school. My mom has painted a picture of me to everyone, my entire life, that I’m no good. She made sure I believed I was worthless my entire life. Her favorite thing to do is crack “jokes” about how awful I was as a child. We had a Mother’s Day lunch with my entire family this afternoon. She proceeded to share a story about a parent-teacher conference she had when I was in the 3rd grade. She’s told it to anyone that’ll listen. She starts sharing and I glared at her and she said “What? I can’t share? I think it’s funny, come on.” I said “Go ahead.” My uncle trying to lighten the mood said -“Haha, never let’s you live it down huh?” And I said, “No, and she never will.” I tried to hold back tears. She loves telling people how I acted as a child but they will never know the way I was treated behind closed doors growing up. I’m 27 and she still has me asking myself - maybe I am being overdramatic? Is it valid to be upset that my mom constantly shares stories of my childhood that make me look bad?. Hey fellow skiers. Hit the slopes Thursday evening and had some effects I’ve never had with coke before. About 3 hours into my sesh I started uncontrollably shivering and got extremely tired. I went out to my friends truck and blasted the heat and fell asleep and even then I was still cold. Not sure if this was a sign of a overdose or what? Just trying to figure out if there’s something I need to be doing differently to avoid it happening again.I’m usually emotionally numb and find it very difficult to cry. I’ve spent the past few months really working on myself and the core of my issues. I find myself “choked up” often or even full on tears. It’s not triggered by anything specific. I’m not sure if I’m just “softening up.”. I’m a 26F who was raised by an Nmom. I’ve been doing a lot of self-reflection recently and trying to work through deep wounds. The deepest of them all being the relationship I have with my Nmom. She has made me feel my entire life that I was not good enough, unworthy of love, and incompetent. This has made a huge impact on my life. I have genuinely believed my entire life that I was unlovable, unworthy, incompetent, etc. This has directly impacted my relationship with romantic partners, how I am as a mother myself, and I’ve been unable to set healthy boundaries with anyone. I’m unlearning all of those things now. It just makes me very sad that the person who is supposed to be my biggest cheerleader is in fact my worst critic. I’m worthy of love and I AM good enough, and so are you. Sending good vibes to everyone. We deserved so much more.I’m 26F and my Nmom couldn’t tell you a thing about my personal interest, likes or dislikes, my aspirations, etc. She has never asked questions or even seemed slightly interested in my life or me as a person in general. When I do try to share things with her she stares at me like she’s completely bored and often times it makes me feel embarrassed that I shared anything with her in the first place. Can anyone else with Nparents relate?. My daughter’s biological father made front page news for beating his girlfriend with her 9 month-old baby in her arms, then held a torch lighter to her child’s face and threatened to burn the infant if she called anyone for help. It has been extremely triggering of my own abuse I endured from him and has made me relive the abuse the past few days. He’s had 10 years of multiple assault charges and they have given him a slap on the wrist every time. I worry it will take him killing someone before he is put behind bars. I know what he is capable of and it terrifies me to know he is roaming free.I lost 85lbs in 12 months. I’m 10lbs from my goal weight - AND HAVE BEEN 10lbs FROM MY GOAL WEIGHT SINCE JULY 2022.Baffles me I cannot stay disciplined long enough to lose a measly 10lbs when I dropped 85 in a year. I’m 5’3 140lbs. I stayed disciplined to lose the 85lbs. I had no cheat days and completely cut out alcohol. No excuses. I really don’t understand what the difference is now. I know the more you lose the slower it comes off but I just seem to maintain at this point. I’m thankful I have maintained as long as I have, but I really want this last 10lbs off. Am I the only one??. Really should’ve done my research before taking shrooms. I have Bipolar Type 1 and on SSRI medication. Thought I was gonna die on the come up. 30 minutes after consumption I felt like I was going to pass out. I walked around the house a bit to try to shake the feeling. Then came the muscle jerks and twitches in my face, jaw, and neck. I’m walking around and then my knees start buckling, so I sit. Ahh, here comes the complete paralysis of my limbs. Now I’ve gone from involuntary jerking motions to being unable to move any part of my body. Sensation of passing out is off and on for the next two hours. Breathing becomes difficult and shallow. Throughout this I’m thinking positively, trying to keep anxiety at bay. “Embrace the experience, you are okay. This will pass. What are you ready to learn?” Etc. Next day, I had a bout of derealization. I had panic attacks off and on everyday for two weeks following the trip. I’ve never had anxiety that severe and the absolute worst depressive episode. I sought out mental health treatment because of it and learned all about serotonin syndrome and the effects of psychedelics with a preexisting mental disorder. Luckily, I’m 5 weeks out from my trip and doing much better. Learned a lesson about trying drugs without research prior. I definitely should’ve avoided shrooms between my disorder and medications. I hope someone else on here can learn from my mistake. Some can handle shrooms with SSRIs and mental health disorders but I guess I’m not one of those people. Just spreading some awareness. On a positive note, I got to see myself from a different point of view. I’d even chalk it up to an ego death. Showed me there are a lot of things I thought I had already worked through that I in fact hadn’t. It was the push I needed to actively start healing parts of myself.Really should’ve done my research before taking shrooms. I have Bipolar Type 1 and on SSRI medication.

    Terrorists and their supporters are now the good guys. Jews - who make up less than 0.25 % of the world population and are just trying to live in their tiny country without being exterminated by 1.5 billion Muslims who hate them - are now the bad guys. Good is evil, evil is good. Thousands of people in western countries are rallying in support of bloodthirsty terrorists who hate and want to destroy the West. Things are looking really bad right now. Really bad.Hamas terrorists 'beheaded babies during kibbutz slaughter': IDF soldiers reveal horrific scenes of carnage they discovered at site where scores of people were massacredhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12615031/amp/Hamas-terrorists-beheaded-babies-kibbutz-slaughter-IDF-soldiers-reveal-horrific-scenes-carnage-discovered-site-scores-people-massacred.html. I see a lot of people saying things like “Gaza is an open air prison” and “Palestinians are poor and starving and living in a ghetto” and the Israelis are treating Palestinians “like the Nazis treated the Jews”. Just curious, how do starving people in a ghetto/prison manage to get 5000 rockets?…“An estimated 2,200 rockets were fired toward southern and central Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, by the Hamas militants, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Meanwhile, Hamas claimed at least 5,000 rockets were fired, all landing in southern and central Israel.”Israel must really suck at oppressing people. C’mon Israel, do better oppression!. In every war between Israel and the terrorists in Gaza, it was painful to see pro-Palestinian activists all over the world condemn Israeli attacks on Gaza while staying silent about terrorist attacks on Israel. But this time, they took their inexcusable behavior to another level. They are actually cheering the mass murder of Israelis. This is no different from the Germans who went from being silent about the Holocaust to openly supporting the cold-blooded murder of Jews.If there are still some decent Palestinian voices anywhere in the world, now is the time to speak up. I have yet to hear one such voice.The animals of Hamas and Islamic Jihad would have you believe that they are fighting for the freedom of the Palestinian people in Gaza. Nothing is further from the truth.Until 1967, Egypt ruled Gaza. Gaza had no independence. In 1967, Israel took control. More than 15 years ago, under the leadership of Ariel Sharon, Israel had recognized the will and right of the Palestinian people in Gaza for freedom and self governance. In a swift, unilateral resolution, the Israeli army completely disengaged from the Gaza strip. Israeli settlements previously built and inhabited in the Gaza strip were emptied of their residents, who were painfully relocated into Israel, and these settlements were handed over to the Palestinians in Gaza. The Gaza strip was transferred to the complete and independent governance of the Palestinian Authority. Shortly after, Hamas overtook power in Gaza by force, killing the opposition Palestinian parties, driving out the Palestinian Authority, and has since been devoting its entire manpower and resources to its principal and only cause - the destruction of the state of Israel. All the while, forcing some 2 million Palestinians they meant to rule, into unemployment, poverty, and a senseless life of hatred towards the people and state of Israel.Israel provides energy, electricity, fresh water, medicine, food and construction supplies to Gaza. Israel allowed aid money from the EU and Qatar to regularly flow into the hands of Hamas, in order to foster the Gazan economy, and to better the lives of Palestinians living there. But little of this, if any, ever reached the Palestinian population. Hamas appropriated all of it to build-up and equip its army of terrorists, to amass tens of thousands of rockets and missiles which are regularly being fired into Israeli cities (including now), and to enable luxurious life for its so called 'political' leaders living abroad in palaces, while the Palestinian population in Gaza is starved into hatred.The truth is that Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, are branches of the global Islamic fundamentalist movement which hate not only Israel, but the entire free world, the West as a whole. Just like El-Kaida, and Daesh, these terrorist movements sanctify hatred over joy; War over peace; Death over life. Movements headed by leaders with twisted, sick minds.But they are not alone. They are guided, supported, and funded by the terror regime of Iran, and their proxy in Lebanon, the Hizbullah.Why is it that if an Israeli does anything bad to an Arab, the news and most people on social media are like: “Israel is bad, Palestinians are victims”.But when Palestinians rape and murder civilians in Israel, the news and most people on social media are like:“Both sides are bad”Why the double standard?. My latest blog in the Times of Israel: We were fools to support the Palestinian cause:“We were fools. We were naïve fools. We did it carefully. We did it because we felt that it was the morally correct thing to do. We supported the Palestinian cause, or what we thought was the Palestinian cause: the struggle for a state of their own.But any naivety, any delusion, has dissipated after the events of the last couple of days.It’s not only that Hamas (which has been supported and nurtured by Palestinians and pro-Palestinian activists for decades) has engaged in a horrific mass murder of Israelis. It’s not only that this terrorist group is the most popular party among Palestinians and that most other parties are either just as bad or almost as bad. It’s also that the horrific actions of Hamas are by all accounts widely supported within the Palestinian community and the pro-Palestinian community abroad.The supposedly moderate president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmood Abbas, refused to condemn the murders committed by Hamas.The Daily Mail reported that after the news of the massacres of Israelis “there were cheers and triumphant flag-waving on the streets of Britain. On London’s Edgware Road, nicknamed the capital’s ‘Arab Street’, cars were draped with the Palestinian flag and horns blaring as if there was a football match victory”.In Canada, a large pro-Palestinian union, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, tweeted, “Today, as Palestinians break down colonial barriers, they breathe life into the dream of an open, liberated geography”.As Avi Benlolo wrote in Canada’s National Post, “the campaign to justify Hamas’ mass murder of innocent civilians is well underway”.As an Arab, I am ashamed. As someone who supported the Palestinian cause, I am ashamed. But now, as far as I am concerned, the Palestinian cause is dead. In fact, that cause has never existed because all evidence points to the Palestinians wanting nothing but the destruction of Israel and the Jews, at any cost.The Palestinians have had 75 years to choose to have a state next to Israel, but they have repeatedly chosen terrorism.Through the murder of hundreds of Israelis and the cheering for those murders, they made their final choice clear. Some people will say that it’s the fault of terrorists and not the fault of Palestinians. I won’t be one of those people. Terrorists cannot exist unless they’re supported by the people.Before this, there seemed to still be a glimmer of hope for a Palestinian state, but I now admit that those of us who believed in that hope were naive. That hope is dead now. I see many peace activists, who previously held nuanced views on the conflict, now declaring on social media their unwavering support for Israel.What choice do we have left? The so-called Palestinian cause will now forever be covered with the blood of Israelis that Hamas massacred and that Palestinians and pro-Palestinian activists cheered.The only hope left for Palestinians who don’t wish to be terrorists is to move out of Gaza and the West Bank. They will never have a state on that land.In the meantime, each of us who pays any attention to this conflict must stand with Israel. It is the duty of every decent person in the world. It is the only reasonable choice left.”. Israeli medical staff have uncovered at least 250 bodies of young people attending a music festival close to the Gaza border.Coward Hamas "warrior" savages butchered young innocent Israeli and other nationalities civilians who were simply listening to music.Hamas butchered entire Israeli families and kidnapped an Israeli grandmother from her wheelchair. The terrorists also kidnapped small children and women. Hamas is endless evil = ISIS. An Arab friend of mine told me there are a lot of news stories going around Arab media, supposedly from legit news sources, that a number of the top-level Hamas leadership were recently caught engaging in homosexual activities. Seems like this should be bigger news given the negative views a lot of Arab / Muslims have about homosexuals. What are your thoughts?One other question: if they get offed by Israel, will they still get their 72 virgins? And if so, will they even want them?. Unfortunately what has happened in Israel has proved to me that I have to vote Republican for now on. There are may things about the Republicans that I strongly disagree with, however the fact that Obama and Biden and the democrats appeased and released billions of dollars to Iran shows to all of our enemies that we aren’t going to stop them from trying to destroy us and our allies. You can hate Trump all you want, and there are lots of reasons to hate him, but the terrorists would never have invaded and kidnapped and murdered our ally if Trump was president. It pains me to say it but I care too much about our country and our allies to support a party that appeases terrorist nations that fund terrorism against us and our allies thought the world. I keep getting into discussions with pro-Palestinians that say Palestinians are justified in what they do “because of the settlements”. First off, most “settlements” are in Israeli controlled / disputed territory. But even more importantly, Arabs view “all of Palestine” including Israel, as Palestinian land and all Jews as settlers. If Israel were to dismantle every settlement today, nothing would change. In fact. Israel did that in Gaza in 2005 in exchange for peace and the next day Gaza fired thousands of rockets into Israel. Question:Everyone knows Iran funds Hamas and terrorism throughout the world. Why is Biden unfeezing and releasing to them billions of dollars? Why are Americans allowing or supporting their administration to release billions of dollars to a country that hates America and funds terrorism activities throughout the world, including terrorism against our allies, such as Israel?. Edited: I added a 4th reason. I’m sure I’ll get a lot of flack for this, but I think it is extremely important for people to understand this:There are 4 reasons why they don’t deserve a state of their own:1) Palestinians are not a “People”. I am not saying they are not human, I am saying they are not a People in the sense of having a unique, significant, ethnicity or other classification that should make them worthy of having their own country. In fact, they never even called themselves Palestinians until the 1960’s; they considered themselves simply Arabs/Muslims. Palestinians have no unique language, customs, religion, culture, etc that is virtually any different than any other Muslim Arab in the world. Jews for example are a People because they are the only ones that have a unique and shared language (Hebrew), a religion and holy book that no one else has, observances and customs that no one else has, and they are even ethically related to each other. In fact the only thing that differentiates Palestinians with the rest of Arab Muslims in the world is where they live and perhaps some variations in cooking and dress. There are already many Arab Muslims countries (including one in Palestine already - Jordan) and there is no reason there should be another one for Arab Muslims just because they live in a certain region of the world. If it is the case that any large religious group that lives in a certain part of the world should get their own county, then Jews in New England should get to have their own country, Jews in Scotland should get to have their own country, Italian Jews should get to have their own country, etc. 2) There already is a Palestinan state. The British mandate for Palestine was for a Jewish country in Palestine, but the British betrayed the mandate and gave much of the land that was promised to Israel to create another Arab Muslim country, Jordan. Jordan IS the Palestinian state. So they already have one.3) The Palestinians don’t want a state. The Palestinians have rejected every offer for a state since 1947, and have made it clear that they view all of Palestine (including Israel) as Muslim land and part of the greater Muslim world. This is why at pro-Palestinian rallies the most popular chant is “from the river to the sea Palestine will be free” because they believe all the land is theirs by default so there is no need for a state. In fact, having a state would go against everything they believe because it would confirm that only a designated part of Palestine (the borders of the Palestinian state) is theirs, when they believe ALL of Palestine is theirs.4) The Palestinians have shown they do not want to recognize Israel and do not want to live at peace with Israel as a neighbor.In addition to the obvious historical actions of the entire Arab world not recognizing Israel, and trying to annihilate it, rhetoric (and Hamas rocket attacks and PA terrorist attacks) from both the PA and Hamas, as well as polls show that the Palestinian leaders and the vast majority of Palestinians do not recognize Israel as a legitimate country and have an ultimate goal to eradicate it. Why would the world ever give a blessing to allow a country to be formed that has as its primary objective to eradicate an established neighboring, democratic country and endanger the millions of people living there?. Will home values keep going up a lot do u think?. For some reason I seem to be the only person in the world to point this out (I couldn’t find anything online about it), but Scarface (the most famous version with Al Pacino) has some of the most blatant anti-semetic undertones in it. The screenplay was by Oliver Stone who has been accused of anti-semetic comments a number of times (and his father was Jewish ironically). In the movie, there are only two blatant Jewish characters, and both are prominent characters : 1) Tony’s drug boss “Frank Lopez” who wears a giant Chai necklace and even speaks some Yiddish, and 2) the crooked cop Mel Bernstein. Interestingly these two Jewish characters are the most despicable characters in the movie. Lopez betrays Al Pacino’s character and tries to have him killed (after saying he was his friend) and then begs “like a cockroach” for his life in a pathetic, cowardly fashion.And Bernstein is a greedy, sleezy, crooked police chief. Both use their power to get what they want and have no ethics or loyalty. It seems Oliver Stone made sure he subtly put his hate for Jews into the screenplay, but no one seemed to have picked up on it, but millions of people who saw the movie have subconsciously picked up on it I’m sure.Zenker’s. If so, have you or they had or considered having surgery?. Have $1.1M in some high yield savings accounts getting around 5.20% APY. Should I keep there or do something else with it? I don’t need it for living expenses. 58M here. I developed chronic/severe insomnia over a period of a few months due to getting very anxious and worried over some life situations. It started with waking up every morning at 3 am with racing / nervous thoughts and that lead to worsening sleep deprivation and more anxiety and more insomnia and a full blown manic / nervous breakdown.When I came out if it, my insomnia was so bad that I could no longer sleep at all and was getting literally only a few minutes of sleep over multiple days. I was having physical pains, panic attacks, suicidal ideations and didn’t think I was going to survive.I finally got on ambien for a couple of weeks, which did help me sleep, but I also started taking Zoloft. The ambien started not working well, and I switched to Trazodone for about a week. Trazodone helped me sleep, but I could feel the Zoloft kicking in (my depression and anxiety overall was way less) and I felt like now that my mind was relaxed at night maybe I could sleep without sleep meds. So I tried and lo and behold I was able to sleep with no sleep meds. It’s been a couple of weeks now with no sleep meds and I’ve been sleeping again pretty well every night. It’s like a miracle because prior to this I thought I might never be able to sleep normally again for the rest of my life.So the Zoloft is what cured the insomnia for me and I will probably stay on that for a long time - maybe for the rest of my life - because it has made my overall mood so much better as well as allowing me to sleep normally again. Hope my experience helps others who are struggling with bad insomnia from anxiety, etc. Wanted to share my story in case it helps others struggling with insomnia…Quick background: 58M. Never had bad insomnia my whole life. About 6 months ago a few rough things happened in my life (injured my knee and couldn’t play sports anymore and my career went from making good money to no money). I started waking up a lot at 3 am with anxiety and that lead to sleep deprivation which lead to having more anxiety which lead to worsening sleep and not sleeping for days, which lead to a manic state which lead to making some very impulsive/bad financial decisions, more anxiety, more sleep deprivation and lead to a nervous breakdown. I ended up with chronic insomnia and could not sleep at all, and would go days without sleep. My body hurt, I was having panic attacks, I often thought I wouldn’t make it through the day. Finally I started taking Ambien which got me to sleep. But I was worried I would never sleep again on my own without sleep meds.The Ambien stopped working and I was afraid now nothing would work and I would never sleep again. I switched from Ambien to Trazodone and I preferred the Trazodone even though I would wake up a lot, and only get a few hours of sleep, but overall I felt more rested than I did with AmbienI also started taking Zoloft for depression/anxiety. As the Zoloft kicked in more, I felt much less depressed and anxious at night so I started trying to sleep without any meds and amazingly I was able to sleep a little bit.Each day got a little better and now I am pretty much back to normal sleep without any sleep meds.Hopefully that gives some people hope that they can beat insomnia. 58M - married for 23 years to a great woman. Have 3 great kids with her. Have money in the bank. Overall healthy, other than a bad knee that keeps me from playing sports (which I used to do regularly). Went from making a lot of money the last few years to no money. But my wife works and makes ok money. I am depressed and started taking Zoloft recently which helps a bit, but I still feel hopeless. I feel like my life is over. Basically no job and I have no motivation. I know people have it a lot worse than me, but I just can’t see any good in my life or future. Just venting.Has anyone done the BEAR implant for ACL repair? I have a complete rupture of my ACL.Link to the BEAR implant is here: https://miachortho.com/patients-and-families/bear-implant/. Note: I added some more info to this just now…years ago playing basketball jumped really high and came down on my left leg so badly that my knee felt like it exploded. Was completely swollen and couldn’t put any presssure on it etc. needed crutches.Went to an ortho and he did X-rays and said to do rehab for a few months and see how it goes. Never suggested am MRI. I did PT for a few months. And stayed away from any sports for about a year total. I then started getting into pickleball and was playing every day for about 6 months. Then one day I felt the knee pop badly and I couldn’t stand on that leg. I stopped playing pickleball and went to a new ortho. He also did x rays and said do PT and see how it goes. I asked about doing an MRI and getting surgery and he said he didn’t recommend surgery as their was no guarantee it would even fix the issue and I might just might need to accept that “my sports days might be over” and the MRI is a waste of time and money. So I stayed off it for a couple of more months, and tried pickleball again and immediately felt the bad pop and couldn’t even stand. Needed crutches to walk.This time I told the ortho I WANT an MRI. I got one and turns out I have a completely torn ACL and it was missed the first time I injured myself. I got a referral to a new ortho and he said he could do ACL reconstructive surgery, and I am now waiting to be scheduled for that.WHY DIDNT EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO ORTHOS TELL ME TO GET AN MRI FROM THE START????? IS THIS MALPRACTICE???. 2 years ago playing basketball jumped really high and came down on my left leg so badly that my knee felt like it exploded.

I have been taking 10mg ambien nightly for a couple of weeks now. It’s the Only thing that I can count on to get sleep.If I don’t take it I don’t sleep at all as I developed chronic insomnia a few months ago after having a sort of mini nervous breakdown.Last week I also started taking 25mg of Zoloft every day just because I was getting depressed over life stuff and not sleeping well in general. That hasn’t really kicked in yet (supposed to take a few weeks to feel affects). I would like to not be dependent on Ambien. Any thoughts about maybe tapering it off, etc? I have tried other stuff like melatonin and all the other natural sleep hygiene stuff like avoiding caffeine and not staying in bed too long without sleeping and keeping a good schedule etc. but none of that seemed to work.Background: few months ago I had life stressors and started not sleeping well due to worrying /anxiety. Got worse and worse until I got chronic insomnia and couldn’t sleep at all. Literally would be up for 48 hours or more straight. Tried some natural stuff but nothing worked. Few weeks ago I got Ambien which helped me sleep for a few decent hours. Started taking that pretty consistently but sometimes it wouldn’t work great and I’d still wake up early morning and not be able to get back to sleep.Last night I got about 9-10 hours of good sleep. Best night I can remember in monthsSince this whole thing started. Here is what seemed to help:- I worked out (swam) for 40 minutes, so I was completely tired / relaxed from all that work out. - I ate a lot, but not too much so I wasn’t stuffed. - I waited about 2.5 hours after I ate before taking the Ambien (10mg). (Supposed to take it on an empty stomach.)I stayed up and watched tv and did other stuff (not on phone / computer) until I felt like I was getting drowsy (took about 45 minutes for me, but I’ve read for other people Ambien starts working in as little as 10 minutes). I don’t like lying in bed trying to sleep, I prefer to wait until I am very tired before going in bed.When I felt drowsy I went to bed, didn’t look at phone or electronics. Fell asleep very quickly and slept for almost 10 hours. I haven’t slept this much in probably 4 months, and I was used to getting no sleep on some nights, to about 6 max on others.Been taking 10mg Ambien for couple of weeks and it was the only thing that got me to sleep. I would wake up a couple of times in the early morning but would fall back asleep pretty quickly and get about 7 hours total sleep which was amazing, since without it I could not sleep at all!But 2 nights ago I took it as usual and woke up at 3:30 am and couldn’t get back to sleep And tonight I took it again and woke up at 1:30 am and can’t get back to sleep. I Don’t understand why it stopped working all of a sudden!!! This was all I had to be able to sleep and I’m really worried now.I developed really bad insomnia over the last few months, to the point where I couldn’t sleep sometimes for days straight. Started Ambien, but wasn’t consistent with it because afraid of becoming dependent on it. But I couldn’t take days and nights of no sleep so I decided I would take it consistently at least until I got myself stable. I took it for two nights in a row (10mg) and it helped me sleep well. But last night it didn’t work, I only slept about 1.5 hours total and couldn’t get back to sleep. Anyone have any thoughts what’s going on?. Was having horrible insomnia that started a few months ago and got progressively worse until I literally wouldn’t/couldn’t sleep for 24-48 hours straight and nothing I tried worked (cbt, cbd, magnesium, relaxation techniques, etc). Started taking ambien 10mg and it completely helped me sleep. So now I take it every night. Will I ever ne able to get off it? Am I stuck having to take it for the rest of my life? Will it lose its effectiveness? Any comments about people’s experiences / knowledge are welcome. I have had chronic insomnia for months, sometimes not sleeping at all for 48 hours straight. It’s been horrible. I’ve tried all the natural remedies and cognitive behavioral stuff. About two weeks ago started taking Ambien, and it helped but I was afraid to take it consistently because of potentially getting addicted to it. But is seems it is the only thing that helps. I have also considered starting to take Zoloft because I have been rather depressed lately (and have had depression in my life various times) due to present day life challenges which probably won’t get fixed anytime soon. My question is, if I do decide to start Zoloft, should I start the Zoloft while taking the Ambien and hope that the Zoloft will also help with sleep and I can wean off the ambien? Has anyone had experience with this?. Swam in a lake for about 20 minutes at around 6 pm (both the outdoor nature and excercise and refreshing cold water probably all helped so try as much of that as you can, even a cool shower, and walk in a park, etc).Made sure my bed and bedroom were clutter free and brought a book (fiction) and put some other relaxing things to do (journal/notepad, adult coloring book, etc) in case I need them. Made sure to have good pillows and blankets ready, and small reading light. Stopped eating around 7 pm.Took 10mg of Ambien at 9 pm (I’ve taken ambien before and sometimes it worked sometimes not so much).Got into bed around 9:15 pm. Main light off, small reading light on, Ceiling fan on, shades closed. TURNED OFF POWER TO PHONE! (I think this is important to not have an urge to check or look at phone). I wrote down in my notepad a list of things that make me happy (“swimming in lake”, “playing pickleball”, “eating good food”, etc). I think it’s important to think of only positive things before trying to sleep, as so often I would think of negative things and that would take me down a terrible spiral of thinking causing me to not sleep.I read some of my book (note the book is a kind of fantasy/fiction book like lord of the rings so that I’m not reading anything too intense that would depress me or make me think about my own life too much. The goal here is to relax). I fell asleep around 10:30, woke up around midnight. Stayed in bed and fell back asleep pretty quickly and woke up again around 4 am. Stayed in bed and fell asleep again rather quickly and woke up around 7:15 am and got out of bed.This was the best sleep I’ve had in possibly months of bad insomnia. I will try it again tonight. Note: eventually I want to wean off the ambien, but I am hoping if I can get a few consecutive nights of good sleep I can get my self in mentally good enough state to work on my life issues (getting a therapist too) and deal with the underlying causes of my anxiety / depression. It’s really hard to do that when only averaging an hour or two of sleep each day and sometimes none at all).
    Me and my bpd fiancé has been together for 5 years. Today, I took the wrong train and ended up calling him because I was anxious. He ended up saying I ruined his day and that I won't be going to the place I went to (where my friends live) if I am that dumb... Or else I will have to sleep on the streetHe has been getting more serious with threats as in he threatened to make me sleep on the floor and actually did. And he made me pack my things while acting like he is breaking up with me to "teach my a lesson"I'm honestly really scared. How should I approach him about it? I really love him. Neither of us are in therapy rn. I have NPD, if that is worth mentioning. Can you guys explain in details malignant VS covert? Had trouble finding explanations. For me, I smile and nod. For example, my fiancé called me out for not opening the window in a way he wanted me to (fucking stupid in my opinion), and I just smiled and nodded until he left the room. What can I do to make my reactions more, uh, kind? Less toxic? Because he replied to my behavior with "that's not funny", which ig means I should change itHow do you guys react?. I start to shake when he talks to his best friend - he calls him (his friend) his simp and my day gets RUINED. I feel like screaming and jumping out of the windows immediately, as if by that action he literally called me the most disgusting thing on planet Earth. No. In the whole fucking universe. It is so, so, so upsetting. I get suspicious that he is cheating in a matter of fucking secondsHow would you all describe your jealousy in relationships? Is it also that bad? I've always been a really jealous person romantically, but ig I'm good at hiding it. Except for that annoyed at sighs 99% of us seem to do lol. Every time I try to find media for people with NPD (like articles, reflection tips, support) I just get into a bunch of articles like how to hurt a narc, how to avoid narcs, signs of a narc only ever filled with stereotypes. Like, they make me think that I'm such a burden and turn me suicidal in a matter of seconds. I didn't choose to have NPD. If there was a pill to just magically cure my disorder in one take I would take it, no matter the cost. Anybody else feel like this? What makes you feel better?. 5 years together, he is borderline and I'm a narc. SO hard to get him to communicate with me, it seems like the smallest shit gets him mad. The floor is wet when I take a shower? I sleep on a blanket in the living room. I made a wrong face even as a joke? Silent treatment for 2-5 hours. I didn't communicate when he THOUGHT about me having to communicate? Oh I better run. The last time we fought, I don't even remember the reason, something really dumb, he made me start packing my things. And so I did. He told me nobody cares about me, that my friends dgaf, that I'm not interesting and anything I do I just push off as being a narc (I don't BTW, I'm ashamed of even mentioning being a narc lol)I have flaws, which is hard to admit. I get really annoyed and demand A LOT of attention. Ask if he loves me at least once an hour etcIs it possible for a BPD NPD couple to work? Going to therapy myself this month. He says he is OK with his actions and not planning on getting therapy, so yeah. We have history together. LDR for 2 years, living together for 3. I was really abusive for the first 2 years which I REALLY regret.I'm 20M, suspected I might have NPD for a few years. My fiancé has BPD, which is hard on both of us but we try to make things better all the time. I noticed every time he mentions even a single thing negatively about me it's like I black out. I just want to yell at him and cry so he stops talking. Yet, of course, I don't. The only thing I figured I could do is go to another room and spend some time here, isolate myself and wait for myself to cool down. For example, today he said he is sometimes surprised by how irresponsible I can be, to which I said "Yeah you are" in an irritated voice because I REALLY wanted him to stop right there. Luckily, he didn't react in any way and now I'm drowning in regret in the bathroom. To be honest, I feel broken and upset with myself. I don't want to be the way I am, I really do want to accept my mistakes and just move on without literally wanting to scream because of shame 24/7.So, what would you guys suggest to start coping and getting better? Besides therapy - I'm already looking into it.
    My fiancé told me tonight that she’s subconsciously distancing herself from me. She’s known this for a week and is just now telling me…it’s got me feeling pretty down. I feel like I’m not a good enough man for her and I’ve never been. I’ve put her through so much bullshit and I still do. She knows I have this thing and yet I don’t know what I am doing wrong at this point. I’ve been trying to be a better fiancé and a better man. I guess I’m just not enough and never will be.I’ve made my way out of the collapse and honestly, I feel better than I have in a long time. I’ve matured and grown from the experience. Sometimes we need a reality check to hit us so that we realize things and come out of our own delusions. It’s time for me to better myself and recognize that I need to gain some real insight in order to improve. I’m starting to understand that people are people, not objects. And sometimes people do actually care about you and there isn’t a motive behind that. There is a such thing as people truly caring for you and loving you.Edit: Scrap the title. Instead, I have to learn that I am in control now. No more delusions. I need to recognize that it is my responsibility to manage this.. I don’t know who to talk to about this, I don’t see my therapist until next week. So I’m kinda just fending for myself right now. I can’t even focus on my classes.This entire week I have been all over the place. I’m ready to give up and submit. This thing is winning, and I’m just along for the ride. I’ve never felt this out of control of everything and my life. I just want to curl up somewhere and escape from the world.I’m not happy with the way my sessions are going so far. I’m not too sure how to speed this up. I understand that rushing the process can alter it negatively and pose the risk of an inaccurate diagnosis. However, I need some answers. I cannot know where to start unless I get a diagnosis. What would you guys suggest if I want to make some real headway?. This is the fucking the worst. I don’t know why my therapist keeps playing games with me. Doesn’t she know I’m a narcissist? Yet she’s here asking me questions trying to get me to figure it out myself. I already know who the fuck I am! Tell me something I don’t know already know. I just want to figure out how to gain some control over this, I don’t need you telling me what I am. I’ve been in a collapse for the last couple of days and it’s eating me away.My best friend since 3rd grade came to check on me tonight. I built up the courage to tell him about my NPD for the very first time. And he accepted me and told me that we’re closer now more than ever. He stated that he’s always known there was something going on with me. The way I talked and the way I acted often stood out to him, and he was worried about me. He had this feeling that I might be a bit narcissistic but he never told me assuming that I would deny it and get angry. He’s not wrong haha. But he told me that he’s glad I was finally honest and that he’ll always love me as a brother. I’m so proud of myself and he’s helped me gain some faith in humanity.It’s all that has been on my mind. That I let someone manipulate me. How could I have been so naive? I should have seen the signs and known better. It feels as if it’s taken a major blow to my ego. I don’t know what to feel anymore, I was in a rage yesterday and today I’m just annoyed with myself and feeling vulnerable.I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past but recently in my sessions with a new therapist, I’ve been told I exhibit narcissistic traits. We’ve also discovered that I struggle with empathy, not having much at all.I am suspecting I have NPD and I’m tired of dragging this out. I want to figure out what’s going on with me so I can go from there.I hate people who waste my time. I hate people who think they’re better than me. I hate people who are irresponsible. I hate people that look at me funny. I hate people who are taller than me. I hate people who love themselves. I can go on and on about what I hate. It seems every day I build up more and more hatred. When will I get what I fucking deserve? I deserve the best of everything. I’m a great person who deserves the world and more.I cannot believe I was such a fucking idiot. Why can I not just be happy with the life I have now and keep looking for more? I let someone play me when I’m the one who pulls the strings! Let find a motherfucker to beat the shit out of. I feel like unleashing my wrath onto the world! The minute I try to be a good person, I get played like a fiddle! This is why I don’t just open up to anyone! Fuck this! Fuck everything! Fuck anyone who ever experienced happiness! Fuck anyone who ever experienced true love! Who’s day can I go fuck up? I hate everything!. I developed feelings for someone who was just like me, and I shouldn’t be surprised with the outcome. I know how we operate, I know how we obtain supply from others and how we use people for our own selfish reasons. Why did I even bother with this? And I have a fiancé who actually loves me and is trying to understand me yet she’s a NT. She’s trying to look past what is “wrong” with me and love me for who I am. And instead, I was falling for someone who I thought truly understood me yet I failed to recognize that it was risky and naive of me. I never want to be vulnerable like this again with anyone UNLESS it’s on this sub or I’m speaking to my therapist. What the actual fuck is wrong with me?! I wasted my time. I just want take this frustration and rage out on everyone and anything around me.Last night, I got drunk again. This time with a couple of new people that I think are actually going to be great friends. I honestly thought they would just be sources of supply but I let down the mask for a bit and they were accepting and understanding. What the fuck is happening? This is the second time I’ve done this and it was successful. Apparently I just need a lot of alcohol in me to start opening up.So I am a 23m, 5’10. I feel like I’m a good height yet I’ve been told by some women and even some of my homies that I’m “short”. What’s wrong with my height exactly? I’m not too tall, and not too short. I believe the average American male is 5’9-5’10 anyway, so I’m right around average. It could just be that I live in the upper Midwest where it seems many men here are over 6ft easily.I’m starting to wonder if I should start embracing this thing I have. Because it’s not my fault that I was dealt this, it’s not my fault I responded to trauma this way. It’s what has protected me ever since. It’s as if people want me to repent for my sins like I’m some evil demon. No, I’m just a person who learned who to protect himself. Like what do people want me to do? Conform to their norms and expectations? That’s their fault for believing that this society is built from sunshine and rainbows. They want to ignore the darker parts of society and believe they’re better because they have a “moral compass”. No, this world is every man for themselves and it always has been. After all, I’ll learn who the people are that I can count on. Because they’ll accept me for who I am and not just some mask I wear to appear “human”. Fuck them.I’ve never felt more alone in my life. Me realizing I will never truly connect with anyone outside of this disturbs me. Not even that, it leaves me in despair. I know all of these people and they know me (they think they do) and yet I feel so alone. Like I am just existing but there isn’t any substance to it. I am just a shadow walking among other people. I just follow others because there isn’t a real me. They will never know my true identity because there isn’t one. They will only ever see what I want them to see. And here my partner is trying to connect with me though she never truly will. And that pains me the most.I am a man of no residence A man of no place in this world A man with no connectionAs I have never learned this connection For it is something foreign which I fear As it requires my mask to fall But my mask is my shieldMy mask is my skin And I cannot simply peel it off For it would reveal myself to the world And a real connection requires this peeling This peeling of the layers that cover our exterior selvesBut even if you do try to peel back these layersHow do we know if there is anything there? Anything beyond that makes that I have constructed Because maybe all you will find is a void As I never learned who I was in the first place. I used to listen to some EDM back then and I’m trying to get back into it. However, I could use a refresh.I’m a Native American male living in the 21st century. AMA. I’m not sure what’s happening at the moment. I don’t feel any emotions. I just feel empty. Like there’s nothing. Was there ever anything? I don’t like this. It’s weird.So I am a malignant narcissist, which some might say is the “worst kind” however that is a bit of a vague statement. So AMA and I’ll happily answer to the best of my abilities.Why do I hate that I care about someone? It makes me feel pathetic and weak. Like why I should care so much about someone else where I am concerned for them? I’ve got better things to worry about. People who tend to care too much for others, I view them as weak. I am not one of those and I never wish to be. It sounds like a complete waste of energy and time. And why should I trust them? People will fuck you over any chance they get. Most if not everyone has ulterior motives behind the things they do. It’s never out of pure kindness, they want something that you have. I often believe they envy me or they are up to something. And now I feel as if I have started to care for some people again and it’s really bothering me. Angering me actually, because it’s not my responsibility. And my therapist…she’s putting me through hell. I never look forward to it because she challenges my ego. How dare she? What is she trying to prove? Something I already know? She needs to back off. I’m a intelligent, handsome, interesting and bold man and everyone knows it! I apologize for this rambling by the way, I just had so much on my mind this past week. Thoughts are starting to become clearer and I’m having a difficult time facing my reality for the first time.I’ve been switching between grandiosity and vulnerability more often lately. I’ve also been getting depressed again which hasn’t happened in at least a couple of years now. I hate this. What’s happening to me? I just want to be unaware again so I don’t overthink my life and question my entire existence.So for some reason my last one didn’t get posted. Anyway, what do you guys think of someone who threatens to use their fists rather than being logical about conflict? I tend to look down on those individuals as I question their intelligence. Threatening someone with physical violence doesn’t get anywhere. Plus I am a narcissist, you can try to push me down but I’ll get right back up and I’m still better than you.I am a human, just like youI live and breathe the same air you doBut the difference is that you will never know me For I am made of layers upon layersAnd underneath these layers, there is nothing but a void Unlike you, I am barely human at all As I am merely a maskAnd this mask is all you shall see,For the one you see is whoever you want me to be. I’m starting to wonder why I was ever placed on this planet. All I do is destroy people’s lives and cause pain and suffering. I have nothing beneficial to offer to this world and the people on it. Sometimes I feel I was better off never born or dead. As Olivia Rodrigo says in her new song “I’m playing the victim so well in my head” yet I am the perpetrator. I am the villain. What the hell is my purpose and why should I even be alive? Could use some support right now..So I’ve started to notice there are definitely a few on this sub that are non-NPD. And I have no issue with that as long as you are here for good reason, like trying to understand us. However, I am curious. Any of you that are non-NPD, what brings you here? Why did you decided to join this little community we have here and what have you learned from it?. So I’m surprised I’m still getting upvotes and comments on my post about being vulnerable to my ex best friend. However, I want to address a discussion I had with a specific commenter. I understand how narcissists can be abusive and cause mental and emotional damage to many people. And yes, it is very difficult to control and the victims deserve validation themselves. However, if you’re not NPD, you’re not going to understand the pain and suffering that we experience ourselves. It’s not like satan birthed us onto this world and we are out to destroy peoples’ lives. We are a result of trauma itself. And despite it being toxic, we are dealing with that trauma by taking it out on others. And the case is, it’s not as simple as shutting it off like a light switch. It can take years to learn to control, and that’s if you’re self aware and you accept it. We’re not monsters, we’re people who do bad things sometimes. Also….I’m not sure why anyone would would believe that separating us from the general population and making us be alone forever is somehow going to work? We can’t be alone. Most humans need some sort of companionship, we’re social animals. Just because we’re narcissists doesn’t mean we don’t want human connection. To separate us from the rest of the world would be the same as white people discriminating against minorities because they don’t look like them. Or straight people discriminating against gays by saying they spread AIDS. And clearly, separating humans into categories has never worked for the betterment of humanity. If you want us to get help, if you want us to be better, we need to learn to empathize with each other her. If we cannot do that, then the general population is no better than us in that regard. It’s an absurd idea and it totally invalidates the point.I just want to thank you all on here for supporting me as much as you do. I lost a best friend yesterday because I informed him of my narcissism and he didn’t react well to it. But I’m glad to have people like you guys on here that I can relate to and discuss topics with that I wouldn’t be able to in public spaces. I appreciate you all more than you know. Many of you are better than most people I’ve met in real life. Thank you, I love you guys.What is the point of engaging in relationships with people who are not cluster B like us? They will never know who I truly am. They will never understand our perspective on life. They will never understand our behaviors and mannerisms and coping mechanisms. So why bother with relationships with NTs? They’ll never be honest and true anyway. It’s as if we are a different species of human. I apologize if this post seems very depressing, this is just how I feel.Do any of you guys have songs that make you feel more grandiose? That help you escape into those fantasies? I need to add more music anyway and I wouldn’t mind some songs that would kind of pick me up when I’m feeling down. The past couple of days have been rough..I have the urge at the moment to fuck up somebody’s day. I want to be a fucking villain right now. They should fear me. I am their worst nightmare. I’m a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Because why be one of the herd when you can be the one who watches from the shadows, waiting for the attack…I don’t know what the hell is going on right now. I don’t believe I’ve ever felt like this haha. I had my third therapy appointment today and my therapist has been trying to show me what empathy is. She’s recognized that I lack in that area so she’s trying to place me in hypothetical situations. It annoys me because I don’t like dealing with hypotheticals. She was challenging my thought processes as well and showed me that they are inherently narcissistic. This method she was using was pissing me off. However, I tried my best to hold my tongue so I wouldn’t come across as out of control. Why can’t I seem to understand that she is trying to help me? I feel intimidated every time I walk in there and I almost never look forward to our meetings. Maybe it’s because she’s challenging me and I’m not used to people challenging me in this way.Everything seems so bad at the moment. Struggling with school now, struggling with finances, and my relationship is in a really bad spot at the moment. Not to mention my father and I don’t talk anymore really. And my grandmother is on her deathbed. Feels as if my whole world is in shambles at the moment. Just want it to slow down for a second…a few weeks ago I felt like I was on top of the world. I was in a grandiose state.Don’t you just love it when someone on the outside is doing whatever they can to ruin your relationship? A female I used to be friends with(we’ll call her B) tried to message my gf telling her that I was on a dating app when I wasn’t. And then B goes out of her way to “wow” react my Facebook post that’s about our 3 year anniversary. This morning some dude messaged my gf saying I was talking to his ex. What’s funny is that the dude knows B as well. Is there some kind of conspiracy? What’s her issue? She really needs to mind her own business and focus on her life.Little rant here. I hate the fact that my entire life is a facade and it always has been. Even in my own family. I feel as if they don’t really even know me. I cannot tell my mother who I really am, as she will not believe it because I am her son and I can do no wrong. I don’t talk to my father anymore as he is a narcissist who will just gaslight me and get into a rage if I tell him how I actually feel about him. And my siblings, they will gaslight me and tell me that my father is a great man who loves us unconditionally. Well they don’t know how he treated me. They don’t know how he stopped caring about me because I didn’t become him. It was either my mother giving me excessive praise and admiration or my father ignoring me and not taking me seriously. Never a balance. Times like these are where I hate my life and wish it wasn’t the way it was. My brothers don’t actually know me, and I feel I don’t actually know them. My sisters I barely know. Instead of telling each-other our problems we just bottle them up and put on a fake smile and a fake act. And watching them turn out like my father did is a real shame.So last night I was very buzzed at a party with a couple of friends and my fiancé. When I am in an intoxicated state, I tend to be more open with my thoughts and feelings. I have a friend I’ve known for 3 years now, he’s a great dude. We’ll call him W for privacy reasons. Anyway, after the party we went back to my friends’ house for the night. My fiancé and W’s partner went to bed. W and I decided to stay up and have a couple of beers and talk. We went outside to a picnic table and talked for hours. During that time, for the first time ever, I told him about my narcissism. Obviously he didn’t believe me at first but I explained to him everything. And the shame I felt and the fear that I was experiencing was intense. I couldn’t look him in the eye, one of my best friends. But he didn’t reject me like I thought he would. He told me it doesn’t define me. He told me I was still his best friend no matter what and he felt closer as a friend, as a brother now. And after having this conversation, I felt an immense weight off of my shoulders. It took alcohol in my system to do it but I am proud of myself anyway. But yet at the same time, I still have some doubts on whether it was a good idea or not. Because I had to be vulnerable and tell the truth. I had to drop my mask and discard the facade. What do you guys think?. So my fiancé has noticed that I’ve been more grandiose ever since I became self aware…why is that? She hates it which I guess makes sense. It’s like my narcissism took a step higher and now I feel as if I’m on top of the world. It’s great but I fear when the vulnerable narcissism will come back. Looking back I feel like I was pathetic and now I feel powerful. It’s weird…. Don’t you just love it when somebody is talking to you about their problems when in all reality you could not care less about what’s happening in their every day life? If you’re not my partner or one of my family members, I really don’t care. I always find myself tuning out people when they’re talking. For example, somebody at work might be telling me about their financial troubles but what does that have to do with me? How exactly does that affect my life? Hehe, if only others knew this I’m sure they wouldn’t talk to me about their problems. A little rant here. I hate that my friend gets to have a career he loves. I hate that he has genuine real love with his partner. I hate that he’s happy. Why don’t I get to have real love? Why does my relationship have to be fucked up? Why do I have to be the one that’s not as successful as I should have been? I’m sorry, I know this sounds selfish but I feel I deserve real love and happiness and everything the world has to offer.So today I stopped at a gas station with my fiancé and we went in to get a couple of fountain drinks. I realized mine was flat after I had her try mine to see if I knew it was for sure flat. It was so I poured it out. Some entitled motherfucker makes a comment saying “this isn’t the taste testing station” or something along the lines of that. I snapped my neck to look at him and see if he was joking and I guess he thought it would be funny to be a sarcastic asshole. He was dead serious. I tried my best to brush it off but I had this intense feeling of rage because I felt humiliated. How dare he talk to me that way like I’m some worthless little bitch. My fiancé kept telling me to let it go but I just kept saying “I’m going to say something”. Once I seen him outside the gas station I told him to go suck a dick. All I could think about was how humiliated I felt and how I wanted to get the last word in. Obviously my fiancé was upset that I tried to welcome conflict and said I should have let it go. But all I could think about was who the hell does he think he is talking to me like that. What a pathetic little weasel. Okay that’s my rant. By the way, I know what I did is wrong now. Just hurt my ego a lot for some reason.I started noticing things I do on a daily basis and I was wondering if anyone here relates to this. I tune people out when they’re talking to me because I don’t care what they’re saying, I only care about what I have to say. I fear rejection from others. When I am criticized, it makes me angry. I gaslight people a lot. When someone asks me to do something, I come up with excuses or I ask them why I should do it. Hell, my fiancé can’t even ask me to do simple things without me making a comment. I feel a constant need for control. I blame others for my problems and can’t actually apologize. I’m always jealous or envious of others. I’m never actually happy for other people when something good happens or them. I feel a need for attention and admiration and validation. If nobody does that, I feel inadequate and it upsets me. The other day…I looked into myself for a sec and there was nothing…just emptiness where there should be a sense of who I am. I started to feel myself getting upset so I shut it off. I tend to struggle with empathy, especially when my fiancé is upset. I sit there and either zone out or I’m just angry and don’t care. I don’t remember the last time I cried for anyone other than my dog that passed away a couple of years ago….
    Ok so I’ve never been diagnosed with ocd but I do have health anxiety which has symptoms similar to ocd and I do tend to have obsessive thoughts that I can’t seem to get out of my head.The most recent one of these is constantly imagining myself from the third person. And not voluntarily, like the image will just pop into my head. It’s really starting to annoy me bc it makes me feel like I’m outside my body looking in on myself which makes me feel depersonalised, and it gives me the same kinda feeling you get when you’re being watched, it’s really uncomfortable and unnerving. Has anyone else ever gotten this and how have you coped with it?. Ok so I’m doing a degree in commerce and I’ve never really been doing as well as I want to be, I’ve been in a constant state of “once I get my shit together”. Had some bad anxiety earlier this year that impacted my study and made me feel even worse abt my lack of success. Anyway so this friend is doing a degree in a field unrelated to business and she gets into the most prestigious consulting group in my uni. I actually felt sick when she told me bc how tf is it fair that someone doing a completely different degree is doing better than I am IN MY OWN FIELD! She has mentioned multiple times in a haha funny way that she just kinda makes shit up when they start talking abt super business stuff. And don’t get me wrong she’s smart but it’s unfair bc 1 her major is a lot easier than mine, I did a class in it and got a distinction without watching a single lecture and 2 she literally doesn’t have a job so of course it’s easier for her to do all these extra internships and get great marks. This literally makes me sound like the worst friend in the world but whenever she brings it up I’m just like 😀 greattttt so cooolAnyway I started going to a therapist for some unrelated issues but how do I bring this up without just like completely changing the subject out of no where. Obviously I’m not the first person here to criticise her but I can’t get over how narrow her vid on low grade npd is. She basically just describes someone immature and annoying. All the traits are the most surface level “they love social media”, “they don’t clean up after themselves”, “they care too much about there looks” “they’re obsessed with celebrities”. It’s actually cartoonish.Low grade npd can range from like she said a slack parent who only partakes in the fun parts of parenting to a overbearing parent who will go above and beyond to make sure their kid is perfect bc they are a reflection of themselves. It can be constantly needing a romantic partner for validation or avoiding romantic relationships out of a crippling fear of rejection. It can be slacking on “adult tasks” or micromanaging your household to prove your competency.I just watched healNPD’s video on how ppl with npd often get health/illness anxiety and I was wondering if any of you get this?Personally I’ve had a lot of health anxiety for a while, and I have always thought that it had something to do with my need for perfection, need for control, need to be be successful and incredibly high standards I hold myself to, bc obviously having a horrible disease or condition would hold me back from all those things. It makes a lot of sense bc I don’t have much medical trauma or anything else I could think of that would cause this obsession with my health.I often find myself hating teen dramas, especially set in highschool that are supposed to be “relatable” bc I get so jealous and insecure abt the characters having a more interesting highschool experience than I did. It’s actually an issue, I stopped watching stranger things when they all got into relationships bc how the fuck is eleven in a relationship yet I’m not, stopped watching sex education for the same reason, and there’s countless tv shows I won’t even try bc I know I’ll hate them for that reason. Also often when watching tv shows or movies I come to despise the “main character” or the person who is supposed to be the “good guy”. Some examples:- Aria from pll - Scott and Allison from teen wolf- Serena and Dan from gossip girl- Daenerys from got- rhaenyra from hotd- Spider-Man- Every single character in riverdale- Nancy and Jonathan stranger things- Rachael from friends- Jane from Jane the virgin (couldn’t get past ep1)-Rory from Gilmore girls (again couldn’t get past ep 1)- Haven’t even bothered watching vampire diaries bc I know I’m gonna hate Elena - Luke skywalker- Gabriella from hsm - Literally every single main character from any Disney or Nickelodeon show (especially the female ones for some reason)Sometimes I worry I have internalised misogyny but then I do have an unhealthy obsession with female “villains” or women with issues like Blair Waldorf, Cersei Lannister, Alicent Hightower, spencer Hastings, Jade from victorious, fallon carrington from dynasty and sharpay evensAnyway just rambling bc I need to get my hatred for these characters out somehow. If anyone has any show recommendations lmk lol. The way I become incredibly anxious, intimidated and basically just seize up around anyone who has a higher social status than me, or is in a position of power above me or who I view as higher up the hierarchy of whatever situation I’m in is so pathetic it’s embarrassing. Its as tho I switch from grandiose to vulnerable depending on how I view/the status of the ppl around me. It’s gotten better after highschool bc there’s less social hierarchy but it still sucks at work bc I can never be the confident outgoing version of myself, or have a decent relationship with my bosses bc of this. And I can never actually impress the ppl I care to impress, only looser I don’t particularly want to associate myself with 😂. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship so obviously I don’t have personal experience with heartbreak or relationships issues (apart from my best friend of 3 yrs ghosting me), and I dunno if it’s lack of empathy or something but I genuinely don’t understand a lot of ppls relationships issues. Like whenever someone get really upset abt their relationship I can’t help but think either it isn’t that bad and you should get over it or it is that bad and break up. Like currently my sister is heartbroken over some guy she never even dated and I just don’t get it? I know it’s wrong and I should never blame the victim but whenever someone starts talking abt the way they were treated in a past relationship I can’t help but judge them for staying in the first place. Like I saw someone on another sub post abt how their abusive ex straight up told them a month into the relationship that they abused every person they were with, and it makes it hard to even feel sympathy for them bc why tf would you even stay after that?. So it seems as tho ppl with npd often didn’t suspect they had it or self diagnose themselves with it, and that they can be in denial when they do get diagnosed with it. And ppl seem to blame this entirely on the narcissism but I can’t help feel as tho the way the media talks abt npd must be a slight contributing factor. Like if you search up npd on YouTube or tiktok or any other social media 90% of the results focus on spotting and diagnosing npd in others. Stuff like “how to tell if your ex is a narc”, etc. Contrast this to how bpd or adhd or bipolar is talked abt where it’s focused on whether you have it with stuff like “what it’s like living with __”. Like are we really surprised that no one is self aware when the way npd is talked abt doesn’t promote self reflection and instead just encourages ppl to point the accusatory finger at others?. Curious to see if there’s anything certain things that actually make you feel empathy?Like seeing other ppl emotionally suffering doesn’t make me emotionally suffer. (Although it does make me uncomfortable bc now I have to comfort them and I’m not very good at that) However there are some things that make me feel:1) physical pain, I hate seeing ppl get physical hurt, I hate watching “funny” fail vids where ppl get hurt, it just grosses me out.2) wholesome videos, like the ones that are supposed to restore your faith in humanity, they makes me happy3) movies, sad movies make me sad The more I think abt empathy the more it confuses me, why does a video of a child I don’t even know beating cancer make me feel but my friend crying in front of me doesn’t?. Ok so I have a very high opinion of myself. I basically think I’m better than the large majority of ppl overall. I definitely think I’m self righteous, and I do curse a lot (not sure how that relates).I’ve always been a chronic daydreamer, and the daydreams always involve an alternate universe where I’m super rich, famous and/or powerful, with a great partner and great friends. I often get a kick out of feeling powerful, like when I can tell someone is intimidated by me, or I’m put in a position of authority.The thought of living an average life where I never amount to much terrifies me. I recently turned 21 and I feel like I’m spiraling bc I haven’t achieved the level of success I dreamed of. I do feel entitled to opportunities I don’t have the grades for, but I understand why they can’t break the rules for me.I find myself getting incredibly jealous of ppl when they achieve something or get complimented, I don’t feel happy for them. I don’t resent them for their achievements but sometimes I do have to remind myself of their flaws just to reassure myself.I’ve also started questioning whether I actually feel emotional empathy, I definitely feel cognitive empathy, but I don’t actually feel sad when someone else feels sad. I have also always thought I was slightly emotionally stunted, like when I get bad news abt someone else I always feel like I’m more focused on how I’m acting than actually feeling.That being said none of this has ever caused me any issues externally. I’ve always been good at keeping friends, and my friends never have issues with me. I also hate loosing friends and see having a lot of friends as a flex so. I’m also genuinely interested in their lives. I guess I’m very conscious of how I’m perceived so I make sure not to boast, or put others down to bring myself up, not to show I’m envious of their accomplishments, not to show I think they’re just not as good as me. I’m also not very quick to anger, I’m not vengeful and tend to be relatively resilient. I can brush off criticism relatively easily although I’ve never had anyone say anything genuinely insulting abt who I am as a person so I don’t know how I would respond if they did. Anyway am I a narcissist or am I just going through a quarter life crisis lolNPI -28, codependency- 1, ocd-4. Basically the title. Is anyone here good at hiding their narcissism feelings or tendencies around their friends bc they know loosing friends would be too much of a blow to the ego. Does anyone keep a decent amount friends for a long time without getting bored of them? Does anyone have some interest in their friends lives even if they don’t majorly care?. Ok so what Kim said on that phone call was just wrong, period. But I can’t pretend that I wouldn’t be fed up if I was Kim.For one the whole issue abt d&g made no sense, and the way kourtney kept trying to turn it on Kim and psychoanalyse her to say that she was wrong for being ambitious and wanting to challenge herself was really weird and annoying. Especially when she wanted to have that useless conversation she wrote notes for, only for the notes to not include a single thing abt how she feels and to be basically be trying to give Kim a therapy session and once again imply there’s something inherently wrong with her bc she’s ambitious.Then with the phone call, kourtney brings up the looks and aesthetics only to argue that it’s got nothing to do with that two seconds later? Then go straight into calling her egotistical, selfish and attention seeking when the conversation up until that point had been relatively civil, and accuse her of not being happy for her at her wedding. I’m mot surprised Kim snapped when kourtney has been implying for ages that Kim is fundamentally flawed and unfulfilled for wanting to challenge herself.As an older sister I understand it can build resentment watching a younger sister become more “successful” than you, but I’d never demonise my younger sister for wanting to be successful. And the therapy doesn’t seem to be helping bc that’s the kinda thing they should be working on. If kourtney is as fulfilled and focused more on what truly matter than money as she claims, why did the d&g thing even matter? And why does it matter that Kim wants to challenge herself?. Just took my first dose of propranolol and now I’m freaking out thinking it’s going to kill me. Which is literally so stupid bc I have previously been on this medication for months and I never died. Like I can think logically but for some reason never believe it.If anyone is struggling with health anxiety I highly recommend Cherellethinks on YouTube. Her entire channel is dedicated to health anxiety talking abt her experience with it, physical symptoms from it, specific fears, tips on how to overcome it. She has loads of videos explaining basically every symptom you can think of and how anxiety can cause it. Her videos have actually helped me so much bc the more you understand health anxiety the easier it is to overcome.Ok so for the past month or so I’ve just had this semi constant dizzy/vertigo feeling, like I’m on a boat, or walking on a mattress, or like the ground underneath me in generally unstable. From what I’ve seen on here it’s not uncommon with anxiety but does anyone have any suggestions on how to get rid of it? I’ve seen ppl say that just trying to ignore it is the only way but its like trying to ignore a mosquito buzzing in my ear.I find myself frequently forgetting to do things I’m supposed to do often like ask the name of the person I’m speaking to on the phone, mention booking fees in emails etc. I tried putting post it notes on my computer to remind me but they kinda just blend into the background of my desk so I don’t notice them (if that makes sense).Ok the title probably doesn’t make much sense. Basically since March I’ve developed really bad health anxiety. I’ve always been a generally anxious person but this health anxiety especially the physical effects it has on me, isn’t like anything I’ve experienced before. In the past month I’ve gone from thinking I had a heart problem, to thinking I had Ms, to thinking I was going to have a psychotic break I’d never recover from, to some weird existential crisis, to thinking some medication has permanently damaged my brain. Anyway today I was worried that I wasn’t going to find a group for this uni group project. And it’s weirdly relieving that I even have the energy to worry abt uni. Given my anxiety at its worse causes me to completely disregard uni bc “what’s the point if I’m going to die”, the fact im worried abt is a pretty good sign. Hoping I get back to a point in my life where my anxiety is just over first world problems.Anyone else kinda worried abt when they’ll eventually have to move out of home? I’m 21 still living with my parents and they basically do everything for me (thank the lord). They do my washing, cook me dinner, do groceries, my dad even drives me to work. I actually don’t know what I’d do without them. How would I ever manage to do my own washing if I can’t even put my clothes away after my mum washes them? How am I going to feed myself every day if I struggle to make myself lunch? How am I supposed to get to work on time if I’m 15mins late every day my dad can’t drive me? How am I supposed to do the dishes if I can’t even remember to put my dishes in the sink? How am I supposed to keep a house clean if I can’t even keep my room clean? Not to mention paying bills, grocery shopping, house maintenance etc. And honestly I don’t know how much longer my parents will put up with me 😂. F21So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days? Is it safe to quit?I would ask my doctor but I can’t see her for another couple of days and I want to quit asap bc the longer I wait the more withdrawal symptoms I’ll get.So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days?. Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better. However now I’m scared of what happens when I eventually go off the meds. I’ve spent the entire day scrolling through “survivingantidepressants.org” and now I’m scared that the meds are going to permanently alter my brain and that if I ever try to go off I’ll have to endure months to years of withdrawal symptoms. Is this just my health anxiety talking or is this an actual valid concern? I’m tempted to stop now before I develop a physical dependency.Some extra context I only have very mild anxiety until March this year when I started spiraling thinking I had some terminal disease. Doctor said I had health anxiety. The anxiety subsided a bit over July but came back mid august. The main reason I wanted anxiety meds is bc I found it so hard to deal with the physical symptoms that came with the anxiety.Anyway if anyone has any advice, or can share their experience going through withdrawal that would be greatly appreciated.Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better.

It’s my 7th day on 25mg and I still have pretty bad brain fog, dpdr and just feel tired. Should I go up to 50mg or stay on 25mg until the side effects pass? Ideally I’d just go up to 50mg and get the side effects over and done with but I have to go to work and uni and if going up to 50mg makes the brain fog worse then I don’t know how I’ll manage.TLDR: my health anxiety keeps trying to tell me that these are brand new symptoms that I’ve never felt before when I know that I felt the same way last time I went into an anxious spiral.So I suffer from health anxiety, which got really bad abt 5 months ago where I basically spent an entire month thinking I had brain cancer. During that time I physically felt the worst: headaches, dizzy, fatigue, really bad derealisation which also made me feel like there was something wrong with my vision (there wasn’t I went to the optometrist), I kept feeling like I was seeing flashes of light or that my vision would black out for a millisecond (it was probably me just blinking 🙄), numbness down one side of my body, tingling, muscle twitches and jerks, a weird pressure at the back of my head and for some reason and ache in my leg. These all disappeared gradually after I got a clear mri back.Recently I’ve gone into another anxious spiral, started with vertigo which I thought was caused by the propranolol I take for my headaches, so I stopped taking it, which caused me to think I’d given myself heart problems, then I thought I had ms. Went to the doctor and she prescribed me sertraline. I know it’s supposed to make anxiety worse before it makes it better but I’m spiraling thinking I’ve permanently altered my brain, or that I’m going crazy. The derealisation is back in a big way, so is the numbness, pressure in the back of my head, tingling, muscle twitching and jerks. Anyway it’s like my brain can’t seem to wrap it’s head around the fact that I’ve been through all this before, that it was just anxiety, and that it passed when the anxiety got better. I feel like this is some brand new experience that I’ll never recover from even though I’ve been through this before and did get through it. I keep thinking “this is the worst I’ve ever felt” when I know for a fact it isn’t.Best way I can describe it is that I feel like I’m high. I’ve heard that sertraline works for depression before it works for anxiety and that anxiety gets worse before it gets better and I think that’s exactly what’s happening to me. I simultaneously feel happier and more anxious, basically how I feel after smoking. The same kind of emotional roller coaster of “I feel fine this is great” to “what if I never feel sober again” to questioning my own existence and the meaning of life. The kind of feeling where you’re mostly ok but constantly worried that you’re teetering on the edge of loosing your mind. Also feeling like I’m in a dream/ seeing everything through virtual reality glasses, dpdr feeling. Anyway I’m trying to stay positive and look at it as just a free high but I hate feeling like this 24/7, especially considering I have to study and go to work. Anyone else felt the same? And when does it go away bc I have uni tests soon and im finding it hard to concentrate while I feel like this😭Note I’m on this for health anxiety and some mild derealisation which is likely just a side effect of the anxiety.Ok so I started 25mg of sertraline 3 days ago for anxiety and the past two days have been alright, but today my anxiety has been way worse. I’m also getting pretty bad derealisation. I’ve had mild derealisation often from anxiety, but this time it seems to come with depersonalisation? Like I’ll look at my hand and I feels like I’m looking at someone else’s hand, as tho there’s some disconnect between me feeling what my hand is doing and me seeing what my hand is doing. It’s also making my anxiety wayyyy worse and sometimes I worry I’m going crazy or will never be the same again (catastrophising I know😂). Anyway did any of you have a similar experience and how long did it take to get better?. So obviously not everything has to have a point but is there any reason Daenerys is called Daenerys stormborn/ was born during a storm other than it being a fun fact and cool sounding name? As far as I know there isn’t any recurring motif of storms during her story, it isn’t related to any prophecy, it doesn’t have any symbolism etc. It is also more symbolic of house Baratheon in the same way fire is symbolic of house targeryen, winter symbolic of stark and gold symbolic of Lannister, so it seems weird that her nickname sounds more like a Baratheon nickname than a targ one. Does anyone have any theories on why it was included? Do you think it will be relevant later in the story?. Basically I have had pretty bad health anxiety for the past 6 months. When I get into an anxious spiral of thinking I have something I always get physical symptoms too. At the moment I’m getting pretty bad vertigo/dizziness. Like I feel as tho I’m on a boat and everything is moving slightly, and just a generally unsteady feeling as tho the ground I’m on could fall away at any moment. I went to my doctor and my blood test is fine, had an mri a few months ago which was fine, and she said there was nothing wrong with my ears. She prescribed me sertraline and I took it for a few days then started getting really bad side effects so I went off it. Has anyone else experienced this? Did medication help? Should I just push through the side effects?. Ok so I starting Sertraline 4 days ago for health anxiety. It was fine for the first 4 days, some anxiety, clenched jaw and sore eyes (could be unrelated) as a side effect but nothing major. But last night I randomly remembered that suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self harm were also a possible side effect and I just had this thought of “what if that happens to me and I hurt myself ”, and then my next thought was “you just thought abt it so it is happening to you”. Anyway ever since last night I keep having these recurring thoughts of self harm and it’s scaring the shit out of me bc never in my life have I ever thought abt it and really don’t want to hurt myself. I didn’t take the medication this morning bc I was scared it was going to make me loose my mind or something. Im booked into see my doctor in 2 days.Anyway has this happened to anyone else? Did these intrusive thoughts go away? It might just be one of those things where I’m scared of thinking abt something so i can’t stop thinking abt it so was I overreacting to stop taking the meds? Is it just my health anxiety convincing me I have mental health problems this time the same way it convinces me I have physical health problems? Is it even thinking abt self harm or is it just like intrusive anxious thoughts considering I don’t actually want to self harm at all and even the thought of it gave me a panic attack.Edit: if this is just a short term side effect I’d be fine to wait it out but, and this is probably just my delusional anxiety brain speaking again, I’m scared these intrusive thoughts will never go away.Some ppl believe that Rhaegars actions were misunderstood and that once we find out the real story and the real intentions behind his actions he’s going to be a way more sympathetic character and we’re all going to view him as some tragic hero. But I genuinely can not think of any big reveal that would make me like rhaegar as a person. If it follows the same “they were actually in love” story the show does it just makes him look stupid, reckless and irresponsible. If they pull some “he heard a prophecy and he thought he had to have a child with Lyanna to save the world” it just makes him look stupid and slightly delusional. How he treated Elia was shitty in literally any context. Unless it’s revealed that the whole time he was possessed by the three eyed raven I don’t see myself liking him. But is there any situation you could see yourself liking rhaegar?. So the great council that favoured viserys over rhaenys setting the precedent that any male relative would be favoured over a daughter. However was this precedent broken when all the lords swore fealty to rhaenyra over daemon? Obviously many would’ve preferred a son over rhaenyra but aegon wasn’t alive at that point so it’s kinda irrelevant.The other question is would targeryen precedent even matter? For every single other house in Westeros (as far as I know) a daughter would come before an uncle, eg. Cersei inheriting over kevan. Would the Baratheons stick to their rules of inheritance or would they follow the targ inheritance rules bc it’s the iron throne?Edit: another question? Say Robert dies without naming either as his heir would stannis ever swear fealty to the daughter? I know he considered rhaenyra a usurper so does this mean he would see his own claim as stronger?. Ok so watching hotd made me think abt how differently we view rhaenyra, her bastards and Alicent vs how we view Cersei, her kids and Ned. The difference probably just comes down to joffery being horrible but my question is what if he wasn’t. What if he was the picture perfect child, someone who would likely become one of the best kings in history. Would we still view Ned as this paradigm of honour, truth and righteousness? Also what if Joffrey didn’t exist and it was tommen who took the throne after Robert died? How would that change how we view things?. Ok I’m confused abt what the point of the hairnet was. Wouldn’t it have been easier and less risky for whoever poisoned joffery to just keep the poison crystal in their pocket or something? I assume they didn’t search everyone at the door, and if it was ollena who got the crystal when she fixed Sansa’s hairnet she would have had to keep it in her pocket for a while anyway. Also if anyone saw her breaking a crystal off Sansa’s hairnet it could look a little suspicious, so why take the risk and go through the hassle? Am I missing something?. I cannot stand when I hear ppl (mainly dany and sometimes Jon Stan’s particularly the ones on tiktok and tumblr ) try to argue about who the main character is or who is the titular character. I swear these ppl actually read a different series. Why would grrm create 24 povs, and a ridiculous amount of plotlines if the story was about one person saving the world. Why are they trying to reduce every other character to a side character and every other plot to a subplot. Also when they try and say the title is about a character, the ice and/or fire isn’t a person, it’s a broad plotline, a theme, an opposing force, a recurring motif.Ok rant over 😂. I hear ppl saying “she was homeless she was starving” etc. but was there ever a point where her and viserys were actually living on the streets?Ps: I haven’t read adwd yet so don’t get mad at me for not knowing. So GRRM said in an interview somewhere that there was 3 general plot lines: the “ice” plot line which is the wall, the others, the nights watch, bran etc., the “fire” plot line which is essos, slavers bay, dany and the dragons, then the kingslanding politics and war of the 5 kings plot line. Which out of the three is your favourite?Personally I prefer the kingslanding wot5k plot, and the essos and wall ones kinda bore me sometimes. Is that just me or is that a popular opinion?. I’ve seen a lot of posts recently comparing Daenerys to other characters recently and I think a lot of the arguments are pretty stupid.Basically most of the arguments go something like “when **insert evil character** does evil thing it’s not mad but when dany does it it is. “To me it’s not abt the actual action that make dany mad, it’s that her actions don’t match her words and the person she sees herself as. She constantly refers to herself as a liberator, a breaker of chains. She claims she wants to “break the wheel” and stop the cycle of powerful families fighting over the throne at the expense of ordinary ppl (which was a little dumb in itself bc she was just another powerful family fighting for the throne but anyway). Her entire thing was that she was different, that she was nothing like the ruthless tyrants who came before her, and that she was going to build a new and better world. However she then started doing things that went against this. Yes forcing ppl to kneel or die isn’t unusual at all, joffery did it after the battle of the Blackwater, stannis did it to mance etc. But she was supposed to be different, and there’s nothing liberating abt being told to submit or die. Now that in itself doesn’t make her mad, not being a liberator isn’t a sign of madness. The issue was that she didn’t change her view of herself to match her actions. She was still convinced she was a liberator and that she was nothing like the previous rulers despite doing the same thing. The madness was the disconnect between her actions and how she viewed herself not the actions by themselves.Ppl don’t consider Tywin or Arya or whoever else she gets compared to mad, bc their view of themselves is accurate. Tywin is not deluding himself into thinking he’s some messiah who’s come to liberate ppl. If he was he would 100% be considered an absolute basket case.Personally I wasn’t a huge fan of her going “mad”, I think it would’ve been better to see her make a conscious rational decision to be more ruthless and ditch the whole “break the wheel” thing.Also rant: I find it so stupid when ppl say stuff like “no one hated Cersei when she blew up the sept” “no one hated Tywin when he wiped out the reynes” bc those are literally some of the most hated ppl in the entire series, anyone who does like them likes them as a character not as a person.Ok so this guy decides he wants to get rid of Cersei and marry his middle aged fat abusive brother to a 16yr old. He decides the best way to do this is to convince his brother that the 16yr old looks like his ex crush who died almost 2 decades ago. He then goes up to the brother of the dead girl and straight up asks “hey does this girl look like your dead sister?” And he’s doing all of this bc he wants to suck off the 16yr olds brother.Then his brother dies and he decided he wants to make himself king seemingly just for the lols bc he has absolutely no claim.I mean obviously I’m simplifying it a lot and probably got some parts wrong but damn that’s absolutely deranged behaviour.Does anyone have any theories on how jaqen h’ghar ended up a prisoner? How does a faceless man get captured, they’re supposed to be the best assassins in the world it would be almost impossible to catch one. Was it part of some greater plan?. Ned bringing him back to winterfell would’ve been a huge risk if he looked like a textbook targeryen so would he have taken the risk and made up some story abt the mother being from Lys or something or would he have found somewhere else for Jon to live?. Obviously bran became the most useless and boring character when he came back from beyond the wall but the most annoying part was that his storyline and character development could have been super interesting. The idea of a young boy who all of a sudden has access to literally all information in the entire world has so much potential. I would’ve loved to see him struggle to figure out what to do with all the info, what to tell and what to keep secret, what is useful and what is useless, what is possibly an abuse of his powers and where should he draw the line on what he can and can’t do, struggle to actually convince ppl that he isn’t just making this all up, and realising that knowledge is unless you know what to do with it. Showing him as a young boy who’s is completely overwhelmed by all this info would have been so much more interesting than whatever tf they turned him into. It also didn’t make sense because knowing things doesn’t necessarily make you wise, so why did he all of sudden become a genius.Obviously it was an incredibly messed up “relationship” as dany was basically sold to him as a minor and assaulted, and she seemed to have some sort of Stockholm syndrome from it as she mostly looked back on him in a positive light and cared for him. What I hated was that they never showed her looking back and realising how messed up it was, and what a shitty, abusive person he was. They do have her speak abt the experience negatively in s7 when she first meets Jon, but then go back on that by having her talk to Sansa abt how he was one of the 2 men she’s ever loved. Which was just weird and contradictory. Showing her looking back positively on the relationship undermines how traumatising and horrible it was, and going through something like that would still be negatively impacting her. It gave a similar vibe as sansa’s “I’m grateful for my trauma” shit which was gross.To Tywin, his golden child as king would be the dream, and he could be hand. So he’d probably consider Jaime getting off the throne as the missed opportunity of a lifetime.
    i’ve met a woman while walking my dog, and while our silly little dumbasses played together i asked her if she wanted a series recommendation. obviously, i told her about utopia AND SHE RECALLED IT FROM HER CULTUROLOGY COURSE AT UNIVERSITY. now instead of explaining to people that creators and actors are geniuses (while above mentioned people haven’t heard any of their names before) i can just drop the “it’s even in the culturology program” bomb lmao.i know it’s probably the dumbest idea ever but it’s 5am here and my brain stopped braining a couple hours ago, therefore you’re gonna have to deal with my shit.my answer to marry is pietre (looking forward to a trip to albania already) and to kill is geoff. the “fuck” one is a whole damn list (*typical reddit user moment*) but i think i should stick to jan just so i won’t get killed myself.i love moral philosophy and dumb analogies, so get creative (yes, that was a dhmis reference) in the comments and write how each character would use their moral compass and how does the compass itself function. i would love to read all kinds of different answers, so if you like to think about useless hypothetical things as much as i do, feel free to dump a whole essay in there :) i’ll start:becky: nothing wrong with hers, tries to follow it no matter what.jessica: overall works okay for her surroundings, but seems to start acting up near tall black guys.ian: works perfectly, but sometimes he forgets to look at it before choosing a direction.lee: doesn’t have one. randomly runs around to places he likes.pietre: looks like tools he and lee were carrying around had some magnetic shit inside, so the compass’ ability to work depends on how far away he stays from them.grant: was skipping school so sometimes confuses directions.alice: wasn’t skipping school. wilson: has a normally working one, but is often forced to go the wrong direction by the obstacles on his way. probably slowly gets desensitized to discomfort of feeling that he’s going somewhere awry.philip: his spins around frantically after what happened to him in the WW2. doesn’t know where to go and always ends up going the wrong way. milner: the needle shows the right direction, but north and south were switched on the dial. thinks that she goes where she needs to, but in reality it’s actually the opposite way.donaldson: his one only points to one direction and the direction is called “his own well-being”terry: he was told that only one direction exists. he will directly face any obstacle, even if it means jumping off a cliff. following one true direction is the most important thing in his life.geoff: he only looks at it if he wants to.letts: spent too much time around carvel’s magnetic equipment so now his compass is quite useless. dugdale: his one malfunctions sometimes and starts working again only if you smack it hard enough.probably a stupid one, but how does jessica keep finding the group at the most random locations possible?? for example, when they took grant and alice in the car. while she was left at alice’s house with pietre, everyone else found a random abandoned house and decided to stay in. what do we see next?? jessica showing up there with no one to give her clues on the location or coordinates. we know that she didn’t follow them because 1) they drove off way before she could even get a car.2) we see scenes where they stop in the open field, so it would be hard not to notice another car, and since everyone is paranoid about the network, she would have had to show herself.did she install a fucking air-tag on the car or smth?? it was never explained it the show, as i remember it, so someone please give me clues.EXCEPT FOR THE 🥄 ONE BECAUSE I CAN ALREADY SENSE YOUR ANSWERS. let’s just imagine that utopia’s events happened in real world for a second. just as a title says, i’m curious of what funny fake conspiracy theories this sub can come up with :)my take on the theme: since the network controls both healthcare AND the government in multiple countries, they have monopolized health insurance business and are preventing the government from providing a more efficient and affordable way to receive healthcare (works differently for different countries) because they need money for their whole “sterilizing the human race” project. not sure if it’s really possible for it to work this way irl, but a funny thing to think about.PLEASE STAY CIVIL AND DONT FORCE YOUR OPINIONS ON OTHERS PLEASE, THIS POST WAS MADE FOR SILLY FAKE THEORIES. for me it’s probably “fascinating child”. want to bawl my eyes out every time i listen to it.i can’t shut up about utopia, so today i was again trying to get my mates from an acting class to watch it. and that’s when i heard it. someone has watched american utopia and decided that it was good. i can’t put into words the amount of despair i’ve felt trying to explain why the show he watched sucks ass. 😭. i have a pretty funny (and fucking long, how it turned out to be in text) story about it, so here’s popcorn for everyone 🍿 🍿 🍿. i will leave a tldr at the end, because i, for the love of everything saint, can’t force myself not to flex my (quite terrible in fact, because english is not my first language) standup and writing skills when i was 13, my dad got a subscription to hbo max, and by some miracle found this masterpiece of a show. of course, his go-to action for starting to watch any blood-cooling piece of film was to let his barely-teenage daughter sit in the same room and stare at the dude getting his eye poked out with a spoon. my reaction to that information though, didn’t really fit into the norm of a normal 13 year old watching a torture scene (my genius ass decided i wanted to be like lee when i grew up, something was definitely fucking wrong with me even then💀), so i pretty quickly got banned from sitting in the same room when my dad got utopia on. nevertheless, the soundtrack got carved into my brain with the same success as a rabbit symbol on wilson’s stomach, so around the same time i have noticed that melanie martinez’s song “carousel” had a similar instrument playing in the background (the one making an ominous “toom” sound, i have no idea what it is and how to describe it with any adequacy). fast forward to me being 17, i decide to smoke some weed (because that’s a perfectly reasonable idea for someone who’s already highly addicted to alcohol, which will be an important information later), and put my music on shuffle. the abovementioned “carousel” song started playing, and my mind instantly switched to the soundtrack of a tv show that i haven’t even seen yet (except for those one or two episodes when i was 13). one thing led to another, and i have, to my amazement, discovered that utopia’s soundtrack is a heaven for ears when u hit a bong. funnily, that fact still wasn’t enough to make me watch the actual show, so i just kept listening to the soundtrack and ignoring the fact that if the music is that good, maaaaybe i should check out where it came from. now, remember the abovementioned alcohol addiction?? i ended up in rehab. with the stupidest fucking people to ever walk this earth. with nothing to do & no one to talk to, i started wondering if i should watch some tv shows to pass the time, and that’s when it hit me. utopia. honestly, those few days i’ve spent watching it were not only the best time i’ve had in that hell of a place, but also that i’ve had in like… a couple of years. sometimes i wonder if this show was the thing to make me feel enough emotions, both positive and negative, to make me finally snap out of my depression and seek other ways to make my brain go brrr :)TLDR: i saw a first episode when i was 13, but my parents decided that it’s not okay for a kid my age to have dreams about becoming a torture master in the future (i was a weird ass kid), so i was prohibited from watching it further. at 17 realized, that the soundtrack sounds awesome on weed, which led me to actually remembering the show and watching it. best thing to happen to me in a couple of years, probably also was a finishing jigsaw piece to stop me from clinging to my depression and actually start living a fucking life 👍edit: forgot to mention that utopia has inspired me to not give up on my dream of becoming an actress, so yeah, it’s literally one of the most valuable experiences in my life lmao. TLDR: якщо знаєте нормального психіатра, напишіть будь-ласкане знаю, куди ще звернутися. раніше лікувалась в латвії, але наразі повернулась додому. підозрюю, що мені потрібно підвищити дозу антидепресантів, бо про це говорив мій лікар в латвії, але самостійно робити це боюся, адже є мільярд речей, які можуть піти не так. наразі єдиний психіатр, якого я знаю в києві - завідуюча підліткового відділення в павлівці, поліна юріївна, і як би вам так це сказати, вона і професійність - це дві дуже різні речі. якщо хтось знає більш адекватні альтернативи, прошу про це написати, адже мої працездібність та бажання жити з кожним днем все менше й менше 🥲🥲. knowing that the show itself is about conspiracies, i’m actually pretty interested if anyone found anything that could probably be decifered, hidden in barely a couple of frames, coded into the interactive web campaign for season two and overall hard to notice if you’re not looking for it. in my opinion, most of Lee’s scenes are peak black humor.
    But if you did: I meant every word I said in it.I’m not going to lie and say I’m not hurt by your lack of acknowledgment, but I knew deep down you didn’t care anywhere near as much as you made yourself out to. I was hurt but not surprised. And my life is still ruined, just so you know. It always will be after what happened to me. You’ve most likely forgotten all about me but I’ll never be able to forget you after what you did to me and left me with. I hate that. Your goal the entire time was to control me and keep me under your control, and now you’ll always have a hold on me.Perhaps one day you’ll become a father and only then will you begin to fathom the affects of what happened to me. I hope the first moments you spend with your first born remind you of me. I hope you’ll imagine your beautiful baby growing older only to have someone treat them the way you treated me. I hope you’ll understand a mother’s love, heartache and longing. I hope you’ll understand the weight of all the hurt you caused me. I hope you’ll understand then.Or made changes to your appearance and then showed/told the person who suggested the change(s)?If so, how did it go?. I’ve also taken inspiration from some of you who have previously commented songs that remind you of your TF 😊https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4cprlnO8ibDWEt8dpLbXcj?si=8QOTtSsATwyaji_KdgwIzAPlease comment any songs you’d like added ❤️. I love being pretty. I may have body dysmorphia and think I’m “ugly and hideous”, but deep down I know I’m fucking gorgeous (and also really complex and smart). It’s one of the things that keep me from falling a part. When shit hits the fan? At least I’m pretty. Someone hurt me? At least I’m pretty. Someone’s better at me than something? At least I’m pretty.I don’t care if bitches don’t like me. I’m prettier than most of them and have a much better life anyway. My parents are rich, I’m smart, I’m pretty, I’m funny, I’m well traveled, I’m generous and kind, I’m loyal, I have a good heart despite my huge fucking ego, my parents love me and will never disown or not love me no matter what, I have amazing siblings who love me no matter what, and I’m always rejecting people and never being rejected. When I list the pros and cons of who I am, I’m reminded that I am definitely on the better end of the spectrum.Down vote all you want idc I’m pretty and you’re mad <3. It was such a short and seemingly insignificant moment but I’ll never forget it. It happened only a few months ago, in July or august I think? It was raining and it was fucking dreadful. I was waiting for the train under the sheltered seating area but the wind was blowing the rain into it. I stood directly behind the wall so it wouldn’t reach me. The train approached and everyone stepped out in preparation to get on the train and I waited behind a little as I didn’t have an umbrella and my coat didn’t have a hood of any sorts. I waited behind everyone while they entered the train and a man holding an umbrella moved closer to me and smiled at me, before extending his arm out so his umbrella provided me with shelter. I stepped closer to him so it would cover us both and thanked him before boarding the train. He waited behind me as I boarded and extended his arm out so the umbrella would cover me while he waited to board, leaving himself exposed to the rain. That was it.It was such a small gesture but it stood out a lot to me. He was a complete stranger and showed such a simple yet kind act of generosity.He was a gentleman. I’ve always wanted someone like that, and my entire dating life I’ve been wasting time on men who don’t have the natural inkling of how to treat a woman. They’re so self serving and they never cherish me until it’s too late. I hate that I’ve even given these people access to me when I could do so much better. A gentleman never has to be asked or begged or taught how to treat a woman. They just know. I deserve to have that.It’s weird, I don’t think I’m “heart broken” but rather just broken and tired. I have no desire to put myself back together again. I give up. Or am I just really unwell? 😅. I’ve always had such an issue with thinking I’m unattractive and unworthy (I’m talking since the day I had thoughts). But after being cheated on and mistreated I’ve hated the way I look so much more. I swear I’m seeing even more things wrong with the way I look.Call me insane but I even made an appointment with a plastic surgeon and dropped over a thousand dollars on a deposit. I didn’t go through with the surgery because I knew deep down it wouldn’t fix my problems. It’s like every time I’m mistreated I just find more things wrong with the way that I look and hate myself even more. Just when I think it can’t get worse, it does. Anyone else?. I don’t know what’s happened to my brain.I feel sad when I think about how I was extremely brainy just a few years ago and now I can barely function like an adult and properly study. My declining intellect aligns with my declining mental health. I don’t think it’s a coincidence.So my question is, will improving my mental health recover my intellectual ability?. You always insisted you were different and for a while you had me fooled. Turns out you were the same and lied right to my face about it every time.Intention doesn’t change the fact that you lied and hurt me. You ended up being the exact person I thought you were. Well no, worse actually.The way you lied and hurt me only confuse me. Here I am empathising with you because you “didn’t have bad intentions”, and feeling like I’m at fault for not seeing past that earlier. How could I have though? I was blinded and paralysed by all the pain.I barely feel like I have permission to acknowledge the facts. The facts are that you lied to me despite hearing all my pain and promising to me that you’d never do the same. You hurt me; and moved right on with your life straight after like it was nothing. Even after I carried your baby all on my own. As if that was easy.So as usual, I’m left behind in the past. Totally forgotten.I was right about you the entire time.And yet I see past that and still forgive you. Why must I always be the fool?. I was born with a fragile heart and all I’ve ever known is heartbreak. Everyone I ever dared to trust with my heart broke it; even my own parents.It’s no wonder I keep willingly walking into heartbreak. I just crave the familiarity in a world full of strangeness.I have no one to blame but myself.Wondering what made you guys realise someone was your twin flame, or anything that acted as confirmation for you. I sometimes wonder if I’m crazy for believing in it.I’m in a few skincare related subreddits but I can’t find any specific place to post my products and get advice of what can be used together etc, as well as which order, tips, and what to add to target another skin concern.Logically I know that’s not true, and the problem is the other person(s). But it literally means nothing to me as I seriously cannot shake the belief that it’s all my fault and that if I weren’t so ugly and flawed then they would treat me right and not leave me.I hate being ugly. So much. It literally ruins my life.I’m convinced I’m going to die alone because I can’t ever trust people and my bdd (amongst other things) makes it impossible to ever believe that I’m desirable and worthy. How are you guys even in relationships?I feel like nobody ever wants me, and if they do then it’s for all the wrong reasons or they get to know the real me and decide they don’t want me anymore. Either that or my bdd ruins everything lol. Or I truly am just THAT ugly.I don’t know how to not let someone calling me “pretty” or “beautiful” turn into a super awkward moment. I always get uncomfortable and upset, or I accept it but tell them that I don’t agree. Either way, it’s awkward.I just feel like a fraud and that I have to try tell people who I really am. Ugly. I am ugly inside and out, and I will never be beautiful.How do I stop getting so upset, annoyed, mad etc whenever people compliment the way I look? Especially when they are completely blind to my physical flaws even when I blatantly point them out?Everyone just brushes me off in a pitiful tone and suggests I have body dysmorphia. I’m not disagreeing either, but I’m confused on how to manage it and the feelings that come with it.:). Even towards those who tried so hard to hurt me and ruin my life; I forgive you and I give you all my love and hope. I hope you forgive yourself and are able to give the same love and hope I have for you to yourself, because that’s who you really need it from.Does that make sense?. I know this sort of goes against what this subreddit is about, but hear me out! I'm so sick and tired of trying to be the bigger person and doing what's right at the sake of my own sanity and wellbeing. Sometimes (not always) I just want to be selfish and put my own needs first. Sometimes I don't want to be compassionate and end up feeling like boo boo the fool when the other party inevitably throws it back in my face.It gets tiring trying to do the right thing and look out for others. How can I even properly be the best version of myself when all I do is try to do what's right for others, and not me?&#x200B;I want to start looking out for ME. Who else is going to?. Those thoughts have come up a lot, but I don’t ever honour them and I just do my best to move on and not give the thoughts any attention. Any of you also have those thoughts regarding anorexia and other forms of self harm?. I sold run & gun years ago, and I wish I hadn’t because it’s supposedly extremely hard to come by now.Sigh. Why did I do that?.
    I blocked him on everything and have been NC for almost 2 weeks now. I have not been looking at pictures and I only have checked to see if he still had me blocked too on Instagram once. I have been talking it out with friends and journaling because I feel like I need to get it out! I’m also in group and individual therapy and am working on anxiety tools and somatic experiencing for anxiety/trauma release.My thoughts are still consumed by him anytime I’m not actively engaged in something like work where my brain is being totally occupied. What more could I be doing and what should I stop doing? Please help!. Mine had a serious mommy kink. Wanted to call me mommy in bed and be praised, dominated, and coddled by me. Had a breastfeeding fetish. I know for some this can be just a sexual thing but for him it seemed… deeper than that. He would cry (literally sob) about wanting to make his parents proud and talked about being jealous of his sister because she was the golden child and his parents thought she was perfect. He told me once he remembered seeing his mom naked as a kid - he said it so randomly. And when we spent time together he would often say he had to go when he told his mom he would be home for dinner (still lived at home and even after moving away when he’d come back to visit he would always go home for mom’s dinner).Our relationship derailed when I found out about all the cheating. It created a toxic dynamic where I was trying to control him all the time because I couldn’t trust him. And he would push back and fight me for freedom while still lying to me and not telling me things because he never stop trying to do what he wanted to do. It essentially created the dynamic he had with his mom, controlling and overbearing, and he *hated* me like I think he deep down hates her. But he has to respect his mom but he was allowed to treat me horribly. It felt like so much of his anger from his childhood at his mom was taken out on me.. That’s all really. My nex was my best friend. I just feel so lonely. It’s a week since final discard and I’ve been leaning on friends but they can only do so much ya know they have their own lives and shit to deal with. I’m working on tolerating being alone and trying to enjoy my own company. I know this is key to healing my disorganized attachment. Wow it’s just hard. I wanna start dating just so I can have some intimacy and companionship but I know that’s not healthy. And then I think of maybe just having sex with someone but I know that’s not healthy either. Just hoping there are people out there who can tell me these feelings are normal and they will pass?. I went to float for the first time (loved it!) and afterwards thought I’d pop into the store to get a lemon real quick because it’s all I needed to make something at home for dinner. I’m walking through the store feeling so relaxed for the first time in weeks (traumatic break up from a cheating narc) and then I hear a man yelling “hey miss!” He can’t be talking to me. He yells again. Then I see the movement out of the corner of my eye as he’s getting closer “hey miss!” And I think oh maybe I’ve dropped something so I turn “hey miss I just *had* to ask, what is the M on your shirt for, Mizzou or Michigan???”This set me on edge and ruined the peace I had found, putting me instantly on high alert. I left the store checking over my shoulder to make sure he wasn’t following me to my car.Why do men think it’s ok to yell and approach us like this!?. I have been out of the relationship for 2 years. I ended things and he tried to Hoover and regain control and I blocked him. He found a new supply and is still with her. We have mutual friends still (they are aware he is a narc or at least abusive) and I will be attending a Halloween part at a friends house. I’ll be getting there early. Idk if he knows I’m coming.Since he has a new supply I will be fine and safe at the party right?It’s a small house party and we typically just play board games, there’s music, and food and some booze. It’s nothing wild we are all in our 30s.I’ve been reading about both and see how he could be a sociopath. Anyone else?. Therapist recommended floating so I’m giving it a try this week. After I booked my session I was reading on the website about preparation/what to expect and it mentioned that it may burn women’s vaginas? It may be so uncomfortable you can’t complete your float session and can reschedule.Has anyone experienced this? I have sensitive skin and a sensitive vagina. I was really looking forward to my session and now I’m a little nervous about this especially being at the end of my cycle. Did you ever feel like your nex was sitting in front of you but they just weren’t “there”? And when you’d comment on the emotional distance or that they weren’t really engaged in the conversation or *showing up* to the relationship they would say “what are you talking about I’m right here?”. He always had to be doing something. He was always on a schedule and a time crunch.It seemed like he had a limit on lounging and if we did it too long he started to get irritated and going over his mental to do list.Being alone is so fucking painful after the discard. It’s like a feeling of fear? panic? inside me that’s unbearable.I get flooded with thoughts. I guess it’s the calm.Mine didn’t name call, ridicule, or belittle me really. I see a lot of posts saying their nexes did this and it’s making me question mine. Was he not really a narc if he wasn’t insulting me all the time?. Anyone else feel like this thing is completely inaccurate and doesn’t reflect the reality of the western world? I set it to age 30-45, not married, not obese, any race, 5’10, and $55k. Seems pretty average in terms of the population and it still gave me alike a 2% chance of meeting a guy like this.Makes no sense.Is there any way to predict whether or not the nex is going to hoover you after they discard you?. I asked him to help we pick where we should go. I gave him a month and never got an answer so I picked the place.I asked him to help me plan. I gave him another two weeks and again never got any feedback so had to make all of the decisions myself.I asked him to plan one thing he wanted to do with me on the trip that was going to be a surprise. Just plan one thing. He never did and claimed he forgot. You forgot.. the ONE thing I was willing to settle for and he couldn’t even do that.And let me tell you guys I planned a phenomenal trip! It was beautiful, it was fun, it was an adventure, and the food was delicious. The perfect get away that I look back on so fondly! When I look back I forget he was even there for the fun parts honestly. Like his presence doesn’t make an impact. I was so excited about everything the whole trip and he was just there, along for the ride. I remember him asking if he could have some time to play video games a lot. We had sex one time and I don’t remember the details but I remember little to no foreplay and not cumming.I snooped his bags and found a condom in his gym bag. The brand we bought and specifically kept at my place because we could never have sex at his place (lived with his parents at the time). The one time we were able to have sex at his I brought over 5 condoms and left them there in case we had other opportunities.When I questioned him about it he said he put in in there in case we ever needed it. I asked when we would ever have needed it and not had access to the ones at our places and he fumbled around repeating himself “just in case we’d ever need it”. This was after I caught him cheating with countless people including a long term affair partner… Two months after.He should have been putting in so much effort to make this trip feel special for me and show how much he cared but, as usual, I was the one doing all the work. I understood he was going away to school afterwards and had a lot to plan for which was why I kept giving him grace for not contributing. But, in two months, to have contributed NOTHING other than showing up.And on the last day of the trip he turns to me in bed with his *sad little puppy face* and says “I didn’t end up helping with any of this or planning a surprise for you I’m sorry” in complete shock and remorse. Equivalent to going to the store and forgetting to buy milk. And like the gullible idiot I was at the time I reassured him “yeah I know you had a lot going on with school so I just focused on making the trip special for you and stress free as possible before you start school”. Afterwards, I am snooping his phone (open policy) and he told his friend where he (not we) went and his friend made a snarky comment about it asking “why *there*”? And his response was that “it was cheap”. That’s all. And when I asked him about the trip later and didn’t he have a good time and feel like it was a bonding experience for us he was just like “idk we were in a weird place at that time I didn’t really think of it as like a nice vacation we were taking together and we had a big fight one of the nights (me getting upset about the cheating and needing reassurance) and you couldn’t even sleep afterwards.” That’s what they do. The see the negatives, they are entitled, they are ungrateful. It feels like a perfect representation of how the relationship goes with a narc. They sell you on a fantasy of what could be, you expect them to function as an equal partner, you end up downsizing your expectations until you’re settling for breadcrumbs, you try to pick up the slack and exhaust yourself doing the emotional labor of two people, you try to make the best of it and make excuses for their behavior but it’s still not enough to make them happy, and when they look back on it they devalue the whole experience.Fuck you nex.That blank stare. No emotion in that face. Nothing going on behind those eyes. Even thinking of them now causes a visceral reaction for me. The worst is when you’re emotional and look up and they’ve stopped trying to mirror your emotions and provide empathy. They are showing nothing and you can see, sense, the black void inside, nearly feeling its pull.*shudder*. I see a lot of struggles on here with trying to escape the narc who you can’t get away from and they hoover and keep coming back trying to regain your supply.What about those of us who were discarded because they found a new supply or decided we weren’t the supply they wanted anymore. How do you deal with these feelings? I feel like our side of the spectrum is harder/worse as I’ve been on the other side and honestly there was something about the validation of them trying to come back around and having to block them that made it easier for me. Escaping for me was nothing compared to this feeling of just being left out on the curb 😞. I am dealing with a lot of guilt for subjecting my mind and body to the torment my nex put me through. Blaming myself and feeling so stupid. And hating myself for still loving this person who isn’t even real! I know it’s not my fault logically. How do I start to forgive myself?. I was discarded 2 days ago. We were together for a year and he was cheating on me the entire time with one long term sexual partner and countless other sexual flings. I feel he used me as his “cover” to present to the public while he was free to pursue his taboo sexual desires with other men and women he was meeting online and on apps. He’s a med student so I think he needed someone to help him look “normal” and I filled that role. A part of me still believes he did really love me but people who love you don’t cheat on you repeatedly. Maybe he loved me as much as he was capable of and maybe the cheating came from his fear of abandonment/being unlovable but I know that’s still not enough or an excuse for his actions. After I discovered the cheating he wanted to stay and try to make it work. My stipulation was that he sought therapy for his sex addiction. It was 5 months of hell and then he broke up with me saying he needed the space to work on himself and heal but that he would want another chance at our relationship in the future but it wasn’t fair to ask me to wait for him.Things evolved over the next 1.5 months with him changing his story over time and citing it was because he was healing in therapy. I said I felt like I was just slowly losing him. And then I was finally discarded. He said he is still in therapy working on himself and I am overcome with anguish thinking about him getting better and being a healthy, wonderful partner for someone else. He is using his student health free counseling services for therapy and goes once every 2 weeks because that’s as frequent as they let you have appointments. One of the last things he said to me while I was crying on his shoulder saying I loved him and didn’t want this was “I think it’s going to be okay.” And left shortly after.I feel completely empty. And thinking of him out there healing and being happy makes me sick.I’ve been having horrible anxiety with major life stressors and work 12 hour shifts as a nurse. I can’t sleep more than 3 hours and it’s compromising my ability to care for patients or work at all I’m having to call in today. Will urgent care give me something that would help me sleep or would they make me see a specialist for that?. A year of cheating on me. 5 months of convincing me he wanted only me and we could make this work. Ended the relationship with me. 1.5 months of hovering saying he needed to work on himself and wanted to be with me. Finally discarded while claiming he still loved me and wanted to be with me. So much mental abuse in such a short amount of time.I was doing fine after I asked him for NC and then two weeks in he messages asking if he can send me a birthday present and we end up meeting in person only for him to tell me he doesn’t think we are ever going to work and he doesn’t want contact with me. Still loves me and wants to be with me he just thinks the relationship isn’t right and not what he needs. Then why did you even reach out why didn’t you just let me go???What the actual fuck.They’re so bloody good at lying. Even more girls coming out of the wood work today that he fucked around with. I always knew there were more. I’m a combination cluster b but I would never do this to another human being. The spectrum is truly wild and I just hope I can heal from this even though I’ll never be able to make sense of it. We’ve been in a grey area for 1.5 months and today he told me he knows we will not work outI feel so empty and numbHe cheated on me the entire relationship and jerked me back and forth through the last 1.5 months so I guess at least I’m glad that’s finally overIt feels like he kept me around until he decided if he wanted to be with me or not and once he decided he didn't he threw me away I tried everything I could to be what he wanted and I guess at the end of the day it just wasn’t meNot really feeling like anyone is ever going to love me so not sure what reason I have for going on in life at this pointSorry this is so pathetic I guess I just am pathetic right now.

The devastation makes me feel better about how alone and empty I am.I’ve only done it a handful of times over the years but it’s where I am tonight so let the good times roll!. I look at pictures of myself as a baby, young girl but I don’t recognize that child as myself.Like I have some faint memories but it’s like I know they as more of a “story” I know than a true memory of it happening, particularly the traumatic parts.Does this sound familiar to anyone else?. Like I want a grown man as a partner who knows how to do life. Has a job, has a place, knows how to cook/clean/take care of himself, knows how to communicate openly with emotional intelligence and vulnerability. Basically an equal, mature partnership. I also want to be his mommy in the bedroom and for that to be the place I get to dominate and take care of him. I don’t think it’s cute when men need an actual parent because they can’t function and need to be taught how to be in a relationship. That’s not attractive to me. It’s a sexual kink for me not a life kink. Am I in the minority here?. I am working on identifying my feelings with my therapist because apparently I live in my head and I’m not in touch with my actual feelings. I’ve always thought my thoughts *were* my feelings but it turns out they are different things.And I’m just deeply, deeply sad. It’s taken me like 12 hours to identify this is how my body and heart is feeling. And I feel it in my chest, specially my sternum. I have no one to talk to so just wanted to post here.I am fresh out of a soul crushing break up and feeling truly awful about being alone. I’m in therapy working on this and trying to heal the parts of myself that are still wounded from an awful childhood. I know I’m doing what’s best for myself but every night when I come home alone to the quiet, the void, I think “I wish I had someone”.Last night, I went out to dinner with my parents and the couple at the next table was obviously fighting. There was no hiding it. They were arguing about how the girl felt the guy was not showing her any empathy towards the way she was feeling. She cried twice. He was apologetic but there was still very little emotion there for him and he seemed more focused on making her laugh and forget how she was feeling. It was truly a horrible thing to sit by and watch. This girl was a young, beautiful, passionate, and emotionally available woman. She could have the world at her disposal and she’s wasting her tears on this boy. I saw this situation as a reflection of how many toxic relationships I’ve been in and tried to convince myself it would get better, I could change him, we could make it work, I know he’s a good guy deep down, I was asking for/expecting too much, etc.It was the first time I realized I would much rather be going home alone than going home with someone who makes me cry.This is a big shift from my last post which got a bigger response than I was expecting and figured this might be a nice update and show of support for all the people who were feeling the same way I was.I’m single, never married, childfree.I do want a relationship. I want love.I hate that society has conditioned me to think that my chance for this to happen is essentially over because I’m not in my 20s anymore. I hate feeling like I missed the boat.Logically, rationally I know this isn’t true but damnit the social conditioning monster is so fucking hard to tame! Especially when it’s continuously reinforced by everything in the media. Ugh!. I’ve always wanted to try it. Any good places in our city?. I thought it had been like 6 weeks since I quit. It’s been 4. And only 2 since I had one small lapse in a social situation.What the fuckkkkk. And you get the useless 20 cosmo petals. Has happened twice in a row now 😤And now I have to plant a bunch of Gentians when I only have 30 petals and no idea how to get more nectar so I guess the event is over for me 🥲. I’m realizing in therapy that my mom was never there for me. She had me and then left me with my grandparents to raise. When she met my stepdad she moved me states away from my family to follow him for work. He was a violent and angry man. My earliest memories of him are him beating me with a belt. Throwing and breaking things. So much yelling. When they divorced my mom dated a lot of men and brought them into my life without my permission or desire. She treated them better than me. She was gone a lot when I was growing up. I remember being home alone while she was out on dates. I guess I preferred that to her bringing them home where I could hear them fuck. She treated her boyfriends kids better than me too. Giving them room in our house to stay, letting them take my toys, buying them things on top of that. She bought one guy an SUV. When I turned 16 she got me a sedan that could barely run and released carbon monoxide into the cabin. I didn’t even realize how abusive she was until the last couple months. She’s all that I had so I guess I needed her and didn’t know any differently. I just kept waiting for her to take care of me. She has mentally and emotionally abused me her entire life. Making me her identity, entertainment, competition, responsible for her emotions. At times she got violent too hitting and kicking me.I saved up all my money from babysitting, birthdays, christmases for years. She sent me on a trip for school and when I got back she had cleaned out my bank account. It wasn’t much, $700 but it was everything I had. I asked her why she did it and she simply said she needed it. Anytime I have brought up that I was mistreated in some way by her growing up she starts to meltdown saying “I can’t! I can’t go back 20, 30 years I just can’t!”She wants to pretend none of it ever happened but she is still just as nasty now as she was then. In the past year alone being emotionally abusive and hitting me in the stomach for making a lighthearted joke in front of my boyfriend at the time. She said she was “just joking too!”I HATE HER!I am in therapy to work through this. I’m close to getting my car in my name and my finances in order and when I do I’m leaving and never coming back.My mom used to do this with slippers a lot as a kid. Idk why these specifically. She would give them to me (often for Christmas) and I’d wear them for a little bit then she would take them and start wearing them herself. When I’d ask about them she’d always have some reason or excuse I honestly don’t remember what she’d say at this point. Probably something about me having other pairs (I like slippers a lot). She would buy food that was special for me at the store. I’d go to get some and most if not all of it would be eaten.She did this even recently with the food while I’m staying at her house and I’m 33 now.I texted him late and he shares his location with me so I saw he was still awake. But then an hour later I saw he phone started charging and that always meant he was going to sleep. So he didn’t respond to me text. I wanted no contact but he broke it by texting me a week ago saying he needed to reach out and said he wanted to send me something for my bday. We ended up agreeing to see each other next week when he’s in town. I was doing ok before he broke NC but now I haven’t been able to stop analyzing the things he said. That I was constantly on his mind but couldn’t be what either of us needed right now. He said he’s putting in the work to fix himself.He put me through hell but I know I put him through it too. I love him so much. Not talking has become unbearable so I reached out saying I wanted contact.He didn’t respond. I’m losing my fucking mind. I know it’s late and he could respond tomorrow but I’m so crazy.I went downstairs in my parents house to look through a box of stuff my grandma kept. It was really hard looking at pictures of me as a baby - before any memories and seeing how innocent I was and how if I had been properly cared for my life would be so much different now.It was hard looking at pictures of me growing up - as memories of trauma were forming and knowing how I felt at the time and the things I was doing to cope, to *survive*, that I’ve never spoken of.I guess those are the things I need to bring up in therapy now, huh? My shadow self. The part of me I’ve always rejected and never loved and believed made me unlovable by others. Looking at those pictures I realized how disconnected I am from myself. Like I could not look at that little face and wrap my brain around “that’s *me*”.When I tell you I sobbed you guys.She didn’t ask for or deserve any of what happened to her. What happened to *me*. But I’m 33 now and I make my own money and I’m in control of my life and everything that happens to me now is my decision. I choose a better life for her. For *me*.I’m having a moment of vulnerability and I just wanted to tell everyone here I know we all have different stories and the world wants to paint us as monsters but we are all still that innocent kid who deserves love, understanding, and healing. I wish it for all of us. That’s all.I went downstairs in my parents house to look through a box of stuff my grandma kept.

My friends wanted to play house and pretend to be moms and I was like this is fucking gross.I hate their baby voices, I hate that they don’t know anything and need to be catered to at all times because they can’t do anything for themselves, I hate how much attention they need, I hate how messy they are, I hate how loud they are, I hate how expensive they are.Like I genuinely hate everything about them.I hate how much people seem to love and coo over them. “Precious innocent angels”. Like, do you not remember all the bad shit you did as a kid knowing full and well it was bad and you were going to get in trouble but still could ultimately get away with it. They fucking suck. Even parents are miserable, they have their entire lives taken away from them, and then they have more kids thinking that’ll make it better, and then they try to pressure others into having kids because misery loves company. I see so many adults that use children to validate their own existence, using them as an extension and representation of themselves, and it’s disgusting. Idk if anyone else feels this way.Like even when I was a kid it was instant hatred of younger kids.

They’ve given me a lot to think about and have prompted some deep introspection. I’m really glad I posted this!.
    And turns out she going to a diff party and didn’t invite me. I want to find out where it is bad and crash. She prob not my friend no more after I went after her weakest points over fb messenger for 4 hours until she said she won’t even enjoy the party now and is dreading going and only then did I let it go and started giving her the silent treatment. I want to find the party bad and show up and make friends with everyone and watch her see me steal her other friends. How dare she. I fucking hate her ass. Dirt under my shoe bitch. I know she’ll be miserable and was crying so I feel better. All my friendships end with these rage episodes then I gotta find new one. Either love me or fear me, no in between option honey. She learned her lesson.This subreddit used to be better than r/npd and now it’s cesspool of CRAP. I’m so pissed cuz I used to get so much value here from discussions about narcissism and npd but ever since that Reddit blackout the mods here have been babies and let the subreddit go to crap. Even the automod is a little bitch now. Can’t believe I have to devalue what was once a SAFE AND INTERESTING SPACE. Someone should take over this subreddit and make it back into what we DESERVE. High quality only. I’m tired of the useless waste of time sob stories that aren’t related to npd. And tired of non npds posting and commenting. Gtfo of our space. Mods need to fix this place up or give it the fuck up to people who actually care ughuggygg so annoying. Most of these people make comments and posts that a lot us with actual NPD diagnosis can’t relate to their experience but they insist they have npd. When we share how our experience with npd actually goes they can’t relate either. Are they just too dumb to realize it’s likely not npd they are dealing with? For example I saw a post on r/narcissism where someone finally got adhd medications and it stopped their narcissistic behavior, such as a rage. Well duh!!! They obviously weren’t dealing with npd at all and it was just adhd symptoms. I’m not saying all npd experiences is universal, but there are definitely similarities and a lot of posts by these undiagnosed and self diagnosed people are dragging down our safe space.Let’s come up with small ways we can start working on our entitlement!For example, I have a lot of entitlement in regards to food and expectations around food. This is exacerbated by my eating disorder. I’ve sent food back so many times for such “minor” (to normies) issues, thrown food when it doesn’t meet my standards and gotten banned from restaurants for cussing out the staff etc.These days I cook way more and am able to deliver the standards I want for myself. When I go out to eat I have a rule now not to send it back more than once, and if I feel a need to then ask for a to go container so my partner can eat it and not waste money. (Thanks therapy for helping me get here.)What are some examples of your entitlement issues and how can or how do you challenge it?. Long time lurker who finally had the nerve to create a private npd account heh. Hi.Since childhood I have only accepted that people love me or fear me. My family and school environment was abusive and i turned it around and became the bully and abuser. This behavior goes back to childhood, starting around age 8/9. It's cringe, but I was the Regina George of my elementary and middle school until we had to move and I struggled to start anew as the popular girl. This started a series of cycles where I would build up large groups of friends and communities only to sabotage them at the first hint of them criticizing or questioning me. I would nuke the bridges instead of burn them, move and start again. Now i am in my 30s with only a few friends left that I have to fake everything around because they are such normies. I have no idea where to go from here. Starting a new social group seems futile. Should I just work on maintaining the friendships I do have since i know they love me already? Why isn;t it good enough though? Why can't i tolerate anything between love and fear/hate? Anyone relate and have insight? I am diagnosed NPD/ASPD and have been in therapy for 7 years without much help if that matters (I live kinda in the country and we dont have very good therapists around here unfortunately, it is is what it is.Also I feel so naked and vulnerable posting here for the first time. Be nice please 🥺.
    Is this an NPD trait? I am extremely passive aggressive, partially because if i let my true emotions come out when I'm angry, things will escalate so hard that the damage will be irreversible. Immediately after moments when things get heated and I control my anger, I fantasise about hurting people. Sometimes it feels like I just need a hard enough push and I will snap someone's neck in a heated argument. I actually have gotten close to that in the past. I can feel my eyes turning black and losing any regard I have for the value of human life (which I don't have much of to begin with). I feel a very strong urge to maim or even slowly kill someone. It's gets so intense that I have to remove myself from that situation without even saying an acceptable amount of words back to the person and somehow calm myself down. Because, from previous experience, if i stay and continue, things get really crazy.Is it common in self aware npd's to be almost happy about their diagnosis? I weirdly feel proud of it but at the same time I am aware of the fact that this is considered a bad thing (it's literally a disorder).
    Hi. Ich W (33) möchte mich doch mal vorstellen. Vor allen würden mich aber Erfahrungen interessieren, denn ja irgendwie komme ich nicht mit den Dingen klar die geschehen sind. Irgendwie fühle ich mich alleine und sitzen gelassen und immer noch völlig inkompatibel in der "Welt" zu leben. Es belastet mich nach wie vor enorm. Ich hatte fest vor dieses Kapitel abzuschließen, mir zu sagen dass ich das Leben gewählt habe und es im Grunde auch nie etwas zu verlieren gab.Ich habe unter dieser Gemeinschaft meine ganze Kindheit verbracht, wurde von meinen Eltern immer überall mitgeschleppt und mir wurde stehts eine angeblich heile Welt vorgespielt. Immer waren wir alle Brüder und Schwestern, obwohl wir uns gegeneinander teils absolut nicht leiden konnten. Es war normal dass man nett und zuvorkommend zu wem war und später in deren Abwesenheit mit anderen über sie gelästert hat. Es war normal dass man Menschen dafür abgewertet hat dass sie vielleicht weniger im Dienst gingen oder von ihren Ehepartner verlassen wurden. Es war okay plötzlich die besten Freunde auszuschließen, für vermeintlich einfachste vergehen. Mir wurde beigebracht dass Homosexualität etwas ganz schlimmes wäre und wie man diese am besten verachtet. Es wurde geklatscht wenn es alle taten, egal ob es einen gefiel oder nicht. Jeden Freitag wurde etwas aus den Unterredungsbuch besprochen, quasi die Manipulationsanleitung für die Öffentlichkeit. Ständig wurde so getan als ob der Dienst für Jehovas das einzig Wahre wäre und der heilige Geist einen stets stärken würde wenn wir nur daran glauben. Es war schlecht zu masturbieren, denn Jehova möge sowas nicht. Wenn man in der Schule gemobbt geschlagen und ausgeschlossen wurde, dann lag es nie an mir selbst, nein es lag daran dass ich eine Zeugin Jehovas war. Alles was ich gemacht habe war negativ, nie gut genug. Im ernst, diese Gesellschaft hat mich geprägt und das stark im negativen.Im Gegensatz zu meinen Geschwistern hatte ich keine Freunde, sondern war stehts ein Anhängsel was mitgeschleppt wurde. Sehr negativ für mich war meine Berufsausbildung, wo mein Ausbilder ebenfalls ein Zeuge Jehovas war. Es war die schlimmste Zeit in meinen Leben, in der ich lernte was es bedeutet Menschen tief zu hassen. Ich war nie gut und es wurde so viel von einen gefordert und Druck aufgebaut der mich zu eine absolute Einzelgängerin machte die einfach nur um ihr Leben kämpfte. Mein Vater meint heute dass er mich ja so unterstützt hätte und es ja so mein Wunsch gewesen wäre dass ich das mache. Er verdreht es so sehr dass es mich aggressiv macht. Er, genau er war es der mir sagte dass er mit Schmach rechnet wenn ich es nicht schaffe und dass ich es durchziehen soll. Sein Spruch "mit Schmach kann er leben" bezog sich auf die Versammlung. Ständig bekam man die Verantwortung dass das eigene Verhalten alle beeinflusst. Ständig hab ich mich schlecht gefühlt, weil ich nie das sein konnte was von mir verlangt wurde.Eigentlich habe ich mit 22 gedacht dass wenn ich mich Löse, ich es lerne wirklich ich selbst zu sein und zu leben. Inzwischen habe ich alle Bibeln und Religiösen Bücher zerrissen und wollte sie nicht mehr sehen. Ich habe endlich angefangen zu schauen was ich an Kleidung, Hobbys mag ohne mich dafür zu schämen.Was soll ich sagen?Meine Eltern sind nach wie vor aktiv. Sie haben mir auch später noch mehrfach gezeigt wie unwichtig ich ihnen bin. Ich kann ihnen nicht mehr vertrauen und sehe sie vielleicht ein mal im Jahr. Eine Zeit lang habe ich noch mit meinen Vater über Whats App geredet, aber eigentlich nur auf die "wie gehts, wie ist das Wetter?" Basis. Immer wenn ich versuche mehr preiszugeben wertet er mich konsequent ab. Meine Geschwister sind beide ebenfalls aus der Gemeinschaft raus, aber keiner hält wirklich noch mit mir Kontakt. Meine Schwester ist verheiratet und hat Kinder. Von ihrer Hochzeit mit einen völlig unbekannten wusste ich erst 2 Wochen nach dem sie geschehen war, davor dachte ich dass sie und ich uns gemeinsam unterstützen und stehts in allen vertrauen würden. Sie zog weiter weg und der Kontakt wurde immer weniger. Mein Bruder und ich waren früher nach meinen Erinnerungen wirklich eng verbunden. Heute sind wir wie Tag und Nacht und er scheint es vergessen zu haben dass ich überhaupt existiere.Die Familie wäre ja eine Sache, aber die andere für mich viel deprimierende Seite ist dass ich mich nie wirklich irgendwo integrieren konnte. Ich habe nie Freundschaften pflegen, geschweige denn irgendwo eine Verbindung aufbauen können. Ich schaffe es kaum mir zu sagen dass es Menschen gibt die mich wirklich mögen. Ich kann nicht wirklich sehen wem ich vertrauen kann und wer mir böses will. Seit 3 Jahren Lebe ich mit meinen Freund zusammen, der meine erste Beziehung und auch meine einzige intime Erfahrung darstellt, weil ich es nie gelernt habe jemanden zu vertrauen, oder was es heißt einen Menschen zu lieben. Er liebt und unterstützt mich, aber wir haben definitiv Probleme wenn es um Nähe geht, da er diese aus welchen Grund auch immer nicht zulassen kann (anderes Laster). Ich bin extrem unzufrieden damit.Beruflich und sozial fühle ich mich wie eine Versagerin. Ich habe versucht mich weiterzubilden und scheitere an den eigenen Ansprüchen. Ich weiß bis heute nicht was meine Berufung früher gewesen wäre. Studieren durfte ich im Gegensatz zu meinen Bruder nicht. Ich vergleiche mich immer wieder, weil genau das früher ein wesentlicher Bestandteil war.Ich habe das Gefühl dass das Leben an mir vorbei zieht. Ich werde älter und bin am Ende kein Stück weiter. Seit einen Jahr bin ich in Psychotherapie und muss sagen dass ich auch jetzt noch kaum wirklich sehe wie ich aus dieser Spirale raus komm. Ich glaube inzwischen dass ich irgendwie lernen muss damit zu leben. Ich kann meine Verhaltensweisen nicht ablegen, ich kann einfach nicht der Mensch sein der ich sein sollte.Ich finde es wirklich schlimm wie wenig es der Gesellschaft interessiert wenn Kinder in totalitären Gemeinschaften aufwachsen müssen und keine Wahl haben. Die psychischen Folgen werden einfach herabgespielt. Es wird so getan als sei es einfach eine Religionsgemeinschaft wie jede andere auch. Es hat sich niemand in der Schule wirklich bemüht mir zu helfen, obwohl klar war dass es mir verdammt schlecht ging.Wie war der Ausstieg bei euch? Fühlt ihr euch wo zugehörig, Zuhause und angekommen?. I've randomly touched on this topic again and again in posts. I always think about the relationship with my partner. Yes, it's a chat story and I thought for a long time whether it belonged here, but I think it's the best place. The best place to understand my thoughts.In one of the recent discussions about relationships and cheating, a lot of things came up.I don't really know if I lack empathy or have other reasons for not understanding it, but it really concerns me.My boyfriend and I have been living together for over 3.5 years now. Somehow it was a damn long and wonderful time, even though I had so many ups and downs and there were several difficulties in our environment, starting with the Corona pandemic that immediately followed, some jealous neighbors and finally the quick death of both of his parents.He now takes over almost all of the household chores without it bothering him. He helps me with my car and all other technical problems. He lends me money when I need something and occasionally gives me gifts. We go on vacation together, sleep in the same bed, kiss and hold each other. Yes, I really benefit a lot from it.From the outside it seems like we're really perfect for each other, but inside me it's building up more and more because unfortunately we're completely missing one thing. Real intimacy and sex. We do it every few months, if at all, and even then I find it unsatisfactory. I overcome myself and talk to him again and again and he apologizes, says he wants to improve, but it hardly changes anything.Now I tell him to his face that I no longer believe that things will ever be different and what can I say, I'm just right so far. I keep wanting to put the gun to his chest, but then some new shit keeps happening. I'm also afraid that when I'm alone again I won't have any help anymore. I still feel completely unattractive and abandoned. I feel trapped in front of everyone. Because you can even be ashamed of masturbation, which in the past simply wasn't a problem if you were alone. I watch him and know that he doesn't masturbate, watch porn or write anywhere with other women. It's no joke that others would scream, I would be happy to finally find the reason. When I ask him, nothing comes up because I don't even know, or that he's so sorry, blah blah.For a while I compensated a lot with Onlyfans, where I always had the excuse of making money. Even if he was really reluctant at first, I at least managed to make him aware of it. Later he helped me take photos, even if only for a short time, and I was hoping that maybe something would change, but nothing happened.The joke is that I wouldn't even have a problem with it. Really not. I would just like to have an open relationship. When I tell him that, he feels bad and gathers the courage to tell me that he doesn't think that's good. I wonder why? Why does it bother him if he doesn't get shit himself?The more I think about it and talk to my therapist about it, I come to a point where I realize that it's different. Because I'll be honest, even with regular intimacy I would probably still desire something else. I am convinced that my dissatisfaction would remain. It wouldn't just be the case with him, it would be with every partner, no matter who I had.Whenever I said it to him, it circled around in my head, because actually I don't just want a higher sex drive from him. I want to be free in the matter and not have to worry about anything.A person who is nice to me and who I always write to in depth at very long intervals tells me that her wife is assexual and that it bothers her. Their alleged solution is a polygamous relationship where there would be a third person. She said that it was something so intimate for her and that she had to fall in love with this person. She could never imagine simple sex.I just can't understand that. What do people get from this loyalty, from these prisons? I would like to know how such motivations come about and why so much is associated with it.If I wrote something like that in r/Advice, they would probably tell me that I should just break up. I just don't understand that either. Why can't it work any other way? And if so, how can I get him to accept it and just trust me?As you can read, this is the first person with whom I have had such a relationship and also the first person with whom I have ever had sex. I don't have the feeling that I'll find someone like him again so quickly, nor that various opportunities will come along that quickly. Now I'm 33 years old and it's driving me crazy. I just feel so bad.The whole thing had always bothered me but I never thought it would trigger me so much. The word "abuse" sounds extremely wrong and dangerous, especially when I have to read and hear from some people that a pwNPD would always be fundamentally abusive. Do people actually understand what kind of word they are using?When I look back on my life, it is full of injuries that shape me to this day and have made me the person I am today. I have forgotten how to show emotions because it always had the worst consequences for me. I have learned to hide things in order to appear as strong as possible. I never got to know the real feeling of what it's like to love someone and be loved in front of everyone.The people around you don't see this pain, no, they deny it or downplay it. They call you a monster that you don't have to deal with.I have hurt people without realizing it. I have also rejected, insulted and put down everyone. I also viewed anyone who tried to help me as an enemy. But I have never, really never caused such serious harm to anyone, neither my life partner nor anyone else. The real damage was to myself.The bad thing is that it is precisely because of sentences like these that it is even more difficult to really look for help and then accept it, because I always think about how the other person can judge me, regardless of whether they are people around me or therapists.I mean this completely and seriously. Everyone who comes to this sub has either experienced it therapeutically or has found a way to reflect on themselves, if only through certain events of others. Otherwise there would be no reason to come here and talk about yourself.I admit that I want attention and validation from others. I own up to the fact that I manipulate people when I see fit. I have no problem saying that I am the most important thing to me. I am more aware and a more honest person. So honest that others despise me and want to destroy me.Anyone who writes that they are lost and forever ashamed should know that even with this step they are much further ahead than most other supposedly healthy people, who are usually no less pathetic.I don't have a regular circle of friends, so I'm always looking for specific people who I think might like me, be it online or in everyday life. It's probably very often the people with whom I initially think that I'm better or at least equal, with whom I think that I can just get involved. Maybe that's exactly what's causing this problem, because no, this isn't some stupid imagination. This is a real and really difficult situation for me. Especially because it keeps bringing me down emotionally.I always come across people who can't achieve anything and then have to try to show that they are so great to me. God, I want to spit in her face.They are usually notorious liars, or people who really convey that what I do is worthless. In retrospect, it's often so stupid that you could actually laugh about it. But I can't because it takes an emotional toll on me in every situation to actually be despised by the other person.Then a naivety is often applied towards me that is simply bottomless. Sometimes I don't understand how so many people have to get themselves into the worst shit and then think I'm going to pull them out of it.I don't know if I get people to do this or if it's really just the rubbish persons who put up with me.Somehow I always thought you needed more self-esteem and then you could develop, but no, it's an act of impossibility. At the moment I just sit at the computer almost every day, listen to music, look at Reddit and am frustrated because I know that I can actually do much more. My creativity seems to be decreasing day by day. It just pisses me off.I have a YouTube channel with a lot of actually active viewers and I know that if I just kept it going it could get a significant increase, but I can't. Just this feeling that everyone can do what I do, but they just can't get beyond it, makes me have a hard time. I don't come up with any really innovative ideas and when I do, I can never really use them anyway.Okay then look for distractions, maybe that will help. Let's move on...PC games, god it's frustrating to see how you can't move forward. “Everyone starts small” is the answer, fuck you all!Even simple games that I play with my boyfriend are no different. He wins, I quit because it's no use.I always had the idea of doing some kind of sport. You have to learn that too and then you will never be the best, let alone worth mentioning.The whole thing sounds ridiculous. Every person always comes up with the same standard, disabled answer that doesn't help anyone. I don't give a damn that no one can do everything well, it would be enough for me to find one damn thing.I limit myself more and more, I start to isolate myself and I fight against it every day. I hoped it would get better and yes I tried really hard to give a better perspective on the things I do. I want to appreciate it and just be proud, but no, it's getting worse.EDIT: I have to add how shitty it is when you actually tell therapists this and they just dismiss it, looking askance as if it's so abnormal, as if this feeling is just made up and not such a limiting problem.. I keep trying to express myself from the outside in such a way that I get what I want. I always want to stand up for myself, be safe and be understood. Every time I talk about my needs, I become embarrassed, dishonest or just talk in riddles, as if there is a wall in front of me saying the right thing. I always keep an eye on the supposed consequences that this entails. I'm always ashamed of it. God I hate it.I somehow thought that I would have just left it at the first thread, but to be honest, it really doesn't let me go. I see that the text is long and at the same time my English is so bad that I don't know if I really have the right wording everywhere. Unfortunately, I can no longer check this properly due to the volume of the text. I think he just belongs here. I think this is one of the most open things I have ever said here and I would be happy if someone reads it.It's really hard for me to summarize like that and somehow it's just embarrassing for me now. The last few days my head has been spinning more and more and I have doubts about everyone, about myself and about every place I go. I have the feeling that I often just start looking for an answer, even where there might not be one at all, let alone one is necessary, things that no normal person thinks about, that maybe just every person goes through. Still, I can't accept that, no, what I experience is always different and always worse than anyone else's. I consider myself to be competent and completely uninfluenceable, but then I keep noticing how I allow myself to be infected. Wow, it pisses me off to be so susceptible to all kinds of dirt, be it various scams or topics that I pick up. It hurts, it really just hurts to be so stupid and stupid, so dependent and childish. I really don't like admitting that. I can't admit it no matter where I am and at the same time I notice more and more how I'm driving myself into shit and at some point I no longer know what it's all about. I've done a lot of nonsense and I just can't get away from this crap. Sometimes I wish I was on a deserted island where all the impressions were gone, where I could just be “normal” inside.I don't know if you can see what I'm currently seeing doubts and serious problems about. I doubt my own story and it's really difficult for me to describe everything that happened to get to this point. Again and again this loneliness, again and again this rejection of other people and the reprimand of supposedly doing something wrong that I have never done wrong. Always knowing that I don't matter to everyone around me. Always my own failure no matter what I start, always a constant devaluation from others and of course from myself. That just hurts. I can't live with that, not without constantly thinking about it and constantly talking about it. Yes, being sick somewhere is becoming more and more my only purpose in life. A fucking vicious circle that no matter what I decide will never be different, as if I would never want it to be any other way.I've had to experience a lot in my past that I have a shitty character, or that I'm simply unstable and different because of my traumatic experiences. Hearing over and over again from your new acquaintances that you should seek help will eventually stay in your head, no matter how hard you try to ignore it. It's extremely difficult for me to see that I need help in certain situations, I'm really ashamed of it and I'm always afraid, afraid that people won't understand the situation or will internally devalue me because I actually want to achieve what I want to do I won't be able to shit alone again. At some point it hit me that I can't feel comfortable like this. At some point I just couldn't deny it anymore and I looked for answers and some of them were extremely strange. At first I thought that coming out as trans would change a lot, but hey, I feel like it's gotten even scarier because yes, I haven't escaped anyone and no, I haven't started a new life in that sense either. New name, new persona, operations, hormones and still the same unbearable personality. Funny. Of course, I distorted my CV in front of a therapist. I somehow wanted everything to fit and wow was I good. She recorded everything and at the end wrote an indication, which mainly consisted of the texts that I personally gave her. Yes, I feel good about what I did, but let's be honest, does what she did speak of competence? What if I were unhappy with that, would she have really differentiated that? As you can imagine, things continued of course, because no, the conflicts within me and with others didn't get any better. During that time, I disappointed more and more people, devalued them and put myself at the top, as if I had poor foresight. In the end everyone ignored me or pitied me. Now came physical worries and fears. I noticed that I was gaining weight slightly due to the hormone therapy. I never considered that it might just have been due to short-term stress. I started looking at other people, realized that I wasn't the thinnest and therefore I'm no different than anyone else. I couldn't accept that. I started losing weight, more and more. My inner focus shifted from one topic to a new one, that of having more and more discipline when eating and worrying more and more about food and my weight. I didn't make any sense of having an eating disorder. I even bragged about it. I went to Pro Ana forums and hoped that I was the thinnest of all and god it was good to see how others wrote about their problems, how they kept having binge eating that didn't work at all for me.Still, it left me less and less satisfied. I became more and more impulsive from the outside and my sister (my only real regular contact at the time) also got a lot of it. It wasn't enough for me, so I had to expand my personal worldview even further and started researching the supposed origins. I went to the family doctor and had myself examined and she introduced me to a gluten-free diet and yes, I was so vulnerable and stupid to just accept it. Of course, I also talked about it and couldn't resist looking into communities and posting how well I had myself under control now and was supposedly fighting my eating disorder. God I hate myself for this.Everyone who had contact with me had to go through this nonsense for a long time. Even my friend had to go through a lot in the first few years. Then suddenly the break. I didn't care about the eating disorder and I just dropped the gluten-free diet from one day on. Somehow my boyfriend helped me to stop being ashamed of doing something so stupid for so long.But of course it shouldn't stay that way. I've repeatedly made comments here about my relationship, but also that I'm still struggling with the same issue mentioned above. In the meantime, there were conflicts with some people who I actually saw as very warm and friendly towards me. One contact in particular at work caught my eye. Because yes, I told him all the crap that came to mind and suddenly we were arguing and I realized that I was losing out. She knew every nonsense about me, the stupidity had no limit and in return I knew nothing about her. If that were the only person I had such a relationship with, everything would be fine, but no, it's really every time, with every fucking person who starts to get closer to me.At the same time, I notice more and more how I provoke people and not just by trolling. I speak and write really disparagingly and always have new situations where I consciously look for supposedly weaker people in order to put them down completely, whenever I see that they supposedly get more attention than I do. Even if people are hated by others and come to me, at some point I push them away, after all they are idiots. I'm creating more and more people who hate me. I don't know if it's my personality or just my shitty instability and lack of acceptance of being happy with myself.And now we finally come to the current situation.I've been seeing a therapist since last year, mind you, behavioral therapy. I'm so annoyed that when I first started looking for it, I never thought about forms of therapy. To be honest, I didn't even know where this journey was supposed to go, let alone how I could even tell something like that without seeming completely stupid. At the same time, I was and still am so torn inside. I just can't take it anymore with all the things I'm doing and going through my head. What I liked about her was that she asked questions directly and I thought she would really think about me, maybe give me a way out, maybe even give me a completely different look at me. After several visits, however, the conversations became more and more one-sided, so that in the end it was only about my family and my brother-in-law, who I absolutely can't stand. We went around in circles. So I wrote like before to make it clear to her that I really wanted more than just small talk and yes I also wrote that I think I'm a narcissist. Well the conversations changed again and she went through the points with me. I was able to confirm a lot of things, but what does that mean? Of course everything applies to me when I think like that. As is usual in this form of therapy, it was hardly really about dealing with things in the past, but only about the current things that affect you in life. Then I thought about depth psychology again, but at the same time I realized how impossible it is to find a therapy place here. Many people reject it outright, saying that my health insurance will then cause problems. It's tiring and at the same time so embarrassing what I've gotten myself into.In the meantime, I've also been dealing with other limitations, such as not being able to get anything done, or being such a mess, and also having so many problems communicating with people. Then I came to the conclusion that I needed to be diagnosed with ADHD. I asked my therapist what her impression was and she said she didn't see anything about it. Nevertheless, I decided to do a diagnosis privately and lo and behold I clearly got the diagnosis.Since then I have been going to her as well as to group therapy. In group therapy I was able to learn a lot about myself and others, which was really good. On the other hand, I have never really been able to absorb the topics and advice. I have the feeling that people are thinking far too simply. At the same time, I also notice how I differ from others, or tell myself so. Topics like envy and mistrust also make themselves felt in me. It seems to be less likely to be recorded, where I think that no one is really interested in you.I think that there has to be more, or rather I am convinced of it and so I go to my therapist, annoyed that I didn't really know where I stood and what sense this therapy actually makes.Now I recently asked her for a statement because I just don't even know what we could work on anymore and I also asked myself whether she was even interested in me and yes, she actually did. I spoke in purely superficial terms and used some empty phrases, things to distract me from my thoughts. But things turned out differently. A session before, she discussed with me a lot about my past and my relationship with my parents, especially my father. Then in the next session she broke everything down, including a lot of what we discussed before and of course what I recorded for her twice. She sees two sides that influence me: instability and strong narcissism. We then went through points and came back to examples of current and former short friendships. I think I left a lasting impression on one in particular. The topic of death seems to affect people more than it does to me. I said how it annoyed me that this person was so bitter in front of me and that it then escalated. It wasn't the only example. I have no idea, but these situations still feel ridiculous to me and I seriously wonder if she's rhyming about it more than she should have. Have I perhaps dramatized the whole thing? As I was saying goodbye to the meeting, I realized that I had left something behind. I can't think of it anymore. Great, you now have the next diagnosis, congratulations.What remains is a negative aftertaste with massive doubts. Is my therapist competent enough? Is what she says true? Is it basically just something I invented again? Is she really not taking me seriously and is she just calling it that? Somehow it's too complex for that.How should things continue now? What should I do? I feel like I'm going deeper and deeper into my own destruction and I don't understand why.Thank you for everyone who read this long text. Thank you for being there.&#x200B;. Actually, I should be happier because I finally managed to get my therapist to analyze me and give me a defacto diagnosis. She sees strong narcissistic parts in me, including a lack of empathy. Added to this is low self-confidence. She had it set up well today, but somehow I can't believe that I'm such a genius who recognizes everything about myself. Before that, I went to a practice regarding my own suspicion of ADHD and here too I received a clear diagnosis. Is this really specialist knowledge, or is it just confirming me so that I can calm down somewhere? Am I so complicated, manipulative that you just take it for granted? I have the feeling that most doctors rely on some tests and of course their own statements. My therapist has known me for more than a year now, but I still don't think she will ever really be able to empathize with what I really experience and how I behave in everyday life. I somehow have the feeling that no matter where I am, there are rarely critical questions where I think someone has the competence to analyze you. I also have enormous doubts about the ADHD diagnosis, although I really tell myself that it was already well evaluated and that it was clearly done by experts. At least on a neurological and psychological basis there seems to be enormous leeway in how the patient is analyzed.Vor ein paar Monaten hatte mal einen Post gemacht wo ich über ein Bewerbungsgespräch geschrieben hab und ja Stolz bin ich noch immer. :)[Ich bin Stolz auf mich... : einfach\_posten (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/einfach_posten/comments/13red47/ich_bin_stolz_auf_mich/)Ich hab dann auch direkt am nächsten Tag für mich eigentlich undenkbar die Zusage bekommen. Umso mehr hab ich mich gefreut endlich eine andere berufliche Perspektive zu haben. Über 12 Jahre waren es nun her, in dem für mich doch irgendwie Stillstand herrschte. Ich bekam selten gute Aufgaben und hatte vor allen extrem viel Leerlauf. Die größeren Unternehmen wo für ich Extern zusammen mit meiner ehemaligen Chefin gearbeitet habe waren toll und man war auch einigermaßen integriert, aber im Detail merkte man dann doch schnell die Unterschiede. So war es 2020 mit der Corona Krise plötzlich voll okay dass mich ein Kunde einfach nicht mehr brauchte. In der Zeit war ich nie wirklich so produktiv, es gab immer wieder mal das ein oder andere aber ich hatte auch das Gefühl dass meine Chefin mich zwar wirklich sehr mochte, aber nicht wirklich was anvertrauen wollte. Den Kunden schien es egal zu sein ob ich wirklich produktiv war oder nicht. Zudem hab ich allerdings auch tatsächlich gerade am Anfang erheblich viele Flüchtigkeitsfehler gemacht und konnte nie wirklich irgendwelche Ratschläge annehmen. Seit diesen Jahr habe ich durch meine ADHS Diagnose auch endlich den Grund dafür gefunden, warum ich so Chaotisch bin, aber in der gesamten Zeit hatte ich nichts davon gewusst und es hat einen schon entsprechend auch stark frustriert. Wie dem auch sei die Zeit dort ist vorbei und ich blicke da schon auch nicht negativ zurück. Habe wirklich auch einige nette Menschen kennen gelernt egal wie Oberflächig und vergänglich doch alles war. Gestört hat mich allerdings auch am Ende auch die Bedingungen, das ich niemanden hatte der irgendwo mich vertreten hätte, außer meiner Chefin. Ich musste mir selbst das Gehalt erkämpfen und es ist klar dass dieses in so einer Konstellation lange nicht besonders gut war, bzw. immer den Tariflöhnen hinterher hängt. Nun war ich gespannt, denn ich habe für mich das unmögliche der Dinge geschafft. Ich hab nicht nur einen neuen Job gefunden, sondern ausgerechnet einen im Öffentlichen Dienst. Dort wo ich immer schwierige Einstellungstests hatte die ich nie bestanden habe. Dort wo ich immer dachte dass man mich wegen der schlechten Zeugnisse eh nicht nimmt. Endlich Gehalt nach Tarif, Home Office Möglichkeit und absolute Flexibilität was die Arbeitszeiten angeht. Ja es ist einfach ein toller Luxus den ich immer haben wollte und jeden beneidet hab der irgendwie es geschafft hat wo fest eingestellt zu sein. Auch das Aufgabengebiet ist endlich komplexer, mehr verschiedene Baustellen und es gibt auch endlich Möglichkeiten an der ein oder anderen Schulung teilzunehmen.Nun ist es da und was soll ich sagen. Die Kollegen sind toll. Wirklich, ich hab noch nie so nette freundliche Kollegen gehabt. Ich hatte noch nie einen so lockeren Vorgesetzten wo es schon fast Kumpelhaft wird. Ich kann mit vielen wirklich tolle Gespräche führen und auch das Alter passt deutlich besser. Früher waren wirklich alle um mich herum ü50. Es ist schon krass zu sehen dass es Kollegen gibt die wirklich mal jünger sind als ich selbst. Was allerdings sehr verwirrend und für mich echt schwierig ist, ist die Arbeit selbst. Besser gesagt die nicht vorhandene Arbeit. Ich sitze hier wirklich nur rum, es gibt nichts. Ich frage und bekomme zur Antwort "schauen sie mal da und da im Intranet" irgendwann hat man genug davon angesehen. Dann kann man sich mit der Datenbank beschäftigen. Zudem war am Anfang überall noch nicht mal ein Zugang vorhanden. Ein paar Miniaufgaben habe ich tatsächlich dann doch für eine andere Abteilung machen können, aber dann wieder das übliche. Immer wieder kommt mal ein Kollege und fragt ob ich kurz da und da mal schauen könnte, er bringt mir das im Laufe des Tages. Passieren tut dann allerdings nichts. Frage ich nach bekomme ich zu hören dass das entweder doch keine Eile hat oder es sich von selbst geklärt hat. Ich sitze den ganzen Tag am Schreibtisch, habe die Tür offen, begrüße jeden der an mir vorbei geht und bin hier auf Reddit unterwegs um Texte wie diesen hier zu verfassen. Anhand der Fülle des Textes sollte meine große Kapazität erkennbar sein. Früher bekam ich schon so wenig dass man wirklich von einer Unterforderung sprechen kann. Ich hatte aber trotzdem gerade bei langweiligen gleichbleibenden doch durchaus auch mal Motivation wenn ich wusste dass es etwas sichtbar Produziertes gab und sei es nur eine Überarbeitung einer Excelliste, oder Ablage von Dateien. Früher waren es 1-2h Arbeit am Tag, heute sind es gut wird 2h in der Woche. Habe nun mehr Geld, weniger Fahrerei, vielleicht bald auch mehr Sicherheit aber dieser Fluch ist geblieben. Zeitweise genieße ich ihn aber auch, einfach weil ich inzwischen auch echt Angst habe das genaue Gegenteil zu erleben. Fakt ist dass ich auch früher selbst angefangen habe mich ständig auf der Arbeit mit anderen Dingen zu beschäftigen, weil ich mich einfach nicht auf die Sache konzentrieren konnte. Das machte mir auch jetzt wieder Angst dass ich es so richtig verhauen könnte. Ich hab es echt mittlerweile verlernt wirklich zu Arbeiten. Vielleicht suche ich mir wirklich auch nur noch so etwas aus. Vielleicht will ich es gar nicht anders. Ist es vielleicht doch in unserer Gesellschaft mittlerweile die eigentliche Normalität und besteht unsere gesamte Wirtschaft tatsächlich großenteils aus Bullshit Jobs?. Ich habe im Mai mir eine Amex Payback geholt und seit etwas über 1 Monat nun auch eine BMW Card. Mir ging es vor allen dabei ums Cashback, aber auch um eine Karte zu haben die man z.B. für einen Leihwagen benutzen kann. Bin damit ansich auch zufrieden. Anfangs hatte ich auch einen echt erstaunlichen Kreditramen von über 10.000€, den ich natürlich nie hätte nutzen wollen, da ich sie wirklich nur für die alltäglichen Ausgaben nutze und auch streng drauf achte dass diese Summe immer auf dem Konto bereit liegt.Dann hatte ich jedoch plötzlich eine Mittleilung von AMEX das meine Karten vorzeitig zur Überprüfung gesperrt wären und ich Kontoauszüge nachreichen soll dass ein entsprechendes Gehalt vorliegt. Gesagt getan und nach ca. 7 Tagen (die haben sich wirklich mächtig Zeit gelassen) konnte ich die Karten auch endlich wieder nutzen. Interessant aber dass mein Kreditramen auf 4500€ heruntergesetzt wurde. Letzte Woche habe ich mir gedacht dass ich mir doch mal lieber eine Schufa Auskunft holen sollte und sie da die Amex hat dafür gesorgt das mein Score von 97,25% auf 93,16% gefallen ist. Was meint ihr ist dieser Verfall normal? Sollte ich dagegen vorgehen oder wird sich das im Laufe der Zeit wieder zum positiven ändern? Ich weiß dass man nun die Möglichkeit hat mehr Geld zu bekommen als man besitzt. Ich würde aber niemals diese Funktion so nutzen und es ging mir wirklich nur um die Zahlungsabwicklung und den Vorteilen die aus den Karten enstehen.. Vor kurzen habe ich überlegt ein Wasserbett zu kaufen und hier nach Erfahrungen gefragt. Die Reaktionen waren recht gemischt. [https://www.reddit.com/r/einfach\_posten/comments/15lbq1h/hat\_jemand\_von\_euch\_erfahrung\_mit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/einfach_posten/comments/15lbq1h/hat_jemand_von_euch_erfahrung_mit/)Wirklich abgeschreckt war ich dennoch nicht, also musste ich doch mal schauen was es so auf den Markt gibt. Erstes Problem so wie ich das dachte einfach nur die Matratze ändern ist schwierig, da in der Größe die wir bei unseren vorhandenen Bettgestell hatten lediglich eine Einzelmatratze möglich ist. Dann der Preis, die Dinger sind irgendwie viel zu teuer, dafür dass man sie am Ende nicht einmal mehr wirklich zurückgeben kann. Die Idee mit den Gebrauchtmarkt war allerdings nicht schlecht. Was ich ganz klar aber sagen muss, die Betten, die dort angeboten werden sind teilweise richtig alt und auch nicht so gut gepflegt wie sie sein sollten. So wie das manche behaupten, von wegen alle würden versuchen sie neu wieder los zu werden, ist es nicht. Das Erste was wir uns angeschaut haben war entsprechend grässlich und ich habe danach wirklich gedacht dass ich definitiv keins mehr holen möchte. Dann hab ich aber tatsächlich noch ein Boxspringbett gefunden was wirklich wie neu war und erst dieses Jahr gekauft wurde. Der Grund warum es verkauft wurde war eine Wohnungsauflösung.Das Abbauen und der Transport ging super, auch wenn ich jetzt etwas mehr aufpassen würde dass man die einzelnen Kerne weniger knickt und wirklich alles an Restwasser rausnimmt. Ganz wichtig auch vor dem Aufbau gut Putzen, vor allen schauen dass keine Sandkörner drauf sind. Dafür gab es auf Amazon aber ein gutes Reinigungsset mit Vinylreiniger Tüchern und Conditioner. Das Befüllen war mit dem Schlauch echt simpel. Das hab ich mir komischerweise viel komplizierter vorgestellt. Die Wassermengen sind aber schon irgendwie nicht ohne und es wirkt wirklich erstmal seltsam auf so ein auf dem ersten Blick windiges Ding "Vinylbeutel" mit derart großen Wassermassen aufzufüllen. Jetzt nach 2 Tagen steht es aber immer noch prima und irgendwie hab ich auch kein schlechtes Gefühl mehr damit. Geschlafen hab ich tatsächlich auch gut bisher. Was nun etwas schwieriger ist, ist sich zu drehen, aber man gewöhnt sich daran doch recht schnell.Die Luft hat man auch recht gut rausbekommen, sogar ohne dass man einen Entlüfter hat (soll noch nachgeschickt werden, mal schauen). Gluckern tut da wenig und wenn dann so minimal dass das eigentlich ein tolles Gefühl ist. Es ist irgendwie lustig wenn es doch etwas plätschert obwohl man völlig im trockenen ist. Zurzeit bereue ich es nicht. :). Ich und mein Freund wollen/müssen nun doch mal unsere schon sehr alte Federkernmatratze austauschen und irgendwie kamen wir auf die verrückte Idee statt eine Federkern-, eine Wasserbettmatratze zu kaufen.Ich weiß noch wie diese früher immer in den Läden und Ausstellungen vorgeführt wurden und als Kind hab ich mir irgendwie nichts mehr gewünscht als im Zimmer so ein Bett zu haben. :)Jetzt wo man die Mittel und auch die absolute Entscheidungsgewalt hat würde ich es doch mal gerne wagen so etwas auszuprobieren.Gibt es von euch jemanden der so etwas privat bei sich zuhause hat, bzw. hatte? Wie sind eure Erfahrungen damit? Worauf sollte man hier bei besonders achten?.

Gibt es von euch jemanden der so etwas privat bei sich zuhause hat, bzw. hatte? Wie sind eure Erfahrungen damit? Worauf sollte man hier bei besonders achten?. Heute bekam ich den Brief wo vor ich schon lange ein mulmiges Gefühl habe und ja es ist nun soweit auch ich wäre eine potentielle Erbin für meinen verstorbenen "Onkel". Ich hatte mit diesen Menschen nie auch nur im Ansatz etwas zu tun. Er kannte mich wahrscheinlich auch gar nicht so wie die ganzen anderen im Suff versinkenden A... die ich damals mit besuchen musste, aber nie sich näher mit mir beschäftigt haben. Der Typ war geisteskrank, hat sich mehrfach versucht umzubringen und ist dann später in einen betreuten Wohnen gekommen wo er nichts anderes als geraucht und sich zu Tode gesoffen hat. Natürlich schlagen alle das Erbe aus und nun kommt dieser Müll zu mir und allen anderen Nichten und Neffen, toll. Ich kann nun 30-70€ für eine Person bezahlen mit der ich nichts im Leben gemeinsam hatte, außer Stress und Scham. Ich denke in nächster Zeit werden noch weitere abkratzen und mich ebenfalls damit "beglücken". Andere haben immer eine große Verwandtschaft, tolle Großeltern, Tanten, Onkels, Nichten, Neffen und auch wenn sie sich vielleicht nicht immer mögen doch irgendwo einen gewissen Rückhalt. Sie erben Häuser, Vermögen. Manche brauchen eigentlich gar keine Sorgen haben, egal was ihnen im Leben passiert, egal wie sehr sie alles in den Ruin treiben. Ich dagegen hatte eine Oma die ich nie kennen gelernt hab, eine andere die uns gehasst hat. Ein Opa der erst völlig mittellos von meinen Eltern im Altersheim gebracht wurde und ich 1 Jahr lang sehen konnte. Ein anderer hat gesoffen und unserer Familie gedroht. Selbst mit seinen Tod versuchte er die ganze Familie zu enterben. Immerhin da hatten meine Eltern kapital bekommen. Mit den Tanten, Onkels habe ich keinen Kontakt mehr und früher auch nur in schlimmster Erinnerung. Die eine Seite hatte null Interesse an einen die andere wie der obere Fall. Ich scheiße auf diese Familie und habe auch nichts was ich in diesen Bezug vermissen würde. Was die Erbgeschichte angeht fühl ich mich allerdings in vielerlei Hinsicht wirklich verarscht. Wieso wird es einen so schwer gemacht ein Erbe einfach abzulehnen, besonders wenn es gar keinen echten Bezug zu mir gab? Wie kann es so kacken dreist erlaubt sein noch zu behaupten dass es für die Ausschlagung "keine Gründe" gebe, obwohl meine Mutter ganz klar eine mögliche Verschuldung angegeben hat. Der Staat kassiert sich von jeder Person Geld bis sie den Taugenichts irgendwie wieder bezahlt bekommt. Wieso muss ich für so einen Menschen bürgen?. Ich hab seit letzte Woche erst mit Medikamenten angefangen, also sind meine Erfahrungen noch sehr gering. Mein Arzt hat gemeint dass wir mit Atomoxetin (Beta Pharm) anfangen sollten und in 6 Wochen wieder nachschauen. Anfangen soll ich mit 10mg und dann Wöchentlich bis 40mg steigern. Soweit so gut. Ich gebe zu ich war und bin etwas skeptisch, sowohl was die Wirkung angeht und ob ich wirklich dauerhaft dieses Medikament nehmen möchte. An sich klang es für mich trotzdem vielversprechend und ich fände es auch schön wenn es wirklich irgendwann entsprechend wirken und mir helfen könnte. Ich weiß auch dass die Wirkung erst frühestens in 4 Wochen bemerkbar sein soll.Was mir seit dem aber radikal auffällt ist dass ich immer müder und noch hibbeliger bin als zuvor. Eigentlich spaziere ich immer gerne, Mittags aber auch gerne mitten in der Nacht. Seit letzter Woche aber muss ich mich stark zu prügeln. Auch die Treppen fallen mir immer schwerer. Es ist noch kein großes Drama, aber es nervt mich schon und fällt mir einfach auf. Früher kannte ich das immer bei einen starken Eisenmangel. Allerdings nehme ich seit Monaten nun Eisentabletten und fühlte mich damit eigentlich gut. ich weiß nicht ob ich mir das einbilde und die Ursache vielleicht ganz woanders liegt, aber momentan vermute ich immer mehr dass es vom Atomoxetin kommt. Wie sind eure Erfahrungen damit, habt ihr das auch so verspürt? Wenn ja, meint ihr dass das mit weiterer Einnahme wieder besser wird?. A really serious question. I've been busy all the time with the factors that ensure that people always seem to give me a huge berth. I think that many actually find me interesting and that there is a certain potential there. I actually always have the feeling that I'm well received at first and that I look nice. However, there seems to be something that I can't change. I've heard this from some people and I have to be honest that it frustrates me enormously. One recently wrote to me that he was in awe of me, partly afraid. I get not a more detailed explanation than that. My appearance is attractive and somehow I think so. Especially when I was shooting videos, I could really notice that for myself. People are first attracted and then scared by what I reflect and radiate. What can it really be and how can I fix it? Do you have similar experiences?. Hallo ihr lieben! Letzte Woche habe ich meine Diagnose erhalten und würde gerne Möglichkeiten finden mich medikamentös weiter behandeln zu lassen. Bei der Praxis wo ich war wäre es angeblich für mich möglich wenn ich die Einstellung wie auch die Diagnostik davor privat leiste. Die Medikamente würden dann mit der Kasse abgerechnet. Habe auf weiterer Anfrage bisher noch keine Antwort und auch so leider keinen blassen Schimmer wie viele Termine und vor allen Kosten auf mich zu kämen. Ich hätte gerne irgendwie die Möglichkeit eine Praxis zu finden die das ganze auch inkl. den Sitzungen auf Kassenleistung macht. Leider erscheint mir das hier im Rhein Main Gebiet nahezu unmöglich. Habt ihr eine Idee was ich machen könnte, oder habt ihr vielleicht sogar Adressen aus der Umgebung?. This post just kind of jumped out of my heart. I don't know if he belongs here and to what extent it's more part of my disorder. It's something that's been bothering me for a long time and at rare times like now I just really notice it. I feel uninteresting and somehow unimportant to the people around me, maybe repulsive? In any case, I notice that most of the conversations I have only arise when I complain, I'm a bit depressed, I see no more ways. People then seem to turn on their helper syndrome. I then suddenly have people who are interested in me, who encourage me or even attack me and are annoyed by me, but they react. I suddenly become interesting. I often talked to my therapist about my self-worth and somehow I started trying to see things in a more positive light, or to somehow give it some importance. In fact, more positive things than bad things have happened lately. A few months ago I was determined to jump off a tall building and end my misery. In the meantime I have found a small ray of hope and somehow realized that I can go further. I suddenly felt success in certain things. Something I had never really allowed myself. At the same time, however, I have felt lonelier than ever in the last few days and weeks and when I talk to the same contacts about it, they withdraw because I am fine. Somehow this is extremely frustrating for me. I have the feeling that I have to stay the way I am, with all the negative thoughts, hate and anger. If I don't then I'm completely irrelevant air.Das mag nun wie eine Bagatelle klingen aber ich hatte heute wohl das beste Vorstellungsgespräch was ich jemals geführt habe. Zum ersten mal habe ich mich nicht verhaspelt oder aus der Reserve locken lassen. Normalerweise war es immer so dass mich schon eine Personalerin völlig verunsichert hat und wenn ich dann mit 4 oder gar 5 Leuten an einen Tisch sitzen musste einfach verstummt bin. Ich fing an mich für alles zu schämen, alles was ich sagen will zu vergessen, an mir jeden vermeintlichen Fehler zu sehen und mich selbst nur noch um Kopf und Kragen zu reden. Die Begebenheiten waren dieses mal eigentlich überhaupt nicht anders. Es war wieder ein großer Besprechungsraum und alles hätte wieder genauso enden können. Habe es aber tatsächlich geschafft. Ich bin über meinen Schatten gesprungen und wirkte alles andere als verklemmt. Merke zum ersten mal bewusst wie offen und Selbstbewusst ich sein kann. Egal wie das nun ausgeht, ob ich wie immer eine Absage bekomme oder nicht ich freu mich gerade einfach das geschafft zu haben.EDIT: Unglaublich, ich habe eine Zusage bekommen.. Keine Ahnung ob das nun hier rein passt. Letztes Jahr, Ende Oktober habe ich die Therapie angefangen und war erst wirklich zuversichtlich und erleichtert dass ich doch noch recht zeitig wo einen Platz gefunden habe. Die "Euphorie" aber verflog nun schnell, weil die Gespräche gefühlt immer einseitiger wurden und ich langsam auch stark an der Kompetenz zweifle. Hatte zwei mal versucht es über lange E-Mails irgendwie offener zu gestalten, mir selbst gesagt dass ich vielleicht auch einfach nicht richtig kommunizieren kann, bzw. alles was mir irgendwie innerlich weh tut verberge. Es gab ein paar etwas konstruktivere Sitzungen danach, aber sehr schnell merke ich wie es am Ende wieder zum selben Muster abdriftet. Frage mich mittlerweile auch wohin sowas überhaupt führen soll. Meine Ängste nimmt es nicht, mehr Selbstwert kann ich bisher auch nicht bekommen, eine Perspektive kann ich mir auch nicht daraus erarbeiten, nur weil eine Person mich alle paar Wochen mal eine Stunde sieht. Mir geht es gefühlt nicht ansatzweise besser und ich habe nicht das Gefühl dass sich das damit jemals ändern kann. Ich bin fest entschlossen es ihr ins Gesicht zu sagen, dass ich keinen weiteren Sinn darin sehe, ich es ehrlich sogar bescheuert finde. Hat jemand schon mal ähnliche Erfahrungen? Wie seit ihr damit umgegangen?. I know there are a lot of undiagnosed people here and I'm no different here, although I would like to try to at least look at facts rather than personal feelings. To claim that someone only has an NPD with a diagnosis is somehow also pointless, to think that one does not become aware of this topic oneself, question oneself through certain scenarios and realize that there seems to be something to it, or how do you see this?What is your opinion on this, especially on the point that you can get bogged down with it yourself?I myself would actually like to have a truth, to somehow have exactly what is clearly there confirmed. If a therapist could explain to me that this is not the case for me and give me a concrete diagnosis (whatever there will be), I would actually try to consider it as possible and also accept it, as long as it is not completely far away from good and bad.Now comes the problem, it doesn't happen because no one is really willing to really delve deeply into me, or maybe they just can't.I think there are a handful of people who can do that, but reaching them is difficult and even then the question would be whether they can understand another subject at all, if they must to have than. Here in Germany we have a health insurance company that also pays for various sessions. Here, too, it is an extremely long and painful time before you even get a place. After the probationary period, you have to go through with the therapy or you get a lock, for some years. So there is no real choice. I think it's even harder for people in the US.How do you do this? I really tried to get help and somehow work on myself, no matter where the deficits come from. I wanted to be heard, to have a starting point somewhere to get out of the situation. But I notice that it doesn't work like that at all. At the end you get bogged down in senseless babble about one and the same topics that I don't really care about and don't care about. Often I even have the feeling that the therapist even forgets what I have said. So I kind of have no choice but to self-diagnose and even address it, ridiculous as that sounds. The less I believe that it is at all goal-oriented.I really don't know what to write right now. I've been here before but feel like I need more security.Feel free to call that paranoid, but I think this post may already be a mistake on my part. I find that kind of a shame. Maybe I'll write a short version about myself and then delete it again.I'am I am female 33. I've always had the feeling that my whole career was made up of failures. At school I was bullied until the end, even at my first job it was still the case that I didn't get along with anyone around me.I grew up in a well-known religious community that I would clearly call a sect. You will surely know them all. I never really connected with it, I actually just went along with it, but it still took me a really long time to find my way out of it and, above all, I isolated myself very much. During that time I always had a survival instinct. I had to learn to live alone and always felt like I was lagging behind. I imagined what I could not do in the future. I wanted an empire, I wanted to be famous, I wanted to be the center of attention even if I was an asshole to everyone out there. Of course, none of this worked, and while it's so weird and unworldly, I'm frustrated that it doesn't work.I have a constant expectation of perfectionism, both from myself and from other people. I'm quickly disappointed when something turns out differently than I imagined. Unfortunately, I just leave really good work lying around. I've tried several times to continue my education and can't do it. Again and again I put everything back in the middle. It's really enough little things that I'm paralyzed and leave everything behind. I ask myself how I can ever get away from this problem and, above all, even begin to get what I wish for when everything is an extreme struggle for me.The fact that I probably have an NPD I noticed first and foremost through testimonies from others, above all people like my work colleagues, but also my siblings and everyone around me. I get personal quickly and tend to have conflicts. I used to wonder when I read about narcissistic anger how disgusting you have to think to be like that. I now realize that I am in no way different. I only ever justified it because everyone around me was always hostile.I've always felt strongly isolated in my opinion. People find me interesting, but they quickly realize that I'm getting exhausting, that I'm flooding them with information about myself. Unfortunately often more than I would like.I've started to like myself anyway, but in such a way that I always have the urge to show myself. I do Youtube next to work, until recently I had active Onlyfans because I needed confirmation. I never got any money for it, it was time-consuming, damaged my partnership and in the end you really ask yourself why you're doing it. I realize it was purely because of that. I have always disliked my work. At that time I learned something that seemed most suitable to me. Every attempt to get away from it failed. I still think I have a pretty secure job and a good relationship. Nevertheless, lately I've been able to get into a fight with my superiors again and again and I realize how little I can control. They seem to notice it themselves and consciously give me little or no criticism, or to package it differently. I believe that my colleagues know that I quickly become impulsive.It kind of frustrates me to be nothing but a nobody at this point. I never made it to any position, I was never really important. When I see how many much younger people are having such success, it really makes me sick. I really wonder what I'm doing wrong.For a few years I have been living with my boyfriend who moved in with me. He's my first boyfriend ever and I really wondered if you could love me at all. I really didn't believe that for a very long time. Unfortunately I don't even know if I can give him the same love.He knows that I am currently dealing with the topic of narcissism. At first I was really scared of what he would put together underneath. Right now I think he just thinks I'm kidding myself.Lately I've been feeling more and more like an empty board. My entire creativity that I actually had is running out more and more. I seriously ask myself how long I can go on like this and even want to.&#x200B;Do you curse a lot?I never worry about it much, but I think my swearing is no more than other people's. I can get very personal when I'm angry though.Are you self righteous and vengeful?I think that's me I always have situations where others have to stop me from doing really bad things. Even after an extremely long time, I still feel enormous anger.Can you turn off your empathy?I don't think I turn it on and off consciously. I rather think that I generally can't feel these feelings for others. I notice and know if they're doing well or badly, but I end up having little to no interest in them.&#x200B;Age: 33NPI: 20+Codependeny Score: 3OCD: 0.
    Ok so I’ve never been diagnosed with ocd but I do have health anxiety which has symptoms similar to ocd and I do tend to have obsessive thoughts that I can’t seem to get out of my head.The most recent one of these is constantly imagining myself from the third person. And not voluntarily, like the image will just pop into my head. It’s really starting to annoy me bc it makes me feel like I’m outside my body looking in on myself which makes me feel depersonalised, and it gives me the same kinda feeling you get when you’re being watched, it’s really uncomfortable and unnerving. Has anyone else ever gotten this and how have you coped with it?. Ok so I’m doing a degree in commerce and I’ve never really been doing as well as I want to be, I’ve been in a constant state of “once I get my shit together”. Had some bad anxiety earlier this year that impacted my study and made me feel even worse abt my lack of success. Anyway so this friend is doing a degree in a field unrelated to business and she gets into the most prestigious consulting group in my uni. I actually felt sick when she told me bc how tf is it fair that someone doing a completely different degree is doing better than I am IN MY OWN FIELD! She has mentioned multiple times in a haha funny way that she just kinda makes shit up when they start talking abt super business stuff. And don’t get me wrong she’s smart but it’s unfair bc 1 her major is a lot easier than mine, I did a class in it and got a distinction without watching a single lecture and 2 she literally doesn’t have a job so of course it’s easier for her to do all these extra internships and get great marks. This literally makes me sound like the worst friend in the world but whenever she brings it up I’m just like 😀 greattttt so cooolAnyway I started going to a therapist for some unrelated issues but how do I bring this up without just like completely changing the subject out of no where. Obviously I’m not the first person here to criticise her but I can’t get over how narrow her vid on low grade npd is. She basically just describes someone immature and annoying. All the traits are the most surface level “they love social media”, “they don’t clean up after themselves”, “they care too much about there looks” “they’re obsessed with celebrities”. It’s actually cartoonish.Low grade npd can range from like she said a slack parent who only partakes in the fun parts of parenting to a overbearing parent who will go above and beyond to make sure their kid is perfect bc they are a reflection of themselves. It can be constantly needing a romantic partner for validation or avoiding romantic relationships out of a crippling fear of rejection. It can be slacking on “adult tasks” or micromanaging your household to prove your competency.I just watched healNPD’s video on how ppl with npd often get health/illness anxiety and I was wondering if any of you get this?Personally I’ve had a lot of health anxiety for a while, and I have always thought that it had something to do with my need for perfection, need for control, need to be be successful and incredibly high standards I hold myself to, bc obviously having a horrible disease or condition would hold me back from all those things. It makes a lot of sense bc I don’t have much medical trauma or anything else I could think of that would cause this obsession with my health.I often find myself hating teen dramas, especially set in highschool that are supposed to be “relatable” bc I get so jealous and insecure abt the characters having a more interesting highschool experience than I did. It’s actually an issue, I stopped watching stranger things when they all got into relationships bc how the fuck is eleven in a relationship yet I’m not, stopped watching sex education for the same reason, and there’s countless tv shows I won’t even try bc I know I’ll hate them for that reason. Also often when watching tv shows or movies I come to despise the “main character” or the person who is supposed to be the “good guy”. Some examples:- Aria from pll - Scott and Allison from teen wolf- Serena and Dan from gossip girl- Daenerys from got- rhaenyra from hotd- Spider-Man- Every single character in riverdale- Nancy and Jonathan stranger things- Rachael from friends- Jane from Jane the virgin (couldn’t get past ep1)-Rory from Gilmore girls (again couldn’t get past ep 1)- Haven’t even bothered watching vampire diaries bc I know I’m gonna hate Elena - Luke skywalker- Gabriella from hsm - Literally every single main character from any Disney or Nickelodeon show (especially the female ones for some reason)Sometimes I worry I have internalised misogyny but then I do have an unhealthy obsession with female “villains” or women with issues like Blair Waldorf, Cersei Lannister, Alicent Hightower, spencer Hastings, Jade from victorious, fallon carrington from dynasty and sharpay evensAnyway just rambling bc I need to get my hatred for these characters out somehow. If anyone has any show recommendations lmk lol. The way I become incredibly anxious, intimidated and basically just seize up around anyone who has a higher social status than me, or is in a position of power above me or who I view as higher up the hierarchy of whatever situation I’m in is so pathetic it’s embarrassing. Its as tho I switch from grandiose to vulnerable depending on how I view/the status of the ppl around me. It’s gotten better after highschool bc there’s less social hierarchy but it still sucks at work bc I can never be the confident outgoing version of myself, or have a decent relationship with my bosses bc of this. And I can never actually impress the ppl I care to impress, only looser I don’t particularly want to associate myself with 😂. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship so obviously I don’t have personal experience with heartbreak or relationships issues (apart from my best friend of 3 yrs ghosting me), and I dunno if it’s lack of empathy or something but I genuinely don’t understand a lot of ppls relationships issues. Like whenever someone get really upset abt their relationship I can’t help but think either it isn’t that bad and you should get over it or it is that bad and break up. Like currently my sister is heartbroken over some guy she never even dated and I just don’t get it? I know it’s wrong and I should never blame the victim but whenever someone starts talking abt the way they were treated in a past relationship I can’t help but judge them for staying in the first place. Like I saw someone on another sub post abt how their abusive ex straight up told them a month into the relationship that they abused every person they were with, and it makes it hard to even feel sympathy for them bc why tf would you even stay after that?. So it seems as tho ppl with npd often didn’t suspect they had it or self diagnose themselves with it, and that they can be in denial when they do get diagnosed with it. And ppl seem to blame this entirely on the narcissism but I can’t help feel as tho the way the media talks abt npd must be a slight contributing factor. Like if you search up npd on YouTube or tiktok or any other social media 90% of the results focus on spotting and diagnosing npd in others. Stuff like “how to tell if your ex is a narc”, etc. Contrast this to how bpd or adhd or bipolar is talked abt where it’s focused on whether you have it with stuff like “what it’s like living with __”. Like are we really surprised that no one is self aware when the way npd is talked abt doesn’t promote self reflection and instead just encourages ppl to point the accusatory finger at others?. Curious to see if there’s anything certain things that actually make you feel empathy?Like seeing other ppl emotionally suffering doesn’t make me emotionally suffer. (Although it does make me uncomfortable bc now I have to comfort them and I’m not very good at that) However there are some things that make me feel:1) physical pain, I hate seeing ppl get physical hurt, I hate watching “funny” fail vids where ppl get hurt, it just grosses me out.2) wholesome videos, like the ones that are supposed to restore your faith in humanity, they makes me happy3) movies, sad movies make me sad The more I think abt empathy the more it confuses me, why does a video of a child I don’t even know beating cancer make me feel but my friend crying in front of me doesn’t?. Ok so I have a very high opinion of myself. I basically think I’m better than the large majority of ppl overall. I definitely think I’m self righteous, and I do curse a lot (not sure how that relates).I’ve always been a chronic daydreamer, and the daydreams always involve an alternate universe where I’m super rich, famous and/or powerful, with a great partner and great friends. I often get a kick out of feeling powerful, like when I can tell someone is intimidated by me, or I’m put in a position of authority.The thought of living an average life where I never amount to much terrifies me. I recently turned 21 and I feel like I’m spiraling bc I haven’t achieved the level of success I dreamed of. I do feel entitled to opportunities I don’t have the grades for, but I understand why they can’t break the rules for me.I find myself getting incredibly jealous of ppl when they achieve something or get complimented, I don’t feel happy for them. I don’t resent them for their achievements but sometimes I do have to remind myself of their flaws just to reassure myself.I’ve also started questioning whether I actually feel emotional empathy, I definitely feel cognitive empathy, but I don’t actually feel sad when someone else feels sad. I have also always thought I was slightly emotionally stunted, like when I get bad news abt someone else I always feel like I’m more focused on how I’m acting than actually feeling.That being said none of this has ever caused me any issues externally. I’ve always been good at keeping friends, and my friends never have issues with me. I also hate loosing friends and see having a lot of friends as a flex so. I’m also genuinely interested in their lives. I guess I’m very conscious of how I’m perceived so I make sure not to boast, or put others down to bring myself up, not to show I’m envious of their accomplishments, not to show I think they’re just not as good as me. I’m also not very quick to anger, I’m not vengeful and tend to be relatively resilient. I can brush off criticism relatively easily although I’ve never had anyone say anything genuinely insulting abt who I am as a person so I don’t know how I would respond if they did. Anyway am I a narcissist or am I just going through a quarter life crisis lolNPI -28, codependency- 1, ocd-4. Basically the title. Is anyone here good at hiding their narcissism feelings or tendencies around their friends bc they know loosing friends would be too much of a blow to the ego. Does anyone keep a decent amount friends for a long time without getting bored of them? Does anyone have some interest in their friends lives even if they don’t majorly care?. Ok so what Kim said on that phone call was just wrong, period. But I can’t pretend that I wouldn’t be fed up if I was Kim.For one the whole issue abt d&g made no sense, and the way kourtney kept trying to turn it on Kim and psychoanalyse her to say that she was wrong for being ambitious and wanting to challenge herself was really weird and annoying. Especially when she wanted to have that useless conversation she wrote notes for, only for the notes to not include a single thing abt how she feels and to be basically be trying to give Kim a therapy session and once again imply there’s something inherently wrong with her bc she’s ambitious.Then with the phone call, kourtney brings up the looks and aesthetics only to argue that it’s got nothing to do with that two seconds later? Then go straight into calling her egotistical, selfish and attention seeking when the conversation up until that point had been relatively civil, and accuse her of not being happy for her at her wedding. I’m mot surprised Kim snapped when kourtney has been implying for ages that Kim is fundamentally flawed and unfulfilled for wanting to challenge herself.As an older sister I understand it can build resentment watching a younger sister become more “successful” than you, but I’d never demonise my younger sister for wanting to be successful. And the therapy doesn’t seem to be helping bc that’s the kinda thing they should be working on. If kourtney is as fulfilled and focused more on what truly matter than money as she claims, why did the d&g thing even matter? And why does it matter that Kim wants to challenge herself?. Just took my first dose of propranolol and now I’m freaking out thinking it’s going to kill me. Which is literally so stupid bc I have previously been on this medication for months and I never died. Like I can think logically but for some reason never believe it.If anyone is struggling with health anxiety I highly recommend Cherellethinks on YouTube. Her entire channel is dedicated to health anxiety talking abt her experience with it, physical symptoms from it, specific fears, tips on how to overcome it. She has loads of videos explaining basically every symptom you can think of and how anxiety can cause it. Her videos have actually helped me so much bc the more you understand health anxiety the easier it is to overcome.Ok so for the past month or so I’ve just had this semi constant dizzy/vertigo feeling, like I’m on a boat, or walking on a mattress, or like the ground underneath me in generally unstable. From what I’ve seen on here it’s not uncommon with anxiety but does anyone have any suggestions on how to get rid of it? I’ve seen ppl say that just trying to ignore it is the only way but its like trying to ignore a mosquito buzzing in my ear.I find myself frequently forgetting to do things I’m supposed to do often like ask the name of the person I’m speaking to on the phone, mention booking fees in emails etc. I tried putting post it notes on my computer to remind me but they kinda just blend into the background of my desk so I don’t notice them (if that makes sense).Ok the title probably doesn’t make much sense. Basically since March I’ve developed really bad health anxiety. I’ve always been a generally anxious person but this health anxiety especially the physical effects it has on me, isn’t like anything I’ve experienced before. In the past month I’ve gone from thinking I had a heart problem, to thinking I had Ms, to thinking I was going to have a psychotic break I’d never recover from, to some weird existential crisis, to thinking some medication has permanently damaged my brain. Anyway today I was worried that I wasn’t going to find a group for this uni group project. And it’s weirdly relieving that I even have the energy to worry abt uni. Given my anxiety at its worse causes me to completely disregard uni bc “what’s the point if I’m going to die”, the fact im worried abt is a pretty good sign. Hoping I get back to a point in my life where my anxiety is just over first world problems.Anyone else kinda worried abt when they’ll eventually have to move out of home? I’m 21 still living with my parents and they basically do everything for me (thank the lord). They do my washing, cook me dinner, do groceries, my dad even drives me to work. I actually don’t know what I’d do without them. How would I ever manage to do my own washing if I can’t even put my clothes away after my mum washes them? How am I going to feed myself every day if I struggle to make myself lunch? How am I supposed to get to work on time if I’m 15mins late every day my dad can’t drive me? How am I supposed to do the dishes if I can’t even remember to put my dishes in the sink? How am I supposed to keep a house clean if I can’t even keep my room clean? Not to mention paying bills, grocery shopping, house maintenance etc. And honestly I don’t know how much longer my parents will put up with me 😂. F21So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days? Is it safe to quit?I would ask my doctor but I can’t see her for another couple of days and I want to quit asap bc the longer I wait the more withdrawal symptoms I’ll get.So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days?. Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better. However now I’m scared of what happens when I eventually go off the meds. I’ve spent the entire day scrolling through “survivingantidepressants.org” and now I’m scared that the meds are going to permanently alter my brain and that if I ever try to go off I’ll have to endure months to years of withdrawal symptoms. Is this just my health anxiety talking or is this an actual valid concern? I’m tempted to stop now before I develop a physical dependency.Some extra context I only have very mild anxiety until March this year when I started spiraling thinking I had some terminal disease. Doctor said I had health anxiety. The anxiety subsided a bit over July but came back mid august. The main reason I wanted anxiety meds is bc I found it so hard to deal with the physical symptoms that came with the anxiety.Anyway if anyone has any advice, or can share their experience going through withdrawal that would be greatly appreciated.Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better.

It’s my 7th day on 25mg and I still have pretty bad brain fog, dpdr and just feel tired. Should I go up to 50mg or stay on 25mg until the side effects pass? Ideally I’d just go up to 50mg and get the side effects over and done with but I have to go to work and uni and if going up to 50mg makes the brain fog worse then I don’t know how I’ll manage.TLDR: my health anxiety keeps trying to tell me that these are brand new symptoms that I’ve never felt before when I know that I felt the same way last time I went into an anxious spiral.So I suffer from health anxiety, which got really bad abt 5 months ago where I basically spent an entire month thinking I had brain cancer. During that time I physically felt the worst: headaches, dizzy, fatigue, really bad derealisation which also made me feel like there was something wrong with my vision (there wasn’t I went to the optometrist), I kept feeling like I was seeing flashes of light or that my vision would black out for a millisecond (it was probably me just blinking 🙄), numbness down one side of my body, tingling, muscle twitches and jerks, a weird pressure at the back of my head and for some reason and ache in my leg. These all disappeared gradually after I got a clear mri back.Recently I’ve gone into another anxious spiral, started with vertigo which I thought was caused by the propranolol I take for my headaches, so I stopped taking it, which caused me to think I’d given myself heart problems, then I thought I had ms. Went to the doctor and she prescribed me sertraline. I know it’s supposed to make anxiety worse before it makes it better but I’m spiraling thinking I’ve permanently altered my brain, or that I’m going crazy. The derealisation is back in a big way, so is the numbness, pressure in the back of my head, tingling, muscle twitching and jerks. Anyway it’s like my brain can’t seem to wrap it’s head around the fact that I’ve been through all this before, that it was just anxiety, and that it passed when the anxiety got better. I feel like this is some brand new experience that I’ll never recover from even though I’ve been through this before and did get through it. I keep thinking “this is the worst I’ve ever felt” when I know for a fact it isn’t.Best way I can describe it is that I feel like I’m high. I’ve heard that sertraline works for depression before it works for anxiety and that anxiety gets worse before it gets better and I think that’s exactly what’s happening to me. I simultaneously feel happier and more anxious, basically how I feel after smoking. The same kind of emotional roller coaster of “I feel fine this is great” to “what if I never feel sober again” to questioning my own existence and the meaning of life. The kind of feeling where you’re mostly ok but constantly worried that you’re teetering on the edge of loosing your mind. Also feeling like I’m in a dream/ seeing everything through virtual reality glasses, dpdr feeling. Anyway I’m trying to stay positive and look at it as just a free high but I hate feeling like this 24/7, especially considering I have to study and go to work. Anyone else felt the same? And when does it go away bc I have uni tests soon and im finding it hard to concentrate while I feel like this😭Note I’m on this for health anxiety and some mild derealisation which is likely just a side effect of the anxiety.Ok so I started 25mg of sertraline 3 days ago for anxiety and the past two days have been alright, but today my anxiety has been way worse. I’m also getting pretty bad derealisation. I’ve had mild derealisation often from anxiety, but this time it seems to come with depersonalisation? Like I’ll look at my hand and I feels like I’m looking at someone else’s hand, as tho there’s some disconnect between me feeling what my hand is doing and me seeing what my hand is doing. It’s also making my anxiety wayyyy worse and sometimes I worry I’m going crazy or will never be the same again (catastrophising I know😂). Anyway did any of you have a similar experience and how long did it take to get better?. So obviously not everything has to have a point but is there any reason Daenerys is called Daenerys stormborn/ was born during a storm other than it being a fun fact and cool sounding name? As far as I know there isn’t any recurring motif of storms during her story, it isn’t related to any prophecy, it doesn’t have any symbolism etc. It is also more symbolic of house Baratheon in the same way fire is symbolic of house targeryen, winter symbolic of stark and gold symbolic of Lannister, so it seems weird that her nickname sounds more like a Baratheon nickname than a targ one. Does anyone have any theories on why it was included? Do you think it will be relevant later in the story?. Basically I have had pretty bad health anxiety for the past 6 months. When I get into an anxious spiral of thinking I have something I always get physical symptoms too. At the moment I’m getting pretty bad vertigo/dizziness. Like I feel as tho I’m on a boat and everything is moving slightly, and just a generally unsteady feeling as tho the ground I’m on could fall away at any moment. I went to my doctor and my blood test is fine, had an mri a few months ago which was fine, and she said there was nothing wrong with my ears. She prescribed me sertraline and I took it for a few days then started getting really bad side effects so I went off it. Has anyone else experienced this? Did medication help? Should I just push through the side effects?. Ok so I starting Sertraline 4 days ago for health anxiety. It was fine for the first 4 days, some anxiety, clenched jaw and sore eyes (could be unrelated) as a side effect but nothing major. But last night I randomly remembered that suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self harm were also a possible side effect and I just had this thought of “what if that happens to me and I hurt myself ”, and then my next thought was “you just thought abt it so it is happening to you”. Anyway ever since last night I keep having these recurring thoughts of self harm and it’s scaring the shit out of me bc never in my life have I ever thought abt it and really don’t want to hurt myself. I didn’t take the medication this morning bc I was scared it was going to make me loose my mind or something. Im booked into see my doctor in 2 days.Anyway has this happened to anyone else? Did these intrusive thoughts go away? It might just be one of those things where I’m scared of thinking abt something so i can’t stop thinking abt it so was I overreacting to stop taking the meds? Is it just my health anxiety convincing me I have mental health problems this time the same way it convinces me I have physical health problems? Is it even thinking abt self harm or is it just like intrusive anxious thoughts considering I don’t actually want to self harm at all and even the thought of it gave me a panic attack.Edit: if this is just a short term side effect I’d be fine to wait it out but, and this is probably just my delusional anxiety brain speaking again, I’m scared these intrusive thoughts will never go away.Some ppl believe that Rhaegars actions were misunderstood and that once we find out the real story and the real intentions behind his actions he’s going to be a way more sympathetic character and we’re all going to view him as some tragic hero. But I genuinely can not think of any big reveal that would make me like rhaegar as a person. If it follows the same “they were actually in love” story the show does it just makes him look stupid, reckless and irresponsible. If they pull some “he heard a prophecy and he thought he had to have a child with Lyanna to save the world” it just makes him look stupid and slightly delusional. How he treated Elia was shitty in literally any context. Unless it’s revealed that the whole time he was possessed by the three eyed raven I don’t see myself liking him. But is there any situation you could see yourself liking rhaegar?. So the great council that favoured viserys over rhaenys setting the precedent that any male relative would be favoured over a daughter. However was this precedent broken when all the lords swore fealty to rhaenyra over daemon? Obviously many would’ve preferred a son over rhaenyra but aegon wasn’t alive at that point so it’s kinda irrelevant.The other question is would targeryen precedent even matter? For every single other house in Westeros (as far as I know) a daughter would come before an uncle, eg. Cersei inheriting over kevan. Would the Baratheons stick to their rules of inheritance or would they follow the targ inheritance rules bc it’s the iron throne?Edit: another question? Say Robert dies without naming either as his heir would stannis ever swear fealty to the daughter? I know he considered rhaenyra a usurper so does this mean he would see his own claim as stronger?. Ok so watching hotd made me think abt how differently we view rhaenyra, her bastards and Alicent vs how we view Cersei, her kids and Ned. The difference probably just comes down to joffery being horrible but my question is what if he wasn’t. What if he was the picture perfect child, someone who would likely become one of the best kings in history. Would we still view Ned as this paradigm of honour, truth and righteousness? Also what if Joffrey didn’t exist and it was tommen who took the throne after Robert died? How would that change how we view things?. Ok I’m confused abt what the point of the hairnet was. Wouldn’t it have been easier and less risky for whoever poisoned joffery to just keep the poison crystal in their pocket or something? I assume they didn’t search everyone at the door, and if it was ollena who got the crystal when she fixed Sansa’s hairnet she would have had to keep it in her pocket for a while anyway. Also if anyone saw her breaking a crystal off Sansa’s hairnet it could look a little suspicious, so why take the risk and go through the hassle? Am I missing something?. I cannot stand when I hear ppl (mainly dany and sometimes Jon Stan’s particularly the ones on tiktok and tumblr ) try to argue about who the main character is or who is the titular character. I swear these ppl actually read a different series. Why would grrm create 24 povs, and a ridiculous amount of plotlines if the story was about one person saving the world. Why are they trying to reduce every other character to a side character and every other plot to a subplot. Also when they try and say the title is about a character, the ice and/or fire isn’t a person, it’s a broad plotline, a theme, an opposing force, a recurring motif.Ok rant over 😂. I hear ppl saying “she was homeless she was starving” etc. but was there ever a point where her and viserys were actually living on the streets?Ps: I haven’t read adwd yet so don’t get mad at me for not knowing. So GRRM said in an interview somewhere that there was 3 general plot lines: the “ice” plot line which is the wall, the others, the nights watch, bran etc., the “fire” plot line which is essos, slavers bay, dany and the dragons, then the kingslanding politics and war of the 5 kings plot line. Which out of the three is your favourite?Personally I prefer the kingslanding wot5k plot, and the essos and wall ones kinda bore me sometimes. Is that just me or is that a popular opinion?. I’ve seen a lot of posts recently comparing Daenerys to other characters recently and I think a lot of the arguments are pretty stupid.Basically most of the arguments go something like “when **insert evil character** does evil thing it’s not mad but when dany does it it is. “To me it’s not abt the actual action that make dany mad, it’s that her actions don’t match her words and the person she sees herself as. She constantly refers to herself as a liberator, a breaker of chains. She claims she wants to “break the wheel” and stop the cycle of powerful families fighting over the throne at the expense of ordinary ppl (which was a little dumb in itself bc she was just another powerful family fighting for the throne but anyway). Her entire thing was that she was different, that she was nothing like the ruthless tyrants who came before her, and that she was going to build a new and better world. However she then started doing things that went against this. Yes forcing ppl to kneel or die isn’t unusual at all, joffery did it after the battle of the Blackwater, stannis did it to mance etc. But she was supposed to be different, and there’s nothing liberating abt being told to submit or die. Now that in itself doesn’t make her mad, not being a liberator isn’t a sign of madness. The issue was that she didn’t change her view of herself to match her actions. She was still convinced she was a liberator and that she was nothing like the previous rulers despite doing the same thing. The madness was the disconnect between her actions and how she viewed herself not the actions by themselves.Ppl don’t consider Tywin or Arya or whoever else she gets compared to mad, bc their view of themselves is accurate. Tywin is not deluding himself into thinking he’s some messiah who’s come to liberate ppl. If he was he would 100% be considered an absolute basket case.Personally I wasn’t a huge fan of her going “mad”, I think it would’ve been better to see her make a conscious rational decision to be more ruthless and ditch the whole “break the wheel” thing.Also rant: I find it so stupid when ppl say stuff like “no one hated Cersei when she blew up the sept” “no one hated Tywin when he wiped out the reynes” bc those are literally some of the most hated ppl in the entire series, anyone who does like them likes them as a character not as a person.Ok so this guy decides he wants to get rid of Cersei and marry his middle aged fat abusive brother to a 16yr old. He decides the best way to do this is to convince his brother that the 16yr old looks like his ex crush who died almost 2 decades ago. He then goes up to the brother of the dead girl and straight up asks “hey does this girl look like your dead sister?” And he’s doing all of this bc he wants to suck off the 16yr olds brother.Then his brother dies and he decided he wants to make himself king seemingly just for the lols bc he has absolutely no claim.I mean obviously I’m simplifying it a lot and probably got some parts wrong but damn that’s absolutely deranged behaviour.Does anyone have any theories on how jaqen h’ghar ended up a prisoner? How does a faceless man get captured, they’re supposed to be the best assassins in the world it would be almost impossible to catch one. Was it part of some greater plan?. Ned bringing him back to winterfell would’ve been a huge risk if he looked like a textbook targeryen so would he have taken the risk and made up some story abt the mother being from Lys or something or would he have found somewhere else for Jon to live?. Obviously bran became the most useless and boring character when he came back from beyond the wall but the most annoying part was that his storyline and character development could have been super interesting. The idea of a young boy who all of a sudden has access to literally all information in the entire world has so much potential. I would’ve loved to see him struggle to figure out what to do with all the info, what to tell and what to keep secret, what is useful and what is useless, what is possibly an abuse of his powers and where should he draw the line on what he can and can’t do, struggle to actually convince ppl that he isn’t just making this all up, and realising that knowledge is unless you know what to do with it. Showing him as a young boy who’s is completely overwhelmed by all this info would have been so much more interesting than whatever tf they turned him into. It also didn’t make sense because knowing things doesn’t necessarily make you wise, so why did he all of sudden become a genius.Obviously it was an incredibly messed up “relationship” as dany was basically sold to him as a minor and assaulted, and she seemed to have some sort of Stockholm syndrome from it as she mostly looked back on him in a positive light and cared for him. What I hated was that they never showed her looking back and realising how messed up it was, and what a shitty, abusive person he was. They do have her speak abt the experience negatively in s7 when she first meets Jon, but then go back on that by having her talk to Sansa abt how he was one of the 2 men she’s ever loved. Which was just weird and contradictory. Showing her looking back positively on the relationship undermines how traumatising and horrible it was, and going through something like that would still be negatively impacting her. It gave a similar vibe as sansa’s “I’m grateful for my trauma” shit which was gross.To Tywin, his golden child as king would be the dream, and he could be hand. So he’d probably consider Jaime getting off the throne as the missed opportunity of a lifetime.
    [Post in question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/178g9wa/atm_i_hate_everything_including_this_sub/)I'm a bit drunk right now, but I calmed down and don't really feel cognitively impaired by the alcohol, but I tend to be a bit dramatic. There is no TRUE reflection, there is always a lense distorting my perception.*" I hate being self aware. It fucking sucks."*Being self-aware actually gives me mixed feelings. It sucks knowing who you are and seeing yourself make the same mistakes. Knowing your anger, jealousy etc. is irrational and getting even more angry at that fact. On the other hand, it gives me the possibility to intervene in those processes. I definitely saved friendships because of it and I managed to sometimes "catch" what was happening, preventing negative spirals. My anger etc. also seems to not last as long anymore (on average), so there are some major upsides to that.*"I feel like a caged circus lion. I JUST WANNA BE A FUCKING LION, but if I am, I'm gonna get put down."*I still feel like this to some degree. Not with as much seething rage, but it is definitely a fucked up situation. I don't feel "sick", I don't see myself as having an "illness". It just feels like I am this way. I'm selfish, arrogant and distant, and unfortunately, those are negative things for others around me. Spin it how you want it, on the inside we will probably always be assholes. I put on masks, fake empathy, fake emotions and lie about who I am, because nobody wants to *truly* see me the way I am. It's easy to say "I still like you" on Reddit, but experiencing who I am daily is an entirely different beast. Why would you want someone like this around? LIKE SERIOUSLY? Our internalized shame might be an exaggeration of how people would see us, but there's a reason we hate ourselves. Even the most self-aware of us, those who are truly doing their best, are faking shit. That little "sorry to hear that, that sounds difficult" when someone tells me something sad, that little smile when a kid smiles at me whilst I'm annoyed at its existence, that little "I love you too", when I know full well I only love the imaginary version of this person, and will never truly care about them the same way someone else could.*"What is "recovery" even supposed to mean? WHAT IN THE FUCK DO YOU RECOVER FROM? BEING YOU?"*Still don't really get that one.*"I get being narcissistic has really bad sides like shame, anxiety etc. I like to complain a LOT about it. But the truth is that our grandiose selves are INSANE at what they do, whilst all the others are just crying in a corner for the most minor of bullshit, whilst we shrugged off things they would have a mental breakdown from."*I guess most people aren't that fragile, grief, crying etc. actually seem to be relatively good ways to work through emotions. There is still a weakness in it that my entire being gets repulsed by.As for the "grandiose self": Certain things, like some types of criticism, rejection etc., are things I am much more weak to. That being said, it is also a type of strength that many people simply don't have. Staying functional and confident in situations others would get an anxiety attack in, being so used to acting people don't even suspect it to be faked and our ability to be rutheless are advantageous and can lead to very positive outcomes. There's a reason high funtioning narcissists tend to climb corporate ladders, it's not just because we manipulate people, it's because we have skillsets that go beyond most neurotypicals in certain situations. In the worst case I might feel ashamed when having to make difficult decisions like firing someone, but I'm certainly not gonna cry about it, and the ego is going to restore itself most likely to ensure functioning in high-stress environments.*"Why can't I just insult people for having stupid bullshit problems, have them insult me back, and then pretend nothing happened 5 minutes after?"*I still don't see that happening for most people at least. It's manageable, but damn sometimes it would be nice to just tell people what you think and NOT have to live with the consequences.*"Then you have to work with people who SO beneath you, it is an insult that they are even in the same UNIVERSE as you."*Very hyperbolic, but idiots *are* frustrating. *"I just had a friend write me a msg that a pet died. "WHO THE FUCK CARES, SHUT THE FUCK UP" is what I'd like to say, but I know people are whiny bitches"*I don't need the message to be this aggressive, but yes, I don't care about your pet. I understand you're sad, but crying about that to someone would make me feel pathetic, so I resent it in you as well. Come to me when there's something to fix, I can't fix death. If I'm not a close friend of yours, don't even think about it.*" "Ohh the narcissist lies and manipulates" YES BECAUSE YOU DUMBFUCKS ARE INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SOMEONE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CAR BREAKING DOWN."*Extremely based. Past me is great.*"LOOK AT YOURSELVES YOU SHITS. YOU CANCER TO SOCIETY. Where the fuck was your flower dress made? How many people are ACTUALLY ENSLAVED because YOU can't humble yourselves to buy some 2nd hand shit. How many of you empath-fucks ignore EVERY homeless person, because you're "too busy" because you've gotta go home and watch TV. How long ago could you empaths have solved world hunger? How many diseases could we have eradicated if you actually voted for ALTRUISTIC THINGS instead of your fucking wallet?"*Even more based. I'd say it in a nicer way, but goddamn those empaths really don't have a lot of empathy outside their own circles. Most people could do a lot more for the world, but they don't really care, just like us. It's just that us not caring affects them.*"And now to this sub. This fucking disgusting sub. I KNOW some of you will understand, but then there will be those people who will say I'm not being EMPATHETIC AND INSIGHTFUL ENOUGH, NOT TRYING TO "RECOVER" ENOUGH whilst talking in a forum for NARCISSISTS.* *(...)**Those people who will give ACTUAL narcissists advice like "oh you gotta be better, you're hurting others" like DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CONDITION MEANS? FUCK OFF, NOBODY CARES. Tell me what* ***I*** *get out of it, tell me why* ***I*** *should care about your words."*I like the sub (mostly). A lot of you are great, insightful and just fun. I would, once again, choose less inflammatory language, but goddamn even in rage mode I'm just dropping truth bombs left and right. Becoming better people is generally a good thing though, even if it's just for us in the end.*"I will go back to being pro-social, it's best for me. But I fucking hate feeling sedated all the time by the expectations of others."*If I'm honest, people hate me. If I lie, people love me. Here I am, riding that fine line again, giving enough truth to not go insane and wearing enough masks to control people's opinions. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best I can do? Probably also no. But I guess it's better than my past self, it's better for others and it's better for me.*I'm not in the greatest emotional state rn, I'm aware I'm externalizing shit.

BEING YOU?All my problems may stem from trauma, abuse and god being a fucking bitch, but my problems RIGHT NOW stem from ME. Who I AM. Not from a "defense mechanism", not from some "mental disorder", no, it's from from WHO THE FUCK I AM. I CANNOT BE ME, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. HOW FUCKING DARE ANYONE TELL US WE CAN'T BE US?I get being narcissistic has really bad sides like shame, anxiety etc. I like to complain a LOT about it. But the truth is that our grandiose selves are INSANE at what they do, whilst all the others are just crying in a corner for the most minor of bullshit, whilst we shrugged off things they would have a mental breakdown from.And then they tell you about it. And they care about your reaction to their bullshit. HOW COME YOU CARE I DON'T FEEL SAD FOR YOU? How is that a problem to YOU? Why can't I just insult people for having stupid bullshit problems, have them insult me back, and then pretend nothing happened 5 minutes after?Then you have to work with people who SO beneath you, it is an insult that they are even in the same UNIVERSE as you. "boo hoo you called me a dumbass for being unable to do something after you explained it 5 times, YES I KNOW WHAT I DID DUMBASS FUCK YOU FOR BEING STUPID, STOP WASTING MY TIME, IT IS ACTUALLY VALUABLE COMPARED TO YOURS".I hate peoples emotional neediness SO much. I just had a friend write me a msg that a pet died. "WHO THE FUCK CARES, SHUT THE FUCK UP" is what I'd like to say, but I know people are whiny bitches, getting sad if a fucking bird flies against their window. I say GET FUCKED BIRD, FREE MEAL (okay I won't actually eat it though) as long as it doesn't take away from MY time by smearing blood all over the glass.I despise my own emotions, I don't cry about bullshit to people, except on reddit but you don't count (no offense). If I don't expect people to do that shit for me, WHY DO I NEED TO BE A NORMAL HUMAN FOR THEM? FUCK OFF!I feel like people don't actually care about the truth that much as long as you don't show it. I told a friend I had basically no affective empathy, and they were fine with it, BUT GUESS WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T SHOW ENOUGH EMPATHY FOR STUPID SHIT IN THEIR LIVES? "You're being so cold to me" YES, I TOLD YOU, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I MEANT YOU DUMBASS - is what I'd like to say, but OF COURSE I gotta keep up the mask and tell them "I was distracted, sorry" because if I don't it will spiral into an avalanche of people hating me for LITERALLY EXISTING AUTHENTICALLY."Ohh *the narcissist* lies and manipulates " YES BECAUSE YOU DUMBFUCKS ARE INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SOMEONE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CAR BREAKING DOWN.

I WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT, THAN SOMEONE SAY: "But what about the others uwu?"I don't want advice. I just wanted to complain. Maybe some people will *actually* relate, atm I don't care. I will go back to being pro-social, it's best for me. But I fucking hate feeling sedated all the time by the expectations of others, and being myself not being "okay", especially since those people aren't fucking worth my time anyways.If you offer me "insight" I will straight up insult you, I'm well aware of what I'm doing and what I need to do.I was texting an irl friend, and thought I'd try to be a bit vulnerable. I told them that a text of theirs offended me a bit, because they (correctly) assumed something was making me insecure. I also told them they were right and it's not a rational thing.They didn't even react negatively, just said they got to know me over the years a little bit, but I got overwhelmed by REALLY strong anxiety and got nauseous for letting the mask slip just a little. My hands were shaking, I couldn't think and I'm still on edge. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST FOR ONCE IN MY GODDAMN LIFE TO SOMEONE THAT KNOWS MY FACE. FUCK THIS.Edit: Not my proudest moment. Went to sleep afterwards. Gonna leave it up, but yikes I hate having that on my account (esp. the comment lol).I just learned that a friend of mine finished his Master's degree. I quit university instead lol.That friend invited us to celebrate that. I know rationally that they're great, worked hard and deserve it. But I feel so insecure right now, I fucking want it to be me. All I wanna do is shittalk that, and I would probably be very sarcastic and rude at the party whilst destroying the mood. I hate that I think, that they think, they're better than me. HOW AM I MEANT TO GO TO A PARTY FOR SOMEONE ELSE, WHO JUST ACHIEVED SOMETHING I DIDN'T? THIS IS CRUEL.I don't wanna ruin this friendship by being a giant asshole. Please what the actual fuck do I do to not hate myself this hard rn and be a normal human being for once?Edit: I guess the advice by Bath\_Kol pretty much fixed it, I just repeated that for a while lol. That was quick.I remember being a fairly young child. I remember seeing the beauty of the world. Loving people and animals. Being sad when a pet died. Being disturbed when another kid would hurt a spider. Wanting to help people just because I can.I remember being overly emotional even. Being fragile.Then, years of trauma. Being abandoned by everyone who took care of my emotional needs. Being ignored except if I got good grades at the end of the year. Hating life. Hating people.Now there's nothing. Whoever I was is gone, replaced by this strange emptiness. A feeling I need to avoid. A hole to fill (hehe sexual joke here).I don't miss that person. I don't miss being honest even if it hurts me. I don't miss caring about other's needs. I don't miss being fragile. But I miss feeling secure, at least sometimes, with someone who cares. Knowing who I am without asking.I wouldn't trade my current state for what was, I just wish this would have never been necessary in the first place. Ironic how "empaths" caused this, isn't it?Berry dramatic vulnerability, 7/10 on the "pity me scale".Hi! Sorry about the long post. New account for obvious reasons.Ever since I was a kid, I knew something was wrong with me, but the only thing I really understood was that I had a lot of social anxiety.I have been in therapy and on meds for depression + social anxiety. I took meds for only about a year (i forgot to take them and decided to just stop lol). The anxiety meds did nothing, the antidepressants were pretty good though. I was also diagnosed with ADHD by a psychologist, and then a psychiatrist but I don't take meds for that so it doesn't really matter.Anyways I was in therapy for about six years with 2 different therapists. I stopped after I felt I wasn't making progess, so right now I'm not in therapy.The problem is that my therapists, though probably pretty good with some patients, never really understood me (to be fair, I didn't either). We talked about some traumatic experiences and my emotional state, but I felt like my core symptoms (anxiety especially) never improved much. I told the second therapist that I don't have a lot of affective empathy, but despite that, it never amounted to much.There was one thing that therapy (unfortunately) did for me though: It made me realise I felt shame. I had a bit of a mental breakdown at that time, realising I don't know who I am etc. and prying into trauma and my mind all the time seems to have caused that. It was very unsettling and alien to me, I never felt that before and literally had to google what that emotion was since my next appointment was almost a week away. Shame is the worst feeling I ever had.I was in therapy for about 9 months afterwards. The shame never got significantly better (though I had a hard time confronting it, can't blame it all on the therapist I guess). But it did make me realise it was at the core of my anxiety.**Now to NPD / Pathological Narcissism**Since I had a lot of anxiety all my life, my narcissistic tendencies are really well hidden. I'm definitely grandiose on the inside and think that I'm better than most people (except those who I respect and who respect/admire me as well), but I never saw that as a problem (I still don't really care lol). If people who I respect slight me, that changes and they become part of the "beneath me" pile, paired with vengeful feelings etc. The anxiety taught me to mask well though, I can even admit flaws (usually things that aren't important or get sympathy).I try to control how people I interact with view me. Especially if someone has a negative opinion I discredit them (or what they might say) preemtively or try to ensure they don't interact with people "who matter". This is something I do, but it feels semi-conscious (I know I'm doing that, but it's pretty automatic). I also change how I act and what I say depending on the person or group, but usually in minor ways (I won't invent a new personality or some shit, but keep certain opinions to myself, agree with things I might not do on my own, get a bit more introverted/extroverted etc.). Basically I tend to modify reality with exaggeration / undertatements a lot, often times I omit some information, sometimes I flat out lie. This usually doesn't cause many problems since I mix in enough truth or make it believable / hard to disprove if I lie. This usually feels automatic, but I do it as a planned thing sometimes as well if I got myself into trouble / caught for something.My anxiety symptoms and depressed moods are VERY tied to how people view me. If I get praise/respect, or I'm the (positive) center of attention I become very confident. If I don't get that for a while I become very anxious, self hating and ashamed (thanks for that last one therapist, very cool!). I need regular reinforcement of people admiring me.I had a time where I was socially fairly isolated due to anxiety for prolonged periods. This was when I got prescribed depression meds. I believe the core reason was NPD, and not getting validation, but it *looked* like a regular depressive episode. The antidepressants worked really well, I became more outgoing, and when I stopped taking meds I never got even close to that level (I think I unconsciously built a network for validation aka a good social circle, so it wasn't possible to get there anymore).Criticism tends to make me very angry (except from the people "who matter", they can somewhat criticize me since I respect them enough. I still get a bit angry, but I know they respect me), though I rarely lash out since my anxiety is keeping most of my symptoms hidden. If I enact revenge it is usually in a covert, backstabby way.I fantasize about being rich / famous every single day, and that seems to be the basis for some of my grandiosity (I'm bascially entitled because I will be successful, but also because I'm smart etc.).I have no idea who I am, everything I do is to improve myself (to be successful), and to be successful so that people will admire and envy me. What exactly I do to achieve that doesn't matter much as long as it's respected.I can have hobbies on my own, but I always have an imaginary audience I perform for. E.g. I sometimes make music. I don't share it (it is bad), but I fantasize about how people will respect me for it, interview me, etc.I don't care much for most people, I don't feel bad for them if something bad happens to them (like their parent/dog dies etc.), I can actually get kinda annoyed and bored talking about their feelings and their life (but sometimes I find certain things very interesting, as I want a great understanding on how humans work). I still listen to them, since I know it's required for friendships and I understand that they are suffering, but I don't get very invested. If I hurt someone (and it has consequences, esp. if it might affect my relationships / status) I can feel shame. I am not sadistic though, so I usually have no reason to hurt people. If I do it's one of those semi-conscious self defense tactics to protect my ego & status. I try to be conscious of and avoid them since it's better for myself not to hurt people and I don't want to feel shame for the (mostly social) repercussions.One last thing (that kinda makes me question some things about it being NPD): I tend to have weak boundaries when people ask for help. I expect praise of course, and if they aren't thankful they become part of the "hate list" and then the "beneath me list" so to speak. But I feel like they will judge me negatively if I say "no", which causes a lot of anxiety, so I usually go along with it. On the other hand if people try to hold me accountable for things I should have done / fucked up I might actually lash out, so idk, seems like there are some boundaries that get heavily enforced if it threatens my self-esteem, but I have a hard time being as selfish as I actually feel on the inside.I'm gonna cut the symptoms here, there's more but the post would become the length of a book.Anyways I'm fairly certain it's NPD (I certainly have high levels of narcissism). I'm open to other suggestions on what might be going on, but I don't feel like the other cluster B things fit very well (I would have preferred ASPD but that's just not the reality lol). I kinda tend to mind-fuck myself and others, so I could also be too biased with this to make an accurate assessment, but this behavior and the feelings have been very consistent. I became aware I might be narcissistic about a year ago and things haven't changed much, so I think I'm probably not just mind-fucking myself.The question is whether I should get a diagnosis and if you agree it might be NPD or if I'm missing something. I feel like I can handle a lot on my own since I became more self aware, but I still struggle with shame and anxiety. Those 2 feelings are the only reason I would consider therapy, but past therapy didn't do much for that.I also don't want people in my life to find out. Narcissism has very negative connotations even if you're trying not to be a dickhead unnecessarily. Not sure if a diagnosis could fuck me over. At the same time, I want some confirmation to finally figure out what is wrong with me since, whatever my condition is, is not fun at all (except the \[supposed\] grandiosity, it's the best).Anyways some questions:\- Do you think this is NPD?\- Do you have a suggestion on how to "reality check" my internal experience?\- Do you recommend getting a diagnosis? If so, why?\- Do you have any tips on anxiety and shame that aren't "confront them and self love"? I tried that for almost a year with almost no effect.Thanks for reading my post (if you did). I know it's a lot of words but it is the culmination of years of self reflection. I just wanna know what's wrong with me and how to tackle the 2 worst emotions in my life.I will do my best to be cordial in the comments, but I'm kind of narcissistic about being narcissistic if that makes sense. Please forgive me if I get defensive if you question that lol, I really am trying to have an open mind though.Edit: Btw I'm 25 yrs old, I'm not going through a teenage identity crisis lmaoAdditional things in case you're interested:[NPI Results](https://psytests.org/result?v=dtrbVE0j)[PNI Results](https://psytests.org/result?v=dtriWp5ar1SQ)NPI: 30codependency: 6OCD: 1.
    Zhongli is obviously the strongest shielder in the game - and he’s geo, an element that doesn’t help with Scara’s passive at all. If you have a well built Layla or another 4 star elemental shielder would that potentially be better than Zhongli because of the swirl passive?. And I don’t understand why, because I genuinely loved my ex. There was no reason to hurt him, he never did anything to me and yet I still did. I just want to get better.If he’s not an unreleased element I honestly think he’s going to be cryo or pyro. Pyro - he has immense dedication to “forbidden” sciences, a common trait with pyro characters, like Yanfei with the law. It’s kind of similar to hydro but hydro is usually loyalty to an ideal or a community, something he doesn’t really have.Cryo - This is based on an analysis I saw once about how he got along with Scara because he viewed them as both outcasts, he wants to be a mysterious outcast with no friends, but he also felt betrayed that Scara left him. Most cryo characters have some sort of internal conflict which this could qualify as.I personally want him to be dendro though.I live in the pnw and rarely travel outside of it so this is mostly using it as a reference. Moonwood mill: a small town on the major river where most people don't usually go that most people consider the "poor part of copperdale". Copperdale: the bigger "sister city" to moonwood mill, where most of my werewolf teens hang out Forgotten hollow: an older neighbourhood of copperdale where the eccentric rich vampires live that most ignoreSan myshuno: like Portland/seattle but better. The adults go there on their dates and stuff and bring the kids to festivals BriteChester: the University district of San myshuno. Willow creek, newcrest, magnolia promenade and San sequoia: suburbs around San myshuno. I just put any venue types that I can't fit in copperdale or moonwood mill into newcrest. Does anyone know how to duplicate moonwood mill without getting duplicate townies?. For me it would be a taxidermy/bug collecting/hunting themed pack. Edit: wow I cannot physically read all of these replies but all of you have good ideas. Some great mod creators are adeepindigo and lumpinou, they might have what you're looking for. My current plant care app Greg paywalled the watering schedule. YES THE WATERING SCHEDULE. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF HAVING A PLANT. Any good alternatives?. I'm playing rotational gameplay and it gets really annoying when I switch to my family that I view as Christian from the Jewish family and I have to redo the calendar 💀. with the updater. I ran an update and now I can't connect, the game freezes up even when I play it in online mode with the correct remid. Hypothetical question. Expansion packs: basic things about life you have to pay 40 bucks for but at least they have big worlds! (which are progressively shrinking) Game packs: interesting lore, small worlds but with more things to explore, actually uniqueIf I just had all the game packs and seasons I would be happy. I love Moonwood Mill and I wish I could put more buildings there. I imagine that Copperdale is its bigger sister city but it's still not exactly the same.Look, I was excited for the infant update just like anyone else. And it was tolerable when I was playing before I got growing together. Now I have to spam a stupid interaction like 100 times just to get the "milestone" to let them sit in the high chair. I don't care if it's realistic, there should be an option to turn that off. I feel like a lot of people are mad about the infant stuff being paywalled, and don't get me wrong, that's valid, but also you do NOT want to deal with infants with growing together.Is a politician in town or something??. I want the micropet reward but I invited them before the feature became a thing, they're on my tree town but don' t show up on the invite friends thing. Where can they put in the invite code? They joined around a month ago. This sounds like a stupid question now that I’m typing it but I love those trees and I want to find one (edit: preferably near sheldon/oakway center area). like with jesus. They’re all over my yard. I know they’re edible but taste pretty bland. Any ways I can sweeten them or anything?. I want to adopt and/or foster children sometime in the future. The problem is, I’m vegan. But I won’t be raising these children from birth, I plan to foster ages 8-18, and it seems unethical to force a lifestyle choice like this on them when they haven’t been vegan for most of their lives. All I can do is explain to them why I follow this philosophy, but can I really call myself vegan if I allow kids under my care to fuel the meat industry?.
    She was using birth control, she has been throwing up every morning for the last two weeks.I told her it's ultimately her choice. I'm not trying to influence her decision.However, she seems dead set on the abortion.I told her I would try to gather up some money to pitch in for her abortion.We live in Georgia (us).I'm not sure what the next steps forward are, how I can help, or what I can do to support her.We aren't friends, we were just fuck buddies. So I don't know how to not over step boundaries.She started dating someone after we stopped hooking up.I'm not sure how to proceed, any advice would be appreciated. I'd also appreciate any useful links or resources.Thanks in advance.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2023.04.012Pretty cool in the world of psychopathology, if you do research In psychopathology, have a mental health condition, or are a cognitive neuroscientist; I'd say it's worth reading.. https://youtu.be/9wg3v-01yKQ?si=UeuKx34SGOeo-2vsI feel like a witty and rebellious badass, but I'm just a abrasive, socially inept, and egotistical dweeb.What does your inflated sense of self look like? How does your inflated self compare to your normal self, or rather how much of your identity actually aligns with who you really are?. So once I started college I essentially decided to give everyone rooting for me a big fuck you by feeding into my grandiosity; being a smartass, and taunting people on my Facebook. I dug a hole I can't get out of, unfortunately.I also neglected my friendships that I made at college, now I think they don't wish to interact with Me, they seem to avoid me. Now? I'm dealing with crippling lonliness.The only relief I get from said lonliness is when I hook up with my fwb, or interact with people from dating apps before one of three things happen.A). I scare them off, bore them to death, or weird them out.B) they find someone else.C) I think to myself, "This person is far too nice to be a victim of my assholery" and I ghost them or explain that I don't think we are compatible.I mean a fwb is nice, at least I'm not totally alone.My bros are all busy being adults.I don't love most of my family, and try to avoid the ones that I do love, they are exhausting and just as toxic as I am.The people I had on Facebook that were supporting me and interacting with me were all scared off when I showed how full of myself I was.Oh well, my goofy actions have silly consequences I guess 🤷‍♂️.So once I started college I essentially decided to give everyone rooting for me a big fuck you by feeding into my grandiosity; being a smartass, and taunting people on my Facebook.

I am broke, and due to a flair up of a chronic mental illness last year, I went into temporary debt and lost my car.Due to wanting to focus on my mental health and learning to cope with said condition, I don't plan on dating anytime soon. However, I would like to make more connections and have casual non romantic relationships. I do like to go for coffee, long drives, and spend time together.Due to social stigma, I am always afraid to admit that I'm broke, and won't have a car for at least another year or so.I feel a lot of shame for it, but unfortunately my best path forward in terms of chasing my long term goals involves me slowly acclimating to college life, and focusing on my studies before I work and go to college. *However*, my free time isn't just spent being lazy. I am a part of SGA, a club, and have been working a lot towards my research project towards this year's symposium.Next semester I've thought about doing work study, but I need to prioritize my academic endeavors. If I want a PhD in the distant future, I have to build a good academic portfolio and have a solid academic record to show I'm ambitious and willing to work hard for my goals.Am I being silly? Is this sort of situation a turn off for most women? I feel like a bit of a bum, but I need to make sure I keep my mental illness under control, and unfortunately that means limiting what stress I take on.I'd appreciate any insight, thanks in advance.I've kept up a false image for so long, my counselor has even said she was taken aback, and she didn't realize these things. She said she could tell I often said what she just wanted to hear, but she didn't know I was dealing with these things.I told her about how my relationships typically fail, or I get bored and move onto the next one.I told her about how I project an outward appearance to the world to protect me from feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness. I told her about my feelings of resentment and bitterness, the need for me to feel powerful so I don't feel weak, my need for external validation and *blah blah blah*.She said she couldn't diagnose me, but I seem self aware enough to work with her, which is good.I've felt like I needed to defend myself from people figuring me out, from knowing I'm weak and vunerable, from knowing I'm not as wise, confident, stoic, charming, and put together as I seem.She said that she has another NPD client who has worked hard to recover, and he has his moments, but he has more control over his symptoms and is able to live a somewhat normal life.She said it was good that I was open, because she felt like I was only saying what I thought I should say for the longest time.It feels like a weight has been lifted off my chest, I was very anxious during my session, but I am feeling hopeful, less angry, and feel better about finding contentment.Cringeworthy emotional vomit aside, what was getting diagnosed and getting help for the first time like for you guys?I don't relate to being taken aback, it's actually freeing for me. I knew something was wrong upstairs in the old noggin, but just didn't know what, until the last 2 to 4 months.As a preface, I'm not sure what cluster B traits I have, sorta in the process of sorting that out. I know Narcissistic ones seem to be the predominant ones, with borderline pd traits being secondary to those. My brain is a cesspit of symptoms and edgy jokes.I met this person on tinder, but over the last week and a half or so, we grew very close *very* fast. She was the only person other than my current fwb that I've been open with about my narcissistic traits.We shared a lot of values, we are both Satanists, grew up in conservative Christian households, and had God awful childhoods.Well, we established that we would have a temporary relationship until she moved to Atlanta next year. I was fine with that, and we both had permission to have casual sex outside of the relationship, and date other people as long as we kept each other informed.Anywho, we got excited about spending time with each other, and she eventually was able to see me under the condition that her friend would come, she had to take her friend in a nearby town, so she came and saw me.Well, about 55 minutes into her being at my house and us hanging out. Her ex started blowing up her phone, getting mad that she was at my house.He kept asking does she like me, and she said yes. He made her choose in between him and me, and said that that was his ultimatum. She said right there in front of me, him. A controlling and possessive twat. Which hurt pretty badly, and they could both tell( her and her friend). However, I got over it and realized that she has her reasons, and I don't own her.However, I woke up feeling bad. Asked to talk about what happened, she said her boyfriend said we couldn't be intimate or anything, and said we could only be friends. Which upset me pretty badly. I asked If I could have some time to myself to process thingsI decided it would be best if we parted ways, I was in a bad headspace and didn't want it to make it her problem.This is what I said "Hey __, I've thought about it and I think it's best that we cut contact. I'm sorry, but I'm bitter and upset right now. Don't want it to affect you, and my feelings are too hurt to be rational or not be avoidant. I'm sorry I'm too much of a crybaby to be friends with you, but I really liked you and I'm dealing with a good bit of emotional distress atm. I think it's just best if we part ways. For what it's worth, I really enjoyed spending time and getting to know you and __. Again, I'm not angry, just pretty sad. I'm sorry"She got worried and asked if we could please be friends, I felt horrible for upsetting her. So I said yes.She said sorry already, but I am still feeling like dog shit. I can normally handle rejection fine, I just move on to the next source of love and affection or focus on myself for a month or so.I have no one to talk to, my guy friends have no clue how to comfort someone, my college friends are likely not my friends anymore, due to me always bailing on plans and isolating myself, and my twin sister is "too busy" whenever I ask to confide in her.I have nowhere to direct my frustration. I tried to ask my fwb If she wanted to meet up, that way I could feel somewhat better through physical affection. She said we couldn't tonight.I don't understand why *this particular rejection* is so devastating for me. I'm a socially awkward weirdo with little to no rizz and poor mental health, it happens often. I am just super upset and don't know how to sit with the feelings. I've tried to force myself to cry, but nada. Can't get any relief.I am assuming so, because it seems like I haven't seen very much literature over theoretical computational models of neuropsychiatric illnesses, and parallels found *in vivo*.With the exception of things like autism, and psychosis.When I eventually get to my PhD, I'd like to help close that gap.I think it's feasible given that the virtual brain was a pretty good success, and things like the virtual epileptic patient were created.I plan to start working on modeling and understanding complex systems asap. For next semesters Under Grad research symposium, I'd like to model the behavior of flocking birds native to this area of the u.s. I plan to run some experiments and see how they react to different stimuli.I think it'll be interesting given the fact that they display collective forms of intelligence, i.e swarm intelligence.Anywho, I just wondered if my long term plans should be adjusted or not.I am assuming so, because it seems like I haven't seen very much literature over theoretical computational models of neuropsychiatric illnesses, and parallels found *in vivo*.With the exception of things like autism, and psychosis.When I eventually get to my PhD, I'd like to help close that gap.I think it's feasible given that the virtual brain was a pretty good success, and things like the virtual epileptic patient were created.I plan to start working on modeling and understanding complex systems asap.

She made me feel alive. Well I was home from college for the weekend, she had to get her friend and help her get her friends stuff from her friends ex's house in a nearby town. She said she wanted to see me she would be nearby. Well her and her friend showed up, and we just talked and got to know each other for about an hour or so. Then her ex kept blowing up her phone. He was possessive, and controlling her still. He was mad that she was hanging out with me. He wouldn't stop calling her when she said she wanted to spend time with me, and that they agreed they wouldn't limit who each other saw, as long as they kept each other in the loop.Eventually after him spamming the call button, he asked "do you want to be together or what __, because you're at this dudes house and *blah blah blah*. She said yes, and I instantly felt my heart sink. I wanted to cry, because I felt strongly for her. However, I didn't want to make her feel bad. After she eventually got him to leave her alone, she asked If I was OK, and so did her friend. I guess they could look at me and tell I was upset, because they said "you look upset". I eventually told her, "yeah my feelings are kind of hurt, but I understand and I don't want you to feel pressured to cater to my upset feelings, I promise I'll be ok". She said "I feel bad" I reassured her and she wanted me to hug her. I did, and after I beat myself up mentally for 2 to 3 minutes, that same dead and empty feeling set back in. I acted happy and cheery. She asked for a hug before she left, and I gave her one. Didn't feel connected to her. Didn't feel much of anything.I took my prn anxiety medication so I could go to sleep peacefully and forget about everything.I just woke up, and it's been on my mind.I notice in every emotionally upsetting situation I've been in, I feel rather disconnected from my emotions.I use dark humor to get through those situations, fake being upset because it's expected, or am dismissive/avoidance about the situation.I feel sort of dead all the time, and I realized several months ago that I am carrying a lot of grief from my childhood, or rather the childhood that was robbed from me. I was too busy trying to survive to have a meaningful childhood. I had brief amounts of positive time periods, but they were just temporary distractions from the abuse and or the fact that my home environment was terrible.I sort of guess apathy is a coping mechanism for me. Given the fact that I already have a shit ton of grief weighing me down. It would be nice if I could cry myself to sleep, but it rarely happens. I move on from relationships like nothing happened, and whenever things are over with this chick, I'll likely do the same. However, I feel a bit more strongly towards her, and am more upset. I just doubt I feel anything past writing out this emotionally charged post. I would like to be able to fully process the disappointment, but my psyche would rather me express the grief as self loathing, which causes me to externalize the uncomfortable feelings as antagonism.I'm not looking for validation that this person is shitty, or anything of that nature.I'm wondering if any of you have dealt with similar feedings, and am wondering how I approach dealing with this.I'd appreciate any insight, thanks in advance.I am doing a presentation on November the 14th, my research advisors over my research project are my pre Calc professor and the psychology professor. They have been guiding me since I started living on campus and started my project. It was an independent project, I'm not presenting for any class.It's over the virtual brain, and it's impact on the world of neuroscience. https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zweiI've already got an idea of what my next research project will be next semester.There are a group of flocking birds native to this area. These birds are are always foraging for food around campus. They display emergent forms of behavior, I am thinking maybe I can run a series of experiments with the help of students, but I need resources to aide me. I plan to see how the birds react to different stimuli, and see if it affects the groups as a whole. Unlike this semesters research project, it will involve actual research, my current one is much moreso trying to discuss the impact of a large project related to artificial brain simulation.I joined SGA and plan on meeting with the dean of students to see If we can get some funding or resources for students like me. It's a long shot since this is a small community College, but I have a nack for annoying people until I get what I want, and I can be fairly persuasive.I have and will always be a neuro nerd, but problem is that I self taught myself the basics of neuroanatomy, psychopharm, and psychopathology. Have been reading literature since I was 14 or so, I'm 20 now. For 2 years, I did nothing but read literature. 2 to 4 hours a day was spent reading literature during my worst bouts of depression. I'm bored with intro stuff, but I'm too lazy to teach myself the advanced level neuro stuff, I was working with the virtual brain several months ago, and had fun with it. However, I wanted to bash my head into a wall at times, trying to figure out the basics of brain modeling and whole brain networks. I'm bored and curious, but lazy.Don't get me wrong, I have *plenty* to learn. I am much more educated than the general population in relation to psychology and neuroscience, but much less than those with professional degrees. I'm bored with college life, and want to put my brain to good use, so I feel like research projects will help satisfy my itch for independence and satisfy my curiosity, it'll also look good on my academic record, I'm sure.However, I'm wondering if I'm doing this for no reason.I wonder if any of this stuff is relevant to my long term goals of going for a comp neuro PhD.Furthermore, I am risking stressing myself into being unwell, I have mental health issues.So I'd just like to know if doing independent research projects is best for me at the undgraduate level.I'd appreciate any insight, thanks in advance.

She was 24, I was 18. She had me fooled.I was completely open with this person, I've told her things I've never told another living soul. She did the same to me.Unfortunately, she turned out to be abusive, and I wasn't ready for a relationship. I was head over heels for this person, to the point where I was dependent on her. I was a sick individual in hopes of being fixed.Things went south and I was dumped. I can't tell you how painful that was. I had fucking dreams about her getting fucked by someone else for two months after I was dumped, I cried myself to sleep night after night for weeks after it. It's the only time I felt such a heartbreakAfter that, I subconsciously sought out similar relationships. She had bpd, and externalized most of her symptoms. Without me even realizing it, I attract other folks with bpd. I've jumped from relationship to relationship seeking out that comfort, to no avail. 3 of my 5 relationships were with someone with bpd. Ive had hookups and have talked to a few other folks with bpd as well.I create an emotional block from me and the people I date in order to keep myself from feeling that bond with someone else again, to feel that level of pain again. I prefer apathy over heartbreak.It makes me a mid to terrible partner, but that level of pain was unfamiliar to me.Recently, I've met someone else (news flash, she has bpd). I feel for her, strongly. I don't know why, I assume it's my subconscious comparing her to my first relationship. I'm normally not dependent or a clinger, but whenever I'm not talking to her I'm uncomfortable. She's coming over to my college in two days, and staying the night. I'm thrilled to meet her, but scared.Strong feelings are always terrifying for me. I haven't cried in front of someone in nearly a year.I've confided in her and told her this.She's moving up state in a few months (or so she says), and I'm afraid I'm setting myself up for heartbreak.Vunerability is terrifying, so much so that I project an outward appearance of strength, confidence, and stoicism. At least try to anyways.I've had intense relationships with other people since my first heartbreak, but I've never felt this strongly for someone I've just met since my first relationship.It's enthralling, I feel alive. The apathy and self loathing is replaced with positive feelings. I'm terrified though. Letting my guard down is what I crave, but it's scary. Did it when I was a kid, to be disappointed time and time again, did it with someone I love, and I was heartbroken as a result.Anywho, sorry for the cheesy love letter. Some of you may be vomiting or cringing, but these are my genuine feelings, swearzies 🤞.This is more of a vent, but if any of you have any insight to offer, I'd appreciate it.Not sure if you guys are knowledgeable about this, but it happens enough that I figured it might be worth mentioning.I have some diagnosed mental health issues, but I have a disordered personality and when I've sought out a diagnosis of BPD, I wasn't taken seriously. I'm older now, and I know there's more to the picture, BPD in particular seems to be sort of hyperfeminized.Women suffering from NPD or ASPD are often misdiagnosed with BPD instead, and men with BPD or HPD are often diagnosed with NPD or ASPD instead.Furthermore, ASPD and NPD are often associated with "masculine" traits like aggression. The stereotypical person with NPD is a machiavellian finance bro who is obsessed with his looks or an evil fitness influencer.Not sure if this is relevant here, but I *feel* like it is because certain mental health conditions are hyperfeminized, in general. Including depression and bipolar disorder, as well as HPD and BPD.I'd appreciate any insight, thanks in advance.As a preface, I apologize for the lengthy post, I am over caffeinated and am distracted by my own thoughts right now.I started college this summer, and I was off to a good start, with precalculus, I started off well. Learning the trigometric functions was fun, and it was easy to learn to how to graph them, find them in relation to a given value, and find them when only 1 was given.I could visualize them in relation to a circle, and the material was easy to learn. However, learning to verify and solve trigometric equations was hard. Moreso the verifying identities. Mainly because of two things.1). It involves algebra, and I half assed my way through my early highschool algebra classes via photomath. 2). While you may can visualize how they "fit" together, I can't work with a lot of words buzzing around In my brain. I think in shapes and images.One thing I have quite a nack for though, is finding ways to solve using alternative methods.For instance, I noticed using arcs and lines, that you can solve for the height of triangles, measure the distance of two coterminal angles among some other things I have down in my notes, and you can solve for graphs and equations of sine/cos without solving explicitly, using a line, amplitude, and 1 or 2 key points, and a lot of problems in precalc are just transformations of original "textbook" functions, using various geometric methods, you can sort of find pieces of a puzzle that come together to describe basic relationships of functions, and the way they describe data in the real world, or you can manipulate data or describe specific relationships with geometric functions. We had a talk the other day after he graded my pre Calc exam (I flunked it because I didn't study). He's a trivia team coach, the one I'm on. He said "i asked him since I'm doing bad, should I drop the class and take it again before I can't do it without receiving a penalty anymore?". He said no, and told me that "if you spent as much effort actually learning material, as you do trying to find loopholes to solving problems.." that I'd be fine.We also talked about what I'm posting about here; he recommended looking at and revisiting geometry, and told me the reason was that geometry describes all sort of natural relationships in our 3D world, and you can apply it to nearly anything. He told me it was a good way to challenge myself.He also told me that he had a colleague like me, a visual learner who could barely do college algebra during his undergrad, but did his Grad school in math to challenge himself, and now he's one of the most exceptional mathematicians he knows.This was encouraging given that I've always struggled with complex math. However, I've noticed that since I've started college algebra and precalc, I have sort of had something eating at my brain. I try to challenge myself to look at relationships in the real world, like a group of flocking birds, or a student playing basket ball, and try to envision geometric sequences and functions that relate to them. Like curves, lines, and waves. It's eating at my brain.So maybe that's a sign that I should get good at describing geometric relationships in various types of quantifiable systems or patterns. I'm planning for my PhD to be in comp neuro, and I'm a computer science student now, but I feel like this will be useful when I start to work with complex data, systems that generate stochastic ouput data (like the birds flocking and having a net result of what seems like collective intelligence).Not trying to sound pretentious, I'm being 100% genuine. I just have a weird way of wording things.So every year since I've gotten sick (at age 15), without fail, I dip into depression in the colder months and pull myself out of it around late February or early March. Normally during the summer, I'm ambitious, goal directed, organized, and productive.What I've noticed over the last week or so is I am feeling a bit lethargic and lazy. I'm neglecting my academic responsibilities, and feel somewhat hopeless.I've experienced this enough to know that this will pass, but I notice the lazier I am and the more I put off studying, doing assignments, or working on my research project; the more I feel like I'm going to be a college drop out, the more I feel like I'll fail, and the more I feel like I'll never accomplish my goals.It's sort of a feedback loop.Like I said, this ain't my first rodeo. However, it's my first rodeo in college, and I'm coming to terms with the fact that I *likely* have NPD and possibly some other cluster b traits. I'm trying to seek out a diagnosis, so I can work on recovering and find stability. It's a lot to process, confronting my ego and narcissism involves being vunerable. Which is scary. Haven't been vunerable with another human for a while, but if I want to recover, that's what I've got to do.So the depressive symptoms have been particularly difficult for a few days.I've noticed on days that it's sunny out, going for walks help. However on dark and gloomy days, I stay cooped up in my dorm and avoid the world.I attend classes and ask questions during them, but I don't take good notes nor have I been studying like I've supposed to the last few weeks.I'd appreciate any insight, thanks in advance.At first I thought the city of angels was a euphemism for a specific drug, a high that lead singer Anthony keidis was referring to.I suppose he is, he's reminiscing about his life before the fame, about his life in Los Angeles. A series of memories that triggers a high for him. With changes comes unfamiliar experiences, and growth for pwbpd or any personality disorder is rather uncomfortable, sometimes painful.As a pwnpd, I often reminisce about being young and reckless, defying authority, being self directed and a rebel. As I'm growing into my new skin as an adult, I have to give up my old ways and heal.Grandiosity is a hell of a drug, and despite me experiencing different kinds of reminiscing and rumination, I feel like most cluster b's tend to miss an old part of themselves, before the grief, before they were aware, and before they were broken.Anywho, enjoy.https://youtu.be/N7ZyzCNeFKY?si=rsBlDbNgaTmHX7tQ. As a preface, I know this is an edge post, but I'm an edgy guy, and the self loathing is strong right now. This is also a new account, my old account (daddydilly69-420) got banned for "HaRraSmENt".Today I decided to venture out of my dorm to interact with some strangers, I saw a cop that mentioned that he knew my brother. We talked and I noticed he showed that he genuinely felt connected to my brother and my cousins that my brother hung out with. Then someone came in with their friend laughing and having a good time.I started feeling crappy, because I could look at them and tell how they felt for each other, the conversations weren't superficial, and they seemed to know how the other person felt.I have 3 best friends that I'd take a bullet for. We grew up together, and before I got help for grief and trauma from developing bipolar, via therapy; I put them through hell for 3 years and they still stuck by my side. I know I can count on them, so I suppose I don't feel distant from them for that reason. I know that I love my twin sister, we helped each other survive our childhood. I feel bonded to people I date, but it fades away over time and comes back in moments.Most of the time I feel apathy, so I stay to myself.I forget to check in on my loved ones unless I'm bored or lonely. I feel like our relationships aren't real, that they believe that I feel for them when I only partially do.All I feel is apathy, with spurts of intense feelings of connectedness, those times are when I am having sex, when someone is in distress and confides in me, or when my savior complex kicks in and I feel the need to be someone's shoulder to cry on or when I need to stick up for someone getting bullied.Apathy with brief periods of feeling.I usually find intense emotions uncomfortable, but damn it would be nice to be able to look at someone you love and feel something other than nothing or disgust consistently.Everywhere, people laugh and connect, so do I, but I can't seem to feel strongly towards someone enough to go out of my way to interact with them on a regular basis. When I do interact with people, I enjoy it. However, it all feels fake.Anywho, that's enough of me crying about not being able to feel.I took some anti anxiety meds, and am listening to music with good guitar riffs. Fortunately for me, one of the side effects of the meds is that I see beautiful colors when I close my eyes and have much more vivid thoughts, so I'll enjoy a beautiful presentation of lights, patterns, and images as I drift off into sleep.Any insight, or shared experiences will be appreciated, nite you amazing people.
    It is not intentional. I am a mom and try to make friends with other moms but it gets nowhere. They eventually keep their distance from me. I try to be as nice as possible and tell them everything they want to hear just so I can feel normal and have a normal social life but they either see my fakeness, the disgust I have on my face from looking at them, or they just feel the complete darkness of my soul. Thankfully I can fake it with stupid people so I have a couple friends. This might be why I am only attracted to stupid people both romantically and platonically. The minute someone gives me a hint that they are kinda dumb I love it and it sucks, makes me feel like a damn predator. In my head I think nobody likes me because they are jealous, but deep down I know its because I give off a bad vibe. And also a little jealousy too.Does anyone else feel the loss of hope? like there is nothing left in this life?When I were young, I was so hopeful for the future. What now? There's nothing. I dont look forward to getting old, losing my memory, getting new aches and pains everyday, having to take multiple medications, becoming more and more irrelevant and forgotten in society. When I was young I had everything. Energy, turned heads everywhere, endless opportunities, open doors. Now I am invisible and have nothing. There is absolutely nothing left. I wished I would have X myself at 29. Anyone else relate?. My mom had this VHS that was taped from T.V and it was a cartoon with a rabbit in it, which I am almost sure was Peter Cottontail. I just remember the rabbit and every episode was him trying to run away from the fox. It's theme song went something like "Ruuuuuuun Peter Cottontail!" and one episode was him going to the garden to eat at night and getting so full but then talking to some sort of orb in the woods. I watched this either in the late 80's or early 90's., but unsure when it was produced. I searched everywhere but cannot find any clips nor the official name of it. It is NOT Here comes Peter Cottontail, or Peter Rabbit.Please share your experiences with growth and whether it's been up and down, or a steady growth, or no growth at all.&#x200B;&#x200B;My Experience: Making vids for 8 months. First 18 or so video had literally no views but my own and maybe one other, so we are talking on average 1-7 views on each video. 1 sub the entire time. I posted a vid 2 months ago that got 100 views and gained about 7 subs. Then my next 2 videos got over 1k each 1 even got 4k views and gained me 120 subs. My next three videos TANKED. under 10 views (but still better than when I first started). I even IMPROVED the quality and everything. Is this a similar experience or is there an issue? A little discouraging....I tried searching this question and even if YT and Pinterest are affiliated but I cannot find the answer. I notice that some outside traffic is coming from Pinterest and also Facebook and I have not linked my video to any outside sources. I searched and found my vid on Pinterest with tags on it (or a shopping tag you can click on to go buy stuff). How did it end up there?. I posted something similar to this in the Self-esteem sub reddit. These are my thoughts on Ugly Duckling Syndrome, and how it can lead to NPD.When I was a kid, I was funny looking as all hell. Bad (ethnic) hair, big dorky glasses, my mother didn't know how to do my hair or dress me. To her, cosmetic things were unimportant so she let my teeth get bad. I was bullied horribly by girls. The boys all called me ugly/disgusting/screamed "ewww" at me, called me horrible names, threatened to hurt me. It was terrible. This happened from like 3rd grade to 8th grade.At 18-20ish, I came into my looks, got a capable stylist, braces, whatever. Guys started to want to date me, even multiple men started competing for my attention. I started getting a ton of attention on the streets. It was honestly like a drug. Over the years, that was my life and the times that I didn't have that, I retreated into my world, thinking I'm still that ugly little girl because I wasn't getting the attention I craved so much. Mind you, I have no gage whatsoever of my attractiveness. I either think I am insanely stunning or the uglies b\*\*\*\* to ever live. There is no in the middle for me.However, supposedly, "Ugly Duckling syndrome" doesn't work that like. According to articles I read, people with this can't take a compliment. **I crave compliments even though I do not always believe them.** People with this also tend to have more empathy. **I have little to no empathy for anyone, mostly because I am incapable because I have a broken sense of self, so all of my energy goes into making myself feel good and not caring about others.** People with this also tend to have better personalities because they had to work on them while they were ugly. **What? That never happened to me. I had a shattered personality because of all of the bullying so now my personality sucks.**Overall, being an "ugly duckling" was supposed to have benefits. For me, it caused me to have no personality, constantly crave attention and validation, and live forever in victimhood because life is not fair to me and become so self-absorbed that I cannot relate or empathize with anyone.Is there a difference between low self-esteem, and no sense of self? Also, is it possible that bullying can cause someone to develop narcissistic traits, or does this develop earlier?. These are some thoughts on "Ugly Duckling" syndrome and how it relates to my severe low self-esteem and need for validation.I was an "ugly kid" throughout my entire life. Bad unconventional (ethnic) hair, big glasses, my mom dressed me horribly. Bullied by mean girls/boys. I was disgusting to every boy ever. The ones who thought I had crushes on them screamed "ewww" at me. I was told by everyone I was ugly from 3rd grade to 8th grade. High school sucked, I had low esteem and low sense of self-worth so I dressed homely and tried to be invisible so that nobody would insult me. Around 20ish, I became better looking. I know this because of the way I started being treated. Guys started to want to date me. I started getting so much attention. Men actually started to compete for my attention. It was like a drug. I couldn't get enough. Mind you, I have no gage whatsoever of my attractiveness.However, supposedly, "Ugly Duckling syndrome" doesn't work that like. According to articles I read, people with this can't take a compliment. **I crave compliments even though I do not always believe them.** People with this also tend to have more empathy. **I have little to no empathy for anyone, mostly because I am incapable because I have a broken sense of self, so all of my energy goes into making myself feel good and not caring about others.** People with this also tend to have better personalities because they had to work on them while they were ugly. **What?

For me, it caused me to have no personality, constantly crave attention and validation, and live forever in victimhood because life is not fair to me and become so self-absorbed that I cannot related or empathize with anyone. Can anyone relate? Is there a difference between low self-esteem, and no sense of self?. This is a rant/vent just about how disappointing it has been. Last year I lost 30 lbs in 6 months (169 to 134) and I felt more amazing than I had in what seemed like forever since before I had kids. I got sick sometime in October and completely fell off and gained most of the weight back. I weighed in at 158 lbs 2 weeks ago and started back on my exercise program and eating better. I never counted calories, just reduced portion size and went for healthier options.I weigh in now at 159 and I see myself in the mirror and am completely disgusted at what I see and that I have allowed myself to get to this point. For reference, I'm 5'2 so this is actually considered obese. I went to the Dr a couple of months ago and he called me fat. He wanted to do some tests because I'm fat and told me so. He pretty much shamed me for gaining all this weight when last year I was 25 lbs less. Needless to say, I am looking for a new Dr. I exercise most days and really do watch what I eat. I increased my water intake. I don't know what else to do. I thought I would have lost at least a couple of lbs. since I kickstarted 2 weeks ago, but I GAINED. I feel so defeated. What else can I try/do to lose?Just the disappointment of losing all that weight last year only to gain it all back. So ashamed.This is more of a vent really, but it has more to do with seeing yourself in a certain way vs. how the world sees you, most particularly in how you look physically. Does the mirror really lie to you and make you think you look better than you really are? What happens when the reality hits you that you are just average looking and not as beautiful as you once thought? Can you really see yourself in a realistic light? I absolutely cannot. I see beautiful, or I see ugly, which I think is actually common with most people. However I refuse to accept the fact that I am average in looks. Average is the absolute worst thing you can be in my opinion. I would rather be ugly and homely, at least then I can complain about my misfortune and garner some pity. If I am beautiful, then I can take pride in that. But average? Average is like being nothing. Invisible. I always puffed up my appearance and thought I was better looking than most people. However, nobody ever told me that. I mean, I never had problems getting men, I always got looks and attention. But then I see other woman and how the attention they get is different. Like they pose for something so stupid like a graduation picture, and it ends up in a catalogue. Or at events, the photographers/videographers focus on them. Its those moments I feel like my sense of self plummets down to the horrifying realization that I am ugly....or worse....average.How do you deal with this? My ego cannot take it. I fall into such a deep abyss of loathing and depression and I feel like I'm cracking.I was to preface this by saying I am a woman.I have never ever in my life felt any empathy towards women. Like if I find out someone got blown to bits in an explosion next to my house then find out it was a woman, I literally will give no f\*\*\*\*. No joke.I really hate them. I had a variety of female friends growing up. The ones who were prettier I despised and used anything I could to destroy their lives, the ones who were below me, I used them to get what I wanted. My relationships like this continue to this day.I thinks sometimes from time to time that I feel a pinch of empathy towards some women, and I feel halfway normal. But this is not normal, guys. I have felt this my entire life.I discredit all women I come into contact with because it drives me crazy to think that she could in any way be above me. Otherwise, it shatters my ego.Is this common in women with NPD? I watched a YT video from a girl who said this but can't find the vid anymore.It never hurt me before but its messing with my life now. Cause I have to deal with females and I don't want to. I prefer men in everything.Edit: I don't know if this is "misogyny" or just me wanting to be alpha female or whatever.
    That I have a desire to hurt others, but am too afraid of being branded a coward. That I don't care about anyone, but want their attention. That I use others as emotional trashbags, but the emotion fades away so soon. Is action the only way to let this infinite pool of anger, hate, envy and sadism free?. I just wanted to drop the idea of giving up. Not encouraging anyone, but just considering the fact that we are like this because of our upbringing. I think your upbringing determines who you will be for the rest of your life. Like the child who want's to become a doctor because their dad was one, or they had a realization they liked helping people. Whether one was abused or overvalued, the cage of narcissism and/or ASPD is nigh unbreakable. Going by the covert/grandiose model, the ultimate goal is to run from shame, for if we were to feel that shame, it would be no better than admitting failure to living up to human standards, a failed human in other words. Even if you never get to that point, what then? The dopamine high from video games, attention and money could wear off, leaving the worst possible truth in your hands. That you never reached the point where even literal toddlers have reached. That you never learned to truly care, to be passionate, to love, to appreciate what you are given, to be human. Whether that chance was taken away by broken people, or you never saw the worth of it because gifts and praise clouded your vision, it doesn't matter. Because that time has passed, and it will never come back. Trying to go back resulted in failure for me, because back then was the only time it mattered, where it could make one change.I feel I've reached the point where killing myself in peace just doesn't work for me. Like despite how much I feel pain or hate, going out in silence feels impossible, like I can't go out alone. Please tell me I'm not alone in this feeling.Sometimes, I get the feeling that this is all there is. That there's only one life, and it makes me sick to my stomach. It actively makes me want to go out and hurt someone, like my life doesn't matter, why should anyone else's? You're telling me that me playing the good guy for people I can't feel for leads to zero? And if this makes me bad, so the fuck what then? Everyone else around me is installed with hopes, dreams, morality and everything that makes humanity such a moral and evolved animal, but what about those who don't? The people who don't care, the people who can't? Villains. Just villains. I keep listening to videos on narcissism, I hear people talk about narcissism, to the point it just sounds the same. We were hurt as children, we want power and attention, we don't care about anyone but ourselves, everything we do is just for a hit of dopamine or self esteem we so desperately need, because we can't make it ourselves. I often just wonder, if we are so bad, so negative, why not just destroy us? Will getting blood on your hands sully you so much? After all the stuff they hear about narcissism, they have to know ignoring someone DESPERATE for self esteem via acknowledgement is a risky thing to do. I'd say I'm sorry for making this post, but that'd be a lie. I don't/can't feel sorry, but I can feel shame if reprimanded. God fucking shitfuck, I'm bored now.Aside from grandiosity and fear of death or rejection, does anyone have a reason to try anything, considering we were set up from childhood to fail mentally?. Grandiose and victim-y, but I don't care. Life is just awful if you have it. You are just as emotionally inept, hateful and fractured as someone thinks a sterotypical narcissisist is, but you just can't get it out. It feels like every emotion that doesn't revolve around you is fake, but the hatred and pain you feel when someone questions you is there, dear god is it there. I want to be the guy who just goes werewolf on everyone, telling everyone off, putting up the middle finger, telling the weak and annoying to go off themselves(cuz I want to see what happens, no empathy, haha) and just let loose, but I can't. I can't because then the 'perks' I get disappear, the world gets to see what I am, and I'm in an even worse position than I was before. I dumped my therapist over this shit. I heard some stuff about how covert narcissists are harder to treat because they're more slippery and cunning than overts, and I just figured that the mountain was to big to climb. I'm just going to wait for the moment that I explode. Idk, I think my life is just going to be a dull one, one just trying my damnest to not reveal whats inside, because once I do, it's over.So I lost my wallet today. Credit cards, cash, id, everything was lost. Personally, I wasn't broken up about the act alone, but telling my parents and others about it kind of irked me. Like someone tried to offer help, and I felt disgusted, I wanted it to be over with. I even asked my dad how somepeople could live with things like massive fuckups, how someone could live effectively knowing they aren't perfect. It just makes me upset, because he gave me a solid answer. I don't get how he gave birth to a dud like me. How is this allowed.I feel I go through that everyday. Ever since I got my first job as a camp guy, there are moments that just bring me down. Like anytime the image I want to show as a decent employee is threatened, my first thought is to quit or wait for the fire. Life is basically a rollercoaster with dull highs and crushing lows. It feels like sometimes the only way off the ride is to "quit the game" (not depressed, just saying), though I know I never would."Loved" By parents, still a barely held together narcissist. Love does not work, it just bandages a neverending bleeding wound.I don't want to believe personal change is real. Behaviors can change, but inside, it feels like for certain people, it just gets worse and worse. If change is real, then it's basically my fault I can't get anything together, that I barely care about anyone but myself or that I barely care about my education and won't spare a thought to how much of my parent's money I am wasting. It's my choice to not do anything with my life because failure makes me want to die, and it's my choice to treat people like shit because I want them to live up to standards I can't reach.I both care and don't care. I acknowledge I have OCD, but I find other's mental illnesses to be either funny, or minimal. Because compared to a personality disorder, its like comparing a common cold to diabetes. One can come and go, the other is an endless battle with no winners. Also when it comes to "trauma" or mental illness, it's usually someone else's fault, they have something to point at, eliminate and move on. Narcissism isn't that. It doesn't even need a lack of love to get going, it can just happen, and it never goes away, you aren't trying to beat something outside yourself, you're fighting yourself, with a low chance of becoming like everyone else.I can't stand it. Even if I figured I had this issue 2 years ago, nothing has gotten better, if anything I feel better about being worse. I see people living good lives. Sure they may suffer from anxiety and/or depression, but those tend to be temporary, situation based. They aren't a part of you. NPD/Narcissism is, and it's a neverending war with no victory to be had. It makes you dependent on others, treat others with disdain and keeps you an emotionally stunted infant. You bounce between highs and lows every day. Sometimes you feel unstoppable, other moments you wish you were never born. Try as I might to break through, nothing works. I'm told all the damn time, things and people change, but they don't, not really. Things change like the weather, they come and go but will never be truly gone, so there's not much solace there. Unlike everyone else, the only 'hope' is to hide or temper my true self and few emotions, most people have the luxury of rarely ever thinking about.Mine is "Being spoiled into narcissism is worse than being abused into it, because the problem is yourself, not the outside".I had this thought at my last therapy appointment, but what if we were meant to be bad guys (at least those of us who seem unwilling to change)? It sounds like a massive NPD cope, but I still wonder. Looking at how people react to villains on the screen, feeling vary from loving to hate them, or hating that they like them. They feel no shame for their actions, and embrace every vile thing about themselves with pride. They know they are viscious, lazy, callous, violent and wear their flaws with pride. Contrast with the real world, with NPD as an example. We aren't exactly model beings, stuggling with emotions, feelings and needs that aren't very flattering. We are driven by a need to be seen, admired and revered with little concern for the people who do (This does not apply to every pwNPD, some if not most are capable of empathy). So the stupid question is: Why not play the bad guy?. I'm just upset. It's infuriating that my life is dictated by how others see me or how I come off to others. My emotions are fickle, fleeting and uncontrollable. I barely care unless I'm given attention, otherwise I couldn't care less, and I can't stand seeing other people do better than me, despite either knowing or later realizing I'm too lazy to achieve what they have. Life sucks for us. Also personal opinion: NPD is ASPD but with fewer upsides (at least emotionally).If we didn't feel emotions, half, if not all the issues that come with having a pd would be wiped out. It doesn't matter if we would no longer be human, because we were barely squeaking by anyway. Before anyone comes in with the sentiment that all the good emotions would be gone too, consider if one good moment beats a lifetime of being an emotional failure. Or even if having a decent childhood matters if that did not stop one from becoming a 5-year old trapped in a mans body.Does anyone wish sometimes something really bad happened to them in their past? I think about how NPD is a result of trauma, and most likely mine is from just being coddled and skipping out on life events. I see people with far worse baggage than mine, and they're still functioning people, with a sense of responsibility, perserverence and humility. They could have seen a family member die, and they'd still be good, successful people, meanwhile some go into a loser spiral if they get a question wrong.This is written while in my low mood, but really what is the point? Every time I hear a mention about NPD or narcissism, I just get a sense of innate brokeness and hopelessness. Like having this disorder makes life a long unbearable journey with baggage you never wanted or chose yet its there until death.Stories have been thrown around, about how some people can endure the worst circumstances and come out a fair, fully functioning person. What will scar and change a person may not do so for someone else, as in a family filled with failures, one child could come out as the good one. They may have made better choices, yes, but what about the ones who made bad ones? And they enjoy making the bad ones? Even though they have seen the consequences? I think genetics have a very heavy hand in how people are built. They may not influence choice directly, but they influence the emotions felt with making the choices. Most people don't feel pain or annoyance when having to take responsibility, but some do. Most may not feel the overwhelming shame of failure, or desperate need to protect the ego, or disdain towards people supposedly lesser, but some do, and they don't need examples of this behavior in their early life, they trend toward this by themselves. Tldr: This is a blackpillesque rant on how I see things. For those working on themselves earnestly, I salute you.Hello, I came to air things out and see what you think. I am a 21 year old college student, and I believe I have NPD, or something that just makes me feel perfectionistic and entitled. I've suffered no bullying, abuse or tragic event, yet I have a lack of empathy. My family and parents are rather loving, yet I have contempt for them. I've tried looking into my past and genetics to see if theres some kind of link, no success yet. I have fleeting moments of happiness and vulnerability, but it becomes swallowed back up. I also find myself getting sharp spikes of anger when I'm talked to by someone, who in my brain, thinks is beneath me. To get to the point, what can I do? I haven't acted out on my emotions, but making the 'right choices' just staves off what I feel is endless negative emotion.Narcissism is a really interesting part of psych to look into, because it sounds and feels like an incurable evil within someone, with murky beginnings and no end in sight. I think about it alot, how it came to be. Was I told I was worthless at somepoint in my life? Did my parents praise and love spoil me rotten? Either way, it's who I am now. It's not like I wasn't taught not to be this way either, I was just stubborn, stuck to my guns. Taught and told again and again by my family to never quit, that perfection and superiority isn't useful, yet I stuck with it for dear life. Thoughts?. Is there a point, like a real point? I hear alot about people who turn out like this because of trauma and bad parents. But then I hear about people who never had a point of trauma and still became like this. Not to mention, some people go through worse and turn out alright. So is it genetics? Loving family, simple childhood, none of that prevented me from being an unempathetic fragile ego person? Try as one might, whatever is wrong is still there. Pretend to be kind, pretend to be normal, pretend that seeing others in pain means a lot to me, or better yet, that it doesn't make me happy seeing people in pain. Most of the time I feel empty or annoyed with other people, like their presence is an affront to mine. Seeing others succeed makes me feel either nothing or rage. Being genuinely happy for someone is alien to me. Even if by some chance, the root to why I am the way I am is discovered, that doesn't truly mean anything. What matters is that it is what it is. Either I pretend to be a decent person for the rest of my life (Impossible, your true self always finds a way out) or I be the way my brain or feelings dictate me to be.Does anyone here have a memory they cherish? A memory where they were happy, joyful, had a good laugh? The kind of memory that feels untouched by NPD?. This is something I dare not face. To the point it almost makes me cry. The feeling of knowing what I'm doing is wrong, but having it pointed out to me makes me upset. I want to go, hide and erase it from memory. Does anyone else here feel this way?. Being someone who loses interest in things I am not good at immediately, is there anyone here who's driven to learn, or someone who achieved their dreams?. This hopefully really will be my last post on this site, because fishing for attention isn't helping me. I'm gonna be real and just say I am lazy. I am entitled, angry and selfish. I am on the brink of becoming a 'failure to launch', something I am ambivalent towards. However, anytime something reminds me of my lack of achievement, it hurts. But I keep going back to the safety of my family's unconditional love that I don't return. I have interests, but not enough drive or interest. This started as a attention post, but I want to stop. But once I do, I just don't get much out of anything else. So, what should I do? Be as honest and direct as you want.Between Elliot Rodger, Salvador Ramos, TJ lane and other mass shooters, a common thread between them was their egos. They were bruised, thought they deserved more, and wanted to go out in a blaze of glory. This isn't to say NPD is inherently violent, or that it is common, but I think its something interesting to look at.After trolling through this sub for months, I've come to the conclusion that while a good amount are strong enough to rein in their issues, some just can't be helped. The pain of looking at what you are, what you lack, and what you won't have is too painful. The idea of real connection, wanting to be kind, achieving the goals they believe they deserve is beneath their standards. They enjoy what they are, but hate when consequences come their way. Again, for those actively working to achieve, they are great. But for those like what I've described, those (at this moment) like me, I see no future other than a crash, then burn. I don't wanna offend, just want attention.Alot of people here can attribute their tendencies and behavior to abuse and trauma. But what if the pwNPD has no visible trauma? They lack empathy, are insecure, lazy and use others regularly, yet not once have they really suffered?. I have loving parents, family, normal childhood, next to no traumatic events. Yet at 20, I have fluctuating emotions, lack of empathy, fragile ego, and crippling insecurity and envy. My parents are relatively normal. What happened?. When it comes to learning or hobbies, I just can't. I can only get through only a couple words and questions before I start question myself. I can't stop thinking about how bad it feels having to learn, how defensive I get when I imagine someone asking me a question I don't know the answer to. I just feel bad all over, learning makes me feel less than. I know I need to get over this, but I don't know how.I am a 20-year old male, and I just want to get this off my chest. I am an envious person who envies what he doesn't have, yet makes no attempts to improve. I ask my family constantly whether people change and grow out of their toxic traits, and they tell me yes, but now on the precipice of getting a job interview, I know don't believe I want to change. I've compulsively watched videos on npd, asked others if I have NPD, and even believed at a point in time I had NPD and wanted to change. Now I'm at a point of no return. I don't care about anyone but myself. I'd rather not work for a living. I don't want to hear anything about improvement, as I get enough from my family, I just wanted to scream. Thank you.
    [Post in question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/178g9wa/atm_i_hate_everything_including_this_sub/)I'm a bit drunk right now, but I calmed down and don't really feel cognitively impaired by the alcohol, but I tend to be a bit dramatic. There is no TRUE reflection, there is always a lense distorting my perception.*" I hate being self aware. It fucking sucks."*Being self-aware actually gives me mixed feelings. It sucks knowing who you are and seeing yourself make the same mistakes. Knowing your anger, jealousy etc. is irrational and getting even more angry at that fact. On the other hand, it gives me the possibility to intervene in those processes. I definitely saved friendships because of it and I managed to sometimes "catch" what was happening, preventing negative spirals. My anger etc. also seems to not last as long anymore (on average), so there are some major upsides to that.*"I feel like a caged circus lion. I JUST WANNA BE A FUCKING LION, but if I am, I'm gonna get put down."*I still feel like this to some degree. Not with as much seething rage, but it is definitely a fucked up situation. I don't feel "sick", I don't see myself as having an "illness". It just feels like I am this way. I'm selfish, arrogant and distant, and unfortunately, those are negative things for others around me. Spin it how you want it, on the inside we will probably always be assholes. I put on masks, fake empathy, fake emotions and lie about who I am, because nobody wants to *truly* see me the way I am. It's easy to say "I still like you" on Reddit, but experiencing who I am daily is an entirely different beast. Why would you want someone like this around? LIKE SERIOUSLY? Our internalized shame might be an exaggeration of how people would see us, but there's a reason we hate ourselves. Even the most self-aware of us, those who are truly doing their best, are faking shit. That little "sorry to hear that, that sounds difficult" when someone tells me something sad, that little smile when a kid smiles at me whilst I'm annoyed at its existence, that little "I love you too", when I know full well I only love the imaginary version of this person, and will never truly care about them the same way someone else could.*"What is "recovery" even supposed to mean? WHAT IN THE FUCK DO YOU RECOVER FROM? BEING YOU?"*Still don't really get that one.*"I get being narcissistic has really bad sides like shame, anxiety etc. I like to complain a LOT about it. But the truth is that our grandiose selves are INSANE at what they do, whilst all the others are just crying in a corner for the most minor of bullshit, whilst we shrugged off things they would have a mental breakdown from."*I guess most people aren't that fragile, grief, crying etc. actually seem to be relatively good ways to work through emotions. There is still a weakness in it that my entire being gets repulsed by.As for the "grandiose self": Certain things, like some types of criticism, rejection etc., are things I am much more weak to. That being said, it is also a type of strength that many people simply don't have. Staying functional and confident in situations others would get an anxiety attack in, being so used to acting people don't even suspect it to be faked and our ability to be rutheless are advantageous and can lead to very positive outcomes. There's a reason high funtioning narcissists tend to climb corporate ladders, it's not just because we manipulate people, it's because we have skillsets that go beyond most neurotypicals in certain situations. In the worst case I might feel ashamed when having to make difficult decisions like firing someone, but I'm certainly not gonna cry about it, and the ego is going to restore itself most likely to ensure functioning in high-stress environments.*"Why can't I just insult people for having stupid bullshit problems, have them insult me back, and then pretend nothing happened 5 minutes after?"*I still don't see that happening for most people at least. It's manageable, but damn sometimes it would be nice to just tell people what you think and NOT have to live with the consequences.*"Then you have to work with people who SO beneath you, it is an insult that they are even in the same UNIVERSE as you."*Very hyperbolic, but idiots *are* frustrating. *"I just had a friend write me a msg that a pet died. "WHO THE FUCK CARES, SHUT THE FUCK UP" is what I'd like to say, but I know people are whiny bitches"*I don't need the message to be this aggressive, but yes, I don't care about your pet. I understand you're sad, but crying about that to someone would make me feel pathetic, so I resent it in you as well. Come to me when there's something to fix, I can't fix death. If I'm not a close friend of yours, don't even think about it.*" "Ohh the narcissist lies and manipulates" YES BECAUSE YOU DUMBFUCKS ARE INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SOMEONE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CAR BREAKING DOWN."*Extremely based. Past me is great.*"LOOK AT YOURSELVES YOU SHITS. YOU CANCER TO SOCIETY. Where the fuck was your flower dress made? How many people are ACTUALLY ENSLAVED because YOU can't humble yourselves to buy some 2nd hand shit. How many of you empath-fucks ignore EVERY homeless person, because you're "too busy" because you've gotta go home and watch TV. How long ago could you empaths have solved world hunger? How many diseases could we have eradicated if you actually voted for ALTRUISTIC THINGS instead of your fucking wallet?"*Even more based. I'd say it in a nicer way, but goddamn those empaths really don't have a lot of empathy outside their own circles. Most people could do a lot more for the world, but they don't really care, just like us. It's just that us not caring affects them.*"And now to this sub. This fucking disgusting sub. I KNOW some of you will understand, but then there will be those people who will say I'm not being EMPATHETIC AND INSIGHTFUL ENOUGH, NOT TRYING TO "RECOVER" ENOUGH whilst talking in a forum for NARCISSISTS.* *(...)**Those people who will give ACTUAL narcissists advice like "oh you gotta be better, you're hurting others" like DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CONDITION MEANS? FUCK OFF, NOBODY CARES. Tell me what* ***I*** *get out of it, tell me why* ***I*** *should care about your words."*I like the sub (mostly). A lot of you are great, insightful and just fun. I would, once again, choose less inflammatory language, but goddamn even in rage mode I'm just dropping truth bombs left and right. Becoming better people is generally a good thing though, even if it's just for us in the end.*"I will go back to being pro-social, it's best for me. But I fucking hate feeling sedated all the time by the expectations of others."*If I'm honest, people hate me. If I lie, people love me. Here I am, riding that fine line again, giving enough truth to not go insane and wearing enough masks to control people's opinions. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best I can do? Probably also no. But I guess it's better than my past self, it's better for others and it's better for me.*I'm not in the greatest emotional state rn, I'm aware I'm externalizing shit. Don't say I didn't warn you.* I feel really frustrated. I had a really shit day recently, it fucked me up. Now I feel like I'm almost back to the "real me" (which only feels real in this state anyways but whatever).I hate being self aware. It fucking sucks. It sucks that I'm sitting here, trying to throw a pity party, knowing I'm doing that. I just wanna call a friend, tell them to go fuck themselves for something random they did a year ago, but I KNOW I'll regret it.I feel like a caged circus lion. I JUST WANNA BE A FUCKING LION, but if I am, I'm gonna get put down.I'm scrolling through this god-forsaken sub, seeing post after post about self improvement, self awareness and "recovery" knowing I'm participating in that shit. I know it's necessary, but for fucks sake did someone come and castrate all of us at some point?What is "recovery" even supposed to mean? WHAT IN THE FUCK DO YOU RECOVER FROM? BEING YOU?All my problems may stem from trauma, abuse and god being a fucking bitch, but my problems RIGHT NOW stem from ME. Who I AM. Not from a "defense mechanism", not from some "mental disorder", no, it's from from WHO THE FUCK I AM. I CANNOT BE ME, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. HOW FUCKING DARE ANYONE TELL US WE CAN'T BE US?I get being narcissistic has really bad sides like shame, anxiety etc. I like to complain a LOT about it. But the truth is that our grandiose selves are INSANE at what they do, whilst all the others are just crying in a corner for the most minor of bullshit, whilst we shrugged off things they would have a mental breakdown from.And then they tell you about it. And they care about your reaction to their bullshit. HOW COME YOU CARE I DON'T FEEL SAD FOR YOU? How is that a problem to YOU? Why can't I just insult people for having stupid bullshit problems, have them insult me back, and then pretend nothing happened 5 minutes after?Then you have to work with people who SO beneath you, it is an insult that they are even in the same UNIVERSE as you. "boo hoo you called me a dumbass for being unable to do something after you explained it 5 times, YES I KNOW WHAT I DID DUMBASS FUCK YOU FOR BEING STUPID, STOP WASTING MY TIME, IT IS ACTUALLY VALUABLE COMPARED TO YOURS".I hate peoples emotional neediness SO much. I just had a friend write me a msg that a pet died. "WHO THE FUCK CARES, SHUT THE FUCK UP" is what I'd like to say, but I know people are whiny bitches, getting sad if a fucking bird flies against their window. I say GET FUCKED BIRD, FREE MEAL (okay I won't actually eat it though) as long as it doesn't take away from MY time by smearing blood all over the glass.I despise my own emotions, I don't cry about bullshit to people, except on reddit but you don't count (no offense). If I don't expect people to do that shit for me, WHY DO I NEED TO BE A NORMAL HUMAN FOR THEM? FUCK OFF!I feel like people don't actually care about the truth that much as long as you don't show it. I told a friend I had basically no affective empathy, and they were fine with it, BUT GUESS WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T SHOW ENOUGH EMPATHY FOR STUPID SHIT IN THEIR LIVES? "You're being so cold to me" YES, I TOLD YOU, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I MEANT YOU DUMBASS - is what I'd like to say, but OF COURSE I gotta keep up the mask and tell them "I was distracted, sorry" because if I don't it will spiral into an avalanche of people hating me for LITERALLY EXISTING AUTHENTICALLY."Ohh *the narcissist* lies and manipulates " YES BECAUSE YOU DUMBFUCKS ARE INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SOMEONE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CAR BREAKING DOWN. Because YOU expect everyone to be like YOU, and if they aren't YOU will fucking hunt them down, you empath bitches. LOOK AT YOURSELVES YOU SHITS. YOU CANCER TO SOCIETY. Where the fuck was your flower dress made? How many people are ACTUALLY ENSLAVED because YOU can't humble yourselves to buy some 2nd hand shit. How many of you empath-fucks ignore EVERY homeless person, because you're "too busy" because you've gotta go home and watch TV. How long ago could you empaths have solved world hunger? How many diseases could we have eradicated if you actually voted for ALTRUISTIC THINGS instead of your fucking wallet?I DONT GIVE A SHIT, BUT I DON'T PRETEND TO OUTSIDE OF TALKING TO YOU. I KNOW I didn't give a shit for a long time, but when my time comes I will GLADLY die with that knowledge.But "*the narc*" is the problem. WE are because we "lack empathy", because I don't pity you because the fucking hamster died, after KNOWING DAMN WELL MOST FOOD ITEMS HAVE A LONGER LIFESPAN WHEN KEPT IN A FREEZER.And now to this sub. This fucking disgusting sub. I KNOW some of you will understand, but then there will be those people who will say I'm not being EMPATHETIC AND INSIGHTFUL ENOUGH, NOT TRYING TO "RECOVER" ENOUGH whilst talking in a forum for NARCISSISTS. The people who sit on their high horse who really relate because they were rude to their coworker once, and they "totally are narcissistic" because they felt superior to others that one time they won a medal at school. Those people who will give ACTUAL narcissists advice like "oh you gotta be better, you're *hurting others*" like DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CONDITION MEANS? FUCK OFF, NOBODY CARES. Tell me what **I** get out of it, tell me why **I** should care about your words.If you relate, THAT'S FINE! BE A PIECE OF SHIT WITH ME.And guess what: Ff you hate this post, THAT'S FINE! Tell me that my seething rage is weakness. Tell me that my inability to be authentic is pathetic. Tell me I disgust you. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT, THAN SOMEONE SAY: "But what about the others uwu?"I don't want advice. I just wanted to complain. Maybe some people will *actually* relate, atm I don't care. I will go back to being pro-social, it's best for me. But I fucking hate feeling sedated all the time by the expectations of others, and being myself not being "okay", especially since those people aren't fucking worth my time anyways.If you offer me "insight" I will straight up insult you, I'm well aware of what I'm doing and what I need to do.I was texting an irl friend, and thought I'd try to be a bit vulnerable. I told them that a text of theirs offended me a bit, because they (correctly) assumed something was making me insecure. I also told them they were right and it's not a rational thing.They didn't even react negatively, just said they got to know me over the years a little bit, but I got overwhelmed by REALLY strong anxiety and got nauseous for letting the mask slip just a little. My hands were shaking, I couldn't think and I'm still on edge. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST FOR ONCE IN MY GODDAMN LIFE TO SOMEONE THAT KNOWS MY FACE. FUCK THIS.Edit: Not my proudest moment. Went to sleep afterwards. Gonna leave it up, but yikes I hate having that on my account (esp. the comment lol).I just learned that a friend of mine finished his Master's degree. I quit university instead lol.That friend invited us to celebrate that. I know rationally that they're great, worked hard and deserve it. But I feel so insecure right now, I fucking want it to be me. All I wanna do is shittalk that, and I would probably be very sarcastic and rude at the party whilst destroying the mood. I hate that I think, that they think, they're better than me. HOW AM I MEANT TO GO TO A PARTY FOR SOMEONE ELSE, WHO JUST ACHIEVED SOMETHING I DIDN'T? THIS IS CRUEL.I don't wanna ruin this friendship by being a giant asshole. Please what the actual fuck do I do to not hate myself this hard rn and be a normal human being for once?Edit: I guess the advice by Bath\_Kol pretty much fixed it, I just repeated that for a while lol. That was quick.I remember being a fairly young child. I remember seeing the beauty of the world. Loving people and animals. Being sad when a pet died. Being disturbed when another kid would hurt a spider. Wanting to help people just because I can.I remember being overly emotional even. Being fragile.Then, years of trauma. Being abandoned by everyone who took care of my emotional needs. Being ignored except if I got good grades at the end of the year. Hating life. Hating people.Now there's nothing. Whoever I was is gone, replaced by this strange emptiness. A feeling I need to avoid. A hole to fill (hehe sexual joke here).I don't miss that person. I don't miss being honest even if it hurts me. I don't miss caring about other's needs. I don't miss being fragile. But I miss feeling secure, at least sometimes, with someone who cares. Knowing who I am without asking.I wouldn't trade my current state for what was, I just wish this would have never been necessary in the first place. Ironic how "empaths" caused this, isn't it?Berry dramatic vulnerability, 7/10 on the "pity me scale".Hi! Sorry about the long post. New account for obvious reasons.Ever since I was a kid, I knew something was wrong with me, but the only thing I really understood was that I had a lot of social anxiety.I have been in therapy and on meds for depression + social anxiety. I took meds for only about a year (i forgot to take them and decided to just stop lol). The anxiety meds did nothing, the antidepressants were pretty good though. I was also diagnosed with ADHD by a psychologist, and then a psychiatrist but I don't take meds for that so it doesn't really matter.Anyways I was in therapy for about six years with 2 different therapists. I stopped after I felt I wasn't making progess, so right now I'm not in therapy.The problem is that my therapists, though probably pretty good with some patients, never really understood me (to be fair, I didn't either). We talked about some traumatic experiences and my emotional state, but I felt like my core symptoms (anxiety especially) never improved much. I told the second therapist that I don't have a lot of affective empathy, but despite that, it never amounted to much.There was one thing that therapy (unfortunately) did for me though: It made me realise I felt shame. I had a bit of a mental breakdown at that time, realising I don't know who I am etc. and prying into trauma and my mind all the time seems to have caused that. It was very unsettling and alien to me, I never felt that before and literally had to google what that emotion was since my next appointment was almost a week away. Shame is the worst feeling I ever had.I was in therapy for about 9 months afterwards. The shame never got significantly better (though I had a hard time confronting it, can't blame it all on the therapist I guess). But it did make me realise it was at the core of my anxiety.**Now to NPD / Pathological Narcissism**Since I had a lot of anxiety all my life, my narcissistic tendencies are really well hidden. I'm definitely grandiose on the inside and think that I'm better than most people (except those who I respect and who respect/admire me as well), but I never saw that as a problem (I still don't really care lol). If people who I respect slight me, that changes and they become part of the "beneath me" pile, paired with vengeful feelings etc. The anxiety taught me to mask well though, I can even admit flaws (usually things that aren't important or get sympathy).I try to control how people I interact with view me. Especially if someone has a negative opinion I discredit them (or what they might say) preemtively or try to ensure they don't interact with people "who matter". This is something I do, but it feels semi-conscious (I know I'm doing that, but it's pretty automatic). I also change how I act and what I say depending on the person or group, but usually in minor ways (I won't invent a new personality or some shit, but keep certain opinions to myself, agree with things I might not do on my own, get a bit more introverted/extroverted etc.). Basically I tend to modify reality with exaggeration / undertatements a lot, often times I omit some information, sometimes I flat out lie. This usually doesn't cause many problems since I mix in enough truth or make it believable / hard to disprove if I lie. This usually feels automatic, but I do it as a planned thing sometimes as well if I got myself into trouble / caught for something.My anxiety symptoms and depressed moods are VERY tied to how people view me. If I get praise/respect, or I'm the (positive) center of attention I become very confident. If I don't get that for a while I become very anxious, self hating and ashamed (thanks for that last one therapist, very cool!). I need regular reinforcement of people admiring me.I had a time where I was socially fairly isolated due to anxiety for prolonged periods. This was when I got prescribed depression meds. I believe the core reason was NPD, and not getting validation, but it *looked* like a regular depressive episode. The antidepressants worked really well, I became more outgoing, and when I stopped taking meds I never got even close to that level (I think I unconsciously built a network for validation aka a good social circle, so it wasn't possible to get there anymore).Criticism tends to make me very angry (except from the people "who matter", they can somewhat criticize me since I respect them enough. I still get a bit angry, but I know they respect me), though I rarely lash out since my anxiety is keeping most of my symptoms hidden. If I enact revenge it is usually in a covert, backstabby way.I fantasize about being rich / famous every single day, and that seems to be the basis for some of my grandiosity (I'm bascially entitled because I will be successful, but also because I'm smart etc.).I have no idea who I am, everything I do is to improve myself (to be successful), and to be successful so that people will admire and envy me. What exactly I do to achieve that doesn't matter much as long as it's respected.I can have hobbies on my own, but I always have an imaginary audience I perform for. E.g. I sometimes make music. I don't share it (it is bad), but I fantasize about how people will respect me for it, interview me, etc.I don't care much for most people, I don't feel bad for them if something bad happens to them (like their parent/dog dies etc.), I can actually get kinda annoyed and bored talking about their feelings and their life (but sometimes I find certain things very interesting, as I want a great understanding on how humans work). I still listen to them, since I know it's required for friendships and I understand that they are suffering, but I don't get very invested. If I hurt someone (and it has consequences, esp. if it might affect my relationships / status) I can feel shame. I am not sadistic though, so I usually have no reason to hurt people. If I do it's one of those semi-conscious self defense tactics to protect my ego & status. I try to be conscious of and avoid them since it's better for myself not to hurt people and I don't want to feel shame for the (mostly social) repercussions.One last thing (that kinda makes me question some things about it being NPD): I tend to have weak boundaries when people ask for help. I expect praise of course, and if they aren't thankful they become part of the "hate list" and then the "beneath me list" so to speak. But I feel like they will judge me negatively if I say "no", which causes a lot of anxiety, so I usually go along with it. On the other hand if people try to hold me accountable for things I should have done / fucked up I might actually lash out, so idk, seems like there are some boundaries that get heavily enforced if it threatens my self-esteem, but I have a hard time being as selfish as I actually feel on the inside.I'm gonna cut the symptoms here, there's more but the post would become the length of a book.Anyways I'm fairly certain it's NPD (I certainly have high levels of narcissism). I'm open to other suggestions on what might be going on, but I don't feel like the other cluster B things fit very well (I would have preferred ASPD but that's just not the reality lol). I kinda tend to mind-fuck myself and others, so I could also be too biased with this to make an accurate assessment, but this behavior and the feelings have been very consistent. I became aware I might be narcissistic about a year ago and things haven't changed much, so I think I'm probably not just mind-fucking myself.The question is whether I should get a diagnosis and if you agree it might be NPD or if I'm missing something. I feel like I can handle a lot on my own since I became more self aware, but I still struggle with shame and anxiety. Those 2 feelings are the only reason I would consider therapy, but past therapy didn't do much for that.I also don't want people in my life to find out. Narcissism has very negative connotations even if you're trying not to be a dickhead unnecessarily. Not sure if a diagnosis could fuck me over. At the same time, I want some confirmation to finally figure out what is wrong with me since, whatever my condition is, is not fun at all (except the \[supposed\] grandiosity, it's the best).Anyways some questions:\- Do you think this is NPD?\- Do you have a suggestion on how to "reality check" my internal experience?\- Do you recommend getting a diagnosis? If so, why?\- Do you have any tips on anxiety and shame that aren't "confront them and self love"? I tried that for almost a year with almost no effect.Thanks for reading my post (if you did). I know it's a lot of words but it is the culmination of years of self reflection. I just wanna know what's wrong with me and how to tackle the 2 worst emotions in my life.I will do my best to be cordial in the comments, but I'm kind of narcissistic about being narcissistic if that makes sense. Please forgive me if I get defensive if you question that lol, I really am trying to have an open mind though.Edit: Btw I'm 25 yrs old, I'm not going through a teenage identity crisis lmaoAdditional things in case you're interested:[NPI Results](https://psytests.org/result?v=dtrbVE0j)[PNI Results](https://psytests.org/result?v=dtriWp5ar1SQ)NPI: 30codependency: 6OCD: 1.
    In the model underpinning schema therapy, there is a mode called the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode. I've read about it a few times, and I just noticed it come up today in myself, I think. I wanted to document it here, so maybe I can become more quickly alert to it in future - because like other maladaptive modes, I feel it really inhibits me, or can do at least.From my recollection the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode is a coping mode in the model. That means there is some underlying vulnerability or distress or unmet need, and this mode is a state of mind and body that we can flip into as a way of reacting or managing what's underneath.I think when I'm in my Paranoid Overcontroller Mode, I become overly fixated and suspicious of other people, maybe particularly one person or two for whatever reason. I suppose there's something about them that I'm fearful of underneath, or something about them that reminds me of someone or some situation in the past the caused me harm. My thoughts turn to and obsess over all the things dry don't like about this person. There is a sense of mistrust. I don't like to look them in the eye, I want to keep away from them, there is a feeling that they are keeping something from me, that they are somehow corrupt, wrong, dangerous, hiding something, manipulative, not truthful, not honest, in authentic. I can even imagine them turning other people against me, thinking negatively about me and talking negatively about me, criticising me with others. That's paranoia. I watch their movements and behaviours, and listen to what they have to say, and my mind is heavily skewed to picking up the evidence to support this from whatever they're saying or doing. It's a form of rumination....The problem is that when I'm in this mode, I don't see the whole person - just the negative aspects that maybe I want to see. I kind of don't want to see the positives. I'm devaluing them. I'm not being empathic, understanding or compassionate. I lose connection to that person. But more than that. I disconnected from the world and other people. I am lost in my own thoughts - just spinning around. I'm cut off from reality, viewing the world through a distorted lens where people are either for me or against me, and I'm collecting the evidence.Gosh! Now I'm reflecting on it, I can see that this mode is somewhat present quite a lot of the time. It's just that today I noticed that was particularly strong, and directed towards one person who I've been with over the last few days. Another man. I guess from the outside looking in at me, people might sense that I am cut off, self absorbed, and that my thoughts are negative and suspicious even. And I wonder if it's on my face. I'm pretty sure it must be, to a degree. Obviously I can't tell that for sure. But there is a chance at least that they pick up on my negative mood, and so might not want to interact or connect with me. I kind of feel that.So I'm really losing out when this mode is strong. I'm not a happy person that I want to be, and people might be more distant from me. It's actually sad. Suddenly I have some compassion for myself coming up. I feel sad for the situation....Where did this come from?A memory of my father immediately pops up in my mind. He's scowling, frowning. His face is distorted. I can tell that he is suspicious of others, he's really paranoid in that moment.Gosh! I guess I picked that up from him! He was suspicious have lots of people when I was a child, and even today he is quite mistrustful of people, although he has mellowed in his older age. But back then he was paranoid about my Mum, her friends, people he worked with, even me and my sister. ...There is a memory, a very strong one, when I was a teenager. It was bedtime. My dad was already upstairs in the spare room. Him and Mum weren't sleeping in the same room by then. Mistrust. Hatred. Fear. Between them. I was in my room. My mum came upstairs. Before she went into the main bedroom, she went to the spare room when my dad was "sleeping" - because he wasn't, as it turned out - and locked the door from the outside. I think I asked her not to do it, but there was something like revenge going on for something he had done earlier in the day. She was less than 3m away from the lock door when my dad jumped up and started banging ferociously on it. He was banging so hard that he started to punch a hole. My mum ran downstairs and told me to come with her. I was on the landing by now. The hole appeared in the door. Splinters of wood were flying over the landing. I could see his fist. His hand was bloody. I could see has distorted face. He asked me to unlock the door. He said I should call the police. I was something like 13 or 14. I didn't want to do that. I was scared of him. But I did unlock the door with the key that was maybe on the floor or something. As soon as it opened I stood back. He ran out and I pretended to faint. I just didn't want to interact with him. So I pretended. He ran downstairs saying that he was going to call the police. I then snapped out of my "faint", and ran behind him shouting "No! Don't!" I remember stopping him when he was at the phone. My mum was outside, she called to me to say come next door - to the neighbours. And I did. I ran out.Later on, in our neighbours' living room, late at night, totally embarrassed, scared, lonely - I was on the sofa, my mum and the wife of the couple next door were with me. My dad was allowed into the house by the husband. Dad came into the room, telling all of us that my mum had locked the door and was planning to burn down the house and kill him.That really wasn't true. But he was totally paranoid. Our neighbours tried to calm him down. Eventually he left and went back to our home. My mum and I slept at our neighbours house that night. I was in my school uniform.I can feel my younger self, shocked, scared, distressed, frustrated, lonely, worried, angry, sad, deflated, embarrassed, guilty, numb.I'm sad for him now. Right now.I feel for him....What I like about the schema approach is that it's not just about countering or challenging the negative or inhibiting thoughts and actions in the here and now. It's not saying simply, "Don't do that! Stop thinking like that! Think positively!" It's about understanding where coping styles come from, trying to swim down to the bottom of the ocean, and connect with the lost, wounded child underneath - the child who was neglected and traumatised. It's about having an understanding the how the wounds of the past relate to the present, and showing - or learning to show - care for those wounds and vulnerabilities.So, to myself today I say, I know I didn't like my dad as a child or teenager. I was often very scared of him. I wanted to be nothing like him. But somehow, and I inherited his negative thinking patterns and behaviours. There is shame around that.But it's not my fault that I have this tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. On one level I inherited it from my dad. Not purely. My mum also has a tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. But for the moment I'm thinking about that memory with my dad, I'm thinking about how his paranoia Took over and lead to violent reaction that stayed strong in my memory for many decades. When I feel that paranoia, when I recognise that suspicious mode, it doesn't make me a bad person. There is a good reason why this habit of mind has come about. Patterns of mind that I inherited from my parents.I really forgive myself. I do.I genuinely feel lighter in my body. I feel lighter in my mind, I feel like I can let go of the paranoid thoughts about the man I'm with at the moment in our group. ...But ... It's interesting because I can now see how my mind is associating the person I am paranoid about with my father. My mind is relating this man today with my dad and how he treated me and my mum in the past. Ah! I see. I see.Fear of my father. Paranoia about his behaviours. Scared of his threats.Spotting similar signals in people today, and feeling threatened. Paranoia.It's understandable. Feeling on edge around certain people because of how my mind associate them with people who threatened me in the past. Again, it's not my fault. But I feel able to let this go. So it's not just about inheritance of certain patterns. It's to do with how I related to my parents as well. I think those two factors are behind my own paranoid thinking today....I want to connect. I want more lightness and freedom in my body and mind. I don't want to be trapped in this paranoid mode that keeps me separate from everyone else.I hope I remember about how things in the past that I had no control over brought about these inhibiting patterns of mind. I hope that I can keep that memory so I can forgive myself again and again, and in so doing let go, and find more freedom and happiness and connection....I think its best to finish this by taking a moment to remember that small, frightened child, and the frightened teenager, too - and just show a lot of understanding to them - to me. In my mind my self as I am now - my big self - is hugging my child self and my teen self. I am showing sorrow, sadness, care, Love, I am kissing them on the forehead as they cuddle up next to me. I say to them,"I'm so sorry that you were frightened and fearful for your own safety. I'm so sorry."I say to myself, looking in an imaginary mirror opposite where we are sitting,"I'm here now. I'm big and I'm strong, and I'm a good bloke - despite everything - I can be a good bloke very often, and I really do try. People are not against me. They want to connect. And although I'm fearful of how people will treat me, 99% of the time people treat me very well."It's true.I've had a few noticeable moments of shame in the past couple of days.As part of pulling myself out of negative states, I've been reflecting on the different components of my experience of shame. I thought I'd document and share them here, rather than the issues of what happened and when. It's because similar patterns keep appearing, and I find it useful to analyse the experience - literally, pick apart - to help me manage and respond more effectively. It's like being able to see all the different parts of the experience, so that I can attend to them separately, and therefore more productively, rather than rolling around in a quagmire of distress.It would be interesting if other people wanted to comment or add their own experience....Anatomy of Shame.Shame for me seems to involve:A strong Inner Critic: I notice this in sentences I say to myself such as, "God! I'm such an idiot." ... or "I'm so stupid." ... or "That was so embarrassing! Ugh!" Or, it could manifest as a projection onto other people, imagining them to be thinking or talking negatively about me, criticising me behind my back or while I'm with them etc. Or I notice it in the images of other people's crumpled, disapproving faces, or fleeting scenes in my mind in which I am shunned from other people or some group.A felt sense of anxiety and distress: I notice uncomfortable or distressing sensations run through my whole body. In particular, I notice an urge to cover up or hide myself. My hands and arms want to move into my body and over my face as if to protect or hide away - from imagined scorn of others.An urge to run away: I see this as a kind of behavioural avoidance. I want to be away from people, run and hide myself. My body is twitching to "get out of there".Rumination: I notice that I obsessively think over the thing that "I did" that caused me to feel ashamed. Over and over, my mind rehearsing the scene of the incident, trying to work out "how bad" the supposedly shameful act was.Worry: I notice worry thoughts, which are similar to rumination but are about the future. "What will people think?" ... "Will people treat me differently?" ... The worry includes an obsessive look for evidence in the past. That is, the rumination of "What happened" ties in with the worry about "the consequences". One feeds the other.Externalised Anger: If I am experiencing shame by proxy of another person's behaviour, particularly someone who is close to me, then I notice Anger directed toward them. For example, if a family member - or someone associated with me - behaves in a way that I think is "shameful" to me, then I notice how i get enraged with their behaviour. It's like my inner critic is turned outwards to other people, as if I were still connected to the shameful act as if Ihad committed it.Controlling behaviour: This can come in many forms. It could be about stopping or controlling or correcting other people's so called "shameful" behaviour. I think the externalising anger can be underneath this, particular if I go into a scolding or lecturing mode. Controlling could also be about trying to rectify how people perceive me by trying to manage my behaviour to be more preferable to them, as I see it. It could be about trying to "work on myself more" so that I don't repeat the shameful act again in an overt way. Attacking Others: This stems from that externalising anger as well. Perhaps if I feel slighted by others, I might verbally or even sometimes - thankfully rarely - physically move to attack them. I see this as a defence against the feelings of shame, using blame and attack to regain a sense of power and strength. I also do this attack vovertly, internally devaluing other people while perhaps acting charming on the surface to control how they perceive me.Compulsive self-soothing: I notice the urge to use self-soothing behavioirs to find relief from the feelings of shame and distress in my body. This might involve something like comfort eating or the likes. Or, it includes a kind of grandiosity. Mirror-gazing after a shame attack, for example, provides an ego-boost through the form of self-admiration (about my appearance or me as aperson) or coinciding thoughts of my own superiority. Or it could be writing a post to get some upvotes and congratulation from people here. ;)So... There are some elements of shame that I notice. What about yours?. When I'm around other people, I have often had that feeling that I should be likeable to the other person I'm with."Should"It's a feeling that anything other than coming across as perfectly buoyant and upbeat is wrong, that people won't like it, that they'll judge me and think badly of me; that I will be ostracised, shamed. I was just sitting with someone I know and feeling that feeling that I need to be on my best behaviour with him. For him. I think it's heightened because the person I'm with is so bloody positive and energised himself. That feeling of needing to perform as the good person is more prominent with certain people like this.A memory pops up from childhood: of me being the smiling child for the guests we had at home.That's what we did as a family when people came round. I guess not always. But it was often enough to leave a relatively strong imprint. My Mum did it in particular, and I followed suit. A presentation mode. False. And I'm not just saying that because the "false self" is a buzz term for us here. She was all smiley and upbeat. I think at the time I did see that it wasn't her usual behaviour, but l also think I thought that's just what we did with guests.I continued that into adulthood, that presentation mode of politeness. Affable. Accommodating. Showing that I was conscientious of other people's feelings. Showing I'm listening by overly nodding, mirroring expressions in the other person, being all smiley and positive glow. The problem was, of course, that I often hid how I was really feeling, which meant that - I think - I couldn't connect with people. The energy required to maintain that "attentive face" was also difficult to uphold. I would frequently leave social situations to be on my own - in the bathroom, mainly - just to not smile for a little bit.I was just programmed to be like that with people.I also got an ego boost out of it, though - at least for a little while at these social events. I would show up to as "The Happy Person" ... "The Charming Listener." Yes, i'd get high on that and look down on people who were not looking happy and cheerful, but instead "miserable" to my mind. Or worse. I really did devalue people consistently in my social groups. Although I turned up all smiles to events, afterwards I would very often criticise pretty much everyone in our social circle who wa there. There wasn't really anyone who wasn't a target of my critique at some point or other. I would moan to my partner that I didn't like these people and that I didn't want to see them. At a couple of points, he made comments about us having fewer and fewer friends because of my judgements....The thing is, these patterns were still active relatively recently. I think I did try to get better around this issue since 2020, but it's really in the last year or so - since self-awareness - that things have changed for the better.I do feel increasingly like I can turn up to social situations and show how I feel - or at least enough to feel real inside. I feel like I have managed to uncover a real self with me, more or less, which I based on how I feel and how I want to come across.But ... Old habits die hard, and sitting with our friend just now, I felt that pull to be the polite, attentive, jolly listener... But - yay! - I noticed this, and made an effort to not yield to those patterns. I presented more how I was (am) feeling. A bit non-descript. A bit not bothered all in all.And then it came to me: it doesn't matter if he doesn't like me. Because look, my emotions, my feelings, don't make a bad or unlikeable person. My feelings are ok, and I don't gave to hide them.I looked across at him and saw him all bubbly and happy. He's a healthy fellow, and generally positive. And I had an image of myself at the same time as different, separate. Two different guys with different feelings, doing OK sitting next to each other, with neither one particularly accommodating the other. I think this is nice to notice. I am - god dammit - gradually becoming my own self, and showing people who I am and how I feel....There are some obstacles to this process external to my own habits, namely people who overtly say to me that I should look of act differently, smile more etc. It's my partner in particular. He also has narc tendencies, and seems to get over-anxious as to how I show up. I have to fairly often say that I'm fine as I am when I'm not "smiling with teeth" as he says. It's a bit of a joke in some ways, but it's also annoying because it's so frequent. And I just want to have my face not in a smiling position in certain situations. I notice that it's when we're around other people. And I'm really not being a dick or anything. And I know, of course, that it is right to show up civil and polite to a degree. Just not so much.Anyway, I don't want to be too defensive or irritable about it. But it is a thing to deal with. Just again, though: I'm not going back in that happy-faced box. I know that a real me exists, I'm cultivating him, and I'm putting him out there.So something really shifted today. Large crack in the ground stylee. I'm sure it'll close again. Probably. But this is to document the \*massive gaping hole\* that has just vomitted everywhere.Sorry for the post splurge. But some cool things came out. I felt rage and distress and loneliness and panic ... Nothing new. But somehow I managed to let it be there more than before. YES!I wanted to run, punch, scream, ... I felt like everything was falling down, whipping up. I didn't know who I was. This is not anything new. It happens fairly frequently. But I somehow had more room to be ok with it today.I felt, and still feel, slightly more buzzy than usual. It'll pass, but ... I said to a friend: *I am bundle of criss-crossed and flailing live wires. With a beard. And some not too bad pecs now. And the delicious glimmer of abs. And a nice smile.*I do feel that this criss-crossedness is a part of me - a big part - that I do hide from myself and others.I am a bit bonkers. My thoughts are totally wild. I don't have psychosis, but my imagination is insane and I get also sorts of violent and scary thoughts popping in a lot. Not all the time. But it can happen.My moods flit around like ping pong balls in a tiny metal room. I try to cover it up by looking \*cool\* and \*hot\* and \*sharp\* and \*nice\* and \*calm\* ... and I can be all those things, but I'm also ... underneath ... this bundle of live wires sparking off.I feel more ok with that.This is me, bitches!!But you already knew ... It was me who had to catch up....bla bla blaHere's the thing:I suddenly realised that everyone else is a bundle of nerves with a cover.AND ... I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO BE NICE TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE MEEEE. Or could be one day, so it's good to be nice.AND ...I got chatting with one person who I previously was really irritated by, and FELT CONNECTION and was more my bonkers self, and just said what was on my mind, and SHE LAUGHED!!! And we had a connection, and it was cooooooooooooooool.Maybe if I show my anger and dance fun and sadness and terror and style and spunkiness and cockiness and my fragility and mood and terror and delight and mania and tiny-ness and wish to doninate ... somehow I'll find myself and it'll help.This is why I look in mirrors.Title.It's so awful.When I reveal the depths of whatever this is .... out comes the lava ..... Panic.Right now.Flashing images of the guy on the train platform coming towards me with his terrifyingly distorted face, attacking me.Flashing images of me attacking everyone on this train.Me going mad.Distress like a tornado in my body.The feeling of MUST GET OUT OF HERE.NOW....Shift.To sadness. I can cope. ...I can't afford it. Few can.This group is basically all there is for working things out.It really fucking annoys me how fucking expensive therapy is.I paid £180 an hour from November to February. Specialist in Npd. All my savings.OK. But ...That's ... four and a half hour long piano lessons.At least the therapist is happy. Woop! Woop! Bringing in the cash.OK. More pockets of unknown shite still there.Watching videos of therapists talk about narcissism.I sense my reactivity towards what they are saying.Why do therapists trigger me so much? Fuck sake.I just want to jump on them and beat them to a pulp. Sometimes I have imagined slitting their throats. Or jumping on their faces and punching and punching. They bring up this rage that I quickly stifle. But I know that the stifling is not helping me.iI stifle. All the time. I shut down my rage because it feels totally unacceptable.Well... that monster is still there inside, but rather than feeling scared, I think he's sexy as hell. Nope. That's yet more grandiosity.It's that deep rage and that come with tears. It's that feeling of being judged so deeply by another person. A distress that immediately makes me want to flip out and attack and blame.Oh fuck.It's like, everything I do is about making myself look good to others, including the progress I've made with my disorder. Posts. Comments. Everything. Style. Politeness. Being nice. Acting. Trying. Working on myself.I can't get out of it.I can't make exact sense of this.I'm really, really fucking horny.I'm getting much better at tolerating not getting upvoted.Yay! Fuck you, social belonging anxiety. Woof!It's rather silly for a 40-something to be concerned about these things, but I know you know how it feels. We all want it. *Gimme that upvote high!!!*And:*Where's my upvote, BITCH!!!?*And:*No one loves me. I'm basically invisible / about to die.*And:*Terrible!!! I did something that people didn't like!!!*You know, don't get me wrong, I still have these thoughts and feelings. But they aren't nearly as intense. Nearly. ;)When I first joined the sub and for a fair while after, I would more frequently delete posts that didn't receive many upvotes. Out of shame, having been slumped at home in sadness and despair.I still do occasionally delete posts. But the last time was because I felt I wasn't being myself - maybe not even a good reason to delete. But anyways. I'm generally getting better at staying with what I've put out - you know, if I feel it's real, I guess - whether or not it flies so well.To me, this is progress. Ding ding! I am standing up for myself more, being less wavering and tossed around by what people think, and caring less about every opinion I receive or don't, or getting caught up if I do something that is "successful" or not.Yay. Growth in confidence. Woop! Woop!I've also noticed I feel more capable being honest about my thoughts, rather than hiding them in case they are criticised....Biff! Another angle would be:Fuck it. I'm invincible, mate!!🤘(P.S. I'm not. Don't hate me. 😁)...Edit: Blimey! This is a test! 😁. Today I have been grandiose in the morning, depressed variously throughout the afternoon, and calm and steady in the evening. But right now, I am really grateful for this journey of discovery. Right now, I don't care about the downs. I know that they'll come again, and I'll absolutely hate it. There will be suicidal ideation and depression and shame. But there is also something about all those things that provides an opportunity.I really love those moments when the downs turn into opportunities for discovery and learning. It's like finding little pieces of the puzzle and putting them together. I love building that picture and working it out over time. I love how I've gone from a really flimsy smiling face of a person, hiding all the anger and doubt and anxiety and shame and torment, to someone with more of a sense of who I am, and able to express much more of what's going on inside, and feel like a real person with an actual self. That is really cool! I still have some weird experiences in terms of feeling fake, feeling empty, suddenly feeling very close to people and loving, before then feeling totally separate and isolated and full of hate and disdain. But I try to be mindful of what is going on, challenge my thoughts and feelings as best I can, and try to find some middle ground.I feel sorry for my young self before self-awareness I was trapped and very troubled. I raged a lot and had terrible panic everyday. Body dysmorphia. Eating disorders. OCD. Hypochondria. The works. All based around this very narcissistic personality structure that I had no clue about at the time, really. But I did the best that I could. I didn't know any better. It's nice to overcome a lot of that, even though the remnants are still there. I can still be pulled down by various things, but not nearly as strongly.My mind may never be completely stable. But in a way, I would kind of hate if that happened. I enjoy this journey where the weirdness of my brain and my reactions to things puzzles me, and drives me to find a solution. ...Late this afternoon, I was tired from - quite frankly - overworking. Again. I had a bit of a low point. Someone I'm working with was not getting their work done and it felt like it was really holding me back. I felt the anger and frustration and blame. I felt, too, the sadness underneath, and I started crying to myself, just walking down the street. It happens. Just gentle, quiet tears of frustration. It was part sadness and part kicking-and-screaming and blaming.I imagined my various 'inner good parents' step in with their messages that would calm me down. The message that really hit home was "I know you are so tired and frustrated. Now, this is what we're going to do... We're going to take it one step at a time. We're going to remember all the good things you've been able to do today..." etc etc. It really helped soothe me and shifted me into a more calm and steady state where I felt capable and strong.That was a cool experience. It's little things like that that drive me on. Every day. Every day I work on myself. Every interaction with people is hard in some way. But ... I am just trying to balance so much and make this life work as best as it can. It involves a lot of self-confrontation, moderating, taming, refining, tempering, nudging forward, holding back ... But I love this journey, as rocky as it may be.I'm sure I'll be desperately low tomorrow over some thing. But I'm also sure I'll find a way out. I know that by now.It is also seriously great to meet and hang out with some of the most deep, caring (lol) and inspiring people I've ever known, and feel that connection between us.Yay!. Which one do I choose for my story of growth and recovery? *Trigger Warning.*Which one do I go for for my suicidal ideation? *Upbeat Talk.*...Ah ha ... That pattern of childish rebellion ... That feeling of being caged in, and the explosion out ... That [Rhombicosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicosidodecahedron) being forced through a square hole ...That core need for autonomy childhood, chronically unmet ... ...*Well done, Peanut. Feel the feelings. Attend to your inner child.* Nope!I want to have a party and do wild mock interpretative dancing a la Kate Bush in the 1980s in front of everyone without drinking a drop of alcohol because I'm that special that I can do that. I hope everyone is jealous.*Don't tell me what to do!*Thanks. Venting - advice requested....*Chooses Flair. Cries.*. No I did not.I spent a considerable amount of time, picking, putting on, checking, enjoying my reflection, imagining what people will think, imagining people admire my looks, semi-consciously rehearsing my modest replies.Started with that tiny t-shirt that no one wears on a Tuesday work day. Tucked in. Ugh! Yes. But too much. Too obvious, complete with my sparkly glasses and over-quaffed hair. Such a narc. But actually: who cares!! Fuck 'em! Actually, shit! I do care. Too much. Try on that shirt over the top for the more casual look. Hm. Terrible shoulder projection. Tucked in. Yes!!! So sexy!!! But no, obvious porn star wannabe again. Untuck shirt and t-shirt. The sad compromise. Phew. I look good not too good. Totally casual. But you can still see my workout progress.Check mirror just one more time, or three, and... stare for a second, and... breakfast! "I'm coming!"*he glows into the kitchen*THE LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT.Hang on a mo...Other people are not two dimensional caricatures. Ooooooooo....They may look a certain way in their demeanour, but underneath is this mysterious Pandora's box of possibilities.They may look miserable right now. But they might suddenly burst into jokes and giggles.They may appear calm and sensible to me on first impression, but they may turn out to be rather lazy or slightly bonkers today.It's difficult to know what to expect. People surprise.Oh yeah! 😁...Does anyone else have this where they very easily and quickly box people into two dimensional "You are this or that"? Is this particular an NPD or PD thing? I kind of think it might be. I've noticed that I very easily seem to do this compared with others around me. When I cast my silly judgements or assessments of people, for example, my partner or friends suggest that things are more complex, and that I'm being too inflexible in my view.So, sitting on this train home, looking at people around me, it feels cool and nice and open in my body to shift this more fixed perspective of people towards something more complex and dynamic and surprising.Oh!. I have found this hard in life, accepting and appreciating other people's talents and abilities and skills and achievements and successes. Even close friends. Even my partner.But ... it's something I've worked on quite a bit over many years. It's gotten easier. And more often I can find myself actually enjoying other people's talents, rather than feeling that tug of envy in my chest.Tonight we went to a birthday party. Cheesy music on the dance floor. I work in music and have spent a lifetime listening to music as a kind of "work". What can I learn from this musician? How can I be as good or better than them? Why aren't I successful? Fantasising about my own potential. etc etc You know the drill.Tonight, I noticed that I just enjoyed the music and the musicians without comparing myself or getting twitchy about my own abilities or status (or lack of status) as a musician.I thought, "Oh, this is what normal people must feel like listening to music."It was ... very nice.To reduce stigma, some refer to BPD as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.Would you re-name NPD for a similar purpose? If so, what?I'm going with SERD for now: Self-Esteem Regulation Disorder, which I think I picked up from elsewhere. I think it would help me explain the symptoms and behaviour to people. I wonder if I would feel less isolated and less concerned talking about it.Also, SERD just rolls off the tongue. Clearly.SERD! 🌈. It's such a bad and swift turnaround, it's also funny.I should really know better by now. But I contine to fool myself, it seems.Us self-aware narcs are not always so different from (supposedly) healthy people.Everyone has narcissistic defences. Ours are just more pronounced and much more dysfunctional.But everyone has that armour, or can do.But here's our advantage as the self-aware crowd. We (hopefully, but not always) \*recognise\* at least some of our defences. And because we have a tendency towards hypersensitivity, hypervigilance, and over-analysis, we may (I think) see more of the layers of our defences, the subtleties and nuances, and talk openly about them (here at least). On average, I'd say most people don't....Defences come in all guises. Grandiosity, yes. Going on the attack. Antagonism. Angry rumination. Martyrdom. Complaining. But also just simple detachment from emotions.Everyone does this.Last night I was with a few friends at dinner. One friend brought up how she was worried about her Mum and Dad, the latter in particular because he was experiencing pain I his side, had previously had cancer, but had been ignoring the pain and the doctor or telling anyone until just recently. She shared her news and revealed a glimpse of her fears. I felt like she was human and I was human. I felt connection to her where previously I was struggling.Within surely less than a minute, another friend chipped in to say something like, "It's probably nothing", and turned the conversation towards something else. The friend with the unwell Dad followed along. The window of vulnerability opened and was quickly closed. I felt the moment where we could connect fall away from me.There it was in the group. Detachment. Cutting off from emotions that might be "too much", "awkward" or "intolerable".I felt lonely again, me with my feelings I sensed there was less room for. I closed up....When I teach my piano students, I try to notice my own state or mode as much as possible, and how the student is responding. I notice that when I've been in a more grandiose state, it feels fun and I feel awesome, and students may tag along with the energy for a while. Perhaps there is some comfort in being with a teacher who distracts them from their own feelings, through becoming the centre of attention in my jokes or quirkiness or through playing in a show-off or extravagant manner. But the sense of comfort and ease in the room doesn't last long. Quite quickly I notice that I become disconnected from the student. They are "over there" and I am "over here". We aren't vibing off each other.I think this is problematic for the student and the teaching, particularly in a one to one teaching context. The disconnection feels quite isolating for both of us. Quite lonely and even a bit scary for the student. In order for the learning to be "good", they need a sense of secure connection with the teacher. And it's true. When I'm in a more balanced, emotionally in-touch state, in tune with what's going on within me, sensing what is happening potentially in the student, verbally checking in with them and listening to their responses, and yet having that overall sense of stability and level-headedness, then the teaching can work better. I notice that students relax more and open up. They share their feelings about playing and we work to resolve problems that I could only know about if they are shared. Or it could be about them sharing their interests or preferences for the direction of travel in the lessons. That opening up allows them their autonomy, which is another key ingredient to success when we work together: I'm doing some guiding, but they are also participating and speaking up about what feels right for them in that moment. If I'm grandiose or detached - not checking in, not open about my own experience - then they don't have so much room to express themselves, and the lessons are about me more than them. And that's not good.I'm not saying that the good teaching is absolutely and totally dependent on my behaviour. But how I show up has at least some impact. And it is my responsibility, I believe, as the adult and professional, to think about these things and try to do my best for the client. Grandiosity is not totally awful and can create some kind of spark in the room. It can even lift people for a while, which is no bad thing. But if it is too strong or too prolonged, disconnection entails, and the learning process - and the joy of music - falls a bit flat....A core part of me, however much I deny it when I'm grandiose or emotionally detached, yearns for connection. I think we all do. It's a fundamental human need.I s'pose this post is aiming at a few things. A reminder for myself to notice that grandiosity or detachment within myself, and to try to find ways of softening the armour, to be more open, even vulnerable, to foster connection with others.I can't deny that there's also a bit of "come on, guys" to this post. I like you for you. Sometimes I feel that our defences get in the way of connecting here, in this special place - where we have that opportunity to connect. ...I say: let's go for it.If you are anything like me, you are sensitive, you have a sensitive temperament. People have told you that you are reading into things that aren't there. You are told that you are too much, too intense, think too much, are full of woe, or have too much energy, too happy, even.It can be lonely being an emotional and sensitive person. It can become easier to put forward what we think is an acceptable presentation of ourselves for others, hiding the fluid and intense feelings underneath. At the same time, it can feel like very few people seem to understand our emotional landscape inside, so we retreat inwards, becoming hyperautonomous and over-introspective, lost in our own thoughts, analysing our feelings, maybe seeing them as superior to that of others.These are perhaps some of the ways that narcissism has manifested in me, which leads to other self-interested behaviours that add to the suffering of feeling lonely and not understood, alien....But the intense feelings are also a gift. This is a tricky line to tread, because it can be easy - certainly for me - to over-treasure and over-personalise these gifts as "ours", making us special, better. So we have to be on guard for this kind of thinking that further separates us from other people, when what we really need is connection and understanding.At the same time, I think we can enjoy our emotions and find solace within them. Intense emotions allow me to experience life with greater passion. I find fulfilment through sorrow and grief, not just resting on everyday, superficial emotions. I have many emotional peaks throughout my days. They can be tough, but I am also grateful for them. It has been a difficult life sometimes. But rich. Very rich. Just being in my body every day.Maybe a view that accounts for both sides of the coin can help keep us level-headed. We are both unlucky and lucky. Recognising the pluses and minuses gives me a sense of balance, and both limits my tendency towards self-aggrandisement and keeps me from a sense of unhelpful self-pity....One of the things I like about this forum is that it is filled with intense people, quite willing to go to the depths. Very fulfilling. I am glad.We can get better. ...Another low effort post.Oh! ...Low effort post. Sorry. But that's it.I had a post earlier about what being kind to ourselves means to different people here.It occurred to me that - of course - for many of us, we struggle to even know what it is to be kind or self-compassionate, because we didn't experience it, or it wasn't modelled to us in childhood.When I started my own journey of recovery about 13 years ago, I also really had very little clue about compassion in some respects. My attempts at compassion for others were more like grandiose manipulations of their emotions, positioning myself as "the person to lean on", being "the wise advisor" and so on. Yes, it wasn't all bad. People may have got things from the interaction. But for me, it was probably more about feeling good about myself, and seeing myself as the bigger, better, wiser person, rather than actually connecting with the person in need. I didn't really have a feeling of connection with them, I don't think. It was more: what can I get out of this interaction? If they feel good at the end, then I will feel good, and that was probably more of the main goal.Attempts at self-compassion ... ? I mean, I didn't know. I remember during therapy in 2020, my therapist "introduced" the idea of compassion to me. It was kind of new to me. I didn't really have a feeling about it. I said I would try to be compassionate to myself, but it wasn't really something I felt. It was more of a logical, cognitive exercise.One time in therapy again last year, I was doing a particular exercise in self-compassion. My therapist asked me to think about what my "healthy adult / role model" might do in a particular imagined situation. I pulled from a list of ideas I had made in the previous year, which I'd jotted down on a piece of paper. Having said out loud what I'd do, I quickly burst into tears, realising that while I knew the answer now, it was something that took me so many years to work out. I was sad for my younger self who didn't experience the compassion a child should receive, and so had to strive to learn it as an adult in a very haphazard way,Now, I do have a better understanding of being nice to myself and others, but it didn't come from me. It took effort, and I had to look for it from other people: by observing friends, characters in films and TV, and podcasters like Tara Brach - who really taught me a lot in particular.So it was a bit presumptuous of me earlier to ask people how they could be kind to themselves today, when it took me a very long time to work it out. I didn't think clearly about it.I had to outsource it. It doesn't come from us. But I do believe it's possible for us to internalise and make our own the behaviours - and eventually feelings - of other people.As I said, one personal go-to in my journey was Tara Brach. She also teachers meditation, and while I found her meditations really nice, it was really the podcast talks that were helpful. I learnt so many things through her talks. I imagined her as my new inner parent. I would speak to her in my mind's eye: "I'm stuck. What should I do?" ... And I would, because I'd listened to her so much, more and more easily imagine what she might say back to me in various situations: "I see you're hurting. I see you're angry. I'm so sorry you're struggling." Just that - that empathy delivered to myself through my imagination - was enough sometimes to help me calm down. I remember that when I couldn't sleep at nice because I was so enraged, imagining Tara Brach come to my bedside like a mother figure, sit down on the bed, rest her hand on my body and say, "I'm so sorry you're hurting right now" ... that would allow me to relax and drift off to sleep.I still struggle with real empathy sometimes, but it's better. When I can't connect properly, I can still say the words that I learnt from Tara Brach, and feel that they might have a positive impact on people like they had on me. It's like: passing on what I learnt through her. It's also far less grandiose than it used to be. I've learnt to let the other person work it out for themselves more, with just little nudges, rather than dictating how I think they "should" think or feel or reflect. Yes, there is still some grandiosity involved on my side, but it's less and less.So there you go. I just wanted to say that.No jokes or cynicism. 😁For me, it's lowering - even by just a knotch - the demands and expectations I put on myself to be productive and perfect in all spheres of life all the time.For once, not doing, but just being. Not pushing forward fast. Allowing life to unfold on its own a but more. Strolling rather than sprinting. Whoops. I dropped the juggling balls. Oh well. I'll pick them up some other time. It's be OK.That is the kind of kindness I need today. What about you? It could be completely different.I'd say these are two core features of my personality, as I currently see it. I wondered if other pwNPD relate in their own way.A comment by u/KickLongjumping4433 got me thinking about these aspects of me.In Schema, they sometimes talk of a 'Defiant Child' mode, which is an "angry response to having one’s autonomy curtailed and being told what to do."Then there is the Rebel Mode in Schema. A Schema theorist I like, David Edwards, quoted some key statements linked to this mode of behaviour: “I dislike rules and can get satisfaction from breaking them,” “I think of myself as a rebel; I often go against the established authority,” and “I enjoy being unconventional, even if it’s unpopular or I don’t fit in.” He goes onto say: "This mode externalises a backstage Defiant Child, and incorporates a narrative that portrays it as a valuable identity. Expression may range from being more passive-aggressive to being actively, even militantly rebellious."...I definitely have these elements in me. And I think it's important to keep in mind that they arise in response to a sense that autonomy is being taken away or denied. Or was in the past, as a child. We have a core need to individuate / differentiate from other people, and ... this is an undeveloped part of me. I didn't properly go through the individuation process because of my over-bearing, enmeshing mother and terrifying father. No space for 'me'.I really see where this lack of autonomy comes from in myself, and why it's such a big trigger for the defiant part of me. When I feel like my independence and sense of personal choice as an adult is undermined or unfairly questioned, like it was in childhood, I get angry really quickly. RAGE! There is a teen-like "Fuck you!" flavour to the anger. Two fingers up. Slammed doors. Vent post.I guess the rebel mode in me, if it's linked to this sense of angry defiance underneath, is the lighter and more playful version of this rage. It's the mischief in me, as I've identified many times before. Disgusting jokes. Pranks. Banter. Giggling about my misdemeanours. Revelling in the naughtiness.I've mentioned, for instance, that I see myself as quite emotionally immature in some respects, or at least that this can come forth in me fairly often. I feel an almost mischievous glee about this aspect of my personality. Again, I think it connects to that sense of rebellion: "I'll behave like a teenager, and it'll make me different, annoying, unconventional etc." But I think it also reveals that underlying angry defiance. It has a kind of: "Fuck you, social conventions!" flavour in there too. I'm not great with rules....I'm sitting on the bed - like a teenager - typing this. Ahead of me is a large mirror. Occasionally, I'm looking up and channelling that rebel / defiant mode through my face, to see what comes up.Gosh. I actually do this often throughout my day! Lol. This is the mode that pops out in the bathroom mirror, for example, when I run there to escape the adult dinner party conversations that I detest. I pull this face to myself. What is it saying? ... "Don't fuck with me!" ... "I don't give a fuck." ... "You're all a bunch of wankers." ... "Fuck this boring shit." ... Maybe I'm thinking these and similar things to myself in the mirror because I feel I can't say them to the people I'm with. Maybe I use the mirror to express or display parts of myself generally that I feel not able to say out loud. I kind of put those parts of me into the mirror, where they are safe. The mirror is a safe space to express myself. Oohhhhhhhh!...The thing is, if I follow the Schema model, then underneath all of that is the vulnerable childlike part of me. A part of me LOVES being this rebel, and wants to deny that there is anything else going on. But to do that would not do myself any favours. It would be to keep me stuck in a way of coping with life - through feeling and being rebellious (passive and active) - rather than actually attending to any wounds underneath that are driving those parts of me ... to, quite honestly, behave in ways that I can regret or bring me a sense of shame in the aftermath.So as I continue to gaze into the mirror, I also find a safe moment to express other things to myself. The mirror is my display cabinet for my deeper emotions I feel unable to share anywhere else.A sadness quickly reveals itself. Loneliness. Fatigue. Bleakness. Depression. Feeling ugly. Feeling unwanted. Feeling unloved. Totally.I spend a moment staring at my face, which shows all these emotions and more that I can't describe properly. It feels good to acknowledge that these feelings are there. I suddenly realise how tired I am.Life is tiring for many reasons. Just tapping into one particular aspect, though, it's tiring not being able to express my emotions in public, or at least *feeling* like I can't. It's tiring feeling like I have to wrap up my emotions in some publicly acceptable presentation that doesn't feel natural to me. It's tiring and frustrating. My sadness shifts to a childlike anger: "Why can't I just say what I want, how I want?! Why do I have to follow these rules of self-expression when they are so stifling and unnatural?" I feel sad again. ...And then I feel that playful rebel part of me come through. It's like a way of distracting myself from he sadness and frustration. There he is in the mirror once more, and I feel my thoughts turn to mischievous things I might think or do later in the day, just to "get my own back". Hm. Defiance. Feeling controlled again, and so engaging in thoughts and behaviours that give me a sense of taking back control, or defying the authority that I don't agree with....I do like this rebellious and defiant part of me, though. Yes, it's immature, and I can do or say some things in that mode that later induce shame, but there are also many upsides. People laugh at my stupid jokes and silly, childlike behaviour. ATTENTION! But the mood of the room lightens.It actually also works well in my work as a piano teacher, where, depending on the appropriateness of the moment, I can be playful and cheeky and poke fun at social norms (especially around music performance and assessment, for example), and it's all part of the package: the slightly quirky piano teacher, helping people escape - for 30 minutes at least - the trappings of school or adult life. I play a bit of the fool if it feels right to do that, and the intention is to lighten the mood sometimes, and give space for people to undo their social conformity, get a bit more childlike themselves and connect with and lose themselves in the music - which is what we're aiming for....I don't want to get rid of the rebel in me. He's funny and cute and energising. But I do think it would be good to recognise where he comes from as well, and tend to that sadness underneath a bit more....Now, where's my rocket. 🚀. I have gotten a lot of helpful comments to posts since I started writing here.Recently, a few people have pointed out my potential black and white thinking on various situations. On reflection, I do see that I still struggle with this style of split-off thinking and perception of myself, other people and the world around me.My understanding is that this is a feature of NPD. I just re-watched a HealNPD YouTube video on integration and splitting, and related to it a lot.I generally see myself as split into 'parts' that feel radically different from one another. Some I instinctively feel are 'all good' while others I perceive as 'all bad'. Well, that is my tendency anyhow. I am trying to enjoy and appreciate that sides that I previously felt terrified to acknowledge. And I am also experimenting right now in seeing the downsides of my "pure hearted" parts. But my mental reflex is still to see these parts as cut off from one another and either dastardly or wholesome. It feels hard right now to perceive a middle ground. Grey areas in my thinking are appearing, I guess. But it takes conscious effort to think like this.I also have the habit of associating my "real self" with these different parts at any given time. When I'm in a low mood, I can easily think, "Oh. That's the real me." But when I'm grandiose or otherwise, I think just the same and ignore the low mood from before. In either state, it feels difficult to imagine that the "real me" is both or the opposite of where I am currently at. I am also obsessed with trying to figure out who "I really am". It's another mental reflex that I have to consciously pull myself away from often.Historically, I have tended to see people as "all bad" or "all good". In the past, I would easily want to discard people in my life who I thought were "evil" or against me or not worth the effort because they were "boring" or "stupid" or "aggressive". I would also idealise some other people as being "good-natured" or "great".These days, I still have that tendency. But I do more readily see people as more than one thing.But I now find it confusing that some other people are much more "blended" than I am. I see there "good" and "bad" qualities, but I don't see those parts as split off from one another. Some people don't shift in and out of different "modes" of behaviour and mood like I do. They are more "one thing with subtle flavours."I see that other people do have quite different sides to them that appear in different contexts. But I somehow don't perceive that as problematic in them, whereas it feels totally problematic that this could be the case with me. The idea that I am not constant confuses me and feels "wrong".I am a kaleidoscope of moving parts that come to the surface, and I don't really know anything different. It feels very disorientating to live in a kaleidoscope, with parts that I cannot hold onto for long, or comprehend as ok or me or real. I am constantly questioning my sense of identity. How can I be both terribly kind and a complete cunt at different times? To others, that might not seem like an issue or something worth worrying about. But to me, my sense of identity plays on my mind every day. Who the fuck am I? The cunt or the cute kind one? It really bothers me. How can I be both?When I am with people, I feel these different parts rise and fall in my persona. They can be very intense and radically different. Rage then anxiety then cockiness then tearfulness then joy. I think I try my best to appear as one person, trying to present a stable image to the world, or as I imagine the people I'm with would want me to be. That has always been my tendency. But it is quite an anxious state, where I'm simultaneously managing what's going on underneath, which is a lot. My therapist said she could see waves of emotions pass quickly through me in session. That is me without the mask on. A montage reel of contrasting parts, flipping very quickly from one to the other. A multipart chorus of voices singing in different tonalities. I feel I am getting better. So that's good. It feels very hard to do this sometimes, but I am trying to present to people more how I want to be or feel in the moment, rather than how I instinctively and subconsciously imagine they want me to appear. It still feels anxiety inducing and challenging. I guess this comes down to feeling like I "had" to be one thing but not another as a child. I had to appear to get along with my parents, for example, even though they terrified or mistreated me. I had to pretend to the world that everything was fine a home, even though it was a scary place to live. I felt I had to please my parents by presenting in particular ways but hiding others. Then being a musical child gave me a place to really escape all of that. I would get attention and shine on the little stage. I would enjoy living inside that bubble of peace and excitement.Writing this makes me feel sad that the trauma or neglect I experienced as a child had such an impact on my brain.I know a little about what's going on here, but would appreciate any more input. What I am really hoping for is some understanding and guidance.Rip off the mask and underneath there is a really nasty side of me. It is not all of me, but it is a real part. I've written about it elsewhere a few times, but I guess I'm coming back to it to try to consolidate my thoughts a bit further.You see, I'm on this journey of mine. I want some kind of reconciliation of my various parts, however contrasting. I want some kind of integration, rather than this splitting of my psyche. I don't want to present in one way to people but feel completely different underneath, or try to push that other side away from my being. Or at least I want to do that less and less, or when it's only necessary. I don't want to split into different and distinct modes so much. I want to have access to more of my whole self, and use those different sides more wisely.I just ... want to be whole. It's not like I'm starting from scratch at this point, but ... that's my journey, which I don't mind repeating and repeating. I want it. I want it....So this nasty side... Once again, like many of my 'tricky parts' it seems, I have hidden it from others, and denied it to myself. Shut it down. Tried to quieten it or change it. Step away from it. Let it shrivel.But it keeps coming back. It won't change. It's just 'there'. An aspect of my personality.It actually pops out when I look in the mirror. It's there in my eyebrows. Lol. :)This nastiness has many flavours:It is rebellious to authority. Antagonistic. Highly irritable. Fractious. Wanting to scold, belittle, shame, lecture, control others close to me. It is sneering at people. It is reducing them to an object that I can mentally demean and ridicule. It is taking some pleasure in shocking people, intimidating them, making them uncomfortable. It is wanting to start arguments only to gain the upper hand. Doing things that most people would find somewhat shocking. It is petty and vengeful. It sometimes imagines doing harm to others. It is pure, wicked mischief.In another post recently, I wrote about a power-hungry side of me. In some ways, this feels a bit different. But these two sides, I guess, could potentially combine. I'm not sure right now.That would be quite something if they did combine and were let loose....This nasty side of me has, in particular, caused me great anxiety in the past. Like: panic for it even being there. *Where did it come from? Is this the real me? Help! I thought I was a good person. I want to be that good person!* But, thankfully, that anxiety has been diminishing through some self-work I've been doing.This past year, I have actively tried to recognise it when it appears and allow it in through my mind and body. In time, I have grown to appreciate but also enjoy it. It has a wild and electrifying energy that really excites me.Apologies for being graphic, but it's become a real turn-on when I'm having a wank. It just really does it for me, and I'd say is part of what I'd call my autosexuality. It's like I'm turned on by this really cuntish side of my being.I can also now look in the mirror at myself and, rather than see it and deny it, change my face to obscure it - I can instead think, "I really like this wicked side of me" and not flinch neatly so much. In fact, I feel the thrill of it....And yet: do I actually want to be a cunt to people? Er ... *No ? ? ?*No. I don't want to hurt people. I don't like that.But it's not a 100% no, either. The nastiness is still there. And I quite like the mischievous aspect of it. It's entertaining, both in the moment and talking about it with similarly-minded or accepting others. There are also ways I have recently discovered to enact this nasty mischief that don't actually cause people harm, but do cause considerable pleasure and thrill.Naughty Peanut....There are definitely aspects of it that I don't want. I don't want to be a dick to my partner, my family, friends or people at large. I don't like scolding or ridiculing my partner or other people. I don't want to lash out at people. I don't want to overtly demean people. I want connection. I want to see people as whole in themselves. I don't want to be controlling of others. I want to let them to exist as they choose. I want to help people more. I want to try to get along with more people. I want to be more generous (though it's quite an effort sometimes!).But again: I want connection....And yet, I do want the energy of that nasty side. I guess just without the behavioural nastiness.I'm hoping that, now I've acknowledged it and enjoyed its presence, I can keep it in mind, draw from its energy, but without the mental or behavioural degrading of others.That covert mischievous aspect seems like it could be an answer. Revelling in little non-harmful misdemeanours in private. And having a good ol' wank about it.I could be kidding myself again, but I'm hoping that can help with the reconciliation and integration.I'm nervous posting this.Not so much about the title, but about whether I've been able to explain my experience effectively....I've been on this path of trying to be more honest with myself, allowing parts of my psyche to be acknowledged and felt, so I can be authentic to myself at the very least.It's not a new thing. It's been going on for a while, this trying to peel back the layers.When I access some hidden or shunned part of me, there is a burst of energy that feels amazing. A real high. It's also psychologically wonderful to acknowledge and accept and even celebrate parts of me that I previously felt ashamed of. Then it settles and becomes a part of me that I accept and recognise as an element of 'me'. It's something I've been doing this year more and more....Today, with a new zeal for this process, I felt a part come forward that I've been scared of, and written about elsewhere. I've always tried to shut it down. But today I was ready to allow it in.It was interesting to feel it come forward when I was out in public. It came through in how I felt in my body and on my face. I noticed it in my thinking and feelings about myself and others.At first it was just a feeling, but I allowed it to come forward more and take centre stage. If it were a character, they would be ... dastardly, cunning, manipulative.And then I realised what was at the core of this part: a real lust for power.It reads a little inconsequential when I read that back now. But that lust, craving, yearning for power, dominance, recognition, status is an important and not small part of me.I allowed it in, allowed my thoughts to be focused on gaining and having power. The energy release that came over me was massive, like a huge sexual energy.I was walking in the street. I tilted my head back and looked to the sky like I was having an orgasm. That energy coursing right through me. It felt fucking fantastic, thinking about power....There I was in the street, and I acknowledged it to myself. I have a huge lust for power, and all the above I've described.Status. Ugh.Reputation. Drool.It's been there since I can remember. It drives my actions, even though I've tried to deny it, shut it down.But today, I said to myself that this is not just a part of me. I said: *I AM power hungry*. For someone who has been trying or pretending (to others and myself) to be the 'good guy' my whole life, this is a huge step. It felt massive.I dived back into that part of me. I had thoughts of manipulating people to gain status, a good reputation, recognition etc ... Wow! What a turn on!I thought of how people in my life give me compliments for my work. Something so small. But again: that quite sexually charged rush as I realise what I'm in it for. That feeling of being on top.Admired.Revered.Ugh. Drool. DROOL!!!!!Literally cum in my pants....Whenever I felt this part of me before, I was scared what I would do with this drive for power at the helm. Would I hurt people?Would I want to hurt people to gain power?Maybe this sounds ridiculous to you reading this. I guess I'm condensing quite a lot of work and experience into short paragraphs. But ... I did a test. I walked passed a few people and noticed how my body reacted. I usually feel small physical urges pretty well. I was curious to see if an urge to hurt people would come through with this part of me being more dominant.But ... no. Nothing.Maybe it'll be there another time and surprise me. But ... no. No urge to hurt people to gain power.Oh! Didn't see that coming.I mean, no judgement if you do actually want to hurt people. I get that others here might have that. But ... I don't.Neutral....I went to a shop. A homeless man sat outside the door. I asked him if I could buy any food for him. As we had our exchange, I observed what was happening in my mind and body. Interesting how that lust for power died down. I bought the food, gave it to him, didn't really feel that much for it. Then went back to my thoughts of power lust and having an orgasm in the street....And another thing. I thought about other people having power as well. And, oh yes: that's why I get envious. But, wait... it also just turned me on more. To be around people with that same lust as I have.WOOF!Hello r/NPD!...I also realised that this lust secretly drives my behaviours: in my work, in my relationships. Oh ... I'll be nice, if I get the power out of it.And oh, I'll work hard and do well for others, for the recognition.But also true is that in the moment of working with others, I don't actually feel that power drive, that yearning for grandiosity. I work one-to-one to help people feel good and be creative. My focus is on them in the room for the most part.But I tell where that lust for power comes out: between sessions. That's when I self-aggrandise about how brilliant I am and have been. Or when, as I said, I get compliments....The do-gooding part feeds the power-hungry part.The power-hungry part drives the actual do-gooding....But also ... I realised and felt inside that when it comes to it, when the chips are down ... I'll ignore or dismiss my power craving and do the right thing for people.Interesting.The fear of this part of me dissipates. Just something to enjoy....It doesn't even make me feel that relieved. It's just how it is. Neutral....PEANUT (wants all the) POWER.So obvious.At least now I know.BUT ...What?Both power-hungry AND ok to share with others.WHAT?...I deny some of my thoughts and feelings to even myself. I'm trying not to. That's a big task for me. Here I am, trying.I'm trying to be whole.I want to go further along this path, to see all the different parts of me and accept them. But I'm scared....Sometimes I feel I present to myself and the world that I am this pure-hearted, clean-thinking guy.And I do feel love. Not for everyone. Maybe ultimately only really for my partner. I'm scared that he'll die and then I'll have no one who I actually love.I have thought that I would probably kill myself if he died.DRAMAS!But true: I have thought about it....I am happy-go-lucky and bouncy in my presentation in public.But that's not all that's going on.I'm incredibly self-obsessed and selfish, and can be quite vicious underneath. That's what I hide from people. I hide from myself as well.Is it that I aim to get along with people in my life, but that's about it?The feeling of power is intoxicating for me. Any kind of power.I write my chirpy emails to my clients, thank my colleagues for their help. I maintain that connection. Appearing all cheerful and like I care.But I also sense this other, exciting part of me that wants them to like me so I can dominate and be on top. Shine. Be brilliant. Own the room. Just dominate. Ooof. It's definitely there. And it's not a nice part of me.It's actually quite a nasty side. Sneering. Judgemental. Using people. Manipulative. I've been scared of this part of me all my life. Is this the real me, after all?FUCK!!!!!It is a real part of me, for sure. I feel it.I worry about what would happen if this part of me took over.I worry about what I could or would do, without a care.The darkest part of my humanity....Is it possible to be so cheerful and nice and enjoy connections, and yet on the other side be so damn ... black hearted?FUCK!....Do I actually like people at all? Anyone?Thinking about it ... Yes. I actually do. I do. Thank God. Thinking about people I know. I do. I feel it. Thank fuck. It feels like a relief to feel those nice feelings about people.Phew ... Sigh ... But it's like I'm clinging onto the edge of a cliff here. Holding onto the good.Desperate not to fall. In case......That nasty side of me. The side that gives me a great feeling of energy and power.Dare I say it, but it's actually an evil side to me....A colleague just came into the room as I typed this.I chatted with her. Her presence felt warm and kind. I enjoyed being with her. I felt equal. I felt connected. Oh thank God. There it is again: that nice feeling. I AM OKAY!!!...Am I deceiving myself for even thinking that I have this 'dark side'? No. It's there. He's there. That flavour of Peanut.Charged with energy. Evil glint in the eye....I have had this idea that my contrasting sides could somehow integrate, blend.I say, sometimes, that some mid-point between dark and light is this cheeky wanker middle man: a cunt with a heart. 🌈...I dunno. Another colleague just came up.I liked being with him. We chatted. It felt natural. Easy.No cheeky wanker....Or maybe I was just mirroring him. ... Ugh.My mind.Who the fuck am I?...Why do I have these thoughts? Is this NPD or another issue?What? Just generally: what? How? Who? ...Who's deceiving who?Am I deceiving you all here? Sometimes. I'm trying not to....Does anyone have a clue about any of this?. Are your narcissistic traits constant or do they glitch on and off?In my work as a piano teacher, I find my narcissism is often out of the picture. In that moment with students, I do devote most of my energies to the person, or to managing my own emotions and wellbeing so I can show up and be present for them in a healthy way.Outside of that context, I can be a right narcissistic silly cunty twat. Mostly covert. Mostly. But again, not always. It's interesting how different situations ignite my narcissism, while others don't.Enough about me. When are you narcissistic and when are you not?What is it that brings out your narcissistic defences? What triggers you?Or ... Are you narcissistic all the time?. I'm knackered as I write this.I'm so tired. Work. Over work. I do that. Physically shattered. Mentally barely here right now.I read some bit of Schema Therapy research that connected proneness to fatigue and burnout with the Unrelenting Standards schema. I have this schema. It's common for people with NPD, apparently.I have sort of burned out a few times in adulthood for sure. Anyone else?Very high standards. Rigid expectations. Perfectionism. Of course. Of course.The drive to be on top. The best. Harder. Faster. Better.Drive. Drive. Drive.Do you relate?///I had a really hard day, work-wise. Physically demanding. I felt dizzy from the stress. But I also thought: "Hey, at least I'll be burning loads of calories and will therefore look good whilst fainting."I hated today, but also found solace and joy in pushing myself.Feeling that I'm on top of everything and pushing hard gives me a bit of a thrill.Feeling that I look good whilst doing the work gives me a boost of energy.Do you get that?///Of course, I'm also working to tame this side of me. A calm breath. A stroll instead of a walk. A break instead of doing anything. But that underlying push to the top of my game is always there and needs managing. ///I have a thing called 'wellbeing Thursday' in order to give myself a break in the week. Thursday mornings ARE MINE! Everyone else can just fuck off (unless you're one of my narc pals). Just : No work. No non-narc friends in cafes because I happen to be free. Nope. I do as I please. On my own, in my narcissistic pleasure dome for one. Thank you Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday, and Good Night.Oh my god.I realised a key difference in the way I treat the people I've met and made friends with here, compared to how I treat people in real life, especially my partner: Unconditional love.Unconditional love, unconditional positive regard or whatever you want to call it. I understand it to be a core emotional need that we often - in this group - didn't have met in our childhoods. Instead we were loved conditionally. And we were taught to love others conditionally. That if we do "X", we get love, or a substitute for love: praise or attention. Something like that.Is it total, 100% unconditional love and positive regard I have for my sub friends? No. It's not perfect. But ... the tendency is there. The habit. The inclination to turn that on rather than block it out and judge. A part of me does judge. But I can shift to overcome that. See passed that.I wonder if it is this that in part lays the foundation for the strong connection I have for people from here. That I had with Nick.I notice I very much try to be much more accepting, seeing potential dissonances, flaws or faults as collective or shared, and which have a context: the wounds we have from the past. I notice my tendency to forgive aspects of behaviour that don't gel with me, letting them go, seeing even antisocial behaviours as the manifestation of coping mechanisms built up from early-on to manage those wounds. Survival tools. I also notice that I listen to them, that I take their advice or even their criticisms on the chin and reflect on them. Not 100% perfectly, but much, much more easily than with people I know in my every day world and definitely with my partner....I had a disagreement with him just now going to the train station. We were on the verge of shifting into an argument. Well I was.I noticed that I was judging him. Of course. I do that. And I placed so many conditions on showing him love, feeling love for him. I do that too.He needs to lose weight. He needs to not drink so much. He needs to do as I would, essentially. Something Few said in an earlier comment about treating people as extensions of myself. It resonated and I related it to how I treat my partner. I am controlling. I am irritated by his actions that don't fit with me.We had our disagreement and I did my usual thing of calmly yet precisely cutting him down. Well done me. He's not perfect. He cuts me down too. But that doesn't stop me from wanting and trying to change for the better, for our relationship as a whole. I saw that he was hurt, though he didn't want to admit it.Then I managed to wonder, "What would I feel and how would I act if this was Nick, or someone else I am close with on the sub?" The motley crew / cast of the NPD version of Friends.I would show them that unconditional love. I would see passed the difficult or antagonistic behaviour, the controlling tendencies or the outbursts. I would see the wounds from before we met. I would tune into them and try to understand things from their perspective. And I would get there much more easily. For the first time, really, I saw my partner as a raw, wounded individual - I'd now say he's very likely NPD but far from self awareness. I saw his his difficult behaviours as the only way to survive that he knew.I turned to him and said, "You might not believe this, but over time, I've grown to love you more. And I just now saw you and loved you in a very new way."I stood there on the platform, looking at him and felt that zing of comnection in my chest, which is so easily blocked out. It surprised me. I noticed that I hadn't felt it like this before. Not really that much.(Then our train pulled in and I caught my reflection in the reflection and thought, "Oo. And... I'm also hot right now." Yay!)...I realised that I really could do with treating my partner - and other people in my life like someone from our little community: with empathy and compassion. Unconditionally. Or more so.Because he is wounded like the rest of us. ...I'm honestly proud of myself for this insight, and yes I'm sharing it here because of my pride. It's also to document for myself for future reference. A reminder of what matters.Nick would have said, "I'm proud of you, man." I would cringe when he said it. I would block myself from feeling his affection and care. I should have let that care in back then. I want to let it in now.I have received a great deal of very helpful support since Nick's death. I'm not the only one who needs it, but I was probably closest to him out of everyone I know here. So I greatly appreciate it. I have been with friends in real life, and we have had our laughs and good times. They have also given me hugs and space to be as I need. But on my own I have been blanking out, crying, distraught, very lonely, lost, depressed and shattered - confused. I'm glad I reached out for help in my lowest moment. As I wrote to Emotional_Climate, it's interesting how receiving a few kind words can have a big positive impact. You all really helped me. Thank you.💛...I don't know that Nick always felt truly supported by me. He said he did, but ... towards the end I had pulled away for such stupid and selfish reasons. I also don't know that he felt understood by me or other people. I'm not saying he suicide is all my fault in some self-centred way. But the very painful thing I've had to face is that my behaviour - my absence and lack of attunement - were at least one factor in his demise. There were many people who let him down, and I was one of them. I think that's the hard truth, no matter how small my impact was. At one point, we were so connected. It was quite unreal. We both said how special the friendship was, so ... I have to consider and understand that I failed him, and that this, in part, established the environment in which he decided the only option was to take his own life.My options going forward feel to be: kill myself, crush myself with self-flagelation as I live on, or live and try to do better. I'm choosing the latter. But I believe I need to feel the pain of the situation to do that. Some self-flagelation feels needed. I believe I need to understand where and how I let Nick down in my own way, feel the pain of that and use that to change in future. Maybe that's me trying to be heroic on some level. But I also can't just go forward and leave the pain aside, or try to. That would be to forget Nick, and I don't want to do that. It would also be to deny that I did anything wrong, and I believe that I did.The future has to be: better attunement with others, better listening, more compassion. People say that I do that, but ... I think there are others who have developed this skill much better than me. I can be so self-absorbed, I don't listen, even though I may appear to. I want to do better. I have been trying to do that in the last few days.The act of listening more and responding with compassion feels very possible. I know how to do that, I just don't always do it enough or when it really counts. It can turn off. But turning it on with sincerity feels like something I can do. But it feels somewhat complicated. I also don't want to cut out the parts of me that I think are "bad" and replace them with what is "good". Sometimess my self-centred parts are strong but I override them. But in doing so, it also feels like I'm shutting part of me off. I did that time and time again already throughout my life, and it only created a false self of "the good guy" - denying that I have these parts of me that are self-centred and even obnoxious. To deny those parts will lead to another collapse, just as I has in the past, when that false self disintegrates. Somehow I can't deny that I am, on some level, very selfish, and yet on another level, I am not.How the fuck do I reconcile that and be authentic, and still be better? Because i want that change in myself in honour of Nick. I really don't know. These parts of me feel so different, they feel hard to reconcile.Since I found out he killed himself. I don't know what else to say. A part of me feels I shouldn't being asking for help. I'm scared to, but I really need it.u/Arise23 has passed.He was my good friend from afar. We met here and had an instant connection.I quickly saw what a remarkable person he was. I saw his incredible capacity for love. He was passionate. He was articulate. He was very giving. He was a great listener and a great laugh. He was a fantastic advisor. He was brilliantly talented. I admired him a great deal. He taught me about male friendship. He helped me grow as a person - as a man. He helped me heal wounds from the past. He guided me.In the short time we knew each other, I came to love him as a brother. He told me he loved me, and I told him I loved him back. He called me 'King', and I called him 'King' in return.. It was a little joke, but it had a truth behind it. He deserved the title.We would talk for hours over the phone. I've never had that with another man before, ever. What a special person. I am shocked and devastated by his tragically early death. I wish that he had had the strength to continue living, but he wasn't able to pull through. I'm so sad.We would sometimes say to one another that it was quite remarkable that we had ever met - two people on different sides of the planet, with some real commonalities. Wow. Who would have known it, bro?I feel utterly blessed to have ever known him. I'm so glad that we met. I'm so glad he connected with me on line. What a joy to know him. What an absolute joy. That connection. Connection. Connection.It's all that matters. We had that. It was really strong.I bought a necklace with a King's Crown on it. Shining. Silver. A shield. I am already wearing it and I do so in his honour. Every time I look in the mirror - which I do often, and he totally did the same! - I will see that King's Crown.Goodbye, Nick. I will miss you very much. Irreplaceable....This sub. This sub introduced me and others to Nick, and other people like him. I'm so grateful."Goodnight King 💛" was the last thing he wrote to me...."Goodnight King 💛," I say in return.I just got a bit of abuse about being a narcissist. It included:*"in the case of you, you don’t even exist, you are a mirror, with no identity of itself, just a walking mirror, mirroring everyone to win them over, always in competition, always in the need to conquer…."*It motivated me to write about mirroring, which for me can be problematic, anxiety-inducing and distressing.Any insights are very welcome....I feel like the mirroring my brain does can be utterly automatic and all-encompassing. I wanna call it 'Deep Mirroring' because of the degree that - I think - it can affect my thinking and behaviour. An example would be:In any kind of writing - posts, comments, emails, texts - I very typically (and automatically) hear the other person's imagined voice in my head as I write, rather than my own. In fact, I struggle to hear my own voice in my head, and instead imagine 'their voice' or some voice they'd assume I have (or would like to have).To my mind, this affects how I write on a very fundamental level - word to word. Every aspect about my written communication can easily be 'what the other would say' or 'what I should sound like in order to be acceptable / cool / interesting' to them'. These are the key problematic aspects of this issue for me. It feels like I'm very, very good at mimicking other people's style of language and I do it to a very deep level. I can have email exchanges with other professionals, for example, where I can automatically mirror back their language style. I think I can sense that I'm using this to 'make myself appear more likeable or acceptable' to them, or to 'get what I want' or 'make a good impression.' A similar pattern can occur in person-to-person exchanges. Again, I can be with a string of people one-on-one, and very easily - if I don't keep it in check - be a very different person, mirroring the other in all sorts of ways in order to come across as *'the person wants me to be'.*I would go so far as to wonder if it's a form of Depersonalisation. It's like I partially dissociate and enter a kind of fantasy world where I'm just imagining 'what would they say?' / 'how would they put it?'I see this as totally connected to my childhood, by the way, where I learnt to mirror as a survival mechanism.Ironically, I'm trying to consider my words carefully here, because this topic is a key issue for me, and I want to make sure my description matches my experience....People have said to me that "this is normal" - and maybe it is, so hearing that again wouldn't be a bad thing. I understand that we adapt our language and behaviour with different people. I also know that idea that human beings are relational creatures - and so we become ourselves *between* one another. Again, it's about adapting in the moment to the context and the people we are with.However, what I find distressing is that, left unguarded, it feels like that my mirroring just takes over, and I completely lose my sense of self. So I can get to the end of a string of emails to different people, where I feel like I've just copied their tone and use of language - with a background hum of 'wanting to get ahead' or 'please people'. But not actually expressing myself as I would - only as I imagine they would from what I've heard or read from them....I've also had a therapist say that this shows that I have good empathy (and I actually can do). I also see it as functional and healthy to a degree. It's just he degree to which I do this that feels dysfunctional. It causes me distress because I want to have a sense of what I sound like, or how I would behave...,Some Good News:Things have improved over the years. I feel I am much more myself than I used to be. But it's still something I work on every day.One way I do this is to force myself to imagine myself speaking as I type. It takes effort for me to do this, but I find the results to be more authentic. I look back and read my writing and think, "Yeah, that's how I would say it." It feels comforting and even relaxing to feel that I've written in my 'own voice' rather than someone else's.\[ I added the bit on the end of the title to demo and practice how I speak, by the by. \]Also, in real life, I have worked a lot on not mirroring people in order to just fit in and get their approval. Instead, I am trying to speak more from how I feel or what I'm thinking. Being the vain twat that I am, this can be problematic in some situations. But even if it's inappropriate (i.e. self-sabotaging) to speak out loud what I'm thinking or feeling, I am trying to at least note what's going on inside to myself, so I can feel I'm being authentic to me even if it's not possible to do so with others in that moment.So, it's got a lot better. Thank fuck! But it's still something I struggle with....I'm all ears if anyone feels this is total crap, and I'm obsessing about nothing. Having said that, it does feel like an issue for me, and it causes me distress. Again, it's like I can almost Depersonalise and obliterate my sense of self through my communication and how I interact.All thoughts welcome. Thank you.I really can devalue my partner in my mind. I don't want that. It can also come across in my demeanour and tone of voice.It's sad. I'm trying to fight it.To other people, I can be super charming and good to be around. Friendly.I like me when I'm in those more public situations.Why aren't I like that at home?I want my partner to see that person I am to others. But he sees much more of the moody, controlling, scolding, patronising sides of me. Classic.Overall, he's a good guy and deserves much better from me. I love him. Actually, I can really adore him when I grt out of my own way. He has his big issues ... but ... he still has many more plus sides. Incredibly generous. Very entertaining and playful. Very cuddly. Argh. Narcs. Why do we always behave like twats to people closest to us? Life is short. I just want to be more happy.I am trying to confront my negative thoughts and actions. It's been an ongoing process for many years. I could still do better.I want my partner to know the friendly me more often.Or how do you regard that 'old you' before you realised / accepted your narcissism or NPD?Or maybe if you met that person today, how do you think you'd feel meeting them or being around them?What emotions come up for you when you think about that younger, unaware You?. How to you manage your anger or rage so you don't lash out at people when they are annoying or irritating to you?. How do you help yourself feel better, get into a better place?I just want to put addictive behaviour aside a moment, and any leap into grandiosity as a means of escaping. I mean ... what actually helps you get into a more calm, level-headed, steadier, non-reactive, connected mindset? That might even benefit you in the longer-term?What are the resources that support your wellbeing?. I am trying to keep my trauma in mind and body rather than push it away or forget it through all the distractions I do, all the ways I try to escape. The glossy image. The goals. The order.I woke up stressed and anxious today for no real reason. I started crying in bed. I just tried to stay with myself as the feelings were there. It was painful. Like flu, except I don't have flu. I thought it would be good to try to just stay with it and say, "It's ok to be here" rather than even try to soothe.I came downstairs and splurged in a DM to an NPD pal. The sadness was there and I cried as I wrote.I closed the laptop and did a workout. Lol.My partner woke up and call 'Hello!' from upstairs. He immediately detected the sadness in my response. "Are you down?" he said. Rather than just flipping into "Everything's fine!!!" mode, I said, "It's just my trauma stuff coming up."He called back down, offering to go and kill my Mum and Dad as a joke.He went to the bathroom and I noticed I started getting very anxious, fearful. My mind started tripping out. I realised that it was because I wanted to open up to him, but I was fearful of his response. I traced this back to what I received from my Mum when I opened up to her. Ridicule. Dismissal. Shut down. Rejection. Or my Father: well ... nothing because I could never consider talking to him about my feelings with him.That template of fear is there in my mind when I think about opening up. I will be "too much". I will be told to "get over it". I will be told to "stop myself from going too far". I will be told that I am "full of woe". I will be told that I "should be happy". My partner came downstairs and sat on the sofa with the coffee I made him. I told him I didn't want to be a burden, but that I wanted to be real about what was going on, rather than try to run away from it.He listened to me as I spoke about the issues I have with trauma, and he was very supportive in what he said. The relief was visceral. I thanked him. I was still tearful. To have that inner child meet the support that he never got in my childhood ... That's what that part of me needs.He asked me if I would feel better once my parents were dead. And I said, "Yes." He was very accepting of that.He did then say something like, "But I don't understand why you can't just say that your parents were idiots and move on." This brought up anger in me that made me feel unsteady. However, I contained it and said that it was like there were two levels to this. One was to think intellectually: Yes, my parents treated me badly. I am an adult now. I know different. I don't believe their messages. The other was the trauma itself: the disruption to my whole nervous system that is a total mind-body experience. The physical rush of fear. The intrusive and terrifying imagery that clouds my thinking. The urge to run out of the room, while at the same time being in lots of social situations where I feel that isn't an option, nor is actually telling people that this is going on. He was understanding and supportive again. I was a little bit like, "Yes. I didn't rage."I talked to him about narcissism as a coping mechanism for my trauma. I talked to him about finding solace and comfort and emotional regulation in the mirror as an example. Or in my appearance, or in my work. He was accepting and listened.Somehow we got onto my Mum's difficult behaviours, which are more the classic 'covert' type that I used to be. He criticised her behaviour, but I said that basically it was like what I was. "Remember when we went to the States with Jackie and Sharon? Do you remember in how much of a funk I was all the way through the trip?" ... "Yes. You were really hard to be with." ... "I was just very sullen a lot of the time." ... That's where my Mum can be. Pulling people down. That was me.My partner talked about there being a rock in the road, and at some point, you have to go around it and forget that it's there.I realised that I was diving a little bit into self-pity, self-obsession in the discussion, which I was actually enjoying. So I said, as a way of pulling myself out of it, "Yes. And I s'pose I can get stuck at that rock and stay there. But also ... running away and trying to forget it hasn't helped me either. ... There needs to be a middle ground where I keep it in mind but also go forward." You know, like: keep it in the rear view mirror.I said, "I think going forward, I just need to be able to say to you: 'My trauma issues are coming up. So if I act a little weird - especially in social settings - please know that I am trying my best. This is very hard to deal with, but I am trying my best." This is in regard to him often sensing that something is up with me, but trying to put it in a box when around other people. I guess because - in part - I had that tendency to pull everyone down. There are other reasons as well, but that's a fair guess in part as to why he does this. Anyway. He accepted this. In social situations, I often float off for a while to just sit on the toilet and re-centre myself for 5 minutes. Or try to. We had a friend round last night, and this happened again. The same cycle: she arrives. I feel really good to be in her warm-hearted company. After about 20 minutes, I start decaying. I can't keep up the facade. Or I try to, but underneath is a whirlwind. Total chaos. I cling to my seat.She knows about my NPD, and has been good with that. I mentioned to her a little bit that there was stuff going on last night, but it wasn't really the right situation to go further. So it was horrible. My mind shattered. I held onto the broken pieces.This morning she sent me the usual "Thank you" message. I wrote back and told her that I wasn't in a good place at all, that it wasn't her fault, but that it comes from 'nowhere'. I told her not to feel guilty, but that I just needed to now say that I struggle. I said I didn't want to hide from it anymore, as much as I can.Sorry, post-splurge. A lot has come up today. I put everything aside for once and lay in bed - not actually having a wank! - but actually dealing with my emotions....Since self-awareness, I have been actively searching for ways to integrate the narcissistic, king-wannabe side of me into my character. I had previously tried shutting or cutting him out. Or obliterating him from view. Over and over. But he remained. And would poke through in clumsy ways despite my attempts to appear "normal". Stable. But as I got to know this part inside, it turns out ... I quite like him. He's funny. So gradually, I've wanted to let him in and out to other people in appropriate ways. Not that I'm being openly superior. Actually, that part has really dwindled in my conscious mind (still there subconsciously). But it's more of the attention-seeking, competitive, self-interested, show-off side. Finding ways to reveal all that to people around me rather than the "Look! I'm The Healthiest Person Ever Promise!" face that I had been wearing. Humour has helped, by the way. I don't want to forget that wannabe-king in me. I can't. So last week, I bought a necklace online with a king's crown pendant. A silver disc with a little roughly-drawn crown in the middle. It's cartoonistic and childlike in design. Medallion-like. Small but perfect. Kind of Warrior-Viking in style. A tiny shield. I like symbols as reminders of things. I wanted to have something round my neck that reminded me of that side of me, rather than be ashamed of it, or forget it.It arrived today, a short while after that terrible distress came up in me.I looked at it and thought, "How can I wear this now? I feel the opposite. This is silly."...As the terrorised part of me relaxed, I was able to talk with another NPD friend. I related that I'd realised that while I was making headway in integrating my more narcissistic side, perhaps I wasn't doing so well with that traumatised part of me. The broken part. Sometimes after a PTSD moment, it's like I'm a broken soldier. Do you ever feel like that? Shattered? I look in the mirror and I look shattered. Tired. Raw.He too has kept on poking through the veneer despite my attempts to block him out - which include those King of the Castle behaviours.I had this feeling that I needed to be in touch with that traumatised, broken part of me, much more than I have been. That there needed to be integration of both the narc and the trauma. And maybe - if I can keep in touch with them and bring them on board to inform my day to day life - they wouldn't erupt in the ways they have been.But how to integrate these parts? They are so different. The king just LOVES to be in his castle. And the pain of that trauma is so intense....A little voice called out to me saying, 'Don't forget me! You keep forgetting me.' ... I will add that I did some psychodrama exercises in workshops and we had done a thing that was intended to get in touch with that forgotten child in us. That was earlier this year I did that.Laying in bed, I looked at that necklace pendant again. Childlike. Rough. Simple. Shiny. Mirror-Like.I had this idea that I could wear it after all, and that it could be helpful. I put it around my neck and it fell on my chest. I looked in the mirror and saw myself: that broken boy who wanted to be king.Actually, I needed it. Because of the trauma. No, it wasn't the best way to cope. But it was the way I coped as a child, and it spilled over into adulthood.It's like that little child imagined a crown to distract from the torment of a very early and unhealable trauma, which he (I) cannot remember because it happened too early. There were many other traumas that are remembered easily. But that early distress. ... Only terrifying feelings and flashes in the mind. It was too much to bear. Absolute shame. So the child sought out anything he could to confirm to him that he was in fact good, able and whole. Stable. Strong. On his journey to his imagined destiny as king he was Prince Charming, he was the Solider, he was the Wizard (at the piano), he was the Tyrant, he was the Grandiose Lover ... He had his whole castle built around him, including a dungeon where he sometimes could hear screams but shut them out. He had his minstrels to entertain him. He had his Joker. He had his Merlin. (Thank God for Merlin. The ultimate Healthy Adult). And he had his demons, who haunted him, tortured him at night.That's me. I'm looking in the mirror right now, and that's who I see: the broken boy who wanted to be king.And this is me in the aftermath. When the castle crumbled.It's raining heavily outside....Broken. Charming. Competitive. Embarrassed. Witty. Terrified. Haunted. Attention-Seeking. Easily Enraged. Insightful (thanks, [Merlin](https://www.reddit.com/user/Elongated_Mayonnaise/)). Stupid. Warrior-like. Fragile. ... I could go on.I think - I hope - this pendant could do a good job in helping me remind myself of all those parts. I want to remember it all.&#x200B;. I feel he saw me as weak, feeble, effeminate, less than he wanted from a son. Not what he'd hoped for.True or not, that is what I felt as a child and teen. And adult.As a child, I saw my body in the mirror and I wanted it to change. Be better. I wanted the "effeminate parts" to be sliced off and trimmed down. Tucked away. Strapped down. I wanted to be more masculine in my appearance. As an adult, I've gone to great lengths to give the impression to my father that I'm in control and strong. Able. Fine. A man....I see myself through his eyes. I'm constantly propping up the appearance that everything is ok.Lying on the bed now, I see myself in the mirror opposite. Feelings of disgust and ridicule. Aversion. And real weakness. Unloved. A frightened and lonely child.Too much of this. Too little of that.There is an urge to shift position and look more appealing to that part of me. But I stay.There have been little tears. I wonder if this is the right thing to do. Cry. Is that enough?..Sigh ... The thing is ... I actually also like some of those behaviours I do to appear more like my father wanted me to look, and I don't really want to give them up. Like. working out and having a masculine figure. I like it. I know that it's caught up in misperception, but I don't want to stop it.It's confusing. I don't quite know how to reconcile the misperception and the enjoyable behaviour.. Because underneath the glossy veneer, and looking like I've got everything sorted, is a feeling of distress in my body that feels so intense and all-encompassing, has overwhelmed me many times before, and I'm terrified of feeling it again. It feels like everything is going to fall apart.*Checks mirror.*Edit: The distress appeared again. It is like my whole world falling apart. Images of my mother shouting at me, chaotically. Right up in my face. In my ears. Screaming at me. Or running wild int he house. Or in distress herself. Fighting my father. He laughs. She screams. It feels like everything is going to shatter. The imagery is intense and for a split second I feel that it could be real. I see my Mum dead on the bed or on the floor. Again and again I have this. This is the distress.. I was talking with a friend of mine about vulnerability and NPD. I noticed a thing I do in writing posts here where I craft them- semi-subconsciously - so I can't let people in. It's like: quasi-vulnerability. It's there, but behind a shiny glass wall that I also put up as a distraction. To counteract that, I thought I'd just post the message I sent them and see what comes up - or not.&#x200B;Oh God... Exposure!&#x200B;"Hey... I'm thinking just now about what you said about not liking being vulnerable. Well ... I have my own expression of this. I noticed that when I post, I tell myself that I'm 'being vulnerable'. And in part, I do think I share vulnerabilities. But ... I present it in a way that is quite closed off. It's like I introduce the vulnerability I notice in myself, and then use the post to work through it and find some resolution. This has a few functions. I sort myself out BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE AND SAYS SOMETHING ANNOYING THAT I ALREADY KNOW! It's also got that function of 'being impressive' and 'heroic' and a 'leader'. Lol.The idea that I might write a post that is totally vulnerable and leaves it open for question and confrontation - even discussion apart from 'Well done, Peanut! I love you!' feels ... like something I don't want to do! Lol. But ... I notice, too, that in the posts I make where I don't close it off so much, there is much more interaction with people I don't usually hear from, and the discussions are helpful and interesting, and there's more connection - which I also want.So ... something to think about and work on.". My partner and I went to the theatre last night to see La Cage Aux Folles.It's basically a show about gays and drag queens. Lol. That's my summary. I've seen it about 4 million times.The audience was noticeably a load of ol' gay men - including us. (It happens at these kinds of shows. All the gays come out for our catwalk.)...**INTERVAL**The men had to queue for the loo. Usually that's something the ladies roll their eyes over while we toddle by with a smug little dance.But with all the lads out for the show, it was like queuing for the Gents at a gay bar. 😁Standing in that queue (we Brits love a queue), half-eyeing-up the oversized beards, muscles and flowery shirts around me, I felt really comfortable. Like being held. Safe. A feeling of belonging.I like being part of this group....Gay men are funny creatures. It's interesting from an NPD angle.There's a kind of narcissism that's normalised, okay and even celebrated as part of 'gay culture'. You can call is body fascism etc. But it doesn't have to be taken so seriously. There's a playful vanity, grandiosity, a cheeky bitchiness, hierarchical thinking, and a constant hum of flirtation and potential for sex. A lot of it can be wrapped up in a naughty humour and glint in the eye. Last weekend we went to a housewarming of a female friend. She has loads of gay male friends, and at one point in the garden, it was just us lot chatting like gay men do. It's different. It's fun. It's flirty. I like it.And the same thing happened. I felt a sense of belonging and okayness. I relaxed. I felt I could be more myself. I discovered myself, in fact.I don't actually have many other gay friends in my life, so it felt refreshing....There's a layer of shame you grow up with as a homosexual lad. I'm 40, so it might be better now in the UK. But in 90s rural Essex, it wasn't what you needed to be to survive.Once when I was about six (?), I sprung into the kitchen wearing a purple beret tilted to the side. I was beaming with a smile, wanting to show my Mum and Dad my little dance.They were both sitting at the kitchen table. My Dad didn't say anything but looked stern. My Mum scolded at me: "Take that beret off! Other people will think you are queer!"I removed my hat and my little self from the kitchen....The shame sticks around.It forms the near-invisible template in your psyche, reminding you how to behave and what to expect from people if you are 'yourself'. You are so used to it, you don't even notice it's there.It affects relationships. My partner, now 49, is still uneasy about us touching each other at all in public, even in central London. It makes me sad, but I understand it and respect it. I still go to cuddle him. He pulls away saying, 'No! You don't know how people will behave here. We could be beaten up!" 💛Hidden shame is probably the reason why I don't have many gay friends, actually. My parents' voices very subtly steering me away from being associated with gay men.It's there in how you hold yourself, how you feel inside as you meet with others. It is the driver behind the reflection-checking as you walk down the street. Without it, you don't feel the urge to check so much.It's there in how I am around other men, whom I had a fear of when I was younger. It's because I experienced so much belittling and abuse from straight men in the past. So I expect them to recoil and look down on me. Expect me to do and be less-than. Or threaten me. Or actually beat me up.(Fuck you, Matthew Parkinson, you fat, lowlife cunt.)...Looking around the theatre audience last night and watching the show, I felt a kind of pride. It's really just a kind of 'okayness' and ease in my body and mind. Actually, it's also a kind of joy for being who I am.It was cool to be part of all the over-groomed beards, cheeky side-glances, unnecessarily large biceps, and over-thought shirt n' socks combos.Yeah. This is me....This morning, I did my workout in front of the mirror as usual. 😁 Headphones on. [The Best of Times](https://youtu.be/vUqiM4c1oWA). The most famous song from 'La Cage' is 'I Am What I Am'. It was performed so brilliantly last night. Lost of people cried. The lyrics fit really well here, in this sub.But The Best of Times is my favourite.Fuck it!&#x200B;*The best of times is now,**What's left of summer but a faded rose?**The best of times is now,**As for tomorrow well: Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?*&#x200B;*So hold this moment fast,**And live and love as long as you know how.**And make this moment last,**Because the best of times is now.*&#x200B;I lifted my weights (upped two 2kgs yesterday, woop-woop!). I lip-synced along to the song on repeat. I did some super jazz hands. I enjoyed my cheeky grin.I imagined my little self dancing with me with his little purple beret. I showed him how to move. I let him free in my mind. He was happy. I was the parent he didn't have. He needed. A bit of [imagery rescripting](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental-Health-Professionals/Sleep/Sleep---Information-Sheets/Sleep-Information-Sheet---06---Imagery-Rescripting.pdf) there. A few little tears came up as the song played again.I'm proud of that little boy with his special dance. No shame....I need more gay men in my life. We all do....I love this [comedy sketch](https://youtu.be/cOESpIz8Mjg), by the by. From Catherine Tate. She's not Irish, but does a great accent, and impression.Chuckle....I know I'm talking about being a gay man. But I hope some things can translate and find their own usefulness to anyone with NPD.It's that experience of being shamed for who we are, of hiding and pretending to survive. Or that inner critic that haunts us like a shimmering ghost, lurking in the corner of our eye.And the joy is re-discovering our selves and being comfortable in who we are, despite what we were taught, and whoever we may be.You know, the rainbow flag is an amazing thing: 🏳️‍🌈. People keep saying "collapse" and I'm like, "What?" ... "You simply mean depression. Sadness."But today: I get it.With NPD in charge, everything is done just to prop up the self away from what is painful - or void - underneath.Today that sugar-crystal dome completely collapsed and I am in the under....OK, Narc OverLord: I get it. Lesson learned. ⛈⚡🌩The distance between the shell and the core is too great. The balloon is too big. Its skin is too thin.Pop....Looking back, my house of cards has gotten too big many times. It has collapsed often. The worst was in my early-mid 30s. I told myself I would be incredibly successful after studying at a prestigious college. Guaranteed. Genius.I wasn't. I put my whole self in that basket. When the ship didn't come in, I wanted to jump off the pier....Today isn't like that. But I see again how I have been propping myself up recently with my twigs and spit, thinking they were cast iron and concrete.Well, the wind blew in and knocked my scaffold over.I also see how I so want to prop up that scaffold again rather than deal with the dodgy foundations and structure.Dear OverLord of the Narcs (aka u/MudVoidSpark), What is my next lesson? I am listening.🌩⚡⛈. It's coming up to about a year since I started finally accepting my narcissism (having been in denial for a couple of years before), leading to then getting an NPD diagnosis / confirmation from a specialist.Quite a journey. Luckily it's involved a lot of self-reflection, otherwise it would've been boring!It's like the ground underneath completely broke open (drama!) and I went through a kind of self-reconfiguration: a breakdown of the persona I had built up for so long, coupled with a poking-through and eruption of all these different aspects of myself that I'd hidden away.It was initially - and for a long while - disturbing. A lot to handle psychologically. "What is this in me? ... Is this real or fake? ... Who the fuck am I?" ... My mind felt like it was in pieces.But (more drama!) I ploughed on through the oncoming winds.Gradually, a more stable sense of self has emerged: certain sides of me keep popping up again and again, more spontaneously, it seems, without clear reference to others so much. I also notice that in conversations, I feel increasingly like a separate person from others, in the way I talk, write or present myself, interests and ideas, opinions. Other people have their moves. I have mine. Yes, there is some merging and blurring, but we are quite different. I'm not trying to br like them or the way think they want me to be. I don't feel so much of the urge to mirror as I did. I feel I have some kind of self to fall back on when I get disrupted. He keeps re-appearing. And I've found myself more assertive, looking people in the eye when I want to speak about something (usually involving some Powerpoint about Schema Therapy)....I'm about to go on a Skype call with my Dad, who lives in another country. I spent my whole life pretty much being a yes-sir, no-sir, three-bags-full-sir kind of son. I would present myself in the way I thought my Dad wanted me to look, talk and behave - even think. ... I did that habitually from a young age as a way of coping with my Dad's terrific temper that could turn on like a switch; his threats of violence - or actual violence.Today, just before the call, I thought: "What a good opportunity to show up as myself."It's not as sudden a shift as I'm making it: I've been showing up more and more, I think, as different from the son I've assumed he wanted me to be. But today: I feel confident to turn up and be as I am, disagree with him ... Just not turn into that smiling face hiding a whirlwind of difficult emotions underneath. I don't feel I have to do that any more.So we met up. I can say he is remarkably brave, emotionally intelligent and articulate in expressing his feelings.I think he's gonna be just fine. Especially if he listens to the incredible advice from old blokes like me. 😁But watch out. Not so fast! u/moldbellchains can smell the grandiosity from down the road, fellas! Fuck!!!Yep, that's not Dior whateveritis, that's me!But he took a pin and popped my self-inflated ego-bubble when it showed up, and in such a healthy and considered way. He stood up for his feelings when they were being pushed aside by my emotional bulldozer mode, and got me thinking anew how grandiosity can have a negative impact on people....There were actual tears, and it was super. Human. A wonderful moment.We had a real connection. And when the moment felt right, we sat on a bench and had a very long hug.A hug that extends to everyone.
    I too stare too long at myself in complete awe. I even get horny just by looking at myself, even in the most inappropriate places. However my reflection is distracting me from real life… I can’t focus on important things, I just want to look at me!!!!!! If I feel down I just look in the mirror and all is well when all is not well. Dykwim? What a curse 😞/MODS IF UR CLOSING THIS TOPIC BCS ITS ‘LOW EFFORT’ ISTG I WILL RAISE HELLFIRE ON U 👹. But myself seems to not be good for people. I’m an energy drain.so what now? Just not be that? Do you not see the irony in that statement?Hand me my mask.Facing the reality of things means that life isn’t a sandbox and I don’t get to be all the fantasies I’ve made up in my head. It means that I have wasted years of my life romanticizing myself, crediting myself for coming up with the ideas of all these grandeur things I could potentially do. Hiding behind my ideas and never having to face the failure of execution. Realizing that everyone else is working hard as fuck while you wasted years on living in your head because it was safe there. Realizing people have it bad all the time so your childhood trauma doesn’t even make you special and even if it does, it doesn’t grant you a ticket to succes. Hard work does. But you got a piss poor working ethic when it comes to achieving things you actually want to achieve. You blame your care takers for robbing you of the opportunity and feeding you the narrative that whatever you liked wasn’t going to workout for you but even now as an adult you don’t really believe it is possible for you. Instead you look at peers thriving, struggling whatever and you want what they have but it feels too late for you. Is that another cop-out to feed the narrative? To be the ever sad and fucked over victim that needs saving? I’m feeling disillusioned.Because I’m actually not the nice girl you preceive me as. I actually see through most of your bullshit. I just love how easy it is to act sweet dumb, and aloof. How much of your ass you show when I’m playing docile. Then when you least expect it, I bite.I’ve come to notice that I don’t even enjoy smoking. The commute to the shop is fun, I get to be active and go to the city center. the rolling is nice as I’ve become an absolute pro over time but every time I spark that joint I just feel disgusted. I hate the smell of weed. Especially pure joints are just disgusting to me. I hate being hyper aware of the smell and thinking my neighbors hate me. I hate the taste of it. I hate how it makes me feel in the moment. That euphoric calm feeling only comes to me once every blue moon. It’s just a compulsion at this point. A habit (in the evening) when I don’t know what else to do. My brain convinces me that anything else is too much of a hassle so I smoke with a frown on my face. Just to feel something. Yuck. On the brink of exhaustion and simple sleep isn’t curing me. I am too exhausted to think, too exhausted to engage in meaningful relationships and am too exhausted to think about the future or my goals. I’m actually quite ready to just end my life here. I don’t have the energy to sustain it anymore. The only moments I feel alive is when I am seeing someone romantically and they boost my deflated ego. Other than that life is in shades of gray and a heavy weight is keeping me stuck.I’m waiting for my psychologist to get back to me but I don’t think they’ll be able to help me. I am tired.My narc mom promised me that all the suffering i’ve endured would make me a stronger more resilient person but ends up I’ve become a shell of a human with nothing to show for it except for a nicotine addiction and a hot body. I’m tired.
    In the model underpinning schema therapy, there is a mode called the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode. I've read about it a few times, and I just noticed it come up today in myself, I think. I wanted to document it here, so maybe I can become more quickly alert to it in future - because like other maladaptive modes, I feel it really inhibits me, or can do at least.From my recollection the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode is a coping mode in the model. That means there is some underlying vulnerability or distress or unmet need, and this mode is a state of mind and body that we can flip into as a way of reacting or managing what's underneath.I think when I'm in my Paranoid Overcontroller Mode, I become overly fixated and suspicious of other people, maybe particularly one person or two for whatever reason. I suppose there's something about them that I'm fearful of underneath, or something about them that reminds me of someone or some situation in the past the caused me harm. My thoughts turn to and obsess over all the things dry don't like about this person. There is a sense of mistrust. I don't like to look them in the eye, I want to keep away from them, there is a feeling that they are keeping something from me, that they are somehow corrupt, wrong, dangerous, hiding something, manipulative, not truthful, not honest, in authentic. I can even imagine them turning other people against me, thinking negatively about me and talking negatively about me, criticising me with others. That's paranoia. I watch their movements and behaviours, and listen to what they have to say, and my mind is heavily skewed to picking up the evidence to support this from whatever they're saying or doing. It's a form of rumination....The problem is that when I'm in this mode, I don't see the whole person - just the negative aspects that maybe I want to see. I kind of don't want to see the positives. I'm devaluing them. I'm not being empathic, understanding or compassionate. I lose connection to that person. But more than that. I disconnected from the world and other people. I am lost in my own thoughts - just spinning around. I'm cut off from reality, viewing the world through a distorted lens where people are either for me or against me, and I'm collecting the evidence.Gosh! Now I'm reflecting on it, I can see that this mode is somewhat present quite a lot of the time. It's just that today I noticed that was particularly strong, and directed towards one person who I've been with over the last few days. Another man. I guess from the outside looking in at me, people might sense that I am cut off, self absorbed, and that my thoughts are negative and suspicious even. And I wonder if it's on my face. I'm pretty sure it must be, to a degree. Obviously I can't tell that for sure. But there is a chance at least that they pick up on my negative mood, and so might not want to interact or connect with me. I kind of feel that.So I'm really losing out when this mode is strong. I'm not a happy person that I want to be, and people might be more distant from me. It's actually sad. Suddenly I have some compassion for myself coming up. I feel sad for the situation....Where did this come from?A memory of my father immediately pops up in my mind. He's scowling, frowning. His face is distorted. I can tell that he is suspicious of others, he's really paranoid in that moment.Gosh! I guess I picked that up from him! He was suspicious have lots of people when I was a child, and even today he is quite mistrustful of people, although he has mellowed in his older age. But back then he was paranoid about my Mum, her friends, people he worked with, even me and my sister. ...There is a memory, a very strong one, when I was a teenager. It was bedtime. My dad was already upstairs in the spare room. Him and Mum weren't sleeping in the same room by then. Mistrust. Hatred. Fear. Between them. I was in my room. My mum came upstairs. Before she went into the main bedroom, she went to the spare room when my dad was "sleeping" - because he wasn't, as it turned out - and locked the door from the outside. I think I asked her not to do it, but there was something like revenge going on for something he had done earlier in the day. She was less than 3m away from the lock door when my dad jumped up and started banging ferociously on it. He was banging so hard that he started to punch a hole. My mum ran downstairs and told me to come with her. I was on the landing by now. The hole appeared in the door. Splinters of wood were flying over the landing. I could see his fist. His hand was bloody. I could see has distorted face. He asked me to unlock the door. He said I should call the police. I was something like 13 or 14. I didn't want to do that. I was scared of him. But I did unlock the door with the key that was maybe on the floor or something. As soon as it opened I stood back. He ran out and I pretended to faint. I just didn't want to interact with him. So I pretended. He ran downstairs saying that he was going to call the police. I then snapped out of my "faint", and ran behind him shouting "No! Don't!" I remember stopping him when he was at the phone. My mum was outside, she called to me to say come next door - to the neighbours. And I did. I ran out.Later on, in our neighbours' living room, late at night, totally embarrassed, scared, lonely - I was on the sofa, my mum and the wife of the couple next door were with me. My dad was allowed into the house by the husband. Dad came into the room, telling all of us that my mum had locked the door and was planning to burn down the house and kill him.That really wasn't true. But he was totally paranoid. Our neighbours tried to calm him down. Eventually he left and went back to our home. My mum and I slept at our neighbours house that night. I was in my school uniform.I can feel my younger self, shocked, scared, distressed, frustrated, lonely, worried, angry, sad, deflated, embarrassed, guilty, numb.I'm sad for him now. Right now.I feel for him....What I like about the schema approach is that it's not just about countering or challenging the negative or inhibiting thoughts and actions in the here and now. It's not saying simply, "Don't do that! Stop thinking like that! Think positively!" It's about understanding where coping styles come from, trying to swim down to the bottom of the ocean, and connect with the lost, wounded child underneath - the child who was neglected and traumatised. It's about having an understanding the how the wounds of the past relate to the present, and showing - or learning to show - care for those wounds and vulnerabilities.So, to myself today I say, I know I didn't like my dad as a child or teenager. I was often very scared of him. I wanted to be nothing like him. But somehow, and I inherited his negative thinking patterns and behaviours. There is shame around that.But it's not my fault that I have this tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. On one level I inherited it from my dad. Not purely. My mum also has a tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. But for the moment I'm thinking about that memory with my dad, I'm thinking about how his paranoia Took over and lead to violent reaction that stayed strong in my memory for many decades. When I feel that paranoia, when I recognise that suspicious mode, it doesn't make me a bad person. There is a good reason why this habit of mind has come about. Patterns of mind that I inherited from my parents.I really forgive myself. I do.I genuinely feel lighter in my body. I feel lighter in my mind, I feel like I can let go of the paranoid thoughts about the man I'm with at the moment in our group. ...But ... It's interesting because I can now see how my mind is associating the person I am paranoid about with my father. My mind is relating this man today with my dad and how he treated me and my mum in the past. Ah! I see. I see.Fear of my father. Paranoia about his behaviours. Scared of his threats.Spotting similar signals in people today, and feeling threatened. Paranoia.It's understandable. Feeling on edge around certain people because of how my mind associate them with people who threatened me in the past. Again, it's not my fault. But I feel able to let this go. So it's not just about inheritance of certain patterns. It's to do with how I related to my parents as well. I think those two factors are behind my own paranoid thinking today....I want to connect. I want more lightness and freedom in my body and mind. I don't want to be trapped in this paranoid mode that keeps me separate from everyone else.I hope I remember about how things in the past that I had no control over brought about these inhibiting patterns of mind. I hope that I can keep that memory so I can forgive myself again and again, and in so doing let go, and find more freedom and happiness and connection....I think its best to finish this by taking a moment to remember that small, frightened child, and the frightened teenager, too - and just show a lot of understanding to them - to me. In my mind my self as I am now - my big self - is hugging my child self and my teen self. I am showing sorrow, sadness, care, Love, I am kissing them on the forehead as they cuddle up next to me. I say to them,"I'm so sorry that you were frightened and fearful for your own safety. I'm so sorry."I say to myself, looking in an imaginary mirror opposite where we are sitting,"I'm here now. I'm big and I'm strong, and I'm a good bloke - despite everything - I can be a good bloke very often, and I really do try. People are not against me. They want to connect. And although I'm fearful of how people will treat me, 99% of the time people treat me very well."It's true.I've had a few noticeable moments of shame in the past couple of days.As part of pulling myself out of negative states, I've been reflecting on the different components of my experience of shame. I thought I'd document and share them here, rather than the issues of what happened and when. It's because similar patterns keep appearing, and I find it useful to analyse the experience - literally, pick apart - to help me manage and respond more effectively. It's like being able to see all the different parts of the experience, so that I can attend to them separately, and therefore more productively, rather than rolling around in a quagmire of distress.It would be interesting if other people wanted to comment or add their own experience....Anatomy of Shame.Shame for me seems to involve:A strong Inner Critic: I notice this in sentences I say to myself such as, "God! I'm such an idiot." ... or "I'm so stupid." ... or "That was so embarrassing! Ugh!" Or, it could manifest as a projection onto other people, imagining them to be thinking or talking negatively about me, criticising me behind my back or while I'm with them etc. Or I notice it in the images of other people's crumpled, disapproving faces, or fleeting scenes in my mind in which I am shunned from other people or some group.A felt sense of anxiety and distress: I notice uncomfortable or distressing sensations run through my whole body. In particular, I notice an urge to cover up or hide myself. My hands and arms want to move into my body and over my face as if to protect or hide away - from imagined scorn of others.An urge to run away: I see this as a kind of behavioural avoidance. I want to be away from people, run and hide myself. My body is twitching to "get out of there".Rumination: I notice that I obsessively think over the thing that "I did" that caused me to feel ashamed. Over and over, my mind rehearsing the scene of the incident, trying to work out "how bad" the supposedly shameful act was.Worry: I notice worry thoughts, which are similar to rumination but are about the future. "What will people think?" ... "Will people treat me differently?" ... The worry includes an obsessive look for evidence in the past. That is, the rumination of "What happened" ties in with the worry about "the consequences". One feeds the other.Externalised Anger: If I am experiencing shame by proxy of another person's behaviour, particularly someone who is close to me, then I notice Anger directed toward them. For example, if a family member - or someone associated with me - behaves in a way that I think is "shameful" to me, then I notice how i get enraged with their behaviour. It's like my inner critic is turned outwards to other people, as if I were still connected to the shameful act as if Ihad committed it.Controlling behaviour: This can come in many forms. It could be about stopping or controlling or correcting other people's so called "shameful" behaviour. I think the externalising anger can be underneath this, particular if I go into a scolding or lecturing mode. Controlling could also be about trying to rectify how people perceive me by trying to manage my behaviour to be more preferable to them, as I see it. It could be about trying to "work on myself more" so that I don't repeat the shameful act again in an overt way. Attacking Others: This stems from that externalising anger as well. Perhaps if I feel slighted by others, I might verbally or even sometimes - thankfully rarely - physically move to attack them. I see this as a defence against the feelings of shame, using blame and attack to regain a sense of power and strength. I also do this attack vovertly, internally devaluing other people while perhaps acting charming on the surface to control how they perceive me.Compulsive self-soothing: I notice the urge to use self-soothing behavioirs to find relief from the feelings of shame and distress in my body. This might involve something like comfort eating or the likes. Or, it includes a kind of grandiosity. Mirror-gazing after a shame attack, for example, provides an ego-boost through the form of self-admiration (about my appearance or me as aperson) or coinciding thoughts of my own superiority. Or it could be writing a post to get some upvotes and congratulation from people here. ;)So... There are some elements of shame that I notice. What about yours?. When I'm around other people, I have often had that feeling that I should be likeable to the other person I'm with."Should"It's a feeling that anything other than coming across as perfectly buoyant and upbeat is wrong, that people won't like it, that they'll judge me and think badly of me; that I will be ostracised, shamed. I was just sitting with someone I know and feeling that feeling that I need to be on my best behaviour with him. For him. I think it's heightened because the person I'm with is so bloody positive and energised himself. That feeling of needing to perform as the good person is more prominent with certain people like this.A memory pops up from childhood: of me being the smiling child for the guests we had at home.That's what we did as a family when people came round. I guess not always. But it was often enough to leave a relatively strong imprint. My Mum did it in particular, and I followed suit. A presentation mode. False. And I'm not just saying that because the "false self" is a buzz term for us here. She was all smiley and upbeat. I think at the time I did see that it wasn't her usual behaviour, but l also think I thought that's just what we did with guests.I continued that into adulthood, that presentation mode of politeness. Affable. Accommodating. Showing that I was conscientious of other people's feelings. Showing I'm listening by overly nodding, mirroring expressions in the other person, being all smiley and positive glow. The problem was, of course, that I often hid how I was really feeling, which meant that - I think - I couldn't connect with people. The energy required to maintain that "attentive face" was also difficult to uphold. I would frequently leave social situations to be on my own - in the bathroom, mainly - just to not smile for a little bit.I was just programmed to be like that with people.I also got an ego boost out of it, though - at least for a little while at these social events. I would show up to as "The Happy Person" ... "The Charming Listener." Yes, i'd get high on that and look down on people who were not looking happy and cheerful, but instead "miserable" to my mind. Or worse. I really did devalue people consistently in my social groups. Although I turned up all smiles to events, afterwards I would very often criticise pretty much everyone in our social circle who wa there. There wasn't really anyone who wasn't a target of my critique at some point or other. I would moan to my partner that I didn't like these people and that I didn't want to see them. At a couple of points, he made comments about us having fewer and fewer friends because of my judgements....The thing is, these patterns were still active relatively recently. I think I did try to get better around this issue since 2020, but it's really in the last year or so - since self-awareness - that things have changed for the better.I do feel increasingly like I can turn up to social situations and show how I feel - or at least enough to feel real inside. I feel like I have managed to uncover a real self with me, more or less, which I based on how I feel and how I want to come across.But ... Old habits die hard, and sitting with our friend just now, I felt that pull to be the polite, attentive, jolly listener... But - yay! - I noticed this, and made an effort to not yield to those patterns. I presented more how I was (am) feeling. A bit non-descript. A bit not bothered all in all.And then it came to me: it doesn't matter if he doesn't like me. Because look, my emotions, my feelings, don't make a bad or unlikeable person. My feelings are ok, and I don't gave to hide them.I looked across at him and saw him all bubbly and happy. He's a healthy fellow, and generally positive. And I had an image of myself at the same time as different, separate. Two different guys with different feelings, doing OK sitting next to each other, with neither one particularly accommodating the other. I think this is nice to notice. I am - god dammit - gradually becoming my own self, and showing people who I am and how I feel....There are some obstacles to this process external to my own habits, namely people who overtly say to me that I should look of act differently, smile more etc. It's my partner in particular. He also has narc tendencies, and seems to get over-anxious as to how I show up. I have to fairly often say that I'm fine as I am when I'm not "smiling with teeth" as he says. It's a bit of a joke in some ways, but it's also annoying because it's so frequent. And I just want to have my face not in a smiling position in certain situations. I notice that it's when we're around other people. And I'm really not being a dick or anything. And I know, of course, that it is right to show up civil and polite to a degree. Just not so much.Anyway, I don't want to be too defensive or irritable about it. But it is a thing to deal with. Just again, though: I'm not going back in that happy-faced box. I know that a real me exists, I'm cultivating him, and I'm putting him out there.So something really shifted today. Large crack in the ground stylee. I'm sure it'll close again. Probably. But this is to document the \*massive gaping hole\* that has just vomitted everywhere.Sorry for the post splurge. But some cool things came out. I felt rage and distress and loneliness and panic ... Nothing new. But somehow I managed to let it be there more than before. YES!I wanted to run, punch, scream, ... I felt like everything was falling down, whipping up. I didn't know who I was. This is not anything new. It happens fairly frequently. But I somehow had more room to be ok with it today.I felt, and still feel, slightly more buzzy than usual. It'll pass, but ... I said to a friend: *I am bundle of criss-crossed and flailing live wires. With a beard. And some not too bad pecs now. And the delicious glimmer of abs. And a nice smile.*I do feel that this criss-crossedness is a part of me - a big part - that I do hide from myself and others.I am a bit bonkers. My thoughts are totally wild. I don't have psychosis, but my imagination is insane and I get also sorts of violent and scary thoughts popping in a lot. Not all the time. But it can happen.My moods flit around like ping pong balls in a tiny metal room. I try to cover it up by looking \*cool\* and \*hot\* and \*sharp\* and \*nice\* and \*calm\* ... and I can be all those things, but I'm also ... underneath ... this bundle of live wires sparking off.I feel more ok with that.This is me, bitches!!But you already knew ... It was me who had to catch up....bla bla blaHere's the thing:I suddenly realised that everyone else is a bundle of nerves with a cover.AND ... I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO BE NICE TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE MEEEE. Or could be one day, so it's good to be nice.AND ...I got chatting with one person who I previously was really irritated by, and FELT CONNECTION and was more my bonkers self, and just said what was on my mind, and SHE LAUGHED!!! And we had a connection, and it was cooooooooooooooool.Maybe if I show my anger and dance fun and sadness and terror and style and spunkiness and cockiness and my fragility and mood and terror and delight and mania and tiny-ness and wish to doninate ... somehow I'll find myself and it'll help.This is why I look in mirrors.Title.It's so awful.When I reveal the depths of whatever this is .... out comes the lava ..... Panic.Right now.Flashing images of the guy on the train platform coming towards me with his terrifyingly distorted face, attacking me.Flashing images of me attacking everyone on this train.Me going mad.Distress like a tornado in my body.The feeling of MUST GET OUT OF HERE.NOW....Shift.To sadness. I can cope. ...I can't afford it. Few can.This group is basically all there is for working things out.It really fucking annoys me how fucking expensive therapy is.I paid £180 an hour from November to February. Specialist in Npd. All my savings.OK. But ...That's ... four and a half hour long piano lessons.At least the therapist is happy. Woop! Woop! Bringing in the cash.OK. More pockets of unknown shite still there.Watching videos of therapists talk about narcissism.I sense my reactivity towards what they are saying.Why do therapists trigger me so much? Fuck sake.I just want to jump on them and beat them to a pulp. Sometimes I have imagined slitting their throats. Or jumping on their faces and punching and punching. They bring up this rage that I quickly stifle. But I know that the stifling is not helping me.iI stifle. All the time. I shut down my rage because it feels totally unacceptable.Well... that monster is still there inside, but rather than feeling scared, I think he's sexy as hell. Nope. That's yet more grandiosity.It's that deep rage and that come with tears. It's that feeling of being judged so deeply by another person. A distress that immediately makes me want to flip out and attack and blame.Oh fuck.It's like, everything I do is about making myself look good to others, including the progress I've made with my disorder. Posts. Comments. Everything. Style. Politeness. Being nice. Acting. Trying. Working on myself.I can't get out of it.I can't make exact sense of this.I'm really, really fucking horny.I'm getting much better at tolerating not getting upvoted.Yay! Fuck you, social belonging anxiety. Woof!It's rather silly for a 40-something to be concerned about these things, but I know you know how it feels. We all want it. *Gimme that upvote high!!!*And:*Where's my upvote, BITCH!!!?*And:*No one loves me. I'm basically invisible / about to die.*And:*Terrible!!! I did something that people didn't like!!!*You know, don't get me wrong, I still have these thoughts and feelings. But they aren't nearly as intense. Nearly. ;)When I first joined the sub and for a fair while after, I would more frequently delete posts that didn't receive many upvotes. Out of shame, having been slumped at home in sadness and despair.I still do occasionally delete posts. But the last time was because I felt I wasn't being myself - maybe not even a good reason to delete. But anyways. I'm generally getting better at staying with what I've put out - you know, if I feel it's real, I guess - whether or not it flies so well.To me, this is progress. Ding ding! I am standing up for myself more, being less wavering and tossed around by what people think, and caring less about every opinion I receive or don't, or getting caught up if I do something that is "successful" or not.Yay. Growth in confidence. Woop! Woop!I've also noticed I feel more capable being honest about my thoughts, rather than hiding them in case they are criticised....Biff! Another angle would be:Fuck it. I'm invincible, mate!!🤘(P.S. I'm not. Don't hate me. 😁)...Edit: Blimey! This is a test! 😁. Today I have been grandiose in the morning, depressed variously throughout the afternoon, and calm and steady in the evening. But right now, I am really grateful for this journey of discovery. Right now, I don't care about the downs. I know that they'll come again, and I'll absolutely hate it. There will be suicidal ideation and depression and shame. But there is also something about all those things that provides an opportunity.I really love those moments when the downs turn into opportunities for discovery and learning. It's like finding little pieces of the puzzle and putting them together. I love building that picture and working it out over time. I love how I've gone from a really flimsy smiling face of a person, hiding all the anger and doubt and anxiety and shame and torment, to someone with more of a sense of who I am, and able to express much more of what's going on inside, and feel like a real person with an actual self. That is really cool! I still have some weird experiences in terms of feeling fake, feeling empty, suddenly feeling very close to people and loving, before then feeling totally separate and isolated and full of hate and disdain. But I try to be mindful of what is going on, challenge my thoughts and feelings as best I can, and try to find some middle ground.I feel sorry for my young self before self-awareness I was trapped and very troubled. I raged a lot and had terrible panic everyday. Body dysmorphia. Eating disorders. OCD. Hypochondria. The works. All based around this very narcissistic personality structure that I had no clue about at the time, really. But I did the best that I could. I didn't know any better. It's nice to overcome a lot of that, even though the remnants are still there. I can still be pulled down by various things, but not nearly as strongly.My mind may never be completely stable. But in a way, I would kind of hate if that happened. I enjoy this journey where the weirdness of my brain and my reactions to things puzzles me, and drives me to find a solution. ...Late this afternoon, I was tired from - quite frankly - overworking. Again. I had a bit of a low point. Someone I'm working with was not getting their work done and it felt like it was really holding me back. I felt the anger and frustration and blame. I felt, too, the sadness underneath, and I started crying to myself, just walking down the street. It happens. Just gentle, quiet tears of frustration. It was part sadness and part kicking-and-screaming and blaming.I imagined my various 'inner good parents' step in with their messages that would calm me down. The message that really hit home was "I know you are so tired and frustrated. Now, this is what we're going to do... We're going to take it one step at a time. We're going to remember all the good things you've been able to do today..." etc etc. It really helped soothe me and shifted me into a more calm and steady state where I felt capable and strong.That was a cool experience. It's little things like that that drive me on. Every day. Every day I work on myself. Every interaction with people is hard in some way. But ... I am just trying to balance so much and make this life work as best as it can. It involves a lot of self-confrontation, moderating, taming, refining, tempering, nudging forward, holding back ... But I love this journey, as rocky as it may be.I'm sure I'll be desperately low tomorrow over some thing. But I'm also sure I'll find a way out. I know that by now.It is also seriously great to meet and hang out with some of the most deep, caring (lol) and inspiring people I've ever known, and feel that connection between us.Yay!. Which one do I choose for my story of growth and recovery? *Trigger Warning.*Which one do I go for for my suicidal ideation? *Upbeat Talk.*...Ah ha ... That pattern of childish rebellion ... That feeling of being caged in, and the explosion out ... That [Rhombicosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicosidodecahedron) being forced through a square hole ...That core need for autonomy childhood, chronically unmet ... ...*Well done, Peanut. Feel the feelings. Attend to your inner child.* Nope!I want to have a party and do wild mock interpretative dancing a la Kate Bush in the 1980s in front of everyone without drinking a drop of alcohol because I'm that special that I can do that. I hope everyone is jealous.*Don't tell me what to do!*Thanks. Venting - advice requested....*Chooses Flair. Cries.*. No I did not.I spent a considerable amount of time, picking, putting on, checking, enjoying my reflection, imagining what people will think, imagining people admire my looks, semi-consciously rehearsing my modest replies.Started with that tiny t-shirt that no one wears on a Tuesday work day. Tucked in. Ugh! Yes. But too much. Too obvious, complete with my sparkly glasses and over-quaffed hair. Such a narc. But actually: who cares!! Fuck 'em! Actually, shit! I do care. Too much. Try on that shirt over the top for the more casual look. Hm. Terrible shoulder projection. Tucked in. Yes!!! So sexy!!! But no, obvious porn star wannabe again. Untuck shirt and t-shirt. The sad compromise. Phew. I look good not too good. Totally casual. But you can still see my workout progress.Check mirror just one more time, or three, and... stare for a second, and... breakfast! "I'm coming!"*he glows into the kitchen*THE LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT.Hang on a mo...Other people are not two dimensional caricatures. Ooooooooo....They may look a certain way in their demeanour, but underneath is this mysterious Pandora's box of possibilities.They may look miserable right now. But they might suddenly burst into jokes and giggles.They may appear calm and sensible to me on first impression, but they may turn out to be rather lazy or slightly bonkers today.It's difficult to know what to expect. People surprise.Oh yeah! 😁...Does anyone else have this where they very easily and quickly box people into two dimensional "You are this or that"? Is this particular an NPD or PD thing? I kind of think it might be. I've noticed that I very easily seem to do this compared with others around me. When I cast my silly judgements or assessments of people, for example, my partner or friends suggest that things are more complex, and that I'm being too inflexible in my view.So, sitting on this train home, looking at people around me, it feels cool and nice and open in my body to shift this more fixed perspective of people towards something more complex and dynamic and surprising.Oh!. I have found this hard in life, accepting and appreciating other people's talents and abilities and skills and achievements and successes. Even close friends. Even my partner.But ... it's something I've worked on quite a bit over many years. It's gotten easier. And more often I can find myself actually enjoying other people's talents, rather than feeling that tug of envy in my chest.Tonight we went to a birthday party. Cheesy music on the dance floor. I work in music and have spent a lifetime listening to music as a kind of "work". What can I learn from this musician? How can I be as good or better than them? Why aren't I successful? Fantasising about my own potential. etc etc You know the drill.Tonight, I noticed that I just enjoyed the music and the musicians without comparing myself or getting twitchy about my own abilities or status (or lack of status) as a musician.I thought, "Oh, this is what normal people must feel like listening to music."It was ... very nice.To reduce stigma, some refer to BPD as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.Would you re-name NPD for a similar purpose? If so, what?I'm going with SERD for now: Self-Esteem Regulation Disorder, which I think I picked up from elsewhere. I think it would help me explain the symptoms and behaviour to people. I wonder if I would feel less isolated and less concerned talking about it.Also, SERD just rolls off the tongue. Clearly.SERD! 🌈. It's such a bad and swift turnaround, it's also funny.I should really know better by now. But I contine to fool myself, it seems.Us self-aware narcs are not always so different from (supposedly) healthy people.Everyone has narcissistic defences. Ours are just more pronounced and much more dysfunctional.But everyone has that armour, or can do.But here's our advantage as the self-aware crowd. We (hopefully, but not always) \*recognise\* at least some of our defences. And because we have a tendency towards hypersensitivity, hypervigilance, and over-analysis, we may (I think) see more of the layers of our defences, the subtleties and nuances, and talk openly about them (here at least). On average, I'd say most people don't....Defences come in all guises. Grandiosity, yes. Going on the attack. Antagonism. Angry rumination. Martyrdom. Complaining. But also just simple detachment from emotions.Everyone does this.Last night I was with a few friends at dinner. One friend brought up how she was worried about her Mum and Dad, the latter in particular because he was experiencing pain I his side, had previously had cancer, but had been ignoring the pain and the doctor or telling anyone until just recently. She shared her news and revealed a glimpse of her fears. I felt like she was human and I was human. I felt connection to her where previously I was struggling.Within surely less than a minute, another friend chipped in to say something like, "It's probably nothing", and turned the conversation towards something else. The friend with the unwell Dad followed along. The window of vulnerability opened and was quickly closed. I felt the moment where we could connect fall away from me.There it was in the group. Detachment. Cutting off from emotions that might be "too much", "awkward" or "intolerable".I felt lonely again, me with my feelings I sensed there was less room for. I closed up....When I teach my piano students, I try to notice my own state or mode as much as possible, and how the student is responding. I notice that when I've been in a more grandiose state, it feels fun and I feel awesome, and students may tag along with the energy for a while. Perhaps there is some comfort in being with a teacher who distracts them from their own feelings, through becoming the centre of attention in my jokes or quirkiness or through playing in a show-off or extravagant manner. But the sense of comfort and ease in the room doesn't last long. Quite quickly I notice that I become disconnected from the student. They are "over there" and I am "over here". We aren't vibing off each other.I think this is problematic for the student and the teaching, particularly in a one to one teaching context. The disconnection feels quite isolating for both of us. Quite lonely and even a bit scary for the student. In order for the learning to be "good", they need a sense of secure connection with the teacher. And it's true. When I'm in a more balanced, emotionally in-touch state, in tune with what's going on within me, sensing what is happening potentially in the student, verbally checking in with them and listening to their responses, and yet having that overall sense of stability and level-headedness, then the teaching can work better. I notice that students relax more and open up. They share their feelings about playing and we work to resolve problems that I could only know about if they are shared. Or it could be about them sharing their interests or preferences for the direction of travel in the lessons. That opening up allows them their autonomy, which is another key ingredient to success when we work together: I'm doing some guiding, but they are also participating and speaking up about what feels right for them in that moment. If I'm grandiose or detached - not checking in, not open about my own experience - then they don't have so much room to express themselves, and the lessons are about me more than them. And that's not good.I'm not saying that the good teaching is absolutely and totally dependent on my behaviour. But how I show up has at least some impact. And it is my responsibility, I believe, as the adult and professional, to think about these things and try to do my best for the client. Grandiosity is not totally awful and can create some kind of spark in the room. It can even lift people for a while, which is no bad thing. But if it is too strong or too prolonged, disconnection entails, and the learning process - and the joy of music - falls a bit flat....A core part of me, however much I deny it when I'm grandiose or emotionally detached, yearns for connection. I think we all do. It's a fundamental human need.I s'pose this post is aiming at a few things. A reminder for myself to notice that grandiosity or detachment within myself, and to try to find ways of softening the armour, to be more open, even vulnerable, to foster connection with others.I can't deny that there's also a bit of "come on, guys" to this post. I like you for you. Sometimes I feel that our defences get in the way of connecting here, in this special place - where we have that opportunity to connect. ...I say: let's go for it.If you are anything like me, you are sensitive, you have a sensitive temperament. People have told you that you are reading into things that aren't there. You are told that you are too much, too intense, think too much, are full of woe, or have too much energy, too happy, even.It can be lonely being an emotional and sensitive person. It can become easier to put forward what we think is an acceptable presentation of ourselves for others, hiding the fluid and intense feelings underneath. At the same time, it can feel like very few people seem to understand our emotional landscape inside, so we retreat inwards, becoming hyperautonomous and over-introspective, lost in our own thoughts, analysing our feelings, maybe seeing them as superior to that of others.These are perhaps some of the ways that narcissism has manifested in me, which leads to other self-interested behaviours that add to the suffering of feeling lonely and not understood, alien....But the intense feelings are also a gift. This is a tricky line to tread, because it can be easy - certainly for me - to over-treasure and over-personalise these gifts as "ours", making us special, better. So we have to be on guard for this kind of thinking that further separates us from other people, when what we really need is connection and understanding.At the same time, I think we can enjoy our emotions and find solace within them. Intense emotions allow me to experience life with greater passion. I find fulfilment through sorrow and grief, not just resting on everyday, superficial emotions. I have many emotional peaks throughout my days. They can be tough, but I am also grateful for them. It has been a difficult life sometimes. But rich. Very rich. Just being in my body every day.Maybe a view that accounts for both sides of the coin can help keep us level-headed. We are both unlucky and lucky. Recognising the pluses and minuses gives me a sense of balance, and both limits my tendency towards self-aggrandisement and keeps me from a sense of unhelpful self-pity....One of the things I like about this forum is that it is filled with intense people, quite willing to go to the depths. Very fulfilling. I am glad.We can get better. ...Another low effort post.Oh! ...Low effort post. Sorry. But that's it.I had a post earlier about what being kind to ourselves means to different people here.It occurred to me that - of course - for many of us, we struggle to even know what it is to be kind or self-compassionate, because we didn't experience it, or it wasn't modelled to us in childhood.When I started my own journey of recovery about 13 years ago, I also really had very little clue about compassion in some respects. My attempts at compassion for others were more like grandiose manipulations of their emotions, positioning myself as "the person to lean on", being "the wise advisor" and so on. Yes, it wasn't all bad. People may have got things from the interaction. But for me, it was probably more about feeling good about myself, and seeing myself as the bigger, better, wiser person, rather than actually connecting with the person in need. I didn't really have a feeling of connection with them, I don't think. It was more: what can I get out of this interaction? If they feel good at the end, then I will feel good, and that was probably more of the main goal.Attempts at self-compassion ... ? I mean, I didn't know. I remember during therapy in 2020, my therapist "introduced" the idea of compassion to me. It was kind of new to me. I didn't really have a feeling about it. I said I would try to be compassionate to myself, but it wasn't really something I felt. It was more of a logical, cognitive exercise.One time in therapy again last year, I was doing a particular exercise in self-compassion. My therapist asked me to think about what my "healthy adult / role model" might do in a particular imagined situation. I pulled from a list of ideas I had made in the previous year, which I'd jotted down on a piece of paper. Having said out loud what I'd do, I quickly burst into tears, realising that while I knew the answer now, it was something that took me so many years to work out. I was sad for my younger self who didn't experience the compassion a child should receive, and so had to strive to learn it as an adult in a very haphazard way,Now, I do have a better understanding of being nice to myself and others, but it didn't come from me. It took effort, and I had to look for it from other people: by observing friends, characters in films and TV, and podcasters like Tara Brach - who really taught me a lot in particular.So it was a bit presumptuous of me earlier to ask people how they could be kind to themselves today, when it took me a very long time to work it out. I didn't think clearly about it.I had to outsource it. It doesn't come from us. But I do believe it's possible for us to internalise and make our own the behaviours - and eventually feelings - of other people.As I said, one personal go-to in my journey was Tara Brach. She also teachers meditation, and while I found her meditations really nice, it was really the podcast talks that were helpful. I learnt so many things through her talks. I imagined her as my new inner parent. I would speak to her in my mind's eye: "I'm stuck. What should I do?" ... And I would, because I'd listened to her so much, more and more easily imagine what she might say back to me in various situations: "I see you're hurting. I see you're angry. I'm so sorry you're struggling." Just that - that empathy delivered to myself through my imagination - was enough sometimes to help me calm down. I remember that when I couldn't sleep at nice because I was so enraged, imagining Tara Brach come to my bedside like a mother figure, sit down on the bed, rest her hand on my body and say, "I'm so sorry you're hurting right now" ... that would allow me to relax and drift off to sleep.I still struggle with real empathy sometimes, but it's better. When I can't connect properly, I can still say the words that I learnt from Tara Brach, and feel that they might have a positive impact on people like they had on me. It's like: passing on what I learnt through her. It's also far less grandiose than it used to be. I've learnt to let the other person work it out for themselves more, with just little nudges, rather than dictating how I think they "should" think or feel or reflect. Yes, there is still some grandiosity involved on my side, but it's less and less.So there you go. I just wanted to say that.No jokes or cynicism. 😁For me, it's lowering - even by just a knotch - the demands and expectations I put on myself to be productive and perfect in all spheres of life all the time.For once, not doing, but just being. Not pushing forward fast. Allowing life to unfold on its own a but more. Strolling rather than sprinting. Whoops. I dropped the juggling balls. Oh well. I'll pick them up some other time. It's be OK.That is the kind of kindness I need today. What about you? It could be completely different.I'd say these are two core features of my personality, as I currently see it. I wondered if other pwNPD relate in their own way.A comment by u/KickLongjumping4433 got me thinking about these aspects of me.In Schema, they sometimes talk of a 'Defiant Child' mode, which is an "angry response to having one’s autonomy curtailed and being told what to do."Then there is the Rebel Mode in Schema. A Schema theorist I like, David Edwards, quoted some key statements linked to this mode of behaviour: “I dislike rules and can get satisfaction from breaking them,” “I think of myself as a rebel; I often go against the established authority,” and “I enjoy being unconventional, even if it’s unpopular or I don’t fit in.” He goes onto say: "This mode externalises a backstage Defiant Child, and incorporates a narrative that portrays it as a valuable identity. Expression may range from being more passive-aggressive to being actively, even militantly rebellious."...I definitely have these elements in me. And I think it's important to keep in mind that they arise in response to a sense that autonomy is being taken away or denied. Or was in the past, as a child. We have a core need to individuate / differentiate from other people, and ... this is an undeveloped part of me. I didn't properly go through the individuation process because of my over-bearing, enmeshing mother and terrifying father. No space for 'me'.I really see where this lack of autonomy comes from in myself, and why it's such a big trigger for the defiant part of me. When I feel like my independence and sense of personal choice as an adult is undermined or unfairly questioned, like it was in childhood, I get angry really quickly. RAGE! There is a teen-like "Fuck you!" flavour to the anger. Two fingers up. Slammed doors. Vent post.I guess the rebel mode in me, if it's linked to this sense of angry defiance underneath, is the lighter and more playful version of this rage. It's the mischief in me, as I've identified many times before. Disgusting jokes. Pranks. Banter. Giggling about my misdemeanours. Revelling in the naughtiness.I've mentioned, for instance, that I see myself as quite emotionally immature in some respects, or at least that this can come forth in me fairly often. I feel an almost mischievous glee about this aspect of my personality. Again, I think it connects to that sense of rebellion: "I'll behave like a teenager, and it'll make me different, annoying, unconventional etc." But I think it also reveals that underlying angry defiance. It has a kind of: "Fuck you, social conventions!" flavour in there too. I'm not great with rules....I'm sitting on the bed - like a teenager - typing this. Ahead of me is a large mirror. Occasionally, I'm looking up and channelling that rebel / defiant mode through my face, to see what comes up.Gosh. I actually do this often throughout my day! Lol. This is the mode that pops out in the bathroom mirror, for example, when I run there to escape the adult dinner party conversations that I detest. I pull this face to myself. What is it saying? ... "Don't fuck with me!" ... "I don't give a fuck." ... "You're all a bunch of wankers." ... "Fuck this boring shit." ... Maybe I'm thinking these and similar things to myself in the mirror because I feel I can't say them to the people I'm with. Maybe I use the mirror to express or display parts of myself generally that I feel not able to say out loud. I kind of put those parts of me into the mirror, where they are safe. The mirror is a safe space to express myself. Oohhhhhhhh!...The thing is, if I follow the Schema model, then underneath all of that is the vulnerable childlike part of me. A part of me LOVES being this rebel, and wants to deny that there is anything else going on. But to do that would not do myself any favours. It would be to keep me stuck in a way of coping with life - through feeling and being rebellious (passive and active) - rather than actually attending to any wounds underneath that are driving those parts of me ... to, quite honestly, behave in ways that I can regret or bring me a sense of shame in the aftermath.So as I continue to gaze into the mirror, I also find a safe moment to express other things to myself. The mirror is my display cabinet for my deeper emotions I feel unable to share anywhere else.A sadness quickly reveals itself. Loneliness. Fatigue. Bleakness. Depression. Feeling ugly. Feeling unwanted. Feeling unloved. Totally.I spend a moment staring at my face, which shows all these emotions and more that I can't describe properly. It feels good to acknowledge that these feelings are there. I suddenly realise how tired I am.Life is tiring for many reasons. Just tapping into one particular aspect, though, it's tiring not being able to express my emotions in public, or at least *feeling* like I can't. It's tiring feeling like I have to wrap up my emotions in some publicly acceptable presentation that doesn't feel natural to me. It's tiring and frustrating. My sadness shifts to a childlike anger: "Why can't I just say what I want, how I want?! Why do I have to follow these rules of self-expression when they are so stifling and unnatural?" I feel sad again. ...And then I feel that playful rebel part of me come through. It's like a way of distracting myself from he sadness and frustration. There he is in the mirror once more, and I feel my thoughts turn to mischievous things I might think or do later in the day, just to "get my own back". Hm. Defiance. Feeling controlled again, and so engaging in thoughts and behaviours that give me a sense of taking back control, or defying the authority that I don't agree with....I do like this rebellious and defiant part of me, though. Yes, it's immature, and I can do or say some things in that mode that later induce shame, but there are also many upsides. People laugh at my stupid jokes and silly, childlike behaviour. ATTENTION! But the mood of the room lightens.It actually also works well in my work as a piano teacher, where, depending on the appropriateness of the moment, I can be playful and cheeky and poke fun at social norms (especially around music performance and assessment, for example), and it's all part of the package: the slightly quirky piano teacher, helping people escape - for 30 minutes at least - the trappings of school or adult life. I play a bit of the fool if it feels right to do that, and the intention is to lighten the mood sometimes, and give space for people to undo their social conformity, get a bit more childlike themselves and connect with and lose themselves in the music - which is what we're aiming for....I don't want to get rid of the rebel in me. He's funny and cute and energising. But I do think it would be good to recognise where he comes from as well, and tend to that sadness underneath a bit more....Now, where's my rocket. 🚀. I have gotten a lot of helpful comments to posts since I started writing here.Recently, a few people have pointed out my potential black and white thinking on various situations. On reflection, I do see that I still struggle with this style of split-off thinking and perception of myself, other people and the world around me.My understanding is that this is a feature of NPD. I just re-watched a HealNPD YouTube video on integration and splitting, and related to it a lot.I generally see myself as split into 'parts' that feel radically different from one another. Some I instinctively feel are 'all good' while others I perceive as 'all bad'. Well, that is my tendency anyhow. I am trying to enjoy and appreciate that sides that I previously felt terrified to acknowledge. And I am also experimenting right now in seeing the downsides of my "pure hearted" parts. But my mental reflex is still to see these parts as cut off from one another and either dastardly or wholesome. It feels hard right now to perceive a middle ground. Grey areas in my thinking are appearing, I guess. But it takes conscious effort to think like this.I also have the habit of associating my "real self" with these different parts at any given time. When I'm in a low mood, I can easily think, "Oh. That's the real me." But when I'm grandiose or otherwise, I think just the same and ignore the low mood from before. In either state, it feels difficult to imagine that the "real me" is both or the opposite of where I am currently at. I am also obsessed with trying to figure out who "I really am". It's another mental reflex that I have to consciously pull myself away from often.Historically, I have tended to see people as "all bad" or "all good". In the past, I would easily want to discard people in my life who I thought were "evil" or against me or not worth the effort because they were "boring" or "stupid" or "aggressive". I would also idealise some other people as being "good-natured" or "great".These days, I still have that tendency. But I do more readily see people as more than one thing.But I now find it confusing that some other people are much more "blended" than I am. I see there "good" and "bad" qualities, but I don't see those parts as split off from one another. Some people don't shift in and out of different "modes" of behaviour and mood like I do. They are more "one thing with subtle flavours."I see that other people do have quite different sides to them that appear in different contexts. But I somehow don't perceive that as problematic in them, whereas it feels totally problematic that this could be the case with me. The idea that I am not constant confuses me and feels "wrong".I am a kaleidoscope of moving parts that come to the surface, and I don't really know anything different. It feels very disorientating to live in a kaleidoscope, with parts that I cannot hold onto for long, or comprehend as ok or me or real. I am constantly questioning my sense of identity. How can I be both terribly kind and a complete cunt at different times? To others, that might not seem like an issue or something worth worrying about. But to me, my sense of identity plays on my mind every day. Who the fuck am I? The cunt or the cute kind one? It really bothers me. How can I be both?When I am with people, I feel these different parts rise and fall in my persona. They can be very intense and radically different. Rage then anxiety then cockiness then tearfulness then joy. I think I try my best to appear as one person, trying to present a stable image to the world, or as I imagine the people I'm with would want me to be. That has always been my tendency. But it is quite an anxious state, where I'm simultaneously managing what's going on underneath, which is a lot. My therapist said she could see waves of emotions pass quickly through me in session. That is me without the mask on. A montage reel of contrasting parts, flipping very quickly from one to the other. A multipart chorus of voices singing in different tonalities. I feel I am getting better. So that's good. It feels very hard to do this sometimes, but I am trying to present to people more how I want to be or feel in the moment, rather than how I instinctively and subconsciously imagine they want me to appear. It still feels anxiety inducing and challenging. I guess this comes down to feeling like I "had" to be one thing but not another as a child. I had to appear to get along with my parents, for example, even though they terrified or mistreated me. I had to pretend to the world that everything was fine a home, even though it was a scary place to live. I felt I had to please my parents by presenting in particular ways but hiding others. Then being a musical child gave me a place to really escape all of that. I would get attention and shine on the little stage. I would enjoy living inside that bubble of peace and excitement.Writing this makes me feel sad that the trauma or neglect I experienced as a child had such an impact on my brain.I know a little about what's going on here, but would appreciate any more input. What I am really hoping for is some understanding and guidance.Rip off the mask and underneath there is a really nasty side of me. It is not all of me, but it is a real part. I've written about it elsewhere a few times, but I guess I'm coming back to it to try to consolidate my thoughts a bit further.You see, I'm on this journey of mine. I want some kind of reconciliation of my various parts, however contrasting. I want some kind of integration, rather than this splitting of my psyche. I don't want to present in one way to people but feel completely different underneath, or try to push that other side away from my being. Or at least I want to do that less and less, or when it's only necessary. I don't want to split into different and distinct modes so much. I want to have access to more of my whole self, and use those different sides more wisely.I just ... want to be whole. It's not like I'm starting from scratch at this point, but ... that's my journey, which I don't mind repeating and repeating. I want it. I want it....So this nasty side... Once again, like many of my 'tricky parts' it seems, I have hidden it from others, and denied it to myself. Shut it down. Tried to quieten it or change it. Step away from it. Let it shrivel.But it keeps coming back. It won't change. It's just 'there'. An aspect of my personality.It actually pops out when I look in the mirror. It's there in my eyebrows. Lol. :)This nastiness has many flavours:It is rebellious to authority. Antagonistic. Highly irritable. Fractious. Wanting to scold, belittle, shame, lecture, control others close to me. It is sneering at people. It is reducing them to an object that I can mentally demean and ridicule. It is taking some pleasure in shocking people, intimidating them, making them uncomfortable. It is wanting to start arguments only to gain the upper hand. Doing things that most people would find somewhat shocking. It is petty and vengeful. It sometimes imagines doing harm to others. It is pure, wicked mischief.In another post recently, I wrote about a power-hungry side of me. In some ways, this feels a bit different. But these two sides, I guess, could potentially combine. I'm not sure right now.That would be quite something if they did combine and were let loose....This nasty side of me has, in particular, caused me great anxiety in the past. Like: panic for it even being there. *Where did it come from? Is this the real me? Help! I thought I was a good person. I want to be that good person!* But, thankfully, that anxiety has been diminishing through some self-work I've been doing.This past year, I have actively tried to recognise it when it appears and allow it in through my mind and body. In time, I have grown to appreciate but also enjoy it. It has a wild and electrifying energy that really excites me.Apologies for being graphic, but it's become a real turn-on when I'm having a wank. It just really does it for me, and I'd say is part of what I'd call my autosexuality. It's like I'm turned on by this really cuntish side of my being.I can also now look in the mirror at myself and, rather than see it and deny it, change my face to obscure it - I can instead think, "I really like this wicked side of me" and not flinch neatly so much. In fact, I feel the thrill of it....And yet: do I actually want to be a cunt to people? Er ... *No ? ? ?*No. I don't want to hurt people. I don't like that.But it's not a 100% no, either. The nastiness is still there. And I quite like the mischievous aspect of it. It's entertaining, both in the moment and talking about it with similarly-minded or accepting others. There are also ways I have recently discovered to enact this nasty mischief that don't actually cause people harm, but do cause considerable pleasure and thrill.Naughty Peanut....There are definitely aspects of it that I don't want. I don't want to be a dick to my partner, my family, friends or people at large. I don't like scolding or ridiculing my partner or other people. I don't want to lash out at people. I don't want to overtly demean people. I want connection. I want to see people as whole in themselves. I don't want to be controlling of others. I want to let them to exist as they choose. I want to help people more. I want to try to get along with more people. I want to be more generous (though it's quite an effort sometimes!).But again: I want connection....And yet, I do want the energy of that nasty side. I guess just without the behavioural nastiness.I'm hoping that, now I've acknowledged it and enjoyed its presence, I can keep it in mind, draw from its energy, but without the mental or behavioural degrading of others.That covert mischievous aspect seems like it could be an answer. Revelling in little non-harmful misdemeanours in private. And having a good ol' wank about it.I could be kidding myself again, but I'm hoping that can help with the reconciliation and integration.I'm nervous posting this.Not so much about the title, but about whether I've been able to explain my experience effectively....I've been on this path of trying to be more honest with myself, allowing parts of my psyche to be acknowledged and felt, so I can be authentic to myself at the very least.It's not a new thing. It's been going on for a while, this trying to peel back the layers.When I access some hidden or shunned part of me, there is a burst of energy that feels amazing. A real high. It's also psychologically wonderful to acknowledge and accept and even celebrate parts of me that I previously felt ashamed of. Then it settles and becomes a part of me that I accept and recognise as an element of 'me'. It's something I've been doing this year more and more....Today, with a new zeal for this process, I felt a part come forward that I've been scared of, and written about elsewhere. I've always tried to shut it down. But today I was ready to allow it in.It was interesting to feel it come forward when I was out in public. It came through in how I felt in my body and on my face. I noticed it in my thinking and feelings about myself and others.At first it was just a feeling, but I allowed it to come forward more and take centre stage. If it were a character, they would be ... dastardly, cunning, manipulative.And then I realised what was at the core of this part: a real lust for power.It reads a little inconsequential when I read that back now. But that lust, craving, yearning for power, dominance, recognition, status is an important and not small part of me.I allowed it in, allowed my thoughts to be focused on gaining and having power. The energy release that came over me was massive, like a huge sexual energy.I was walking in the street. I tilted my head back and looked to the sky like I was having an orgasm. That energy coursing right through me. It felt fucking fantastic, thinking about power....There I was in the street, and I acknowledged it to myself. I have a huge lust for power, and all the above I've described.Status. Ugh.Reputation. Drool.It's been there since I can remember. It drives my actions, even though I've tried to deny it, shut it down.But today, I said to myself that this is not just a part of me. I said: *I AM power hungry*. For someone who has been trying or pretending (to others and myself) to be the 'good guy' my whole life, this is a huge step. It felt massive.I dived back into that part of me. I had thoughts of manipulating people to gain status, a good reputation, recognition etc ... Wow! What a turn on!I thought of how people in my life give me compliments for my work. Something so small. But again: that quite sexually charged rush as I realise what I'm in it for. That feeling of being on top.Admired.Revered.Ugh. Drool. DROOL!!!!!Literally cum in my pants....Whenever I felt this part of me before, I was scared what I would do with this drive for power at the helm. Would I hurt people?Would I want to hurt people to gain power?Maybe this sounds ridiculous to you reading this. I guess I'm condensing quite a lot of work and experience into short paragraphs. But ... I did a test. I walked passed a few people and noticed how my body reacted. I usually feel small physical urges pretty well. I was curious to see if an urge to hurt people would come through with this part of me being more dominant.But ... no. Nothing.Maybe it'll be there another time and surprise me. But ... no. No urge to hurt people to gain power.Oh! Didn't see that coming.I mean, no judgement if you do actually want to hurt people. I get that others here might have that. But ... I don't.Neutral....I went to a shop. A homeless man sat outside the door. I asked him if I could buy any food for him. As we had our exchange, I observed what was happening in my mind and body. Interesting how that lust for power died down. I bought the food, gave it to him, didn't really feel that much for it. Then went back to my thoughts of power lust and having an orgasm in the street....And another thing. I thought about other people having power as well. And, oh yes: that's why I get envious. But, wait... it also just turned me on more. To be around people with that same lust as I have.WOOF!Hello r/NPD!...I also realised that this lust secretly drives my behaviours: in my work, in my relationships. Oh ... I'll be nice, if I get the power out of it.And oh, I'll work hard and do well for others, for the recognition.But also true is that in the moment of working with others, I don't actually feel that power drive, that yearning for grandiosity. I work one-to-one to help people feel good and be creative. My focus is on them in the room for the most part.But I tell where that lust for power comes out: between sessions. That's when I self-aggrandise about how brilliant I am and have been. Or when, as I said, I get compliments....The do-gooding part feeds the power-hungry part.The power-hungry part drives the actual do-gooding....But also ... I realised and felt inside that when it comes to it, when the chips are down ... I'll ignore or dismiss my power craving and do the right thing for people.Interesting.The fear of this part of me dissipates. Just something to enjoy....It doesn't even make me feel that relieved. It's just how it is. Neutral....PEANUT (wants all the) POWER.So obvious.At least now I know.BUT ...What?Both power-hungry AND ok to share with others.WHAT?...I deny some of my thoughts and feelings to even myself. I'm trying not to. That's a big task for me. Here I am, trying.I'm trying to be whole.I want to go further along this path, to see all the different parts of me and accept them. But I'm scared....Sometimes I feel I present to myself and the world that I am this pure-hearted, clean-thinking guy.And I do feel love. Not for everyone. Maybe ultimately only really for my partner. I'm scared that he'll die and then I'll have no one who I actually love.I have thought that I would probably kill myself if he died.DRAMAS!But true: I have thought about it....I am happy-go-lucky and bouncy in my presentation in public.But that's not all that's going on.I'm incredibly self-obsessed and selfish, and can be quite vicious underneath. That's what I hide from people. I hide from myself as well.Is it that I aim to get along with people in my life, but that's about it?The feeling of power is intoxicating for me. Any kind of power.I write my chirpy emails to my clients, thank my colleagues for their help. I maintain that connection. Appearing all cheerful and like I care.But I also sense this other, exciting part of me that wants them to like me so I can dominate and be on top. Shine. Be brilliant. Own the room. Just dominate. Ooof. It's definitely there. And it's not a nice part of me.It's actually quite a nasty side. Sneering. Judgemental. Using people. Manipulative. I've been scared of this part of me all my life. Is this the real me, after all?FUCK!!!!!It is a real part of me, for sure. I feel it.I worry about what would happen if this part of me took over.I worry about what I could or would do, without a care.The darkest part of my humanity....Is it possible to be so cheerful and nice and enjoy connections, and yet on the other side be so damn ... black hearted?FUCK!....Do I actually like people at all? Anyone?Thinking about it ... Yes. I actually do. I do. Thank God. Thinking about people I know. I do. I feel it. Thank fuck. It feels like a relief to feel those nice feelings about people.Phew ... Sigh ... But it's like I'm clinging onto the edge of a cliff here. Holding onto the good.Desperate not to fall. In case......That nasty side of me. The side that gives me a great feeling of energy and power.Dare I say it, but it's actually an evil side to me....A colleague just came into the room as I typed this.I chatted with her. Her presence felt warm and kind. I enjoyed being with her. I felt equal. I felt connected. Oh thank God. There it is again: that nice feeling. I AM OKAY!!!...Am I deceiving myself for even thinking that I have this 'dark side'? No. It's there. He's there. That flavour of Peanut.Charged with energy. Evil glint in the eye....I have had this idea that my contrasting sides could somehow integrate, blend.I say, sometimes, that some mid-point between dark and light is this cheeky wanker middle man: a cunt with a heart. 🌈...I dunno. Another colleague just came up.I liked being with him. We chatted. It felt natural. Easy.No cheeky wanker....Or maybe I was just mirroring him. ... Ugh.My mind.Who the fuck am I?...Why do I have these thoughts? Is this NPD or another issue?What? Just generally: what? How? Who? ...Who's deceiving who?Am I deceiving you all here? Sometimes. I'm trying not to....Does anyone have a clue about any of this?. Are your narcissistic traits constant or do they glitch on and off?In my work as a piano teacher, I find my narcissism is often out of the picture. In that moment with students, I do devote most of my energies to the person, or to managing my own emotions and wellbeing so I can show up and be present for them in a healthy way.Outside of that context, I can be a right narcissistic silly cunty twat. Mostly covert. Mostly. But again, not always. It's interesting how different situations ignite my narcissism, while others don't.Enough about me. When are you narcissistic and when are you not?What is it that brings out your narcissistic defences? What triggers you?Or ... Are you narcissistic all the time?. I'm knackered as I write this.I'm so tired. Work. Over work. I do that. Physically shattered. Mentally barely here right now.I read some bit of Schema Therapy research that connected proneness to fatigue and burnout with the Unrelenting Standards schema. I have this schema. It's common for people with NPD, apparently.I have sort of burned out a few times in adulthood for sure. Anyone else?Very high standards. Rigid expectations. Perfectionism. Of course. Of course.The drive to be on top. The best. Harder. Faster. Better.Drive. Drive. Drive.Do you relate?///I had a really hard day, work-wise. Physically demanding. I felt dizzy from the stress. But I also thought: "Hey, at least I'll be burning loads of calories and will therefore look good whilst fainting."I hated today, but also found solace and joy in pushing myself.Feeling that I'm on top of everything and pushing hard gives me a bit of a thrill.Feeling that I look good whilst doing the work gives me a boost of energy.Do you get that?///Of course, I'm also working to tame this side of me. A calm breath. A stroll instead of a walk. A break instead of doing anything. But that underlying push to the top of my game is always there and needs managing. ///I have a thing called 'wellbeing Thursday' in order to give myself a break in the week. Thursday mornings ARE MINE! Everyone else can just fuck off (unless you're one of my narc pals). Just : No work. No non-narc friends in cafes because I happen to be free. Nope. I do as I please. On my own, in my narcissistic pleasure dome for one. Thank you Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday, and Good Night.Oh my god.I realised a key difference in the way I treat the people I've met and made friends with here, compared to how I treat people in real life, especially my partner: Unconditional love.Unconditional love, unconditional positive regard or whatever you want to call it. I understand it to be a core emotional need that we often - in this group - didn't have met in our childhoods. Instead we were loved conditionally. And we were taught to love others conditionally. That if we do "X", we get love, or a substitute for love: praise or attention. Something like that.Is it total, 100% unconditional love and positive regard I have for my sub friends? No. It's not perfect. But ... the tendency is there. The habit. The inclination to turn that on rather than block it out and judge. A part of me does judge. But I can shift to overcome that. See passed that.I wonder if it is this that in part lays the foundation for the strong connection I have for people from here. That I had with Nick.I notice I very much try to be much more accepting, seeing potential dissonances, flaws or faults as collective or shared, and which have a context: the wounds we have from the past. I notice my tendency to forgive aspects of behaviour that don't gel with me, letting them go, seeing even antisocial behaviours as the manifestation of coping mechanisms built up from early-on to manage those wounds. Survival tools. I also notice that I listen to them, that I take their advice or even their criticisms on the chin and reflect on them. Not 100% perfectly, but much, much more easily than with people I know in my every day world and definitely with my partner....I had a disagreement with him just now going to the train station. We were on the verge of shifting into an argument. Well I was.I noticed that I was judging him. Of course. I do that. And I placed so many conditions on showing him love, feeling love for him. I do that too.He needs to lose weight. He needs to not drink so much. He needs to do as I would, essentially. Something Few said in an earlier comment about treating people as extensions of myself. It resonated and I related it to how I treat my partner. I am controlling. I am irritated by his actions that don't fit with me.We had our disagreement and I did my usual thing of calmly yet precisely cutting him down. Well done me. He's not perfect. He cuts me down too. But that doesn't stop me from wanting and trying to change for the better, for our relationship as a whole. I saw that he was hurt, though he didn't want to admit it.Then I managed to wonder, "What would I feel and how would I act if this was Nick, or someone else I am close with on the sub?" The motley crew / cast of the NPD version of Friends.I would show them that unconditional love. I would see passed the difficult or antagonistic behaviour, the controlling tendencies or the outbursts. I would see the wounds from before we met. I would tune into them and try to understand things from their perspective. And I would get there much more easily. For the first time, really, I saw my partner as a raw, wounded individual - I'd now say he's very likely NPD but far from self awareness. I saw his his difficult behaviours as the only way to survive that he knew.I turned to him and said, "You might not believe this, but over time, I've grown to love you more. And I just now saw you and loved you in a very new way."I stood there on the platform, looking at him and felt that zing of comnection in my chest, which is so easily blocked out. It surprised me. I noticed that I hadn't felt it like this before. Not really that much.(Then our train pulled in and I caught my reflection in the reflection and thought, "Oo. And... I'm also hot right now." Yay!)...I realised that I really could do with treating my partner - and other people in my life like someone from our little community: with empathy and compassion. Unconditionally. Or more so.Because he is wounded like the rest of us. ...I'm honestly proud of myself for this insight, and yes I'm sharing it here because of my pride. It's also to document for myself for future reference. A reminder of what matters.Nick would have said, "I'm proud of you, man." I would cringe when he said it. I would block myself from feeling his affection and care. I should have let that care in back then. I want to let it in now.I have received a great deal of very helpful support since Nick's death. I'm not the only one who needs it, but I was probably closest to him out of everyone I know here. So I greatly appreciate it. I have been with friends in real life, and we have had our laughs and good times. They have also given me hugs and space to be as I need. But on my own I have been blanking out, crying, distraught, very lonely, lost, depressed and shattered - confused. I'm glad I reached out for help in my lowest moment. As I wrote to Emotional_Climate, it's interesting how receiving a few kind words can have a big positive impact. You all really helped me. Thank you.💛...I don't know that Nick always felt truly supported by me. He said he did, but ... towards the end I had pulled away for such stupid and selfish reasons. I also don't know that he felt understood by me or other people. I'm not saying he suicide is all my fault in some self-centred way. But the very painful thing I've had to face is that my behaviour - my absence and lack of attunement - were at least one factor in his demise. There were many people who let him down, and I was one of them. I think that's the hard truth, no matter how small my impact was. At one point, we were so connected. It was quite unreal. We both said how special the friendship was, so ... I have to consider and understand that I failed him, and that this, in part, established the environment in which he decided the only option was to take his own life.My options going forward feel to be: kill myself, crush myself with self-flagelation as I live on, or live and try to do better. I'm choosing the latter. But I believe I need to feel the pain of the situation to do that. Some self-flagelation feels needed. I believe I need to understand where and how I let Nick down in my own way, feel the pain of that and use that to change in future. Maybe that's me trying to be heroic on some level. But I also can't just go forward and leave the pain aside, or try to. That would be to forget Nick, and I don't want to do that. It would also be to deny that I did anything wrong, and I believe that I did.The future has to be: better attunement with others, better listening, more compassion. People say that I do that, but ... I think there are others who have developed this skill much better than me. I can be so self-absorbed, I don't listen, even though I may appear to. I want to do better. I have been trying to do that in the last few days.The act of listening more and responding with compassion feels very possible. I know how to do that, I just don't always do it enough or when it really counts. It can turn off. But turning it on with sincerity feels like something I can do. But it feels somewhat complicated. I also don't want to cut out the parts of me that I think are "bad" and replace them with what is "good". Sometimess my self-centred parts are strong but I override them. But in doing so, it also feels like I'm shutting part of me off. I did that time and time again already throughout my life, and it only created a false self of "the good guy" - denying that I have these parts of me that are self-centred and even obnoxious. To deny those parts will lead to another collapse, just as I has in the past, when that false self disintegrates. Somehow I can't deny that I am, on some level, very selfish, and yet on another level, I am not.How the fuck do I reconcile that and be authentic, and still be better? Because i want that change in myself in honour of Nick. I really don't know. These parts of me feel so different, they feel hard to reconcile.Since I found out he killed himself. I don't know what else to say. A part of me feels I shouldn't being asking for help. I'm scared to, but I really need it.u/Arise23 has passed.He was my good friend from afar. We met here and had an instant connection.I quickly saw what a remarkable person he was. I saw his incredible capacity for love. He was passionate. He was articulate. He was very giving. He was a great listener and a great laugh. He was a fantastic advisor. He was brilliantly talented. I admired him a great deal. He taught me about male friendship. He helped me grow as a person - as a man. He helped me heal wounds from the past. He guided me.In the short time we knew each other, I came to love him as a brother. He told me he loved me, and I told him I loved him back. He called me 'King', and I called him 'King' in return.. It was a little joke, but it had a truth behind it. He deserved the title.We would talk for hours over the phone. I've never had that with another man before, ever. What a special person. I am shocked and devastated by his tragically early death. I wish that he had had the strength to continue living, but he wasn't able to pull through. I'm so sad.We would sometimes say to one another that it was quite remarkable that we had ever met - two people on different sides of the planet, with some real commonalities. Wow. Who would have known it, bro?I feel utterly blessed to have ever known him. I'm so glad that we met. I'm so glad he connected with me on line. What a joy to know him. What an absolute joy. That connection. Connection. Connection.It's all that matters. We had that. It was really strong.I bought a necklace with a King's Crown on it. Shining. Silver. A shield. I am already wearing it and I do so in his honour. Every time I look in the mirror - which I do often, and he totally did the same! - I will see that King's Crown.Goodbye, Nick. I will miss you very much. Irreplaceable....This sub. This sub introduced me and others to Nick, and other people like him. I'm so grateful."Goodnight King 💛" was the last thing he wrote to me...."Goodnight King 💛," I say in return.I just got a bit of abuse about being a narcissist. It included:*"in the case of you, you don’t even exist, you are a mirror, with no identity of itself, just a walking mirror, mirroring everyone to win them over, always in competition, always in the need to conquer…."*It motivated me to write about mirroring, which for me can be problematic, anxiety-inducing and distressing.Any insights are very welcome....I feel like the mirroring my brain does can be utterly automatic and all-encompassing. I wanna call it 'Deep Mirroring' because of the degree that - I think - it can affect my thinking and behaviour. An example would be:In any kind of writing - posts, comments, emails, texts - I very typically (and automatically) hear the other person's imagined voice in my head as I write, rather than my own. In fact, I struggle to hear my own voice in my head, and instead imagine 'their voice' or some voice they'd assume I have (or would like to have).To my mind, this affects how I write on a very fundamental level - word to word. Every aspect about my written communication can easily be 'what the other would say' or 'what I should sound like in order to be acceptable / cool / interesting' to them'. These are the key problematic aspects of this issue for me. It feels like I'm very, very good at mimicking other people's style of language and I do it to a very deep level. I can have email exchanges with other professionals, for example, where I can automatically mirror back their language style. I think I can sense that I'm using this to 'make myself appear more likeable or acceptable' to them, or to 'get what I want' or 'make a good impression.' A similar pattern can occur in person-to-person exchanges. Again, I can be with a string of people one-on-one, and very easily - if I don't keep it in check - be a very different person, mirroring the other in all sorts of ways in order to come across as *'the person wants me to be'.*I would go so far as to wonder if it's a form of Depersonalisation. It's like I partially dissociate and enter a kind of fantasy world where I'm just imagining 'what would they say?' / 'how would they put it?'I see this as totally connected to my childhood, by the way, where I learnt to mirror as a survival mechanism.Ironically, I'm trying to consider my words carefully here, because this topic is a key issue for me, and I want to make sure my description matches my experience....People have said to me that "this is normal" - and maybe it is, so hearing that again wouldn't be a bad thing. I understand that we adapt our language and behaviour with different people. I also know that idea that human beings are relational creatures - and so we become ourselves *between* one another. Again, it's about adapting in the moment to the context and the people we are with.However, what I find distressing is that, left unguarded, it feels like that my mirroring just takes over, and I completely lose my sense of self. So I can get to the end of a string of emails to different people, where I feel like I've just copied their tone and use of language - with a background hum of 'wanting to get ahead' or 'please people'. But not actually expressing myself as I would - only as I imagine they would from what I've heard or read from them....I've also had a therapist say that this shows that I have good empathy (and I actually can do). I also see it as functional and healthy to a degree. It's just he degree to which I do this that feels dysfunctional. It causes me distress because I want to have a sense of what I sound like, or how I would behave...,Some Good News:Things have improved over the years. I feel I am much more myself than I used to be. But it's still something I work on every day.One way I do this is to force myself to imagine myself speaking as I type. It takes effort for me to do this, but I find the results to be more authentic. I look back and read my writing and think, "Yeah, that's how I would say it." It feels comforting and even relaxing to feel that I've written in my 'own voice' rather than someone else's.\[ I added the bit on the end of the title to demo and practice how I speak, by the by. \]Also, in real life, I have worked a lot on not mirroring people in order to just fit in and get their approval. Instead, I am trying to speak more from how I feel or what I'm thinking. Being the vain twat that I am, this can be problematic in some situations. But even if it's inappropriate (i.e. self-sabotaging) to speak out loud what I'm thinking or feeling, I am trying to at least note what's going on inside to myself, so I can feel I'm being authentic to me even if it's not possible to do so with others in that moment.So, it's got a lot better. Thank fuck! But it's still something I struggle with....I'm all ears if anyone feels this is total crap, and I'm obsessing about nothing. Having said that, it does feel like an issue for me, and it causes me distress. Again, it's like I can almost Depersonalise and obliterate my sense of self through my communication and how I interact.All thoughts welcome. Thank you.I really can devalue my partner in my mind. I don't want that. It can also come across in my demeanour and tone of voice.It's sad. I'm trying to fight it.To other people, I can be super charming and good to be around. Friendly.I like me when I'm in those more public situations.Why aren't I like that at home?I want my partner to see that person I am to others. But he sees much more of the moody, controlling, scolding, patronising sides of me. Classic.Overall, he's a good guy and deserves much better from me. I love him. Actually, I can really adore him when I grt out of my own way. He has his big issues ... but ... he still has many more plus sides. Incredibly generous. Very entertaining and playful. Very cuddly. Argh. Narcs. Why do we always behave like twats to people closest to us? Life is short. I just want to be more happy.I am trying to confront my negative thoughts and actions. It's been an ongoing process for many years. I could still do better.I want my partner to know the friendly me more often.Or how do you regard that 'old you' before you realised / accepted your narcissism or NPD?Or maybe if you met that person today, how do you think you'd feel meeting them or being around them?What emotions come up for you when you think about that younger, unaware You?. How to you manage your anger or rage so you don't lash out at people when they are annoying or irritating to you?. How do you help yourself feel better, get into a better place?I just want to put addictive behaviour aside a moment, and any leap into grandiosity as a means of escaping. I mean ... what actually helps you get into a more calm, level-headed, steadier, non-reactive, connected mindset? That might even benefit you in the longer-term?What are the resources that support your wellbeing?. I am trying to keep my trauma in mind and body rather than push it away or forget it through all the distractions I do, all the ways I try to escape. The glossy image. The goals. The order.I woke up stressed and anxious today for no real reason. I started crying in bed. I just tried to stay with myself as the feelings were there. It was painful. Like flu, except I don't have flu. I thought it would be good to try to just stay with it and say, "It's ok to be here" rather than even try to soothe.I came downstairs and splurged in a DM to an NPD pal. The sadness was there and I cried as I wrote.I closed the laptop and did a workout. Lol.My partner woke up and call 'Hello!' from upstairs. He immediately detected the sadness in my response. "Are you down?" he said. Rather than just flipping into "Everything's fine!!!" mode, I said, "It's just my trauma stuff coming up."He called back down, offering to go and kill my Mum and Dad as a joke.He went to the bathroom and I noticed I started getting very anxious, fearful. My mind started tripping out. I realised that it was because I wanted to open up to him, but I was fearful of his response. I traced this back to what I received from my Mum when I opened up to her. Ridicule. Dismissal. Shut down. Rejection. Or my Father: well ... nothing because I could never consider talking to him about my feelings with him.That template of fear is there in my mind when I think about opening up. I will be "too much". I will be told to "get over it". I will be told to "stop myself from going too far". I will be told that I am "full of woe". I will be told that I "should be happy". My partner came downstairs and sat on the sofa with the coffee I made him. I told him I didn't want to be a burden, but that I wanted to be real about what was going on, rather than try to run away from it.He listened to me as I spoke about the issues I have with trauma, and he was very supportive in what he said. The relief was visceral. I thanked him. I was still tearful. To have that inner child meet the support that he never got in my childhood ... That's what that part of me needs.He asked me if I would feel better once my parents were dead. And I said, "Yes." He was very accepting of that.He did then say something like, "But I don't understand why you can't just say that your parents were idiots and move on." This brought up anger in me that made me feel unsteady. However, I contained it and said that it was like there were two levels to this. One was to think intellectually: Yes, my parents treated me badly. I am an adult now. I know different. I don't believe their messages. The other was the trauma itself: the disruption to my whole nervous system that is a total mind-body experience. The physical rush of fear. The intrusive and terrifying imagery that clouds my thinking. The urge to run out of the room, while at the same time being in lots of social situations where I feel that isn't an option, nor is actually telling people that this is going on. He was understanding and supportive again. I was a little bit like, "Yes. I didn't rage."I talked to him about narcissism as a coping mechanism for my trauma. I talked to him about finding solace and comfort and emotional regulation in the mirror as an example. Or in my appearance, or in my work. He was accepting and listened.Somehow we got onto my Mum's difficult behaviours, which are more the classic 'covert' type that I used to be. He criticised her behaviour, but I said that basically it was like what I was. "Remember when we went to the States with Jackie and Sharon? Do you remember in how much of a funk I was all the way through the trip?" ... "Yes. You were really hard to be with." ... "I was just very sullen a lot of the time." ... That's where my Mum can be. Pulling people down. That was me.My partner talked about there being a rock in the road, and at some point, you have to go around it and forget that it's there.I realised that I was diving a little bit into self-pity, self-obsession in the discussion, which I was actually enjoying. So I said, as a way of pulling myself out of it, "Yes. And I s'pose I can get stuck at that rock and stay there. But also ... running away and trying to forget it hasn't helped me either. ... There needs to be a middle ground where I keep it in mind but also go forward." You know, like: keep it in the rear view mirror.I said, "I think going forward, I just need to be able to say to you: 'My trauma issues are coming up. So if I act a little weird - especially in social settings - please know that I am trying my best. This is very hard to deal with, but I am trying my best." This is in regard to him often sensing that something is up with me, but trying to put it in a box when around other people. I guess because - in part - I had that tendency to pull everyone down. There are other reasons as well, but that's a fair guess in part as to why he does this. Anyway. He accepted this. In social situations, I often float off for a while to just sit on the toilet and re-centre myself for 5 minutes. Or try to. We had a friend round last night, and this happened again. The same cycle: she arrives. I feel really good to be in her warm-hearted company. After about 20 minutes, I start decaying. I can't keep up the facade. Or I try to, but underneath is a whirlwind. Total chaos. I cling to my seat.She knows about my NPD, and has been good with that. I mentioned to her a little bit that there was stuff going on last night, but it wasn't really the right situation to go further. So it was horrible. My mind shattered. I held onto the broken pieces.This morning she sent me the usual "Thank you" message. I wrote back and told her that I wasn't in a good place at all, that it wasn't her fault, but that it comes from 'nowhere'. I told her not to feel guilty, but that I just needed to now say that I struggle. I said I didn't want to hide from it anymore, as much as I can.Sorry, post-splurge. A lot has come up today. I put everything aside for once and lay in bed - not actually having a wank! - but actually dealing with my emotions....Since self-awareness, I have been actively searching for ways to integrate the narcissistic, king-wannabe side of me into my character. I had previously tried shutting or cutting him out. Or obliterating him from view. Over and over. But he remained. And would poke through in clumsy ways despite my attempts to appear "normal". Stable. But as I got to know this part inside, it turns out ... I quite like him. He's funny. So gradually, I've wanted to let him in and out to other people in appropriate ways. Not that I'm being openly superior. Actually, that part has really dwindled in my conscious mind (still there subconsciously). But it's more of the attention-seeking, competitive, self-interested, show-off side. Finding ways to reveal all that to people around me rather than the "Look! I'm The Healthiest Person Ever Promise!" face that I had been wearing. Humour has helped, by the way. I don't want to forget that wannabe-king in me. I can't. So last week, I bought a necklace online with a king's crown pendant. A silver disc with a little roughly-drawn crown in the middle. It's cartoonistic and childlike in design. Medallion-like. Small but perfect. Kind of Warrior-Viking in style. A tiny shield. I like symbols as reminders of things. I wanted to have something round my neck that reminded me of that side of me, rather than be ashamed of it, or forget it.It arrived today, a short while after that terrible distress came up in me.I looked at it and thought, "How can I wear this now? I feel the opposite. This is silly."...As the terrorised part of me relaxed, I was able to talk with another NPD friend. I related that I'd realised that while I was making headway in integrating my more narcissistic side, perhaps I wasn't doing so well with that traumatised part of me. The broken part. Sometimes after a PTSD moment, it's like I'm a broken soldier. Do you ever feel like that? Shattered? I look in the mirror and I look shattered. Tired. Raw.He too has kept on poking through the veneer despite my attempts to block him out - which include those King of the Castle behaviours.I had this feeling that I needed to be in touch with that traumatised, broken part of me, much more than I have been. That there needed to be integration of both the narc and the trauma. And maybe - if I can keep in touch with them and bring them on board to inform my day to day life - they wouldn't erupt in the ways they have been.But how to integrate these parts? They are so different. The king just LOVES to be in his castle. And the pain of that trauma is so intense....A little voice called out to me saying, 'Don't forget me! You keep forgetting me.' ... I will add that I did some psychodrama exercises in workshops and we had done a thing that was intended to get in touch with that forgotten child in us. That was earlier this year I did that.Laying in bed, I looked at that necklace pendant again. Childlike. Rough. Simple. Shiny. Mirror-Like.I had this idea that I could wear it after all, and that it could be helpful. I put it around my neck and it fell on my chest. I looked in the mirror and saw myself: that broken boy who wanted to be king.Actually, I needed it. Because of the trauma. No, it wasn't the best way to cope. But it was the way I coped as a child, and it spilled over into adulthood.It's like that little child imagined a crown to distract from the torment of a very early and unhealable trauma, which he (I) cannot remember because it happened too early. There were many other traumas that are remembered easily. But that early distress. ... Only terrifying feelings and flashes in the mind. It was too much to bear. Absolute shame. So the child sought out anything he could to confirm to him that he was in fact good, able and whole. Stable. Strong. On his journey to his imagined destiny as king he was Prince Charming, he was the Solider, he was the Wizard (at the piano), he was the Tyrant, he was the Grandiose Lover ... He had his whole castle built around him, including a dungeon where he sometimes could hear screams but shut them out. He had his minstrels to entertain him. He had his Joker. He had his Merlin. (Thank God for Merlin. The ultimate Healthy Adult). And he had his demons, who haunted him, tortured him at night.That's me. I'm looking in the mirror right now, and that's who I see: the broken boy who wanted to be king.And this is me in the aftermath. When the castle crumbled.It's raining heavily outside....Broken. Charming. Competitive. Embarrassed. Witty. Terrified. Haunted. Attention-Seeking. Easily Enraged. Insightful (thanks, [Merlin](https://www.reddit.com/user/Elongated_Mayonnaise/)). Stupid. Warrior-like. Fragile. ... I could go on.I think - I hope - this pendant could do a good job in helping me remind myself of all those parts. I want to remember it all.&#x200B;. I feel he saw me as weak, feeble, effeminate, less than he wanted from a son. Not what he'd hoped for.True or not, that is what I felt as a child and teen. And adult.As a child, I saw my body in the mirror and I wanted it to change. Be better. I wanted the "effeminate parts" to be sliced off and trimmed down. Tucked away. Strapped down. I wanted to be more masculine in my appearance. As an adult, I've gone to great lengths to give the impression to my father that I'm in control and strong. Able. Fine. A man....I see myself through his eyes. I'm constantly propping up the appearance that everything is ok.Lying on the bed now, I see myself in the mirror opposite. Feelings of disgust and ridicule. Aversion. And real weakness. Unloved. A frightened and lonely child.Too much of this. Too little of that.There is an urge to shift position and look more appealing to that part of me. But I stay.There have been little tears. I wonder if this is the right thing to do. Cry. Is that enough?..Sigh ... The thing is ... I actually also like some of those behaviours I do to appear more like my father wanted me to look, and I don't really want to give them up. Like. working out and having a masculine figure. I like it. I know that it's caught up in misperception, but I don't want to stop it.It's confusing. I don't quite know how to reconcile the misperception and the enjoyable behaviour.. Because underneath the glossy veneer, and looking like I've got everything sorted, is a feeling of distress in my body that feels so intense and all-encompassing, has overwhelmed me many times before, and I'm terrified of feeling it again. It feels like everything is going to fall apart.*Checks mirror.*Edit: The distress appeared again. It is like my whole world falling apart. Images of my mother shouting at me, chaotically. Right up in my face. In my ears. Screaming at me. Or running wild int he house. Or in distress herself. Fighting my father. He laughs. She screams. It feels like everything is going to shatter. The imagery is intense and for a split second I feel that it could be real. I see my Mum dead on the bed or on the floor. Again and again I have this. This is the distress.. I was talking with a friend of mine about vulnerability and NPD. I noticed a thing I do in writing posts here where I craft them- semi-subconsciously - so I can't let people in. It's like: quasi-vulnerability. It's there, but behind a shiny glass wall that I also put up as a distraction. To counteract that, I thought I'd just post the message I sent them and see what comes up - or not.&#x200B;Oh God... Exposure!&#x200B;"Hey... I'm thinking just now about what you said about not liking being vulnerable. Well ... I have my own expression of this. I noticed that when I post, I tell myself that I'm 'being vulnerable'. And in part, I do think I share vulnerabilities. But ... I present it in a way that is quite closed off. It's like I introduce the vulnerability I notice in myself, and then use the post to work through it and find some resolution. This has a few functions. I sort myself out BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE AND SAYS SOMETHING ANNOYING THAT I ALREADY KNOW! It's also got that function of 'being impressive' and 'heroic' and a 'leader'. Lol.The idea that I might write a post that is totally vulnerable and leaves it open for question and confrontation - even discussion apart from 'Well done, Peanut! I love you!' feels ... like something I don't want to do! Lol. But ... I notice, too, that in the posts I make where I don't close it off so much, there is much more interaction with people I don't usually hear from, and the discussions are helpful and interesting, and there's more connection - which I also want.So ... something to think about and work on.". My partner and I went to the theatre last night to see La Cage Aux Folles.It's basically a show about gays and drag queens. Lol. That's my summary. I've seen it about 4 million times.The audience was noticeably a load of ol' gay men - including us. (It happens at these kinds of shows. All the gays come out for our catwalk.)...**INTERVAL**The men had to queue for the loo. Usually that's something the ladies roll their eyes over while we toddle by with a smug little dance.But with all the lads out for the show, it was like queuing for the Gents at a gay bar. 😁Standing in that queue (we Brits love a queue), half-eyeing-up the oversized beards, muscles and flowery shirts around me, I felt really comfortable. Like being held. Safe. A feeling of belonging.I like being part of this group....Gay men are funny creatures. It's interesting from an NPD angle.There's a kind of narcissism that's normalised, okay and even celebrated as part of 'gay culture'. You can call is body fascism etc. But it doesn't have to be taken so seriously. There's a playful vanity, grandiosity, a cheeky bitchiness, hierarchical thinking, and a constant hum of flirtation and potential for sex. A lot of it can be wrapped up in a naughty humour and glint in the eye. Last weekend we went to a housewarming of a female friend. She has loads of gay male friends, and at one point in the garden, it was just us lot chatting like gay men do. It's different. It's fun. It's flirty. I like it.And the same thing happened. I felt a sense of belonging and okayness. I relaxed. I felt I could be more myself. I discovered myself, in fact.I don't actually have many other gay friends in my life, so it felt refreshing....There's a layer of shame you grow up with as a homosexual lad. I'm 40, so it might be better now in the UK. But in 90s rural Essex, it wasn't what you needed to be to survive.Once when I was about six (?), I sprung into the kitchen wearing a purple beret tilted to the side. I was beaming with a smile, wanting to show my Mum and Dad my little dance.They were both sitting at the kitchen table. My Dad didn't say anything but looked stern. My Mum scolded at me: "Take that beret off! Other people will think you are queer!"I removed my hat and my little self from the kitchen....The shame sticks around.It forms the near-invisible template in your psyche, reminding you how to behave and what to expect from people if you are 'yourself'. You are so used to it, you don't even notice it's there.It affects relationships. My partner, now 49, is still uneasy about us touching each other at all in public, even in central London. It makes me sad, but I understand it and respect it. I still go to cuddle him. He pulls away saying, 'No! You don't know how people will behave here. We could be beaten up!" 💛Hidden shame is probably the reason why I don't have many gay friends, actually. My parents' voices very subtly steering me away from being associated with gay men.It's there in how you hold yourself, how you feel inside as you meet with others. It is the driver behind the reflection-checking as you walk down the street. Without it, you don't feel the urge to check so much.It's there in how I am around other men, whom I had a fear of when I was younger. It's because I experienced so much belittling and abuse from straight men in the past. So I expect them to recoil and look down on me. Expect me to do and be less-than. Or threaten me. Or actually beat me up.(Fuck you, Matthew Parkinson, you fat, lowlife cunt.)...Looking around the theatre audience last night and watching the show, I felt a kind of pride. It's really just a kind of 'okayness' and ease in my body and mind. Actually, it's also a kind of joy for being who I am.It was cool to be part of all the over-groomed beards, cheeky side-glances, unnecessarily large biceps, and over-thought shirt n' socks combos.Yeah. This is me....This morning, I did my workout in front of the mirror as usual. 😁 Headphones on. [The Best of Times](https://youtu.be/vUqiM4c1oWA). The most famous song from 'La Cage' is 'I Am What I Am'. It was performed so brilliantly last night. Lost of people cried. The lyrics fit really well here, in this sub.But The Best of Times is my favourite.Fuck it!&#x200B;*The best of times is now,**What's left of summer but a faded rose?**The best of times is now,**As for tomorrow well: Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?*&#x200B;*So hold this moment fast,**And live and love as long as you know how.**And make this moment last,**Because the best of times is now.*&#x200B;I lifted my weights (upped two 2kgs yesterday, woop-woop!). I lip-synced along to the song on repeat. I did some super jazz hands. I enjoyed my cheeky grin.I imagined my little self dancing with me with his little purple beret. I showed him how to move. I let him free in my mind. He was happy. I was the parent he didn't have. He needed. A bit of [imagery rescripting](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental-Health-Professionals/Sleep/Sleep---Information-Sheets/Sleep-Information-Sheet---06---Imagery-Rescripting.pdf) there. A few little tears came up as the song played again.I'm proud of that little boy with his special dance. No shame....I need more gay men in my life. We all do....I love this [comedy sketch](https://youtu.be/cOESpIz8Mjg), by the by. From Catherine Tate. She's not Irish, but does a great accent, and impression.Chuckle....I know I'm talking about being a gay man. But I hope some things can translate and find their own usefulness to anyone with NPD.It's that experience of being shamed for who we are, of hiding and pretending to survive. Or that inner critic that haunts us like a shimmering ghost, lurking in the corner of our eye.And the joy is re-discovering our selves and being comfortable in who we are, despite what we were taught, and whoever we may be.You know, the rainbow flag is an amazing thing: 🏳️‍🌈. People keep saying "collapse" and I'm like, "What?" ... "You simply mean depression. Sadness."But today: I get it.With NPD in charge, everything is done just to prop up the self away from what is painful - or void - underneath.Today that sugar-crystal dome completely collapsed and I am in the under....OK, Narc OverLord: I get it. Lesson learned. ⛈⚡🌩The distance between the shell and the core is too great. The balloon is too big. Its skin is too thin.Pop....Looking back, my house of cards has gotten too big many times. It has collapsed often. The worst was in my early-mid 30s. I told myself I would be incredibly successful after studying at a prestigious college. Guaranteed. Genius.I wasn't. I put my whole self in that basket. When the ship didn't come in, I wanted to jump off the pier....Today isn't like that. But I see again how I have been propping myself up recently with my twigs and spit, thinking they were cast iron and concrete.Well, the wind blew in and knocked my scaffold over.I also see how I so want to prop up that scaffold again rather than deal with the dodgy foundations and structure.Dear OverLord of the Narcs (aka u/MudVoidSpark), What is my next lesson? I am listening.🌩⚡⛈. It's coming up to about a year since I started finally accepting my narcissism (having been in denial for a couple of years before), leading to then getting an NPD diagnosis / confirmation from a specialist.Quite a journey. Luckily it's involved a lot of self-reflection, otherwise it would've been boring!It's like the ground underneath completely broke open (drama!) and I went through a kind of self-reconfiguration: a breakdown of the persona I had built up for so long, coupled with a poking-through and eruption of all these different aspects of myself that I'd hidden away.It was initially - and for a long while - disturbing. A lot to handle psychologically. "What is this in me? ... Is this real or fake? ... Who the fuck am I?" ... My mind felt like it was in pieces.But (more drama!) I ploughed on through the oncoming winds.Gradually, a more stable sense of self has emerged: certain sides of me keep popping up again and again, more spontaneously, it seems, without clear reference to others so much. I also notice that in conversations, I feel increasingly like a separate person from others, in the way I talk, write or present myself, interests and ideas, opinions. Other people have their moves. I have mine. Yes, there is some merging and blurring, but we are quite different. I'm not trying to br like them or the way think they want me to be. I don't feel so much of the urge to mirror as I did. I feel I have some kind of self to fall back on when I get disrupted. He keeps re-appearing. And I've found myself more assertive, looking people in the eye when I want to speak about something (usually involving some Powerpoint about Schema Therapy)....I'm about to go on a Skype call with my Dad, who lives in another country. I spent my whole life pretty much being a yes-sir, no-sir, three-bags-full-sir kind of son. I would present myself in the way I thought my Dad wanted me to look, talk and behave - even think. ... I did that habitually from a young age as a way of coping with my Dad's terrific temper that could turn on like a switch; his threats of violence - or actual violence.Today, just before the call, I thought: "What a good opportunity to show up as myself."It's not as sudden a shift as I'm making it: I've been showing up more and more, I think, as different from the son I've assumed he wanted me to be. But today: I feel confident to turn up and be as I am, disagree with him ... Just not turn into that smiling face hiding a whirlwind of difficult emotions underneath. I don't feel I have to do that any more.So we met up. I can say he is remarkably brave, emotionally intelligent and articulate in expressing his feelings.I think he's gonna be just fine. Especially if he listens to the incredible advice from old blokes like me. 😁But watch out. Not so fast! u/moldbellchains can smell the grandiosity from down the road, fellas! Fuck!!!Yep, that's not Dior whateveritis, that's me!But he took a pin and popped my self-inflated ego-bubble when it showed up, and in such a healthy and considered way. He stood up for his feelings when they were being pushed aside by my emotional bulldozer mode, and got me thinking anew how grandiosity can have a negative impact on people....There were actual tears, and it was super. Human. A wonderful moment.We had a real connection. And when the moment felt right, we sat on a bench and had a very long hug.A hug that extends to everyone.
    Recently I’ve been experiencing insane amounts of empathy. It’s crazy, I’ve never felt this way but it feels amazing, honestly. I can finally understand the proper human connection. I’ve been working on my toxic behaviour for a while and I need to admit that I’ve started noticing some changes: - I’ve talked with a lot of random lonely people who approached me and I tried to lighten them up and just listen to them. - I’ve become much kinder to my friends. - I’ve supported my friends when they had a lot of problems - I’ve become less bitter and jealous. I still have those urges to make fun of others or humiliate them but I absolutely don’t do any cruel shit anymore and it does not give me satisfaction.I fucking hate seeing people struggle. Especially homeless people or lonely people who are left alone by everyone. I fucking hate seeing people who are insecure or feel worthless. I realised that if you want to start recovery from NPD, you need to stop behaving like the centre of the world. No one gives a fuck about you but YOU can make a change in the world by behaving better. The abuse, verbal or nonverbal, is absolutely useless. It doesn’t benefit you socially, mentally or in any way. Close relationships with others are soooo beautiful and fulfilling. So the only thing you gotta do is not fuck it up..
    I read that other post that asked whether narcissists can love. And while people seemed to agree they can't, no one seemed able to describe what that love is supposed to be like. But if you don't even know how something looks like or is supposed to be, how do you want to judge yourself of not being capable of it? Or could it be that there isn't just narcissists and normal people and that the world isn't that black and white, but that everyone has their own expectations for how a relationship and love should look like and in the end it all comes down to compatibility, compromise and communication?That being said, I want to know how that real love is supposed to be. Only then I may able to learn it.Simple question. Doesn’t matter whether you’ve been diagnosed with NPD or simply have narcissistic traits (which all humans have to some extent).- What narcissist traits and behaviors do you show that you and your relationships are suffering from? - How do you manage or deal with them? Both long term strategies and short term actions. - Have you been successful?. I have a lot of MP3 on my computer. All of them are dance, electronic, house, techno, etc. They have artist and title, at least in the filename, often also in the tags.What I need is the genre at least. Even better would be to also get cover art, mood, keys etc. Is there any tool that does that? Similar to what Kodi and Plex can do for movies and TV shows.. Have you encountered any countries/places that you found better for meeting interesting people and making friends than other places?I’m from a country that regularly is labeled as not friendly by expats because it’s so difficult to meet people and make friends. I’m living in a country where locals and many expats don’t share similar culture, interests, education, career and world views, so even though I manage to meet people here I’m struggling finding friends and making deeper connections. To put it bluntly, I miss people who are interested in economy, politics, etc. and who you can have an interesting discussion with because they genuinely stay abreast of those topics. I’m craving those evening with a bottle of wine discussing what’s happening in the world, and I feel like I won’t be able to find it where I am.After my breakup one of the things I realized is that I don’t do much with my life other than working my ass off, and that I only had my ex when she broke up. I received promotion after promotion but with each one I worked more and longer and became more stressed. Then Covid made my soccer buddies move back home, so I didn’t do anything else than working long hours and then chilling at home. Time spent with my ex was dinners or spas. On the other hand I never clinged on her. She had all the space she wanted, more than I liked. We rarely saw each other. And sometimes I get the impression that we humans are expected to have an Instagram-life where we at least have to be a semi-professional surfer, play the piano, hit the gym five days a week, and build space ships or write novels in between. So simple question: how much of a life does your partner need to have? Is someone who likes to chill — Netflix, restaurants, spas, reading — really so unattractive?. Please also include age, gender, relationship status (if you’re comfortable) for context. At the beginning of the year I got into a bad burnout and anxiety at work. Woke up every night worrying and questioning. Then my gf broke up with me. It crushed me and I fell into a big hole. Panic attacks; anxiety over things I never was scared about; multiple visits to the ER because I thought I had a heart attack; etc. Some time during that time I developed tinnitus. I believe it was around the same time when I tried a CPAP machine for sleep. I did a sleep study which showed that I have mild sleep apnea when sleeping on the back. Since I didn’t sleep well during that time I thought I give it a try but it just made things worse because I slept even less and was more of a walking zombie the next day. I stopped after four days. I’m not sure if it’s really related to this or not. Symptoms:- Tinnitus mostly on the right ear (though sometimes feels like both ears)- Feeling of pressure on both ears (like on an airplane) - Cracking feeling/sound when swallowing against the ear pressure I went to the ENT who cleaned my ears from excess wax and did a hearing test. He said the test was largely fine with a small bit of hearing loss in some frequencies (he showed me some graph). He also looked into my nose and ears and prescribes nose spray, antihistamines and ginkgo biloba which I’ve been taking for six weeks without any improvement. Mentally/emotionally I’m doing much better than some months ago. I started therapy (online and in person); journaling; reconnecting with old friends and family members; spending time outside; regular exercise; change of diet; better sleep; reading; removing social media; cleaning up and decorating my place; cooking for myself; taking time off from work; reflecting and engaging with myself; planning some travels; and fortunately things at work also improved a lot.But I still wake up during the night around the same time. I’m not sure if this is still because of anxiety/depression, or if I just got used to it, or if it’s the tinnitus now. I’m getting a bit hopeless reading that a tinnitus that’s been lasting for some months will likely never go away. I also worry that I might have brain cancer or something like that. Around 1.5 years ago I got sick from what my ex and I thought was a food poisoning. I was sick for a week but my eyes/vision got slightly impaired (I’m suddenly far-sighted and see an almost unnoticeable bit of double vision that only gets slightly worse when feeling stressed). I went to several eye doctors and neurologists (including Neuro-Ophthalmologists) but all said my eyes itself are fine and it might be just migraine or something that can’t be explained._TL;DR Ex (F35) broke up with me (M40) five months ago. I went through deep anxiety and depression but started to improve my life. How do I know when I should start dating again?_My ex broke up with me five months ago. I went through hell. It was so bad, I had panic attacks and anxiety about all sorts of things; I even developed anxiety of heights as I feared I may lose my mind and turn suicidal. I felt uncomfortable in elevators. I went to the ER six times because I thought I was about to get a heart attack. I developed tinnitus. But I also turned my life around. I started therapy (online and in person); journaling; reconnecting with old friends and family members; spending time outside; regular exercise; change of diet; better sleep; reading; removing social media; cleaning up and decorating my place; cooking for myself; taking time off from work; reflecting and engaging with myself; planning some travels; and fortunately things at work also improved a lot. I’m back on my feet and feeling much, much better now. That being said, I still feel regrets over the breakup sometimes. And I haven’t developed enough of a social life and friendships yet that would provide me enough sense of belonging. But those things may take a long time. And I’m not getting younger either. I want to grow old with the right person. And I’m picky too. Some friends tell me it’s too early simply because it’s just been five months, as if there’s a fixed timeframe you have to stay single after a breakup. So how long should I wait after a breakup? How much should I have worked on myself before starting to date again? How do I know the right moment?. My ex broke up with me five months ago. I went through hell.

How much should I have worked on myself before starting to date again? How do I know the right moment?. TL;DR I believe a bad phase of depression and anxiety may have caused me tinnitus. I have not taken anti-depressants and my am feeling much better mentally and emotionally. Not sure whether I should give anti-depressants a try. At the beginning of the year I started to develop a burnout at work. I woke up every night with hopelessness and worries and self doubts but also felt like that during the. Some weeks later my gf broke up with me and said things that I believe were supposed to be helpful but crushed me. I developed anxiety that I’ll die alone because I’m a monster unable to build connections and relationships. I wasn’t suicidal but became paranoid that maybe one moment I might turn suicidal. Rooftop bars or the condo balcony of my friend on the 34th floor or even elevators caused me slight panic attacks. I got scared that certain medicines may cause me to get suicidal or schizophrenic.I went to the ER six times because I thought I had a heart attack. They did all sorts of tests over and over again and I even paid for a CTA scan of the heart. Everything was fine physically. But I continued to have severe anxiety. I barely slept. The moment I was about to fall asleepI felt I’m suffocating. This caused me to be a walking zombie the next day. I lost a lot of weight. I had moments of a heavy head and my vision getting darker. Eventually I developed tinnitus and pressure on my ears like you have on a flight. That was about two months ago. Since then I’m actually feeling much better. I never took anti-depressants through this whole time and also declined all the benzos the doctors throw at you for your anxiety. Since I wasn’t suicidal and still managed to function I thought it’s not warranted. Instead, I did therapy (online and in person); journaling; reconnecting with old friends and family members; spending time outside; regular exercise; change of diet; better sleep; reading; removing social media; cleaning up and decorating my place; cooking for myself; taking time off from work; reflecting and engaging with myself; planning some travels; and fortunately things at work also improved a lot. I’m feeling much, much better now. Not 100% cured but almost? And I’m keeping all those healthy behaviors. Unfortunately the tinnitus didn’t go away. And I still have days where I’m having regrets over the breakup and feelings of anxiety over a future spent in loneliness. Even though I join social events to meet new people I feel like I don’t connect with them and this worries me. I still have a low self esteem and am not a super happy person. I also realized that maybe a low-grade depression and anxiety has been building up even before the burnout and the breakup due to some health issues that I had over the past four years. So I’m wondering if I should take antidepressants now. I don’t really like the idea and it seems counter-intuitive to do it now that I’m feeling better. But I’m worrying that this tinnitus may other not go away. Unfortunately the place I’m in isn’t the best for mental health problems. There are a handful of English speaking therapists and there are the psychiatrists who don’t do anything else than putting you on antidepressants or benzos. So I’m asking here. Any thoughts? Is there the possibility of a low dosage antidepressant therapy?. I’m living abroad and a friend of mine back home met a girl there who turned out to have a friend here who used to live in my home country and even study some semesters at my university there. She speaks my language which is impressive and works as an interpretator, translator and language teacher. My friend and his girl connected me with her in a messenger some days ago. I don’t have a photo there but she has. She knows my name and job and some bits about my background (that I speak her language and have been living here for a while already and that I used to live and study in the same place where she used to live). She seems really nice and we want to meet in person. I’m wondering whether it’s a red flag that she never asked for a photo but that we text every day including a good morning and good night. I don’t reply much during the day because of work and she doesn’t bomb me with texts either when I don’t reply. Our texts aren’t flirting but about what we’ve been doing and what we are doing in life in general. But she keeps the texting going a bit more than me. Should I consider it a red flag?TL;DR F30 keeps texting with me (M40) even though she’s never seen my photo.I work for a well-known multinational, have a big title, and take home 150k USD p.a. while living in an exotic country with low income tax and cost of living.

And I guess that's what's holding me back---I've never been a risk-taker and have always been looking at job safety and saving/investing for retirement, and it scares me to take the risk of failing and ending up with a low paying job.* List all the qualities and behaviors you expect from your partner in a romantic relationship.* Assume that if it's not on the list, it's not part of the relationship.* Try to be detailed.

    Hi. Ich W (33) möchte mich doch mal vorstellen. Vor allen würden mich aber Erfahrungen interessieren, denn ja irgendwie komme ich nicht mit den Dingen klar die geschehen sind. Irgendwie fühle ich mich alleine und sitzen gelassen und immer noch völlig inkompatibel in der "Welt" zu leben. Es belastet mich nach wie vor enorm. Ich hatte fest vor dieses Kapitel abzuschließen, mir zu sagen dass ich das Leben gewählt habe und es im Grunde auch nie etwas zu verlieren gab.Ich habe unter dieser Gemeinschaft meine ganze Kindheit verbracht, wurde von meinen Eltern immer überall mitgeschleppt und mir wurde stehts eine angeblich heile Welt vorgespielt. Immer waren wir alle Brüder und Schwestern, obwohl wir uns gegeneinander teils absolut nicht leiden konnten. Es war normal dass man nett und zuvorkommend zu wem war und später in deren Abwesenheit mit anderen über sie gelästert hat. Es war normal dass man Menschen dafür abgewertet hat dass sie vielleicht weniger im Dienst gingen oder von ihren Ehepartner verlassen wurden. Es war okay plötzlich die besten Freunde auszuschließen, für vermeintlich einfachste vergehen. Mir wurde beigebracht dass Homosexualität etwas ganz schlimmes wäre und wie man diese am besten verachtet. Es wurde geklatscht wenn es alle taten, egal ob es einen gefiel oder nicht. Jeden Freitag wurde etwas aus den Unterredungsbuch besprochen, quasi die Manipulationsanleitung für die Öffentlichkeit. Ständig wurde so getan als ob der Dienst für Jehovas das einzig Wahre wäre und der heilige Geist einen stets stärken würde wenn wir nur daran glauben. Es war schlecht zu masturbieren, denn Jehova möge sowas nicht. Wenn man in der Schule gemobbt geschlagen und ausgeschlossen wurde, dann lag es nie an mir selbst, nein es lag daran dass ich eine Zeugin Jehovas war. Alles was ich gemacht habe war negativ, nie gut genug. Im ernst, diese Gesellschaft hat mich geprägt und das stark im negativen.Im Gegensatz zu meinen Geschwistern hatte ich keine Freunde, sondern war stehts ein Anhängsel was mitgeschleppt wurde. Sehr negativ für mich war meine Berufsausbildung, wo mein Ausbilder ebenfalls ein Zeuge Jehovas war. Es war die schlimmste Zeit in meinen Leben, in der ich lernte was es bedeutet Menschen tief zu hassen. Ich war nie gut und es wurde so viel von einen gefordert und Druck aufgebaut der mich zu eine absolute Einzelgängerin machte die einfach nur um ihr Leben kämpfte. Mein Vater meint heute dass er mich ja so unterstützt hätte und es ja so mein Wunsch gewesen wäre dass ich das mache. Er verdreht es so sehr dass es mich aggressiv macht. Er, genau er war es der mir sagte dass er mit Schmach rechnet wenn ich es nicht schaffe und dass ich es durchziehen soll. Sein Spruch "mit Schmach kann er leben" bezog sich auf die Versammlung. Ständig bekam man die Verantwortung dass das eigene Verhalten alle beeinflusst. Ständig hab ich mich schlecht gefühlt, weil ich nie das sein konnte was von mir verlangt wurde.Eigentlich habe ich mit 22 gedacht dass wenn ich mich Löse, ich es lerne wirklich ich selbst zu sein und zu leben. Inzwischen habe ich alle Bibeln und Religiösen Bücher zerrissen und wollte sie nicht mehr sehen. Ich habe endlich angefangen zu schauen was ich an Kleidung, Hobbys mag ohne mich dafür zu schämen.Was soll ich sagen?Meine Eltern sind nach wie vor aktiv. Sie haben mir auch später noch mehrfach gezeigt wie unwichtig ich ihnen bin. Ich kann ihnen nicht mehr vertrauen und sehe sie vielleicht ein mal im Jahr. Eine Zeit lang habe ich noch mit meinen Vater über Whats App geredet, aber eigentlich nur auf die "wie gehts, wie ist das Wetter?" Basis. Immer wenn ich versuche mehr preiszugeben wertet er mich konsequent ab. Meine Geschwister sind beide ebenfalls aus der Gemeinschaft raus, aber keiner hält wirklich noch mit mir Kontakt. Meine Schwester ist verheiratet und hat Kinder. Von ihrer Hochzeit mit einen völlig unbekannten wusste ich erst 2 Wochen nach dem sie geschehen war, davor dachte ich dass sie und ich uns gemeinsam unterstützen und stehts in allen vertrauen würden. Sie zog weiter weg und der Kontakt wurde immer weniger. Mein Bruder und ich waren früher nach meinen Erinnerungen wirklich eng verbunden. Heute sind wir wie Tag und Nacht und er scheint es vergessen zu haben dass ich überhaupt existiere.Die Familie wäre ja eine Sache, aber die andere für mich viel deprimierende Seite ist dass ich mich nie wirklich irgendwo integrieren konnte. Ich habe nie Freundschaften pflegen, geschweige denn irgendwo eine Verbindung aufbauen können. Ich schaffe es kaum mir zu sagen dass es Menschen gibt die mich wirklich mögen. Ich kann nicht wirklich sehen wem ich vertrauen kann und wer mir böses will. Seit 3 Jahren Lebe ich mit meinen Freund zusammen, der meine erste Beziehung und auch meine einzige intime Erfahrung darstellt, weil ich es nie gelernt habe jemanden zu vertrauen, oder was es heißt einen Menschen zu lieben. Er liebt und unterstützt mich, aber wir haben definitiv Probleme wenn es um Nähe geht, da er diese aus welchen Grund auch immer nicht zulassen kann (anderes Laster). Ich bin extrem unzufrieden damit.Beruflich und sozial fühle ich mich wie eine Versagerin. Ich habe versucht mich weiterzubilden und scheitere an den eigenen Ansprüchen. Ich weiß bis heute nicht was meine Berufung früher gewesen wäre. Studieren durfte ich im Gegensatz zu meinen Bruder nicht. Ich vergleiche mich immer wieder, weil genau das früher ein wesentlicher Bestandteil war.Ich habe das Gefühl dass das Leben an mir vorbei zieht. Ich werde älter und bin am Ende kein Stück weiter. Seit einen Jahr bin ich in Psychotherapie und muss sagen dass ich auch jetzt noch kaum wirklich sehe wie ich aus dieser Spirale raus komm. Ich glaube inzwischen dass ich irgendwie lernen muss damit zu leben. Ich kann meine Verhaltensweisen nicht ablegen, ich kann einfach nicht der Mensch sein der ich sein sollte.Ich finde es wirklich schlimm wie wenig es der Gesellschaft interessiert wenn Kinder in totalitären Gemeinschaften aufwachsen müssen und keine Wahl haben. Die psychischen Folgen werden einfach herabgespielt. Es wird so getan als sei es einfach eine Religionsgemeinschaft wie jede andere auch. Es hat sich niemand in der Schule wirklich bemüht mir zu helfen, obwohl klar war dass es mir verdammt schlecht ging.Wie war der Ausstieg bei euch? Fühlt ihr euch wo zugehörig, Zuhause und angekommen?. I've randomly touched on this topic again and again in posts. I always think about the relationship with my partner. Yes, it's a chat story and I thought for a long time whether it belonged here, but I think it's the best place. The best place to understand my thoughts.In one of the recent discussions about relationships and cheating, a lot of things came up.I don't really know if I lack empathy or have other reasons for not understanding it, but it really concerns me.My boyfriend and I have been living together for over 3.5 years now. Somehow it was a damn long and wonderful time, even though I had so many ups and downs and there were several difficulties in our environment, starting with the Corona pandemic that immediately followed, some jealous neighbors and finally the quick death of both of his parents.He now takes over almost all of the household chores without it bothering him. He helps me with my car and all other technical problems. He lends me money when I need something and occasionally gives me gifts. We go on vacation together, sleep in the same bed, kiss and hold each other. Yes, I really benefit a lot from it.From the outside it seems like we're really perfect for each other, but inside me it's building up more and more because unfortunately we're completely missing one thing. Real intimacy and sex. We do it every few months, if at all, and even then I find it unsatisfactory. I overcome myself and talk to him again and again and he apologizes, says he wants to improve, but it hardly changes anything.Now I tell him to his face that I no longer believe that things will ever be different and what can I say, I'm just right so far. I keep wanting to put the gun to his chest, but then some new shit keeps happening. I'm also afraid that when I'm alone again I won't have any help anymore. I still feel completely unattractive and abandoned. I feel trapped in front of everyone. Because you can even be ashamed of masturbation, which in the past simply wasn't a problem if you were alone. I watch him and know that he doesn't masturbate, watch porn or write anywhere with other women. It's no joke that others would scream, I would be happy to finally find the reason. When I ask him, nothing comes up because I don't even know, or that he's so sorry, blah blah.For a while I compensated a lot with Onlyfans, where I always had the excuse of making money. Even if he was really reluctant at first, I at least managed to make him aware of it. Later he helped me take photos, even if only for a short time, and I was hoping that maybe something would change, but nothing happened.The joke is that I wouldn't even have a problem with it. Really not. I would just like to have an open relationship. When I tell him that, he feels bad and gathers the courage to tell me that he doesn't think that's good. I wonder why? Why does it bother him if he doesn't get shit himself?The more I think about it and talk to my therapist about it, I come to a point where I realize that it's different. Because I'll be honest, even with regular intimacy I would probably still desire something else. I am convinced that my dissatisfaction would remain. It wouldn't just be the case with him, it would be with every partner, no matter who I had.Whenever I said it to him, it circled around in my head, because actually I don't just want a higher sex drive from him. I want to be free in the matter and not have to worry about anything.A person who is nice to me and who I always write to in depth at very long intervals tells me that her wife is assexual and that it bothers her. Their alleged solution is a polygamous relationship where there would be a third person. She said that it was something so intimate for her and that she had to fall in love with this person. She could never imagine simple sex.I just can't understand that. What do people get from this loyalty, from these prisons? I would like to know how such motivations come about and why so much is associated with it.If I wrote something like that in r/Advice, they would probably tell me that I should just break up. I just don't understand that either. Why can't it work any other way? And if so, how can I get him to accept it and just trust me?As you can read, this is the first person with whom I have had such a relationship and also the first person with whom I have ever had sex. I don't have the feeling that I'll find someone like him again so quickly, nor that various opportunities will come along that quickly. Now I'm 33 years old and it's driving me crazy. I just feel so bad.The whole thing had always bothered me but I never thought it would trigger me so much. The word "abuse" sounds extremely wrong and dangerous, especially when I have to read and hear from some people that a pwNPD would always be fundamentally abusive. Do people actually understand what kind of word they are using?When I look back on my life, it is full of injuries that shape me to this day and have made me the person I am today. I have forgotten how to show emotions because it always had the worst consequences for me. I have learned to hide things in order to appear as strong as possible. I never got to know the real feeling of what it's like to love someone and be loved in front of everyone.The people around you don't see this pain, no, they deny it or downplay it. They call you a monster that you don't have to deal with.I have hurt people without realizing it. I have also rejected, insulted and put down everyone. I also viewed anyone who tried to help me as an enemy. But I have never, really never caused such serious harm to anyone, neither my life partner nor anyone else. The real damage was to myself.The bad thing is that it is precisely because of sentences like these that it is even more difficult to really look for help and then accept it, because I always think about how the other person can judge me, regardless of whether they are people around me or therapists.I mean this completely and seriously. Everyone who comes to this sub has either experienced it therapeutically or has found a way to reflect on themselves, if only through certain events of others. Otherwise there would be no reason to come here and talk about yourself.I admit that I want attention and validation from others. I own up to the fact that I manipulate people when I see fit. I have no problem saying that I am the most important thing to me. I am more aware and a more honest person. So honest that others despise me and want to destroy me.Anyone who writes that they are lost and forever ashamed should know that even with this step they are much further ahead than most other supposedly healthy people, who are usually no less pathetic.I don't have a regular circle of friends, so I'm always looking for specific people who I think might like me, be it online or in everyday life. It's probably very often the people with whom I initially think that I'm better or at least equal, with whom I think that I can just get involved. Maybe that's exactly what's causing this problem, because no, this isn't some stupid imagination. This is a real and really difficult situation for me. Especially because it keeps bringing me down emotionally.I always come across people who can't achieve anything and then have to try to show that they are so great to me. God, I want to spit in her face.They are usually notorious liars, or people who really convey that what I do is worthless. In retrospect, it's often so stupid that you could actually laugh about it. But I can't because it takes an emotional toll on me in every situation to actually be despised by the other person.Then a naivety is often applied towards me that is simply bottomless. Sometimes I don't understand how so many people have to get themselves into the worst shit and then think I'm going to pull them out of it.I don't know if I get people to do this or if it's really just the rubbish persons who put up with me.Somehow I always thought you needed more self-esteem and then you could develop, but no, it's an act of impossibility. At the moment I just sit at the computer almost every day, listen to music, look at Reddit and am frustrated because I know that I can actually do much more. My creativity seems to be decreasing day by day. It just pisses me off.I have a YouTube channel with a lot of actually active viewers and I know that if I just kept it going it could get a significant increase, but I can't. Just this feeling that everyone can do what I do, but they just can't get beyond it, makes me have a hard time. I don't come up with any really innovative ideas and when I do, I can never really use them anyway.Okay then look for distractions, maybe that will help. Let's move on...PC games, god it's frustrating to see how you can't move forward. “Everyone starts small” is the answer, fuck you all!Even simple games that I play with my boyfriend are no different. He wins, I quit because it's no use.I always had the idea of doing some kind of sport. You have to learn that too and then you will never be the best, let alone worth mentioning.The whole thing sounds ridiculous. Every person always comes up with the same standard, disabled answer that doesn't help anyone. I don't give a damn that no one can do everything well, it would be enough for me to find one damn thing.I limit myself more and more, I start to isolate myself and I fight against it every day. I hoped it would get better and yes I tried really hard to give a better perspective on the things I do. I want to appreciate it and just be proud, but no, it's getting worse.EDIT: I have to add how shitty it is when you actually tell therapists this and they just dismiss it, looking askance as if it's so abnormal, as if this feeling is just made up and not such a limiting problem.. I keep trying to express myself from the outside in such a way that I get what I want. I always want to stand up for myself, be safe and be understood. Every time I talk about my needs, I become embarrassed, dishonest or just talk in riddles, as if there is a wall in front of me saying the right thing. I always keep an eye on the supposed consequences that this entails. I'm always ashamed of it. God I hate it.I somehow thought that I would have just left it at the first thread, but to be honest, it really doesn't let me go. I see that the text is long and at the same time my English is so bad that I don't know if I really have the right wording everywhere. Unfortunately, I can no longer check this properly due to the volume of the text. I think he just belongs here. I think this is one of the most open things I have ever said here and I would be happy if someone reads it.It's really hard for me to summarize like that and somehow it's just embarrassing for me now. The last few days my head has been spinning more and more and I have doubts about everyone, about myself and about every place I go. I have the feeling that I often just start looking for an answer, even where there might not be one at all, let alone one is necessary, things that no normal person thinks about, that maybe just every person goes through. Still, I can't accept that, no, what I experience is always different and always worse than anyone else's. I consider myself to be competent and completely uninfluenceable, but then I keep noticing how I allow myself to be infected. Wow, it pisses me off to be so susceptible to all kinds of dirt, be it various scams or topics that I pick up. It hurts, it really just hurts to be so stupid and stupid, so dependent and childish. I really don't like admitting that. I can't admit it no matter where I am and at the same time I notice more and more how I'm driving myself into shit and at some point I no longer know what it's all about. I've done a lot of nonsense and I just can't get away from this crap. Sometimes I wish I was on a deserted island where all the impressions were gone, where I could just be “normal” inside.I don't know if you can see what I'm currently seeing doubts and serious problems about. I doubt my own story and it's really difficult for me to describe everything that happened to get to this point. Again and again this loneliness, again and again this rejection of other people and the reprimand of supposedly doing something wrong that I have never done wrong. Always knowing that I don't matter to everyone around me. Always my own failure no matter what I start, always a constant devaluation from others and of course from myself. That just hurts. I can't live with that, not without constantly thinking about it and constantly talking about it. Yes, being sick somewhere is becoming more and more my only purpose in life. A fucking vicious circle that no matter what I decide will never be different, as if I would never want it to be any other way.I've had to experience a lot in my past that I have a shitty character, or that I'm simply unstable and different because of my traumatic experiences. Hearing over and over again from your new acquaintances that you should seek help will eventually stay in your head, no matter how hard you try to ignore it. It's extremely difficult for me to see that I need help in certain situations, I'm really ashamed of it and I'm always afraid, afraid that people won't understand the situation or will internally devalue me because I actually want to achieve what I want to do I won't be able to shit alone again. At some point it hit me that I can't feel comfortable like this. At some point I just couldn't deny it anymore and I looked for answers and some of them were extremely strange. At first I thought that coming out as trans would change a lot, but hey, I feel like it's gotten even scarier because yes, I haven't escaped anyone and no, I haven't started a new life in that sense either. New name, new persona, operations, hormones and still the same unbearable personality. Funny. Of course, I distorted my CV in front of a therapist. I somehow wanted everything to fit and wow was I good. She recorded everything and at the end wrote an indication, which mainly consisted of the texts that I personally gave her. Yes, I feel good about what I did, but let's be honest, does what she did speak of competence? What if I were unhappy with that, would she have really differentiated that? As you can imagine, things continued of course, because no, the conflicts within me and with others didn't get any better. During that time, I disappointed more and more people, devalued them and put myself at the top, as if I had poor foresight. In the end everyone ignored me or pitied me. Now came physical worries and fears. I noticed that I was gaining weight slightly due to the hormone therapy. I never considered that it might just have been due to short-term stress. I started looking at other people, realized that I wasn't the thinnest and therefore I'm no different than anyone else. I couldn't accept that. I started losing weight, more and more. My inner focus shifted from one topic to a new one, that of having more and more discipline when eating and worrying more and more about food and my weight. I didn't make any sense of having an eating disorder. I even bragged about it. I went to Pro Ana forums and hoped that I was the thinnest of all and god it was good to see how others wrote about their problems, how they kept having binge eating that didn't work at all for me.Still, it left me less and less satisfied. I became more and more impulsive from the outside and my sister (my only real regular contact at the time) also got a lot of it. It wasn't enough for me, so I had to expand my personal worldview even further and started researching the supposed origins. I went to the family doctor and had myself examined and she introduced me to a gluten-free diet and yes, I was so vulnerable and stupid to just accept it. Of course, I also talked about it and couldn't resist looking into communities and posting how well I had myself under control now and was supposedly fighting my eating disorder. God I hate myself for this.Everyone who had contact with me had to go through this nonsense for a long time. Even my friend had to go through a lot in the first few years. Then suddenly the break. I didn't care about the eating disorder and I just dropped the gluten-free diet from one day on. Somehow my boyfriend helped me to stop being ashamed of doing something so stupid for so long.But of course it shouldn't stay that way. I've repeatedly made comments here about my relationship, but also that I'm still struggling with the same issue mentioned above. In the meantime, there were conflicts with some people who I actually saw as very warm and friendly towards me. One contact in particular at work caught my eye. Because yes, I told him all the crap that came to mind and suddenly we were arguing and I realized that I was losing out. She knew every nonsense about me, the stupidity had no limit and in return I knew nothing about her. If that were the only person I had such a relationship with, everything would be fine, but no, it's really every time, with every fucking person who starts to get closer to me.At the same time, I notice more and more how I provoke people and not just by trolling. I speak and write really disparagingly and always have new situations where I consciously look for supposedly weaker people in order to put them down completely, whenever I see that they supposedly get more attention than I do. Even if people are hated by others and come to me, at some point I push them away, after all they are idiots. I'm creating more and more people who hate me. I don't know if it's my personality or just my shitty instability and lack of acceptance of being happy with myself.And now we finally come to the current situation.I've been seeing a therapist since last year, mind you, behavioral therapy. I'm so annoyed that when I first started looking for it, I never thought about forms of therapy. To be honest, I didn't even know where this journey was supposed to go, let alone how I could even tell something like that without seeming completely stupid. At the same time, I was and still am so torn inside. I just can't take it anymore with all the things I'm doing and going through my head. What I liked about her was that she asked questions directly and I thought she would really think about me, maybe give me a way out, maybe even give me a completely different look at me. After several visits, however, the conversations became more and more one-sided, so that in the end it was only about my family and my brother-in-law, who I absolutely can't stand. We went around in circles. So I wrote like before to make it clear to her that I really wanted more than just small talk and yes I also wrote that I think I'm a narcissist. Well the conversations changed again and she went through the points with me. I was able to confirm a lot of things, but what does that mean? Of course everything applies to me when I think like that. As is usual in this form of therapy, it was hardly really about dealing with things in the past, but only about the current things that affect you in life. Then I thought about depth psychology again, but at the same time I realized how impossible it is to find a therapy place here. Many people reject it outright, saying that my health insurance will then cause problems. It's tiring and at the same time so embarrassing what I've gotten myself into.In the meantime, I've also been dealing with other limitations, such as not being able to get anything done, or being such a mess, and also having so many problems communicating with people. Then I came to the conclusion that I needed to be diagnosed with ADHD. I asked my therapist what her impression was and she said she didn't see anything about it. Nevertheless, I decided to do a diagnosis privately and lo and behold I clearly got the diagnosis.Since then I have been going to her as well as to group therapy. In group therapy I was able to learn a lot about myself and others, which was really good. On the other hand, I have never really been able to absorb the topics and advice. I have the feeling that people are thinking far too simply. At the same time, I also notice how I differ from others, or tell myself so. Topics like envy and mistrust also make themselves felt in me. It seems to be less likely to be recorded, where I think that no one is really interested in you.I think that there has to be more, or rather I am convinced of it and so I go to my therapist, annoyed that I didn't really know where I stood and what sense this therapy actually makes.Now I recently asked her for a statement because I just don't even know what we could work on anymore and I also asked myself whether she was even interested in me and yes, she actually did. I spoke in purely superficial terms and used some empty phrases, things to distract me from my thoughts. But things turned out differently. A session before, she discussed with me a lot about my past and my relationship with my parents, especially my father. Then in the next session she broke everything down, including a lot of what we discussed before and of course what I recorded for her twice. She sees two sides that influence me: instability and strong narcissism. We then went through points and came back to examples of current and former short friendships. I think I left a lasting impression on one in particular. The topic of death seems to affect people more than it does to me. I said how it annoyed me that this person was so bitter in front of me and that it then escalated. It wasn't the only example. I have no idea, but these situations still feel ridiculous to me and I seriously wonder if she's rhyming about it more than she should have. Have I perhaps dramatized the whole thing? As I was saying goodbye to the meeting, I realized that I had left something behind. I can't think of it anymore. Great, you now have the next diagnosis, congratulations.What remains is a negative aftertaste with massive doubts. Is my therapist competent enough? Is what she says true? Is it basically just something I invented again? Is she really not taking me seriously and is she just calling it that? Somehow it's too complex for that.How should things continue now? What should I do? I feel like I'm going deeper and deeper into my own destruction and I don't understand why.Thank you for everyone who read this long text. Thank you for being there.&#x200B;. Actually, I should be happier because I finally managed to get my therapist to analyze me and give me a defacto diagnosis. She sees strong narcissistic parts in me, including a lack of empathy. Added to this is low self-confidence. She had it set up well today, but somehow I can't believe that I'm such a genius who recognizes everything about myself. Before that, I went to a practice regarding my own suspicion of ADHD and here too I received a clear diagnosis. Is this really specialist knowledge, or is it just confirming me so that I can calm down somewhere? Am I so complicated, manipulative that you just take it for granted? I have the feeling that most doctors rely on some tests and of course their own statements. My therapist has known me for more than a year now, but I still don't think she will ever really be able to empathize with what I really experience and how I behave in everyday life. I somehow have the feeling that no matter where I am, there are rarely critical questions where I think someone has the competence to analyze you. I also have enormous doubts about the ADHD diagnosis, although I really tell myself that it was already well evaluated and that it was clearly done by experts. At least on a neurological and psychological basis there seems to be enormous leeway in how the patient is analyzed.Vor ein paar Monaten hatte mal einen Post gemacht wo ich über ein Bewerbungsgespräch geschrieben hab und ja Stolz bin ich noch immer. :)[Ich bin Stolz auf mich... : einfach\_posten (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/einfach_posten/comments/13red47/ich_bin_stolz_auf_mich/)Ich hab dann auch direkt am nächsten Tag für mich eigentlich undenkbar die Zusage bekommen. Umso mehr hab ich mich gefreut endlich eine andere berufliche Perspektive zu haben. Über 12 Jahre waren es nun her, in dem für mich doch irgendwie Stillstand herrschte. Ich bekam selten gute Aufgaben und hatte vor allen extrem viel Leerlauf. Die größeren Unternehmen wo für ich Extern zusammen mit meiner ehemaligen Chefin gearbeitet habe waren toll und man war auch einigermaßen integriert, aber im Detail merkte man dann doch schnell die Unterschiede. So war es 2020 mit der Corona Krise plötzlich voll okay dass mich ein Kunde einfach nicht mehr brauchte. In der Zeit war ich nie wirklich so produktiv, es gab immer wieder mal das ein oder andere aber ich hatte auch das Gefühl dass meine Chefin mich zwar wirklich sehr mochte, aber nicht wirklich was anvertrauen wollte. Den Kunden schien es egal zu sein ob ich wirklich produktiv war oder nicht. Zudem hab ich allerdings auch tatsächlich gerade am Anfang erheblich viele Flüchtigkeitsfehler gemacht und konnte nie wirklich irgendwelche Ratschläge annehmen. Seit diesen Jahr habe ich durch meine ADHS Diagnose auch endlich den Grund dafür gefunden, warum ich so Chaotisch bin, aber in der gesamten Zeit hatte ich nichts davon gewusst und es hat einen schon entsprechend auch stark frustriert. Wie dem auch sei die Zeit dort ist vorbei und ich blicke da schon auch nicht negativ zurück. Habe wirklich auch einige nette Menschen kennen gelernt egal wie Oberflächig und vergänglich doch alles war. Gestört hat mich allerdings auch am Ende auch die Bedingungen, das ich niemanden hatte der irgendwo mich vertreten hätte, außer meiner Chefin. Ich musste mir selbst das Gehalt erkämpfen und es ist klar dass dieses in so einer Konstellation lange nicht besonders gut war, bzw. immer den Tariflöhnen hinterher hängt. Nun war ich gespannt, denn ich habe für mich das unmögliche der Dinge geschafft. Ich hab nicht nur einen neuen Job gefunden, sondern ausgerechnet einen im Öffentlichen Dienst. Dort wo ich immer schwierige Einstellungstests hatte die ich nie bestanden habe. Dort wo ich immer dachte dass man mich wegen der schlechten Zeugnisse eh nicht nimmt. Endlich Gehalt nach Tarif, Home Office Möglichkeit und absolute Flexibilität was die Arbeitszeiten angeht. Ja es ist einfach ein toller Luxus den ich immer haben wollte und jeden beneidet hab der irgendwie es geschafft hat wo fest eingestellt zu sein. Auch das Aufgabengebiet ist endlich komplexer, mehr verschiedene Baustellen und es gibt auch endlich Möglichkeiten an der ein oder anderen Schulung teilzunehmen.Nun ist es da und was soll ich sagen. Die Kollegen sind toll. Wirklich, ich hab noch nie so nette freundliche Kollegen gehabt. Ich hatte noch nie einen so lockeren Vorgesetzten wo es schon fast Kumpelhaft wird. Ich kann mit vielen wirklich tolle Gespräche führen und auch das Alter passt deutlich besser. Früher waren wirklich alle um mich herum ü50. Es ist schon krass zu sehen dass es Kollegen gibt die wirklich mal jünger sind als ich selbst. Was allerdings sehr verwirrend und für mich echt schwierig ist, ist die Arbeit selbst. Besser gesagt die nicht vorhandene Arbeit. Ich sitze hier wirklich nur rum, es gibt nichts. Ich frage und bekomme zur Antwort "schauen sie mal da und da im Intranet" irgendwann hat man genug davon angesehen. Dann kann man sich mit der Datenbank beschäftigen. Zudem war am Anfang überall noch nicht mal ein Zugang vorhanden. Ein paar Miniaufgaben habe ich tatsächlich dann doch für eine andere Abteilung machen können, aber dann wieder das übliche. Immer wieder kommt mal ein Kollege und fragt ob ich kurz da und da mal schauen könnte, er bringt mir das im Laufe des Tages. Passieren tut dann allerdings nichts. Frage ich nach bekomme ich zu hören dass das entweder doch keine Eile hat oder es sich von selbst geklärt hat. Ich sitze den ganzen Tag am Schreibtisch, habe die Tür offen, begrüße jeden der an mir vorbei geht und bin hier auf Reddit unterwegs um Texte wie diesen hier zu verfassen. Anhand der Fülle des Textes sollte meine große Kapazität erkennbar sein. Früher bekam ich schon so wenig dass man wirklich von einer Unterforderung sprechen kann. Ich hatte aber trotzdem gerade bei langweiligen gleichbleibenden doch durchaus auch mal Motivation wenn ich wusste dass es etwas sichtbar Produziertes gab und sei es nur eine Überarbeitung einer Excelliste, oder Ablage von Dateien. Früher waren es 1-2h Arbeit am Tag, heute sind es gut wird 2h in der Woche. Habe nun mehr Geld, weniger Fahrerei, vielleicht bald auch mehr Sicherheit aber dieser Fluch ist geblieben. Zeitweise genieße ich ihn aber auch, einfach weil ich inzwischen auch echt Angst habe das genaue Gegenteil zu erleben. Fakt ist dass ich auch früher selbst angefangen habe mich ständig auf der Arbeit mit anderen Dingen zu beschäftigen, weil ich mich einfach nicht auf die Sache konzentrieren konnte. Das machte mir auch jetzt wieder Angst dass ich es so richtig verhauen könnte. Ich hab es echt mittlerweile verlernt wirklich zu Arbeiten. Vielleicht suche ich mir wirklich auch nur noch so etwas aus. Vielleicht will ich es gar nicht anders. Ist es vielleicht doch in unserer Gesellschaft mittlerweile die eigentliche Normalität und besteht unsere gesamte Wirtschaft tatsächlich großenteils aus Bullshit Jobs?. Ich habe im Mai mir eine Amex Payback geholt und seit etwas über 1 Monat nun auch eine BMW Card. Mir ging es vor allen dabei ums Cashback, aber auch um eine Karte zu haben die man z.B. für einen Leihwagen benutzen kann. Bin damit ansich auch zufrieden. Anfangs hatte ich auch einen echt erstaunlichen Kreditramen von über 10.000€, den ich natürlich nie hätte nutzen wollen, da ich sie wirklich nur für die alltäglichen Ausgaben nutze und auch streng drauf achte dass diese Summe immer auf dem Konto bereit liegt.Dann hatte ich jedoch plötzlich eine Mittleilung von AMEX das meine Karten vorzeitig zur Überprüfung gesperrt wären und ich Kontoauszüge nachreichen soll dass ein entsprechendes Gehalt vorliegt. Gesagt getan und nach ca. 7 Tagen (die haben sich wirklich mächtig Zeit gelassen) konnte ich die Karten auch endlich wieder nutzen. Interessant aber dass mein Kreditramen auf 4500€ heruntergesetzt wurde. Letzte Woche habe ich mir gedacht dass ich mir doch mal lieber eine Schufa Auskunft holen sollte und sie da die Amex hat dafür gesorgt das mein Score von 97,25% auf 93,16% gefallen ist. Was meint ihr ist dieser Verfall normal? Sollte ich dagegen vorgehen oder wird sich das im Laufe der Zeit wieder zum positiven ändern? Ich weiß dass man nun die Möglichkeit hat mehr Geld zu bekommen als man besitzt. Ich würde aber niemals diese Funktion so nutzen und es ging mir wirklich nur um die Zahlungsabwicklung und den Vorteilen die aus den Karten enstehen.. Vor kurzen habe ich überlegt ein Wasserbett zu kaufen und hier nach Erfahrungen gefragt. Die Reaktionen waren recht gemischt. [https://www.reddit.com/r/einfach\_posten/comments/15lbq1h/hat\_jemand\_von\_euch\_erfahrung\_mit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/einfach_posten/comments/15lbq1h/hat_jemand_von_euch_erfahrung_mit/)Wirklich abgeschreckt war ich dennoch nicht, also musste ich doch mal schauen was es so auf den Markt gibt. Erstes Problem so wie ich das dachte einfach nur die Matratze ändern ist schwierig, da in der Größe die wir bei unseren vorhandenen Bettgestell hatten lediglich eine Einzelmatratze möglich ist. Dann der Preis, die Dinger sind irgendwie viel zu teuer, dafür dass man sie am Ende nicht einmal mehr wirklich zurückgeben kann. Die Idee mit den Gebrauchtmarkt war allerdings nicht schlecht. Was ich ganz klar aber sagen muss, die Betten, die dort angeboten werden sind teilweise richtig alt und auch nicht so gut gepflegt wie sie sein sollten. So wie das manche behaupten, von wegen alle würden versuchen sie neu wieder los zu werden, ist es nicht. Das Erste was wir uns angeschaut haben war entsprechend grässlich und ich habe danach wirklich gedacht dass ich definitiv keins mehr holen möchte. Dann hab ich aber tatsächlich noch ein Boxspringbett gefunden was wirklich wie neu war und erst dieses Jahr gekauft wurde. Der Grund warum es verkauft wurde war eine Wohnungsauflösung.Das Abbauen und der Transport ging super, auch wenn ich jetzt etwas mehr aufpassen würde dass man die einzelnen Kerne weniger knickt und wirklich alles an Restwasser rausnimmt. Ganz wichtig auch vor dem Aufbau gut Putzen, vor allen schauen dass keine Sandkörner drauf sind. Dafür gab es auf Amazon aber ein gutes Reinigungsset mit Vinylreiniger Tüchern und Conditioner. Das Befüllen war mit dem Schlauch echt simpel. Das hab ich mir komischerweise viel komplizierter vorgestellt. Die Wassermengen sind aber schon irgendwie nicht ohne und es wirkt wirklich erstmal seltsam auf so ein auf dem ersten Blick windiges Ding "Vinylbeutel" mit derart großen Wassermassen aufzufüllen. Jetzt nach 2 Tagen steht es aber immer noch prima und irgendwie hab ich auch kein schlechtes Gefühl mehr damit. Geschlafen hab ich tatsächlich auch gut bisher. Was nun etwas schwieriger ist, ist sich zu drehen, aber man gewöhnt sich daran doch recht schnell.Die Luft hat man auch recht gut rausbekommen, sogar ohne dass man einen Entlüfter hat (soll noch nachgeschickt werden, mal schauen). Gluckern tut da wenig und wenn dann so minimal dass das eigentlich ein tolles Gefühl ist. Es ist irgendwie lustig wenn es doch etwas plätschert obwohl man völlig im trockenen ist. Zurzeit bereue ich es nicht. :). Ich und mein Freund wollen/müssen nun doch mal unsere schon sehr alte Federkernmatratze austauschen und irgendwie kamen wir auf die verrückte Idee statt eine Federkern-, eine Wasserbettmatratze zu kaufen.Ich weiß noch wie diese früher immer in den Läden und Ausstellungen vorgeführt wurden und als Kind hab ich mir irgendwie nichts mehr gewünscht als im Zimmer so ein Bett zu haben. :)Jetzt wo man die Mittel und auch die absolute Entscheidungsgewalt hat würde ich es doch mal gerne wagen so etwas auszuprobieren.Gibt es von euch jemanden der so etwas privat bei sich zuhause hat, bzw. hatte? Wie sind eure Erfahrungen damit? Worauf sollte man hier bei besonders achten?.

Gibt es von euch jemanden der so etwas privat bei sich zuhause hat, bzw. hatte? Wie sind eure Erfahrungen damit? Worauf sollte man hier bei besonders achten?. Heute bekam ich den Brief wo vor ich schon lange ein mulmiges Gefühl habe und ja es ist nun soweit auch ich wäre eine potentielle Erbin für meinen verstorbenen "Onkel". Ich hatte mit diesen Menschen nie auch nur im Ansatz etwas zu tun. Er kannte mich wahrscheinlich auch gar nicht so wie die ganzen anderen im Suff versinkenden A... die ich damals mit besuchen musste, aber nie sich näher mit mir beschäftigt haben. Der Typ war geisteskrank, hat sich mehrfach versucht umzubringen und ist dann später in einen betreuten Wohnen gekommen wo er nichts anderes als geraucht und sich zu Tode gesoffen hat. Natürlich schlagen alle das Erbe aus und nun kommt dieser Müll zu mir und allen anderen Nichten und Neffen, toll. Ich kann nun 30-70€ für eine Person bezahlen mit der ich nichts im Leben gemeinsam hatte, außer Stress und Scham. Ich denke in nächster Zeit werden noch weitere abkratzen und mich ebenfalls damit "beglücken". Andere haben immer eine große Verwandtschaft, tolle Großeltern, Tanten, Onkels, Nichten, Neffen und auch wenn sie sich vielleicht nicht immer mögen doch irgendwo einen gewissen Rückhalt. Sie erben Häuser, Vermögen. Manche brauchen eigentlich gar keine Sorgen haben, egal was ihnen im Leben passiert, egal wie sehr sie alles in den Ruin treiben. Ich dagegen hatte eine Oma die ich nie kennen gelernt hab, eine andere die uns gehasst hat. Ein Opa der erst völlig mittellos von meinen Eltern im Altersheim gebracht wurde und ich 1 Jahr lang sehen konnte. Ein anderer hat gesoffen und unserer Familie gedroht. Selbst mit seinen Tod versuchte er die ganze Familie zu enterben. Immerhin da hatten meine Eltern kapital bekommen. Mit den Tanten, Onkels habe ich keinen Kontakt mehr und früher auch nur in schlimmster Erinnerung. Die eine Seite hatte null Interesse an einen die andere wie der obere Fall. Ich scheiße auf diese Familie und habe auch nichts was ich in diesen Bezug vermissen würde. Was die Erbgeschichte angeht fühl ich mich allerdings in vielerlei Hinsicht wirklich verarscht. Wieso wird es einen so schwer gemacht ein Erbe einfach abzulehnen, besonders wenn es gar keinen echten Bezug zu mir gab? Wie kann es so kacken dreist erlaubt sein noch zu behaupten dass es für die Ausschlagung "keine Gründe" gebe, obwohl meine Mutter ganz klar eine mögliche Verschuldung angegeben hat. Der Staat kassiert sich von jeder Person Geld bis sie den Taugenichts irgendwie wieder bezahlt bekommt. Wieso muss ich für so einen Menschen bürgen?. Ich hab seit letzte Woche erst mit Medikamenten angefangen, also sind meine Erfahrungen noch sehr gering. Mein Arzt hat gemeint dass wir mit Atomoxetin (Beta Pharm) anfangen sollten und in 6 Wochen wieder nachschauen. Anfangen soll ich mit 10mg und dann Wöchentlich bis 40mg steigern. Soweit so gut. Ich gebe zu ich war und bin etwas skeptisch, sowohl was die Wirkung angeht und ob ich wirklich dauerhaft dieses Medikament nehmen möchte. An sich klang es für mich trotzdem vielversprechend und ich fände es auch schön wenn es wirklich irgendwann entsprechend wirken und mir helfen könnte. Ich weiß auch dass die Wirkung erst frühestens in 4 Wochen bemerkbar sein soll.Was mir seit dem aber radikal auffällt ist dass ich immer müder und noch hibbeliger bin als zuvor. Eigentlich spaziere ich immer gerne, Mittags aber auch gerne mitten in der Nacht. Seit letzter Woche aber muss ich mich stark zu prügeln. Auch die Treppen fallen mir immer schwerer. Es ist noch kein großes Drama, aber es nervt mich schon und fällt mir einfach auf. Früher kannte ich das immer bei einen starken Eisenmangel. Allerdings nehme ich seit Monaten nun Eisentabletten und fühlte mich damit eigentlich gut. ich weiß nicht ob ich mir das einbilde und die Ursache vielleicht ganz woanders liegt, aber momentan vermute ich immer mehr dass es vom Atomoxetin kommt. Wie sind eure Erfahrungen damit, habt ihr das auch so verspürt? Wenn ja, meint ihr dass das mit weiterer Einnahme wieder besser wird?. A really serious question. I've been busy all the time with the factors that ensure that people always seem to give me a huge berth. I think that many actually find me interesting and that there is a certain potential there. I actually always have the feeling that I'm well received at first and that I look nice. However, there seems to be something that I can't change. I've heard this from some people and I have to be honest that it frustrates me enormously. One recently wrote to me that he was in awe of me, partly afraid. I get not a more detailed explanation than that. My appearance is attractive and somehow I think so. Especially when I was shooting videos, I could really notice that for myself. People are first attracted and then scared by what I reflect and radiate. What can it really be and how can I fix it? Do you have similar experiences?. Hallo ihr lieben! Letzte Woche habe ich meine Diagnose erhalten und würde gerne Möglichkeiten finden mich medikamentös weiter behandeln zu lassen. Bei der Praxis wo ich war wäre es angeblich für mich möglich wenn ich die Einstellung wie auch die Diagnostik davor privat leiste. Die Medikamente würden dann mit der Kasse abgerechnet. Habe auf weiterer Anfrage bisher noch keine Antwort und auch so leider keinen blassen Schimmer wie viele Termine und vor allen Kosten auf mich zu kämen. Ich hätte gerne irgendwie die Möglichkeit eine Praxis zu finden die das ganze auch inkl. den Sitzungen auf Kassenleistung macht. Leider erscheint mir das hier im Rhein Main Gebiet nahezu unmöglich. Habt ihr eine Idee was ich machen könnte, oder habt ihr vielleicht sogar Adressen aus der Umgebung?. This post just kind of jumped out of my heart. I don't know if he belongs here and to what extent it's more part of my disorder. It's something that's been bothering me for a long time and at rare times like now I just really notice it. I feel uninteresting and somehow unimportant to the people around me, maybe repulsive? In any case, I notice that most of the conversations I have only arise when I complain, I'm a bit depressed, I see no more ways. People then seem to turn on their helper syndrome. I then suddenly have people who are interested in me, who encourage me or even attack me and are annoyed by me, but they react. I suddenly become interesting. I often talked to my therapist about my self-worth and somehow I started trying to see things in a more positive light, or to somehow give it some importance. In fact, more positive things than bad things have happened lately. A few months ago I was determined to jump off a tall building and end my misery. In the meantime I have found a small ray of hope and somehow realized that I can go further. I suddenly felt success in certain things. Something I had never really allowed myself. At the same time, however, I have felt lonelier than ever in the last few days and weeks and when I talk to the same contacts about it, they withdraw because I am fine. Somehow this is extremely frustrating for me. I have the feeling that I have to stay the way I am, with all the negative thoughts, hate and anger. If I don't then I'm completely irrelevant air.Das mag nun wie eine Bagatelle klingen aber ich hatte heute wohl das beste Vorstellungsgespräch was ich jemals geführt habe. Zum ersten mal habe ich mich nicht verhaspelt oder aus der Reserve locken lassen. Normalerweise war es immer so dass mich schon eine Personalerin völlig verunsichert hat und wenn ich dann mit 4 oder gar 5 Leuten an einen Tisch sitzen musste einfach verstummt bin. Ich fing an mich für alles zu schämen, alles was ich sagen will zu vergessen, an mir jeden vermeintlichen Fehler zu sehen und mich selbst nur noch um Kopf und Kragen zu reden. Die Begebenheiten waren dieses mal eigentlich überhaupt nicht anders. Es war wieder ein großer Besprechungsraum und alles hätte wieder genauso enden können. Habe es aber tatsächlich geschafft. Ich bin über meinen Schatten gesprungen und wirkte alles andere als verklemmt. Merke zum ersten mal bewusst wie offen und Selbstbewusst ich sein kann. Egal wie das nun ausgeht, ob ich wie immer eine Absage bekomme oder nicht ich freu mich gerade einfach das geschafft zu haben.EDIT: Unglaublich, ich habe eine Zusage bekommen.. Keine Ahnung ob das nun hier rein passt. Letztes Jahr, Ende Oktober habe ich die Therapie angefangen und war erst wirklich zuversichtlich und erleichtert dass ich doch noch recht zeitig wo einen Platz gefunden habe. Die "Euphorie" aber verflog nun schnell, weil die Gespräche gefühlt immer einseitiger wurden und ich langsam auch stark an der Kompetenz zweifle. Hatte zwei mal versucht es über lange E-Mails irgendwie offener zu gestalten, mir selbst gesagt dass ich vielleicht auch einfach nicht richtig kommunizieren kann, bzw. alles was mir irgendwie innerlich weh tut verberge. Es gab ein paar etwas konstruktivere Sitzungen danach, aber sehr schnell merke ich wie es am Ende wieder zum selben Muster abdriftet. Frage mich mittlerweile auch wohin sowas überhaupt führen soll. Meine Ängste nimmt es nicht, mehr Selbstwert kann ich bisher auch nicht bekommen, eine Perspektive kann ich mir auch nicht daraus erarbeiten, nur weil eine Person mich alle paar Wochen mal eine Stunde sieht. Mir geht es gefühlt nicht ansatzweise besser und ich habe nicht das Gefühl dass sich das damit jemals ändern kann. Ich bin fest entschlossen es ihr ins Gesicht zu sagen, dass ich keinen weiteren Sinn darin sehe, ich es ehrlich sogar bescheuert finde. Hat jemand schon mal ähnliche Erfahrungen? Wie seit ihr damit umgegangen?. I know there are a lot of undiagnosed people here and I'm no different here, although I would like to try to at least look at facts rather than personal feelings. To claim that someone only has an NPD with a diagnosis is somehow also pointless, to think that one does not become aware of this topic oneself, question oneself through certain scenarios and realize that there seems to be something to it, or how do you see this?What is your opinion on this, especially on the point that you can get bogged down with it yourself?I myself would actually like to have a truth, to somehow have exactly what is clearly there confirmed. If a therapist could explain to me that this is not the case for me and give me a concrete diagnosis (whatever there will be), I would actually try to consider it as possible and also accept it, as long as it is not completely far away from good and bad.Now comes the problem, it doesn't happen because no one is really willing to really delve deeply into me, or maybe they just can't.I think there are a handful of people who can do that, but reaching them is difficult and even then the question would be whether they can understand another subject at all, if they must to have than. Here in Germany we have a health insurance company that also pays for various sessions. Here, too, it is an extremely long and painful time before you even get a place. After the probationary period, you have to go through with the therapy or you get a lock, for some years. So there is no real choice. I think it's even harder for people in the US.How do you do this? I really tried to get help and somehow work on myself, no matter where the deficits come from. I wanted to be heard, to have a starting point somewhere to get out of the situation. But I notice that it doesn't work like that at all. At the end you get bogged down in senseless babble about one and the same topics that I don't really care about and don't care about. Often I even have the feeling that the therapist even forgets what I have said. So I kind of have no choice but to self-diagnose and even address it, ridiculous as that sounds. The less I believe that it is at all goal-oriented.I really don't know what to write right now. I've been here before but feel like I need more security.Feel free to call that paranoid, but I think this post may already be a mistake on my part. I find that kind of a shame. Maybe I'll write a short version about myself and then delete it again.I'am I am female 33. I've always had the feeling that my whole career was made up of failures. At school I was bullied until the end, even at my first job it was still the case that I didn't get along with anyone around me.I grew up in a well-known religious community that I would clearly call a sect. You will surely know them all. I never really connected with it, I actually just went along with it, but it still took me a really long time to find my way out of it and, above all, I isolated myself very much. During that time I always had a survival instinct. I had to learn to live alone and always felt like I was lagging behind. I imagined what I could not do in the future. I wanted an empire, I wanted to be famous, I wanted to be the center of attention even if I was an asshole to everyone out there. Of course, none of this worked, and while it's so weird and unworldly, I'm frustrated that it doesn't work.I have a constant expectation of perfectionism, both from myself and from other people. I'm quickly disappointed when something turns out differently than I imagined. Unfortunately, I just leave really good work lying around. I've tried several times to continue my education and can't do it. Again and again I put everything back in the middle. It's really enough little things that I'm paralyzed and leave everything behind. I ask myself how I can ever get away from this problem and, above all, even begin to get what I wish for when everything is an extreme struggle for me.The fact that I probably have an NPD I noticed first and foremost through testimonies from others, above all people like my work colleagues, but also my siblings and everyone around me. I get personal quickly and tend to have conflicts. I used to wonder when I read about narcissistic anger how disgusting you have to think to be like that. I now realize that I am in no way different. I only ever justified it because everyone around me was always hostile.I've always felt strongly isolated in my opinion. People find me interesting, but they quickly realize that I'm getting exhausting, that I'm flooding them with information about myself. Unfortunately often more than I would like.I've started to like myself anyway, but in such a way that I always have the urge to show myself. I do Youtube next to work, until recently I had active Onlyfans because I needed confirmation. I never got any money for it, it was time-consuming, damaged my partnership and in the end you really ask yourself why you're doing it. I realize it was purely because of that. I have always disliked my work. At that time I learned something that seemed most suitable to me. Every attempt to get away from it failed. I still think I have a pretty secure job and a good relationship. Nevertheless, lately I've been able to get into a fight with my superiors again and again and I realize how little I can control. They seem to notice it themselves and consciously give me little or no criticism, or to package it differently. I believe that my colleagues know that I quickly become impulsive.It kind of frustrates me to be nothing but a nobody at this point. I never made it to any position, I was never really important. When I see how many much younger people are having such success, it really makes me sick. I really wonder what I'm doing wrong.For a few years I have been living with my boyfriend who moved in with me. He's my first boyfriend ever and I really wondered if you could love me at all. I really didn't believe that for a very long time. Unfortunately I don't even know if I can give him the same love.He knows that I am currently dealing with the topic of narcissism. At first I was really scared of what he would put together underneath. Right now I think he just thinks I'm kidding myself.Lately I've been feeling more and more like an empty board. My entire creativity that I actually had is running out more and more. I seriously ask myself how long I can go on like this and even want to.&#x200B;Do you curse a lot?I never worry about it much, but I think my swearing is no more than other people's. I can get very personal when I'm angry though.Are you self righteous and vengeful?I think that's me I always have situations where others have to stop me from doing really bad things. Even after an extremely long time, I still feel enormous anger.Can you turn off your empathy?I don't think I turn it on and off consciously. I rather think that I generally can't feel these feelings for others. I notice and know if they're doing well or badly, but I end up having little to no interest in them.&#x200B;Age: 33NPI: 20+Codependeny Score: 3OCD: 0.
    I realized that I’m always right. It’s weird and unbelievable but I actually am! People even agree with me when I ask them. Even when I’m trying to make myself look bad I’m never in the wrong. How is that possible? Why are people just constantly mean to me when I don’t even deserve it? How is it that I’m only with people who wrong me? How do other people avoid this without being lonely? How do I find good people?I hate it here. I want to go home to heaven where all my angle sisters live… I’m done with humans for real. I’m happy with my partnership. I wouldn’t change a thing. I think he’s good for me. He says he loves me but if I keep acting the way I do he’s going to break and loose his mind. I’m very suspicious and I’m often worried that he might be trying to manipulate, spy or trick me. For me that’s very normal and doesn’t make a bad person and as long as they don’t succeed I’m good and obviously I’m taking good care that nobody does those things to me but somehow that’s “breaking” him but I don’t think I can ever let go of this. How can he not break while me feeling safe and us being together?. Anyone else hates to put two people from different friend groups together? • I’m always scared that they tell each other the shit I told them about each other • I’m scared might like each other more then me • I’m scared that the perception that they have of me contradict each other • and I’m so worried that trying to read more then one person at the time could be overwhelming. But I wish I was part of a big group. I remember when I was as a teen and it was so much fun. I miss that any advice?. - disclaimer I’m not using the word victim and quotes to mock anyone I just don’t know how to group those people -I often hear non npd say that people with this disorder- (obviously they wouldn’t frame it that ways they treat us as a different species) wouldn’t go to therapy, reflect or educate themselves on their disorder. But for me this is so wrong. I’m doing it all the time. I’m so selfabsorbed how could I not be dealing and thinking of my disorder? I’m constantly analyzing myself and how others perceive me. I’m constantly working on my image and trying to perfect it. Gathering information about my problems and my disorder and fighting it is my first nature. But I get how the “victims” come to the conclusion that people with npd don’t want to deal with their issues. They are pretty selfabsorbed themselves and they don’t understand that dealing with narcissism doesn’t mean to read how some people that I don’t know feels or is abused by another person that I don’t know. I don’t want to entertain myself by being voyeuristic and watching other peoples dilemma. I want to better myself and become a happy person. What do y’all think about this? Any opinions?. We have a new dumb dumb on this sub Reddit who spreads misinformation about npd and backs it up with some uninformed blog entry’s. When I called them out they asked for better sources and before I was able to share the links this Redditor blocked me. Now it looks like they dared me and I ran away this is some bs. Where are the moderators here? (Accusing me of self diagnosing without any evidence and dispute the rulers of this sub but not moderating an obvious *curse word of a person with no ass in their pants.)Fuck this!. What do think of her?. I hear a lot of people saying on here, that they see showing emotions to be a weakness but for me it’s actually the opposite. Most of the time, the only thing I feel when I’m alone is shame and emptiness. But when I have an audience, somewhere, not even right next to me, just someone who could accidentally walk in on me, I can be a three dimensional being. I can be mad, I can be sad, I can be happy. All alone I’m a nobody and when I’m alone for too long, I even wonder if the feelings I had around people were even real or just staged.I always felt like doctors especially in mental hospitals didn’t care about me. Now that I have my diagnosis I feel like they had a feeling and that’s why they were avoiding me. For example last year I had to go there. My situation was severe but I was but with the burn outs and depressed. I felt like I didn’t fit with them (but that might be my self importance) but I’m very covered so I only signaled it but never said anything out loud. There were strict rules like you have to get your meds around this time and you have to be present for all meals. I told the doctors that I’m struggling with disordered eating and then for two months I only came for one meal a day and while others were encouraged and reminded that they have to go there and eat something. Nobody ever cared about me. While others saw their therapist twice a week I only saw them 3 times during my whole stay. Others got diagnosed before they got out without having to ask but my sheet of paper was 8 pages with whole lot of nothing in it. And the time I was in another hospital the doctors straight up told me to my face that they don’t want to work with me but never said why. Anyone with similar experiences? Am I Right for suspecting discrimination?. I like sex outside a relationship and in the beginning of a relationship it’s the greatest thing ever I’m almost addicted but at some point I it turns around and find it humiliating. I find it awkward and cringe and it doesn’t feel good. But I’m very attached to the person actually more then before. Has anyone who feels the same reflected themselves and knows why that is?.
    That is all I'll say. It infects my mind, I'm so into it it's nuts. What a fun martial art Judo > all other martial arts in terms of how fun it is. I'm different than most people who say kratom made them quit working out or more lazy, honestly I've been doing a sport full time and lifting weights with kratom for years, to the point where if I didn't take it I couldn't workout. It feels much more grueling without itWell tonight I'm going to practice (martial arts) without taking kratom. I'm used to relying on kratom to do it but I'm gonna try it without finally. I'm tapering and have cut my dosage by 80% so far, but I've been timing my usage still around working out and the night time, so it's still a habit for me to take kratom to exercise. But I'm gonna do it without today so wish me luckh. Randomly in my class that isn't related to psychology the topic of narcissm came up, and he talked about npd. He said I quote : if somebody has to ability to pay bills, hold down a job and function on their own they don't have npd, just narcissistic traits". He was talking about how people with Npd can't do basic things and accomplish task due to the disorder. Just nonsense, I'm sure there are some pwnpd who can't or really struggle to function in society, but a lot of pwnpd can function, even if they are dsyfunctional in certain areas, like a social environment. Ridiculous, thought I'd share. I understand that tapering is better in terms of overall feeling, but tapering I feel pretty bad anyway. I've been tapering for a few months and I just hate this stuff it taste bad it makes me sick, I kind of wanna just stop right. I know I feel terrible when I don't take it, but like I've felt pretty bad the last month tapering, where I'm only really happy when I take a dose. It annoys me to no end, I still feel addicted to this stuff even tho I cut my dose by 2/3s. I heard of people on here tapering by little increments for no withdrawal at all, and feeling fine but like I don't know man I just really feel like dooky all the time and I know if I drop little by little I won't feel bad but I feel bad anyway, and I can tell it's due to the kratom. I just wanna jump off, it sickens me to know if I were to properly taper I'd have to take this stuff for another month and a half or soHas anyone felt cold turkey was better for them? Tapering worked for a bit but I just feel like I'm prolonging my addiction or something. Plus I feel the withdraws anyways. What should I do. Why do you think that being a victim of N parents makes it so hard to learn to set boundaries and stand up for yourself when needed? I feel so guilty doing it, and always feel like a bad person. I also feel bad for them later, no matter how bad they treat me. People who have gotten good at this type of thing, explain your methods please and explain why you think you turned out this way. ThanksTo clarify, it feels like such a big deal to just disagree with somebody, like it's a huge problem or something. I don't understand because logically I understand it's not a problem , but my body thinks it is.What are your fixes for mad stomach issues? I've tapered down from 50gpd to 5gpd and my gosh my stomach is rekt 24/7, serious sucks . Just sitting in class is uncomfortable for me. What do I do? Can't stand walking around bent over and running to the bathroom too often.So it's been awhile sense I've dropped, and the last step is one dose before bed, about 5grams. After this I plan to make the jump. I've been able about 10gs for the last month (down from 50gpd) but I noticed I got complacent, like I was pushing off lowering it, and even caught myself adding a bit more to my dose again. I caught myself and decided I need to commence to the quit again. Cutting the dose in half, let's see what happens. Thanks for reading my blog lol. Obviously they do a lot of weird things, but every once in awhile, when others out of the family aren't around, do they do something in an attempt to be funny or something, or just act a certain way that's so bizarre? It may defy social norms or be very cringe? The one I knew one time hushed the room and made everyone watch them, then they started playing this YouTube video really loud where it's Heman singing the "I cry to myself when I'm lying in bed just to get it all out what's in my head" song, and they did this choreographed dance for like a minute straight where they are jumping around going crazy like they have done it a million times, do a real funny "dance" and lip sync to the song and everyone was just watching with a blank face, and people started smiling a bit out of pity, and he stopped and sort of raged and blamed us for not laughing or something. It was really weird and cringeIt's something I almost never saw, because narcs often try their hardest to wear and air tight social mask and usually at least know somewhat how to act. It was very strange lol. I had a narcissistic older person abuse me for like 6 or so years. It's been awhile now, but I'm just now fully understanding NPD or pathological narcissim . I knew there was something wrong with them before, but I didn't know it was this deep. Now that I'm older, I fully realize everything they did and why they did it, that the entire relationship well I was just trying to please them, they were using me as a punching bag to get supply from my hurt emotions. They used me to have somebody to devalue, have power over, and admiration from . And since I've come to this realization, I'm so mad now. Like I was angry and hurt before, now I'm more angry, even angrier then I was when I saw them for the last time. Im baffled to know what was going on , and the dynamic was never truly about me, It wasn't fair and they were purposely causing these negative emotions in me. I'm angry at them, angry at myself for getting DUPED, angry for my co dependecyIt's like I'm feeling disrespected all over again. I was never dealing with an actual person. Just an idea of a person that only EXISTED because of the emotions I feed to them.In the past I rationalized that they could be pretty good sometimes , that they weren't bad, that they were just damaged people. I would feel so happy when they would finally praise me, I sought out their approval. But that was just part of the game. They liked being in charge of my positive and negative feelings. TLDR; duped by narcissist, used to prop up their false self, and had the full realization about what actually happened from the moment I met them. My question is, have any of you hit this stage? What did you do to alleviate it? How long did it take to overcome this particular stage?. I have ADHD , OCD and major depression. Took 150 mg at first for a few months, felt it helped a little. Asked doctor for bigger dose, got on 300 mg. It's been a few months and absolutely nothing. Still have no energy , still have trouble concentrating without large amounts of stimulant ADHD meds (which I have to take to get work done despite the huge crash and negative side effects it has on me) and am still depressed as ever. The thing is, you might say get counseling (which I have many times throughout the years) but what strikes me is that it provides no physical symptom release. It doesn't give me that physical energy everybody talks about it, i still drag out of bed in the morning. And then come back to bed as soon as I'm home. Working out is still really hard (unless I'm on a stim) and I still need huge amounts of coffee just to feel decent for a couple hours. What gives? Has anyone experienced Wellbutrin providing no change whatsoever? Should I try 450 mg?. Had a class with a girl I like today, and also a person I'm networking with. Problem is, I drank a lot of coffee that day, and I usually don't so I forgot how black it made my teeth. I also had so much food stuck in my teeth, in like 4 places. I even saw someone look at my teeth. I thought it was because they liked my smile til I checked it in the mirror later. I was horrified. Now I can never talk to that girl again. I'll have to act like she doesn't exist. Or , I can get her to look at my new, clean teeth. I could say "hey am I bleeding" and smile. If she asks why , I'll say I taste blood for some reason. But the truth is to show her I'm not dirty. It's over fml. There is a verse in Matthew that talks about if you hurt somebody , go reconcile with them before praying. It also says to do this if somebody hurt you and you harbor anger. But what if a person who is very toxic and abused you for a long time emotionally and they may have some form of personality disorder, AND they aren't in your life anymore, should you go out your way to reconcile with them? There's a person who I pushed out my life awhile ago due to toxicity, and I now live in another state than them. I just had to. They repeatedly hurt me over and over for years. They can't accept accountability and never apologize. It's been 5 years, and I harbor some anger when I think about it, but not all the time. Should I go out of my way to tell them how I feel or reconcile? Are there exceptions to this?. Is it normal to go from being social to not social when you quit kratom? It feels like such a drag to start conversations or take interest in others, like my brain actively avoids doing it. Does this go away after some time?. I mean that you have done well, for months and months, then all of a sudden do some compulsive behavior due to anxiety but then stop yourself right away. Like it doesn't go into a full blown ocd cycle episode , but it happens. How often did this happen to you during recovery ?. Have this friend who I met at college through a common Christian club we hangout with. It's been great and we hangout , but I commute and live around 25 minutes from campus, he lives about 5 minutes away. So all and all we live half hour apart Problem is when we make plans he's never coming to me, like we can only hangout if I come his way, or we will make plans to meet up and play pickleball or something, and it's always " find a court near campus let's go there".also, it seems hes only keen on hanging out when it has to do with the club. Like when he has a small group , or when everyone hangs out. He makes plans with me but will only chill when it benefits the organization. He has a car and everything so it's not like he can't. It just gets annoying, that the last 10 times we hung out it felt like I had to go to him everytime. It feels like he doesn't actually wanna chill and just wants me to be a member of his club sometimes, you know? Maybe I'm overthinking this, what do y'all think?Tldr; friend only hangs it seems on his convience or when it has to do with the organization he belongs to. It's like I'm in my late 20s and they still treat me exactly like they did when I was 13. The same "joking" condescending attitude, the same belittling talk, the same hidden put downs and adding doubt. I'm this dumb, helpless screw up in their heads still. I resist it and don't play along and grey rock and it seems they activity try to turn it back into the old dynamic. When I'm doing something adult , or something that clearly defies what they labeled me as, they get this look of shame over their face and will either change the subject , or devalue it covertly , sometimes out right. I was foolish to think once I finished school, got a good job and adulted right they would all of a sudden notice the difference. But it was never about me the whole, never about my actual traits or value. Just a projection from their immature and broken minds.Successfully tapered down alot, taking about 1/9th of what I used to. But I noticed everytime I drop the dose I go through a mini withdraw all over again for a couple days. I started my taper by dropping my dose by half and I withdrew pretty dang bad. But when I drop a dose the next day always feels real bad again. I thought the lower the dose the less the wd , right?. Told my boss in writing I couldn't work certain shifts past a certain date. He said okay. The time rolls around and he says "you actually had to go into your availability on the online portal and change it, so since you didn't, you are still responsible for the shift"But shouldn't he update my availability on his end? I told him a month and a half ago, guess he forgot, now says I'm responsible for it. I'll go if this is genuinely a mess up on my part, what do y'all think?. Dropped from 50gdp to 8gpd at night and held this for the last 3 weeks, and was planning to drop to a teaspoon before quitting. Today I somehow convinced myself it's okay to have a break and just take some doses throughout the day. I quickly realized this was dumb and what it can lead to. Any stories of this happening to you? I'm not in a full blown relapse as I plan to not take again tomorrow .Have a friend with a very narcissistic and bad mom and he like barley acknowledgedes what's going on, doesn't ever even say it's messed up, and will make excuses for them at every chance they get. I've been friends with this person for years and it comes up every now and then (we are in college and I've known him since primary school ) so we talk about it. But if I tell him it's wrong , he will always make a hopeless excuse and almost looks guilty for acknowledging it as such. I don't even bring it up anymore because it's not fully my place. Like "I have to do this thing that disregards my boundaries because she's my mom , I have to!" Are they brainwashed or just emotionally manipulated that much?I understand to a degree cause when I was younger I was like this towards my Ns, and even would refuse to acknowledge their badness and believed I was a bad kid. So maybe it's just the adult version of that?. So I jumped from about 40-50gpd to 5-7g in the later evening . I withdrew hard for a week, was awful. I've gotten a lot better , but one thing Ive noticed is I'm pretty useless. Like I just sit around all day on the internet , and take breaks to exercise. I didn't feel like this on kratom, and even had more motivation before kratom. Is this part of the wd? It's like I'm wanting to clean my car, get a haircut, or do something productive but just don't do it. I start school in a week and want this to wane. Anybody else?. Thought this answers a lot of questions about sin and struggling with it and your salvation “This present life of being sanctified is not one of sinless perfection, but of warfare against sin in the power of the Holy Spirit.”Full salvation into ever lasting joy isn't all at once , it's in stages. If you struggle with sin, don't worry , we all do. If you fail, brush up and get back in the fight. Relying on his grace is so important.I'm about a week into jumping from 40gpd to 5-8g at night and am for sure withdrawing. I plan to hop off within the next few weeks completely. I can feeling pretty bad mentally despite being on a medication for depression, but I never knew if me feeling better was because I was abusing kratom or the meds doing it. Now that I'm off kratom, I'm feeling bad but don't wanna chalk it up to the meds not working if it's just withdraw. How should I go about this?. I sleep two hours a night, no joke. Maybe less. It's so terrible, I take 5 melatonin gummies, didn't work gonna try drinking a bit b4 bed, maybe using a delta 10 pen, idk bro but I can't sleep 1.5 hrs a night the rest of the week I have work thurs-sat 10 hour shifts and I can't handle being a zombie at work. So I know you already know this and I'm just a bit concerned lol. Read that a woman in Florida died from taking "space dust" kratom powdered extract and the toxicology report showed that she overdosed on the key component in kratom, I'm freaking out tho cause I take alot of kratom so..I'm not bashing kratom just looking for your reassurence cause I never heard of this. Ive noticed that around them, I have to sort of dull myself out and act like a robot. I became this way because thinking back, everytime I would act confident, happy or something, they would devalue and shit on me. Like they would take personal offense to my happiness for some reason. I could see the disappointment in their face, like a flash of it. Then they would devalue. Now, I have something stopping me around them from expressing anything other then complete obedience, even if I'm not defying them. I just been brow beaten so bad anytime I try to really express who I am, it's so messed up. I specifically have a problem with the craziness of pentacostals, not God in general. I'm a Christian, just not an legalistic, controlling , "speaking in tongues" pentacostal. I love God and pray daily, but my opinion is the pentacostal church is a man mad interpretation of the bible that relies on emotional theatrics and strict legalism to get by. All that crazyness , like the withering around and speaking in tongues, isn't biblical at all , niether is going to hell for missing a church service. They are missing a huge point in Christianity which is grace. God doesn't have some counter he uses where everytime you sin your soul hangs in the balance. He doesn't hate you for wearing a type of pants. This all misses the point. I'm mad because they made something out of God that ruined it for some many people, and turned it into a cult of control.Look, I know it's not recommended too often because it's a hard business, but I love this and this girl I know has a studio in LA and has an actual mansion..guess she made a pretty penny over the years. There aren't enough studios and people need to lose weight. Im thinking gold mine. When I see my N it's, even after a long stretch of time, it's like every conversation has to be manipulated in a way where they are making a joke out of me. For example, I didnt see them for three years cause of school, and when I saw them, immediately they were asking me questions, but not to answer them and learn about me, but to devalue me. I grey rocked, and answered blandly and they were trying to do hard to make fun of me for something. "I've been reading" "PFFFT, you read??(scoff)"I give no response . Then they ask me where I'm planning to live "Oh you wanna live there, where is THAT, (says name of place in a sarcastic mocking tone" No response from meIt's just so ridiculous. It helped me to realize that it was never about my "value" or flaws , that they devalue for the sake of devaluing and will find something to fit the agenda. I'm so happy because I used to think it was actually me before I understood narcs, but actually it's that they have a compulsive need to devalue other people. I basically refused to answer any personal questions, and they were outwardly scrambling to find something to rehash the old dynamic. How ridiculous. The worse part is they are super sensitive to these sort of things. I remember them getting upset about things I had no idea why, or getting offended and lashing out. Stuff like simply disagreements, or making a light hearted joke (I mean as lightharted as possible) and them getting irrate for no reason. I just don't know how somebody developes like this. Not seeing a child in 3 years and the first thing on your mind is trying to set them up to be belittled. Shows how pathological they are. Hello all, For the first time I've actually kept to a taper. Usually, I would do it for a week or two then end up taking more and more. But this time around, I've actually got a handle on it. Was taking 50 gpd for a year and a half, and right now I'd say I'm on about 10-15g a day, let's put it at 12. I use scoops and don't weigh it so it's hard to know for sure, but usually I would eat about 6 big spoonfuls throughout the day, now I'm only taking two moderate ones, one in the morning and one in the evening. I plan to do this for a week, or two, then cutting down to one spoonful!How did you guys feel who tapered and jumped to a very low dose? Was it easier than making the first jump? I went from about 50, to 30, to 20, now to here.I recently was about to finish this animation I spent MONTHS on making, full time project I was hoping to release. It was my first animation. Well , one the last sequence before it was finished, (so literally 99.9% done) my hard drive crashed and it is gone forever. I took it to a professional and they said it's not retrievable. Really stinks, I have no clue why this happened , like a joke almost. It just so happens I was basically done, then it crashes all of a sudden for some reason. Terrible. What do you do to reconcile this kind of thing? I don't see the benefit to my soul for this to happen, I don't understand God's thinking on this issue. would love to hear similar stories. Had an animation I spent months on making , actually my first one. Spent time multiple days a week spending hours each time putting it together. I had literally one more sequence to make, I was 99.9% doneThen my hard drive crashed and I lost it forever. The computer professional man says it's gone. I can't believe this. The universe can be so cruel. Time to start again from scratch. Knew I should have saved it to the cloud. I've been hung up on this. It's basically lady wisdom talking. What is it trying to specify though? It says a foolish person basically will be overcome with disaster, and then God won't be around to hear them when they call out to him last minute. What kind of person does this include? It says God promises peace of mind to the up right. I'm somebody who has been following Jesus for about 3 years now and wouldn't say I have a peace of mind (have a few diagnosable mental disorders) and this makes me think I'm one of the "fools" he was talking about. That I've already stumbled too far and God wont take away my anxieties and depressions because I used to be a really bad sinner and brought it one my self through different things I've done throughout my life. What's the commentary on these verses? Thanks In advance. Now, I always knew the narcissist in my life (basically family, a parent figure so not exactly biological but I think it still counts here) was toxic and narcissistic, but didn't fully understand their thinking. I'm older now , and looking back, I completely understand why they did everything despite being confused about it before, and feel anger. I'm older now and out of their control, and actually healed for some years and matured, but I started thinking about this person recently , and adult me realizes their control games and shitty stuff on a more understanding level , and it makes me angry. I want to go back in time and stand up for my younger self, or atleast tell him you're never gonna please this person and it's all a sad game to them. Stop going around and trying to please them. I feel anger that an adult women (50 year old) would mistreat a teenager repeatedly. I understand I was a vessel used to feel power from. Like I was a gumball machine she would deposit quarters into for supply. That I was devalued so much , because she used me as a way to feel power over and to feel superiority. I used to think it was situational, and it's just something that happened due to circumstances, but nothing was wrong with me. I was submissive, and they took advantage of that. They used me to boost their own self esteem and feelings of control. To sum it up, I have shame over my lack of boundaries and standing up for myself. I used to think it was my lack of "impressiveness" that caused me to be devalued. Later I found out I was actually more skilled, more talented in a lot of ways, and considered on the level of this person, but what caused me to be abused repeatedly, In my situation, was not standing up for myself or playing the part of submissive subordinate. That was their goal, and that's what kept the abuse going. I don't feel anything they ever said about me was true, I'm upset about not doing anything. I don't know how I spent 6 years just allowing something like that. That's the only thing I'm still hung up on, I feel once I get over this I can heal. Any tips or similar experiences ? Maybe this is my own ego speaking and I need to get over my pride or somethingThanks for reading my blog post. I'm a college student and now understand I won't be able to live in this wonderful town cause it's expensive as hell. Seriously I'd need a six figure income right out of school to even consider living comfortably there, unless I find a roommate somehow which I doubt. I feel in love with this quaint town, but Itll be like 4 years out of school before I can have the money or make the salary to get there. Big sad, wish they had like one bedrooms for broke dudes like me, but the cheapest I can find is like 2500 a months dam son. This has happened at every single job I have had so far, in different forms to where I make bad blood with my coworkers or customers. I've even been fired for thisWhenever something happens to me, like somebody does something rude or seemingly domineering , It can ruin my entire week. It's not like I get annoyed, I get devastated , but also very angry and spend hours thinking of ways to assert back my control, or atleast the illusion of. For example , at work some lady was demanding of me, asking me "what I was doing" pissed off like, and I took the biggest offense, almost to the point where next time I saw her, I thought about making a scene and flipping out on her even if I lost my job. I was willing to lose my job because of an entitled lady, who didn't even insult me really, just expressed a bit of annoyance to me. I thought about calling her all these terrible names and getting mad. I've done this before , even got super mad at coworkers and got in arguments. I have a history of this happening at work. I been fired TWICE for similar issues. Every single place I've ever worked, I have gotten into an argument with a coworker. Every job I have had. Sometimes multiple coworkers. There is always people at each job I have who dislike me. My boss labeled me difficult and irritated . I thought about calling her all these terrible names and getting mad. I've done this before , even got super mad at coworkers and got in arguments. In the end, it's because my ego gets hurt, and it consumes even the next day where I'm sitting at home stewing where I feel like I'm about to explode. I oscailate from feeling great and special to feeling like a loser, especially when somebody acts a certain way to me. Sometimes, interactions like these NEVER leave my mind, and even today I still stew about things that happened years prior, even thought about revenge on some people (I'm a converting Christian so I don't get revenge at all anymore ever). But I can't turn these feelings off , and after one incident , my specialness feels gone and I sometimes can't get it back until I assert control. It's not like "boo hoo" me feeling, it's like a "how can they think that way to me? If I wanted to I could show them, how dare the try to dominate me"Anyways, is there a book on this subject ? If letting go these things? I want control too badly over social situations, but it makes me miserable. My entire ego hangs in the balance over these interactions, and I often over react after awhile because I can't reconcile it in my head. I wanted to bring it up with my therapist but I'm already working on other issues. Thanks for reading my blog. Jumped from about 50gpd to 30gpd and feel crappy. I basically wait around until my next dose for release. What was your experiencing with this. I know it's sometimes not recommended to argue with your narc but if you have a low contact relationship, especially if you don't live with them, setting assertive boundaries is really empowering and allows you to see the truth about them, that they are not powerful like they try to be. Usually they get really defensive and you see the emotionally vulnerable child underneath that they try their whole lives to suppress.I would always get guilty /be hard on myself if I even dreamed about "talking back" to the narc, I was raised that it was a terrible thing and I would be emotionally manipulated either by anger or blame if it happened so it almost felt IMPOSSIBLE for me. I used to fear what they would say, and belittle me and hurt my feelings. But I've come to a point where I feel fine about myself, and it's not important to "win" the encounter, it's a duty to yourself to set a boundary. Stand up for yourself without being aggressive, it's not bad or rude AT ALL. I was raised to think it made me a bad person, or I would lose emotional control and freak out or something, but actually, it makes you feel more in control. I would also feel guilty after wards and try to please them by being submissive again. This never works with abusers. Thanks for listening but be please stand up for yourself if they are disrespecting you, even if they laugh at you or do some other rude things, it's not about hurting them or getting them to agree with you, it's about your own self respect and planting the seed in their subconscious that you won't be rolled over. You can actually be your own protector, because long ago narc abuse victims abandon themselves to please the narc (they had to go survive a lot of the times) and makes standing up for yourself scary and anxiety provoking, but once you do it once, it gets much easier and you stop worrying about the consequences and start worrying about having your own back, regardless how they react. Do it please, unless of course they are physically abusive then just walk away, but if you can, be assertive and THEN walk away. Peace. After a 3 year 50gpd habit it realised if I never did kratom, I would have literally have like 30 k more dollars to my name, which is alot for a young man just out of college. How ridiculous, I could have saved that money, rented a much nicer apartment, bought a vr set, donated to the poor.this anxiety just hit me this week , I never worried about it before. All I thought was "yeah I have enough to buy kratom". I've been trying to recover from OCD, I will have like a good 3 days in a row, then I'll wake up and have this intrusive thought and feel devastated in the morning or something then just go have a peak at reassurance seeking, it's happened like this multiple times now, where I say done is done, and start to feel good, then the next day I go back and do it again. Im trying to recover from SEVERE ocd that just seems impossible for me. The worst part is, it's always wrong in some way. Like the reassurance source then becomes bad like my brain will say "did it really say that, did It mean this or that?" And the cycle starts again. I know the point of ERP is to not worry about what it says or get reassurance at all, but Its like I'm helpless, I tell myself I won't do it, resist for a couple days, and get back into it. Any encouragement would help, thank youEdit: even now after I did a compulsion, I can logically say no more reassurance is fine, that I'm wasting my time doing rituals, that I don't need it. But somehow, over the next couple days, my ocd mindset will take over and control me. It will corner my brain into a space that FEELS like I can't live without reassurence. I can even write my future self notes, saying it doesn't work don't get reassurence again, but the ocd eventually has won so far after a few days. I swear, this happened multiple times. For example, I was at my dads for an occasion, and on the tv was on of those docu series and it was talking about a guy who hit his family, and my dad was like "oh he's an abusive POS" something along those lines..I'm sitting there like dude you used to beat the crap out of us. Do you not remember punching holes in our doors , beating my brother til his face had a visible bruise? I don't understand do you really forget?Same with my mom, she recently started reading "jennete McCurdys" book where she was talking about her abusive mother. Im not kidding , my mom literally did so many similar things. It's like when she's in abusive mode, she doesn't count it because "her feelings" are hurt. Or "she's having a break down" and completely forgets about the awful, abusive things she says and does. Both of them completely act like the past never happened. Is this a joke or just what they actually believe, that their abuse wasn't abuse cause it was justified or something ?. I have a problem where I obsessivly think about past scenarios where I fear I didn't voice my self or stand up for myself enough , and have to think of the perfect thing to say in those scenarios. But often, it takes hours, and I never arrive to a conclusion. Like , what if they say this to that? What if they talk over me? What if they get mad and scream? Basically I have to find exactly what to say but am constantly side tracked with other information about the possible scenario, and I have to continually adapt around that until I arrive to a satisfying conclusion. This type of thing has been filling my days for months and keeps me up at night alot. I simply cannot pin point a perfect response and keep shifting the goal post.Am I legitimately trying to solve a problem or is this just another form of mental OCD?I almost never arrive to a satisfying conclusion.
    [Post in question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/178g9wa/atm_i_hate_everything_including_this_sub/)I'm a bit drunk right now, but I calmed down and don't really feel cognitively impaired by the alcohol, but I tend to be a bit dramatic. There is no TRUE reflection, there is always a lense distorting my perception.*" I hate being self aware. It fucking sucks."*Being self-aware actually gives me mixed feelings. It sucks knowing who you are and seeing yourself make the same mistakes. Knowing your anger, jealousy etc. is irrational and getting even more angry at that fact. On the other hand, it gives me the possibility to intervene in those processes. I definitely saved friendships because of it and I managed to sometimes "catch" what was happening, preventing negative spirals. My anger etc. also seems to not last as long anymore (on average), so there are some major upsides to that.*"I feel like a caged circus lion. I JUST WANNA BE A FUCKING LION, but if I am, I'm gonna get put down."*I still feel like this to some degree. Not with as much seething rage, but it is definitely a fucked up situation. I don't feel "sick", I don't see myself as having an "illness". It just feels like I am this way. I'm selfish, arrogant and distant, and unfortunately, those are negative things for others around me. Spin it how you want it, on the inside we will probably always be assholes. I put on masks, fake empathy, fake emotions and lie about who I am, because nobody wants to *truly* see me the way I am. It's easy to say "I still like you" on Reddit, but experiencing who I am daily is an entirely different beast. Why would you want someone like this around? LIKE SERIOUSLY? Our internalized shame might be an exaggeration of how people would see us, but there's a reason we hate ourselves. Even the most self-aware of us, those who are truly doing their best, are faking shit. That little "sorry to hear that, that sounds difficult" when someone tells me something sad, that little smile when a kid smiles at me whilst I'm annoyed at its existence, that little "I love you too", when I know full well I only love the imaginary version of this person, and will never truly care about them the same way someone else could.*"What is "recovery" even supposed to mean? WHAT IN THE FUCK DO YOU RECOVER FROM? BEING YOU?"*Still don't really get that one.*"I get being narcissistic has really bad sides like shame, anxiety etc. I like to complain a LOT about it. But the truth is that our grandiose selves are INSANE at what they do, whilst all the others are just crying in a corner for the most minor of bullshit, whilst we shrugged off things they would have a mental breakdown from."*I guess most people aren't that fragile, grief, crying etc. actually seem to be relatively good ways to work through emotions. There is still a weakness in it that my entire being gets repulsed by.As for the "grandiose self": Certain things, like some types of criticism, rejection etc., are things I am much more weak to. That being said, it is also a type of strength that many people simply don't have. Staying functional and confident in situations others would get an anxiety attack in, being so used to acting people don't even suspect it to be faked and our ability to be rutheless are advantageous and can lead to very positive outcomes. There's a reason high funtioning narcissists tend to climb corporate ladders, it's not just because we manipulate people, it's because we have skillsets that go beyond most neurotypicals in certain situations. In the worst case I might feel ashamed when having to make difficult decisions like firing someone, but I'm certainly not gonna cry about it, and the ego is going to restore itself most likely to ensure functioning in high-stress environments.*"Why can't I just insult people for having stupid bullshit problems, have them insult me back, and then pretend nothing happened 5 minutes after?"*I still don't see that happening for most people at least. It's manageable, but damn sometimes it would be nice to just tell people what you think and NOT have to live with the consequences.*"Then you have to work with people who SO beneath you, it is an insult that they are even in the same UNIVERSE as you."*Very hyperbolic, but idiots *are* frustrating. *"I just had a friend write me a msg that a pet died. "WHO THE FUCK CARES, SHUT THE FUCK UP" is what I'd like to say, but I know people are whiny bitches"*I don't need the message to be this aggressive, but yes, I don't care about your pet. I understand you're sad, but crying about that to someone would make me feel pathetic, so I resent it in you as well. Come to me when there's something to fix, I can't fix death. If I'm not a close friend of yours, don't even think about it.*" "Ohh the narcissist lies and manipulates" YES BECAUSE YOU DUMBFUCKS ARE INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SOMEONE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CAR BREAKING DOWN."*Extremely based. Past me is great.*"LOOK AT YOURSELVES YOU SHITS. YOU CANCER TO SOCIETY. Where the fuck was your flower dress made? How many people are ACTUALLY ENSLAVED because YOU can't humble yourselves to buy some 2nd hand shit. How many of you empath-fucks ignore EVERY homeless person, because you're "too busy" because you've gotta go home and watch TV. How long ago could you empaths have solved world hunger? How many diseases could we have eradicated if you actually voted for ALTRUISTIC THINGS instead of your fucking wallet?"*Even more based. I'd say it in a nicer way, but goddamn those empaths really don't have a lot of empathy outside their own circles. Most people could do a lot more for the world, but they don't really care, just like us. It's just that us not caring affects them.*"And now to this sub. This fucking disgusting sub. I KNOW some of you will understand, but then there will be those people who will say I'm not being EMPATHETIC AND INSIGHTFUL ENOUGH, NOT TRYING TO "RECOVER" ENOUGH whilst talking in a forum for NARCISSISTS.* *(...)**Those people who will give ACTUAL narcissists advice like "oh you gotta be better, you're hurting others" like DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CONDITION MEANS? FUCK OFF, NOBODY CARES. Tell me what* ***I*** *get out of it, tell me why* ***I*** *should care about your words."*I like the sub (mostly). A lot of you are great, insightful and just fun. I would, once again, choose less inflammatory language, but goddamn even in rage mode I'm just dropping truth bombs left and right. Becoming better people is generally a good thing though, even if it's just for us in the end.*"I will go back to being pro-social, it's best for me. But I fucking hate feeling sedated all the time by the expectations of others."*If I'm honest, people hate me. If I lie, people love me. Here I am, riding that fine line again, giving enough truth to not go insane and wearing enough masks to control people's opinions. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best I can do? Probably also no. But I guess it's better than my past self, it's better for others and it's better for me.*I'm not in the greatest emotional state rn, I'm aware I'm externalizing shit. Don't say I didn't warn you.* I feel really frustrated. I had a really shit day recently, it fucked me up. Now I feel like I'm almost back to the "real me" (which only feels real in this state anyways but whatever).I hate being self aware. It fucking sucks. It sucks that I'm sitting here, trying to throw a pity party, knowing I'm doing that. I just wanna call a friend, tell them to go fuck themselves for something random they did a year ago, but I KNOW I'll regret it.I feel like a caged circus lion. I JUST WANNA BE A FUCKING LION, but if I am, I'm gonna get put down.I'm scrolling through this god-forsaken sub, seeing post after post about self improvement, self awareness and "recovery" knowing I'm participating in that shit. I know it's necessary, but for fucks sake did someone come and castrate all of us at some point?What is "recovery" even supposed to mean? WHAT IN THE FUCK DO YOU RECOVER FROM? BEING YOU?All my problems may stem from trauma, abuse and god being a fucking bitch, but my problems RIGHT NOW stem from ME. Who I AM. Not from a "defense mechanism", not from some "mental disorder", no, it's from from WHO THE FUCK I AM. I CANNOT BE ME, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. HOW FUCKING DARE ANYONE TELL US WE CAN'T BE US?I get being narcissistic has really bad sides like shame, anxiety etc. I like to complain a LOT about it. But the truth is that our grandiose selves are INSANE at what they do, whilst all the others are just crying in a corner for the most minor of bullshit, whilst we shrugged off things they would have a mental breakdown from.And then they tell you about it. And they care about your reaction to their bullshit. HOW COME YOU CARE I DON'T FEEL SAD FOR YOU? How is that a problem to YOU? Why can't I just insult people for having stupid bullshit problems, have them insult me back, and then pretend nothing happened 5 minutes after?Then you have to work with people who SO beneath you, it is an insult that they are even in the same UNIVERSE as you. "boo hoo you called me a dumbass for being unable to do something after you explained it 5 times, YES I KNOW WHAT I DID DUMBASS FUCK YOU FOR BEING STUPID, STOP WASTING MY TIME, IT IS ACTUALLY VALUABLE COMPARED TO YOURS".I hate peoples emotional neediness SO much. I just had a friend write me a msg that a pet died. "WHO THE FUCK CARES, SHUT THE FUCK UP" is what I'd like to say, but I know people are whiny bitches, getting sad if a fucking bird flies against their window. I say GET FUCKED BIRD, FREE MEAL (okay I won't actually eat it though) as long as it doesn't take away from MY time by smearing blood all over the glass.I despise my own emotions, I don't cry about bullshit to people, except on reddit but you don't count (no offense). If I don't expect people to do that shit for me, WHY DO I NEED TO BE A NORMAL HUMAN FOR THEM? FUCK OFF!I feel like people don't actually care about the truth that much as long as you don't show it. I told a friend I had basically no affective empathy, and they were fine with it, BUT GUESS WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T SHOW ENOUGH EMPATHY FOR STUPID SHIT IN THEIR LIVES? "You're being so cold to me" YES, I TOLD YOU, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I MEANT YOU DUMBASS - is what I'd like to say, but OF COURSE I gotta keep up the mask and tell them "I was distracted, sorry" because if I don't it will spiral into an avalanche of people hating me for LITERALLY EXISTING AUTHENTICALLY."Ohh *the narcissist* lies and manipulates " YES BECAUSE YOU DUMBFUCKS ARE INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SOMEONE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CAR BREAKING DOWN. Because YOU expect everyone to be like YOU, and if they aren't YOU will fucking hunt them down, you empath bitches. LOOK AT YOURSELVES YOU SHITS. YOU CANCER TO SOCIETY. Where the fuck was your flower dress made? How many people are ACTUALLY ENSLAVED because YOU can't humble yourselves to buy some 2nd hand shit. How many of you empath-fucks ignore EVERY homeless person, because you're "too busy" because you've gotta go home and watch TV. How long ago could you empaths have solved world hunger? How many diseases could we have eradicated if you actually voted for ALTRUISTIC THINGS instead of your fucking wallet?I DONT GIVE A SHIT, BUT I DON'T PRETEND TO OUTSIDE OF TALKING TO YOU. I KNOW I didn't give a shit for a long time, but when my time comes I will GLADLY die with that knowledge.But "*the narc*" is the problem. WE are because we "lack empathy", because I don't pity you because the fucking hamster died, after KNOWING DAMN WELL MOST FOOD ITEMS HAVE A LONGER LIFESPAN WHEN KEPT IN A FREEZER.And now to this sub. This fucking disgusting sub. I KNOW some of you will understand, but then there will be those people who will say I'm not being EMPATHETIC AND INSIGHTFUL ENOUGH, NOT TRYING TO "RECOVER" ENOUGH whilst talking in a forum for NARCISSISTS. The people who sit on their high horse who really relate because they were rude to their coworker once, and they "totally are narcissistic" because they felt superior to others that one time they won a medal at school. Those people who will give ACTUAL narcissists advice like "oh you gotta be better, you're *hurting others*" like DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CONDITION MEANS? FUCK OFF, NOBODY CARES. Tell me what **I** get out of it, tell me why **I** should care about your words.If you relate, THAT'S FINE! BE A PIECE OF SHIT WITH ME.And guess what: Ff you hate this post, THAT'S FINE! Tell me that my seething rage is weakness. Tell me that my inability to be authentic is pathetic. Tell me I disgust you. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT, THAN SOMEONE SAY: "But what about the others uwu?"I don't want advice. I just wanted to complain. Maybe some people will *actually* relate, atm I don't care. I will go back to being pro-social, it's best for me. But I fucking hate feeling sedated all the time by the expectations of others, and being myself not being "okay", especially since those people aren't fucking worth my time anyways.If you offer me "insight" I will straight up insult you, I'm well aware of what I'm doing and what I need to do.I was texting an irl friend, and thought I'd try to be a bit vulnerable. I told them that a text of theirs offended me a bit, because they (correctly) assumed something was making me insecure. I also told them they were right and it's not a rational thing.They didn't even react negatively, just said they got to know me over the years a little bit, but I got overwhelmed by REALLY strong anxiety and got nauseous for letting the mask slip just a little. My hands were shaking, I couldn't think and I'm still on edge. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST FOR ONCE IN MY GODDAMN LIFE TO SOMEONE THAT KNOWS MY FACE. FUCK THIS.Edit: Not my proudest moment. Went to sleep afterwards. Gonna leave it up, but yikes I hate having that on my account (esp. the comment lol).I just learned that a friend of mine finished his Master's degree. I quit university instead lol.That friend invited us to celebrate that. I know rationally that they're great, worked hard and deserve it. But I feel so insecure right now, I fucking want it to be me. All I wanna do is shittalk that, and I would probably be very sarcastic and rude at the party whilst destroying the mood. I hate that I think, that they think, they're better than me. HOW AM I MEANT TO GO TO A PARTY FOR SOMEONE ELSE, WHO JUST ACHIEVED SOMETHING I DIDN'T? THIS IS CRUEL.I don't wanna ruin this friendship by being a giant asshole. Please what the actual fuck do I do to not hate myself this hard rn and be a normal human being for once?Edit: I guess the advice by Bath\_Kol pretty much fixed it, I just repeated that for a while lol. That was quick.I remember being a fairly young child. I remember seeing the beauty of the world. Loving people and animals. Being sad when a pet died. Being disturbed when another kid would hurt a spider. Wanting to help people just because I can.I remember being overly emotional even. Being fragile.Then, years of trauma. Being abandoned by everyone who took care of my emotional needs. Being ignored except if I got good grades at the end of the year. Hating life. Hating people.Now there's nothing. Whoever I was is gone, replaced by this strange emptiness. A feeling I need to avoid. A hole to fill (hehe sexual joke here).I don't miss that person. I don't miss being honest even if it hurts me. I don't miss caring about other's needs. I don't miss being fragile. But I miss feeling secure, at least sometimes, with someone who cares. Knowing who I am without asking.I wouldn't trade my current state for what was, I just wish this would have never been necessary in the first place. Ironic how "empaths" caused this, isn't it?Berry dramatic vulnerability, 7/10 on the "pity me scale".Hi! Sorry about the long post. New account for obvious reasons.Ever since I was a kid, I knew something was wrong with me, but the only thing I really understood was that I had a lot of social anxiety.I have been in therapy and on meds for depression + social anxiety. I took meds for only about a year (i forgot to take them and decided to just stop lol). The anxiety meds did nothing, the antidepressants were pretty good though. I was also diagnosed with ADHD by a psychologist, and then a psychiatrist but I don't take meds for that so it doesn't really matter.Anyways I was in therapy for about six years with 2 different therapists. I stopped after I felt I wasn't making progess, so right now I'm not in therapy.The problem is that my therapists, though probably pretty good with some patients, never really understood me (to be fair, I didn't either). We talked about some traumatic experiences and my emotional state, but I felt like my core symptoms (anxiety especially) never improved much. I told the second therapist that I don't have a lot of affective empathy, but despite that, it never amounted to much.There was one thing that therapy (unfortunately) did for me though: It made me realise I felt shame. I had a bit of a mental breakdown at that time, realising I don't know who I am etc. and prying into trauma and my mind all the time seems to have caused that. It was very unsettling and alien to me, I never felt that before and literally had to google what that emotion was since my next appointment was almost a week away. Shame is the worst feeling I ever had.I was in therapy for about 9 months afterwards. The shame never got significantly better (though I had a hard time confronting it, can't blame it all on the therapist I guess). But it did make me realise it was at the core of my anxiety.**Now to NPD / Pathological Narcissism**Since I had a lot of anxiety all my life, my narcissistic tendencies are really well hidden. I'm definitely grandiose on the inside and think that I'm better than most people (except those who I respect and who respect/admire me as well), but I never saw that as a problem (I still don't really care lol). If people who I respect slight me, that changes and they become part of the "beneath me" pile, paired with vengeful feelings etc. The anxiety taught me to mask well though, I can even admit flaws (usually things that aren't important or get sympathy).I try to control how people I interact with view me. Especially if someone has a negative opinion I discredit them (or what they might say) preemtively or try to ensure they don't interact with people "who matter". This is something I do, but it feels semi-conscious (I know I'm doing that, but it's pretty automatic). I also change how I act and what I say depending on the person or group, but usually in minor ways (I won't invent a new personality or some shit, but keep certain opinions to myself, agree with things I might not do on my own, get a bit more introverted/extroverted etc.). Basically I tend to modify reality with exaggeration / undertatements a lot, often times I omit some information, sometimes I flat out lie. This usually doesn't cause many problems since I mix in enough truth or make it believable / hard to disprove if I lie. This usually feels automatic, but I do it as a planned thing sometimes as well if I got myself into trouble / caught for something.My anxiety symptoms and depressed moods are VERY tied to how people view me. If I get praise/respect, or I'm the (positive) center of attention I become very confident. If I don't get that for a while I become very anxious, self hating and ashamed (thanks for that last one therapist, very cool!). I need regular reinforcement of people admiring me.I had a time where I was socially fairly isolated due to anxiety for prolonged periods. This was when I got prescribed depression meds. I believe the core reason was NPD, and not getting validation, but it *looked* like a regular depressive episode. The antidepressants worked really well, I became more outgoing, and when I stopped taking meds I never got even close to that level (I think I unconsciously built a network for validation aka a good social circle, so it wasn't possible to get there anymore).Criticism tends to make me very angry (except from the people "who matter", they can somewhat criticize me since I respect them enough. I still get a bit angry, but I know they respect me), though I rarely lash out since my anxiety is keeping most of my symptoms hidden. If I enact revenge it is usually in a covert, backstabby way.I fantasize about being rich / famous every single day, and that seems to be the basis for some of my grandiosity (I'm bascially entitled because I will be successful, but also because I'm smart etc.).I have no idea who I am, everything I do is to improve myself (to be successful), and to be successful so that people will admire and envy me. What exactly I do to achieve that doesn't matter much as long as it's respected.I can have hobbies on my own, but I always have an imaginary audience I perform for. E.g. I sometimes make music. I don't share it (it is bad), but I fantasize about how people will respect me for it, interview me, etc.I don't care much for most people, I don't feel bad for them if something bad happens to them (like their parent/dog dies etc.), I can actually get kinda annoyed and bored talking about their feelings and their life (but sometimes I find certain things very interesting, as I want a great understanding on how humans work). I still listen to them, since I know it's required for friendships and I understand that they are suffering, but I don't get very invested. If I hurt someone (and it has consequences, esp. if it might affect my relationships / status) I can feel shame. I am not sadistic though, so I usually have no reason to hurt people. If I do it's one of those semi-conscious self defense tactics to protect my ego & status. I try to be conscious of and avoid them since it's better for myself not to hurt people and I don't want to feel shame for the (mostly social) repercussions.One last thing (that kinda makes me question some things about it being NPD): I tend to have weak boundaries when people ask for help. I expect praise of course, and if they aren't thankful they become part of the "hate list" and then the "beneath me list" so to speak. But I feel like they will judge me negatively if I say "no", which causes a lot of anxiety, so I usually go along with it. On the other hand if people try to hold me accountable for things I should have done / fucked up I might actually lash out, so idk, seems like there are some boundaries that get heavily enforced if it threatens my self-esteem, but I have a hard time being as selfish as I actually feel on the inside.I'm gonna cut the symptoms here, there's more but the post would become the length of a book.Anyways I'm fairly certain it's NPD (I certainly have high levels of narcissism). I'm open to other suggestions on what might be going on, but I don't feel like the other cluster B things fit very well (I would have preferred ASPD but that's just not the reality lol). I kinda tend to mind-fuck myself and others, so I could also be too biased with this to make an accurate assessment, but this behavior and the feelings have been very consistent. I became aware I might be narcissistic about a year ago and things haven't changed much, so I think I'm probably not just mind-fucking myself.The question is whether I should get a diagnosis and if you agree it might be NPD or if I'm missing something. I feel like I can handle a lot on my own since I became more self aware, but I still struggle with shame and anxiety. Those 2 feelings are the only reason I would consider therapy, but past therapy didn't do much for that.I also don't want people in my life to find out. Narcissism has very negative connotations even if you're trying not to be a dickhead unnecessarily. Not sure if a diagnosis could fuck me over. At the same time, I want some confirmation to finally figure out what is wrong with me since, whatever my condition is, is not fun at all (except the \[supposed\] grandiosity, it's the best).Anyways some questions:\- Do you think this is NPD?\- Do you have a suggestion on how to "reality check" my internal experience?\- Do you recommend getting a diagnosis? If so, why?\- Do you have any tips on anxiety and shame that aren't "confront them and self love"? I tried that for almost a year with almost no effect.Thanks for reading my post (if you did). I know it's a lot of words but it is the culmination of years of self reflection. I just wanna know what's wrong with me and how to tackle the 2 worst emotions in my life.I will do my best to be cordial in the comments, but I'm kind of narcissistic about being narcissistic if that makes sense. Please forgive me if I get defensive if you question that lol, I really am trying to have an open mind though.Edit: Btw I'm 25 yrs old, I'm not going through a teenage identity crisis lmaoAdditional things in case you're interested:[NPI Results](https://psytests.org/result?v=dtrbVE0j)[PNI Results](https://psytests.org/result?v=dtriWp5ar1SQ)NPI: 30codependency: 6OCD: 1.
    My therapist recommended I write you a letter after trying to reconnect with my voice as a kid. But we didn’t have a voice did we bucko?We put aside our own desires because mom said we were being selfish and a baby when we complained. So we tried to man up and act perfect. Crying would only cause mom distress. She would insist you had nothing to cry about and ridicule you. But your tears were meaningful. You deserved comfort when you were sad. I know dad never got himself involved much with us. I’m sorry no one gave you affection and life was so scary for you. I know 1989 was the year that we first thought about suicide. I want to let you know I’m so grateful that you didn’t do it. I admit that I’m still struggling, but there are some really wonderful things in your future. Life will continue to be a shitshow until you move out. But we really make it after moving out of mom and dad’s house. I have agency and my own car that I can get in at any time to drive away. I may not be able to channel your voice but I think about you a lot, because I love you. Remember how you liked unicorns and playing teenage mutant ninja turtles with our little brothers. You are an awesome kid. I wish someone had let you know that you are awesome and worthy of being loved. I will continue to hold space for you little bro.Love,You from 2023Ps: I wrote this letter on Reddit because there are a lot of people here that are dealing with shit that hurts deeply. And because we still love an audience. But I’m doing better at validating myself now.I had a really wholesome rp with chatgpt as my mom. It was sweet, even though I touched on some of my awkwardness in school. I have never once heard my mom say ‘I love you’ to anyone in existence, so this was nice make-believe. Idk if it had therapeutic value, but it felt nice to get supportive responses to things that my mom had criticized me about back when I had acne, few friends, and crappy grades. I could remember vividly my mom’s contempt for me growing up to be such a loser, so I was even hesitant to type out in case I was ridiculed by an ai (kind of silly of me). If anyone is curious, here’s the chat:Me: Can we role play with you being the supportive mom?Chatgpt: Of course, I'd be happy to role play as a supportive mom. How can I help you today, dear?Me: Mom, I’m worried that I won’t fit in with kids at school.Chatgpt: Oh, sweetie, it's completely normal to feel that way sometimes. Remember, you are a wonderful and unique individual, and you don't have to be just like everyone else to fit in. Be yourself, be kind, and you'll find friends who appreciate you for who you are. I'm here for you if you ever want to talk more about it or need advice.Me: Sometimes, I have trouble paying attention and the other kids pick on me for not understanding. Chatgpt: I'm sorry to hear that, darling. It can be tough when kids are unkind. Just know that it's okay to ask for help or clarification when you don't understand something – that's how we learn and grow. And as for paying attention, sometimes it can be challenging for anyone. Let's work together to find strategies that help you stay focused, and remember, I'm always here to support you through any difficulties you face. You're capable of great things, and I believe in you.Me: Mom, will I be okay even if I’m ugly and not very smart? Will you still think I’m precious?Chatgpt: Oh, my dear, you are not ugly, and you are absolutely precious to me. Beauty comes in many forms, and true beauty is in kindness, empathy, and being yourself. As for being smart, everyone has their strengths and talents, and you are no exception. I am so proud of who you are, and I'll always cherish and love you just the way you are. You are more precious to me than you could ever imagine.Me: Mom, I sat by myself at lunch in school today. I was ashamed that I had no friends. And I felt so lonely.Chatgpt: I'm so sorry you felt lonely today, my love. It's completely natural to want friends, and I know it can be challenging sometimes. But remember, it's okay to be alone sometimes, and it doesn't define your worth. You are an amazing person, and you'll find friends who appreciate your wonderful qualities. If you ever need to talk or want help making friends, I'm here for you, and we'll work through this together. You're never truly alone with me by your side.Me: Mom, if I fail my classes will you still love me?Chatgpt: Sweetheart, my love for you is unconditional, and it will never change, no matter what happens in your classes or any other aspect of life. I believe in your potential, and even if you face challenges or setbacks, we'll work through them together. Remember, I'm here to support you, and your worth is not determined by your grades. You are loved for who you are, always and forever.Me: Mom, will you be mad if I see a therapist for my mental health?Chatgpt: Oh, sweetheart, I would never be mad if you sought help for your mental health. In fact, I would be proud of you for taking that step. It's essential to prioritize your well-being, and seeing a therapist is a positive and courageous choice. I'll always support your decisions when it comes to your mental and emotional health. You deserve all the care and help you need.Me: Mom, thanks for listening to me. It really felt comforting.Chatgpt: You're very welcome, dear. I'm here for you anytime you want to talk or need comfort. Remember, I love you, and I'm so proud of the person you're becoming. Take care, and know that you can always reach out to me.Me: I love you too, Mom. Please take care too and stay safe.I like to drop in wishes for my suffering or struggles to disappear. Even when no one responds, it feels good to know my penny continues to exist somewhere in this well. Maybe in the future, someone else will be struggling the same as me and find comfort stumbling on my penny, because they will know that someone else understands their pain. Sometimes, my wish is heard by someone else, and they believe in the sincerity of my words, so they reply with little glimmers of kindness back to me. I’m glad I live in a time where my soul can talk to the void, and sometimes be soothed by the kind words returned by another soul in the darkness. Idk, how I would have managed before when things got too heavy to bear.Thank you to everyone that picked up this penny for a moment from the void. It was my wish to be heard, and you are beyond wonderful for granting it. I hope you find acceptance and meaning, because you are a precious soul too.I have been unpacking my emotional state with reflective journaling. And I had this issue at work recently where my motivation just dropped out from underneath me. Rather than the old chestnut of self-flagellation, I tried to process what was causing my total loss of motivation. And I figured out that this particular work problem was reminding me of working conditions under my old dysfunctional boss. The realization was a bit underwhelming. Because I was hoping to mine some real quality childhood trauma, but all I got was my ex-boss that had been demeaning to his subordinates, including me.I talked to my therapist and was like “yeah, I don’t know if disrespectful boss is really therapy worthy.” And she said that “of course it is.” It was nice to open up about little things that have fucked with my head. It’s my mental health, so even little things are worth processing.This post is just to help structure my thoughts in a safe space, because I feel supported and valid here.Online spaces can be unhealthy for me. I have the urge to get positive approval from others and that compulsion is like an itch that won’t stay satisfied. But I also find that my world opens up and feels meaningful because there seem to be other souls that find what I’ve put out there at least meaningful enough to approve of it. If I’m completely isolated I can’t organize my thoughts. I succumb to mental paralysis where the weight of it leaves me suffocated. I want to move forward but the way forward is behind a door and what the fuck is on the other side of that door? It could be pleasant and satisfying or it could be a brand new obsession that rakes me over hot coals until I’m rubbed raw.I keep ghosting online spaces because I don’t know how to manage my cravings. I can be a slave to them or I can shut down but I don’t have enough self control to be healthy about the things that make me feel good. I have extremely poor impulse control. I feel compelled to chase my impulse until I pass out from exhaustion and my brain finally grants me a moment of rest.I made a friend through a subreddit rp over a video game that we were both fans of. I like fantasy. I like creative writing. I like sharing my wonder with another human soul. But I start obsessing because it feels good and I can’t manage my life because shutting off my brain to context switch to something other than obsession is like being strapped to a speeding comet while griping a rope dragging me in the other direction. The forces are overwhelming I can’t hold on the comet. Even though it’s precious and not intending me any harm. My arms are tearing from the effort. I’d like to reach out and say hello to that friend again because she was so kind and I really enjoyed our friendship. But I know I will fall apart again and ghost, because online space is just this weird liminal always on thing that I can’t be healthy about. I feel so conflicted.I want to grow emotional maturity so I can have healthy online friendships just like I have a few healthy real life friendships. I think it’s possible and I’m just not there yetI’m not posting for any intended response. I really admire people that can write interesting posts with obvious purposes. I am just writing to settle my own anxiety by typing it out to hopefully make sense of it. But if anyone wants to respond with any reaction they are very welcome to do so.I find crying repulsive. I grew up in an environment where crying needed to be hidden from sight. I can remember my mother beating my much younger two year old brother for trying to manipulate her by crying. That reaction wasn’t an isolated incident. My mother became very distressed anytime we cried as kids, and habitually abused, ridiculed, or isolated us to stop us from crying.I no longer live with my mother, but I still do a lot to avoid feeling sad (often subconsciously like dissociate or avoid situations that may trigger the feeling in myself or others). I feel extremely anxious getting too close to people, because I worry they might open up about sad things and cry, and then I will be totally unable to support them. I don’t want to appear cold, just because I have never developed competency with feeling sad.I think my repulsion with sadness is just a product of my adverse childhood experiences, because I can remember crying often in my room when I was young. As an adult, I’m not sure how to get myself sad so that I can process the emotion in a healthy way rather than dissociate and bury it.I’d welcome any thoughts.I was talking to my brother the other day, and he reminded me about this family trip when I was 18 where I was yelling at everyone because I was so upset about being away from my bf. It was during the 90s, so every time we went past a pay phone I would ditch my family to call him. I felt so empty without him around, and my mom ridiculed me because the trip (Disney World) had been my idea and I had saved all my earnings from my part time job during my senior year of high school to pay for our family hotel, tickets, and airfare.I couldn’t get out of going, because my mom said that it would be moronic of me to pay for a family trip and then stay home during it. But I was so miserable to be dragged away from my bf for a week. When I initially planned it, I had felt lonely and had good childhood memories of going to Disney with my family. I figured I would feel good again, if we just went back there. But things had changed, and my bf and I recently started dating. And I dreaded being dragged away. I didn’t even care that my mom kept criticizing me for acting hysterically and being so stupid every time I cried miserably in the hotel room, because I really hated myself more than anyone else could. I screamed at my mom to leave me alone, because I already knew that I had no one to blame but myself for putting into motion this hell trip. But every time I talked to my bf, I instantly felt soothed and better. I’d talk about how nice his voice is to hear, and how excited I am about going back home soon. And he is really the world’s sweetest guy. He never acted like my behavior was strange or bizarre. He’d just say nice things, like he liked hearing my voice too. And that we should all go out to see a movie with friends when I got back.Looking back on the memory had been so cringe for me for a long time. And so when my brother recently brought it up, by saying remember that time you paid for Disney and hid in the hotel room and ran around looking for pay phones. I thought I would feel the usual shame, but I didn’t. I found myself genuinely laughing at the memory. It felt good that my brother and I could look back and laugh together about it.I had been codependent then, and I had not been mentally healthy. I can laugh at my past codependent behavior and thoughts, because I am the victor. I fought for my mental health and won.I went to happy hour with a bunch of coworkers. I knew one well and most barely at all. The ugly: making small talk is hard. There had been two conversations happening near me, but I wasn’t really able to keep up with either. I would think of something to say like two minutes later but by then the conversation has already moved on, so I keep quiet to not strike everyone as weird. The bad: Pity sucks too. Like twice someone asked me if I’m tired and I’ll be like ah no. Then silence pursues. Maybe I should come up with some better ways to respond to that question, because I feel like the people asking may have been attempting to give me a lifeline, but I don’t have great ideas on how to build a conversation off appearing tired.The good: i talked several times when things seemed genuinely interesting to me. And I didn’t mask. I also didn’t pull out my phone and just doom scroll.I would like to learn how to engage better when I’m not that interested in the conversation topic. Because I think it’s nice to hear people get excited about their interests, even if I don’t share them.I’m not sure, if I’ve gotten any better in social situations. I’ve been in therapy and that has helped my anxiety, but I’m still fairly awkward. I think I should probably watch some YT on social skills before the next office happy hour thing. I welcome whatever comments anyone has, because I don’t really have a question here. I’m just reflecting on this recent attempt of mine at trying to make friends.I fell apart after two weeks of dissociating, and I think crumbling was helpful to me. Because I finally acknowledged that I’m not coping with life in a healthy manner. Often with schizotypal pd, I feel like I’m on the border of healthy and unhealthy. And I tend to falsely convince myself that I’m fine and don’t need help, because I know I can be much worse. Any amount of mental illness is worthy of help. No mental illness struggle is too small. Be compassionate to yourself besties.I tend to dissociate often due to anxiety. I have cPTSD from adverse childhood experiences, but I’m in a safe, supportive environment now. Despite my current safe situation, I will start catastrophizing and then I unanchor from reality. At that point, I don’t feel stressed, but I also feel like I’m in a fog and clear thinking is an issue along with responsiveness. Numbness is blissful. But I have made goals and my problems aren’t getting any better when I am not present. I have found that giving myself pep talks has helped me confront the things that I had been compulsively avoiding. After getting something done that I had avoided for a long time, I feel actually good and not the never sated feeling that indulging a compulsion gives me. I’d like to learn how to be a better support person for myself. Does anyone know resources for developing pep talk skills? I want to be an emotional support pillar for myself. So I can remind myself how worthwhile my existence is and that attempting something is its own achievement and other mantras that can help me try despite the compulsive urge to withdraw far away from it all.I have enjoyed writing creatively since I was little. The issue is that my characters are always odd. And the stories don’t ever really make sense in a conventional way. The plot stutters, spirals, morphs and crumbles. So I knew I never wanted to write professionally, because it seems to irritate people when things in a story aren’t coherent. The thread followed a place my brain said would be interesting, so I don’t really have great justification for feedback on why character A did X. The story is chaos that I felt compelled to chase.It feels good taking fictional characters and just letting my schizotypy fly with them. It’s a nice outlet. I like sharing my stories on platforms, because I feed off positive comments. I have tried fanfic and rp, but I run into same issues with both where at some point people will try to get my story to be rational through a normie lens and then question what the hell is wrong with me. My brain is dysfunctional is the short answer, but I feel like my stories can still be deep, compelling, entertaining, and interesting despite that. I like to write but being judged saps away all the anticipatory joy. I can’t write for an audience, and I can’t write without an audience. But I really love creative writing.My thoughts often get disordered. I can hold them together for brief interludes of clarity, but they tumble into a mess (despite my efforts). I want to form a coherent response because I know that is the appropriate thing to do when someone talks to you, but my mind dysfunctions and coherent communication becomes a capability I lack. People’s faces seem so significant, that I lose the thread of thought if I let myself watch them. I need to look somewhere quiet and calm because keeping my grip on that thread requires all the focus I can muster. I remember these people are important to me even when I can’t feel their importance anymore. It’s not me that is broken. It’s a thought disorder that creates challenges that I am attempting to manage. I hope everyone I love understands that I am still very much the person they always loved. There is just interference between myself and my brain that makes my thoughts, speech, and actions take odd and bizarre turns. I still want to be recognized as valid and worthwhile. Despite all the evidence to the contrary.My childhood was kind of lacking, so I’m trying to do things to make up for it now. I joined a local rocket launching club, and I assembled and painted a rocket I bought as a kit to bring to my first meeting. It came with some lame decals to decorate the rocket. I was so proud of my work sanding the balsa fins, carefully gluing the components, and spray painting it a nice royal blue that I didn’t want to make it dull with generic stickers. So I googled a picture of Bomb Devil from Chainsaw Man. The manga is black and white but I wanted my decal to pop, so I used an app to change the image’s blacks to bright yellow and the grays to vivid green. I used a silver sharpie on the side of the rocket to make it look like the blue rocket had been torn open and Bomb Devil had been lurking inside.I’m stupidly proud of my cardboard and balsa wood rocket, I hope it flys well at this rocket launching group thing. Even if it doesn’t launch great, at least it looks extremely amazing.Also, I showed off my rocket to my partner and he was very nice about it. It must be hard being in a relationship with someone that gets excited about putting stickers on things like they are four years old. He’s a really great guy for just rolling with it. He told me that it actually looks very cool (he strongly dislikes anime so it was super nice of him to say that).Just sharing my story like a form of journaling, but if anyone else has some inner child work they want to flex then please be my guest.Sometimes I just like to upvote random shit on Reddit. I don’t have the patience to read it, but I figure someone may be a little happier to see the upvotes and it cost me nothing. I also have a bit of a sadistic tendency, and I like to fantasize that someone’s bad take is getting upvoted so now they may be under the false impression that someone else has approvingly judged their content to be insightful/clever/wise/ witty or whatever they were going for. Spreading chaos also feels rewarding. It’s really cool that I get to exist in a time when I can just tap, tap this magic artifact connected to other souls and sow happiness and mayhem.Alexithymia is difficulty recognizing or describing emotions. My therapist has challenged me to understand my emotional state better, but it’s hard for me to pin down my emotions as they are occurring. I might know I’m upset or distressed, but I can’t work out a more nuanced understanding. And it’s so tempting to bury or repress those feelings before I lose control to them.Even positive emotions are challenging for me to understand. I was feeling okay about things and I thought I must have been experiencing depression, because in the past it’s only been during episodes of anhedonia where I don’t feel stressed and anxious. But I didn’t feel apathetic or like I couldn’t care about things. It took me a while to figure out that what I was feeling was not depression at all but was actually contentment.DAE relate to alexthymia?. I’ve been calling about Adderall to every pharmacy within 70+ miles. I’ve had an interesting experience with 2 or 3 small non-chain pharmacies. They tell me that they won’t take new customers that are looking to get Adderall refilled, due to the shortage. I thought that was pretty cool, because I know my local Walmart that I faithfully have used for seven years could not care less about my patronage.I was thinking when this shortage is over, it might be nice to switch to a non-chain pharmacy that denies new customers in an effort to take care of their existing ones. I put the flair as “tips/suggestions” because I wasn’t really sure how to flair it. I thought it was a nice policy for people interested, but obviously doesn’t do much to help anyone in current crisis (like myself).T/w angry rant ahead What the hell is the oppression Olympics between AvPD and SzPD all about with some people on this sub? There are all these casual mentions of things like “well my life sucks but at least I’m happy I don’t have SzPD” that keep showing up lately.Why not just say something about being relieved not having to experience **social anhedonia**? It’s not the only symptom experienced by people with SzPD, although it seems to be simplified into that.I don’t understand the obsessive need of some of the people in this sub to glorify that they are somehow winning against other mental ill people simply because they don’t experience social anhedonia.Experiencing social anhedonia is not a intentional choice of people with Schizoid PD. It would be like saying people with ADHD are choosing to be inattentive.Also, there is a lot more to SzPD then the one symptom that some people in this sub seem to be hyperfixating on. END RANT. I have had mild, transient psychosis where I experience grandiose or paranoid delusions and racing thoughts. I was wondering if psychosis could be thought of as another negative symptom, because it seems like my mind loses the capability of discernment and criticality. I experience an idea as flawless and irrefutable simply because my mind no longer shades thoughts with any uncertainty. They feel as real as the pain from stubbing my toe. It seems absurd to question their veracity and I’m annoyed beyond belief by people that seem skeptical of my delusions because they feel like the clearest thoughts I’ve ever had even though I can’t explain why I feel that way about them. It’s the same thing with racing thoughts, suddenly all the random things I perceive crowd into my consciousness for attention. There must have been some filter that my brain usually applies to only bring useful things to my attention. But that filter has diminished capacity so suddenly the trees, animals, and people are so vivid that it all seems extremely significant. Everything is significant because my brain just keeps overwhelming me with meaning. My consciousness is so poorly equipped for tackling the millions of things my brain (when not psychotic) notes and discards unconsciously.I know very little about this extremely complicated organ inside my skull. But I really appreciate all it does for me, because there is so much it does without me ever realizing until things start going wrong.I guess calling psychosis a negative symptom is not very helpful. I just feel like it’s not my brain adding things to my reality it is just experiencing diminished capability when it comes to filtering, critical analysis, and discernment.I have dependent personality traits. I was severely enmeshed in romantic relationships. I was abusive when I’d rage. I saw people for who I wanted them to be and not for who they were. I sought to fix people to feel good about myself. I resented that I was always putting myself out, but I had this certainty that being human meant suffering.I remediated those tendencies, because I didn’t want to be abusive. I forced emotional distance between myself and others and refused to center my universe around other people. Years later I learned about boundaries to protect myself. I also am in therapy to figure out my personality disorder and schizophrenia spectrum symptoms. Fast forward to today, and I think I have codependency successfully managed. I never went to CoDA or read Codependent No More, but I hear it praised a lot on this sub. I just kept myself accountable and committed to learning healthy coping mechanisms in therapy and getting my self worth and anxiety issues addressed.Is there more to learn in that book? What parts really resonated and helped?. A few years back I had been invited to a neighbor’s outdoor bbq party. I went even though I’m socially awkward because I liked the neighbor. There were a bunch of people that brought their kids too. And the neighbor had a pool that the kids were swimming in. I stood beside the pool in a group of adults. I wasn’t able to participate in the conversation, so I stood by like a wallflower and just rested my eyes on the kids playing in the pool. Then I noticed that one kid was behaving really bizarrely in the pool. He kept bobbing his head right at the surface of the water but not really coming all the way up. Other children were laughing, splashing, and swimming right beside this boy. Five other adults stood beside me chatting as though nothing was amiss. Everything was so noisy, but that little boy kept bobbing under with his arms and feet waving silently under the water. I felt alarm bells ringing in my head, and it was so weird that everyone was being nonchalant and chatting. I thought I must be misunderstanding something. I yelled out, “is that boy okay?” while pointing at the little kid. Luckily, once I spoke a woman beside me instantly stopped chatting, jumped into the water, swam to the boy, and hauled him out of the pool. He was choking and spluttering on water. I couldn’t believe the boy had actually been drowning because it’s nothing like on tv. It turns out when people are drowning they don’t scream. Their lungs gulp in air before they go back under and there is no time to exhale or yell. The woman that jumped in was the real hero, but I am thankful that I was socially awkward and able to raise the alarm. And now I know what drowning looks like, so I won’t hesitate in the future to jump in.Note: the parents of the boy were nearby at the time, and I think they had other little ones that had been holding their attention. The whole thing happened so quick and it could have been catastrophic.EDIT: just sharing because there is some benefit to not having great social skills.I have this issue with my brain where it is extremely limited to on/off responses. I either care about something to paranoid levels or I find it impossible to care at all. Like I am paralyzed in fear about the fate of humanity or the cruelty of the world at one time and at another I would feel unperturbed to find the world burning. I want to fix these on/off switches so they are analog dials. I want to have healthy amounts of feeling about things.This manifests in more ways then just feelings. It’s like the reward system in my brain is stuck on flood levels or famine levels. If I do something impulsive it’s like a tidal wave is activated in my mind, and my mind compulsively urges me to keep doing impulsive behaviors. For example, I have terrible social anxiety, and I did something impulsive to reach out to make friends and it went really well. I texted a few of my neighbors to share late morning coffee with me at my home. (My home is obsessively clean at the moment because I either live in filth or live in a Mr. Clean commercial). Everything went so wonderful. Two neighbors accepted and even though my home is nothing special it shined without a single particle of dust observable. I made a few social blunders but both neighbors were so accommodating and easy going that it didn’t signify at all. The experience was like manna from Heaven to a starving person. I always overthink things but this time I took a leap and it was so exhilarating. But now my brain is stuck in impulsive mode. I had been vigilant about paying down my credit cards and gotten them down to zero, but guess what? I have dreamed of taking photos of nature and my bestbuy card is empty, so I impulsively spent $1600 on a new camera and peripherals. I am going to see if I can return the camera because being in debt is hell. But I was so fucking sure that being impulsive and not overthinking would keep making me happy.How do I achieve a nuanced appreciation for things? I want to experience life without being subject to the whims of dysfunctional chemical imbalances tearing through billions of neurons.I experience alogia, and I was looking into getting non-vocal cards from Etsy that I can use to gracefully indicate to others that I am unable to speak right now in a way that is coherent or meaningful.Etsy has cards for people with ASD, but I don’t think the verbiage is quite appropriate for alogia. The card says something like, “I cannot speak at the moment. Please be patient. I understand you, and my mind is functioning well.” I was uncomfortable buying the cards, since alogia means my mind is dysfunctioning and lost the capability to meaningfully vocalize. In my case, the poverty of speech is transient but when it happens I can’t fix it myself. I just have to wait it out.I understand what is being said to me, but my mind has lost its capability to spontaneously form a response. It would be a lie to indicate to others that my mind is functioning well.I’m thinking about contacting the Etsy seller to see if they can change the text to something else. I don’t want to go into personal details about my diagnosis, but I do want others to understand it’s not cause for alarm.I want to express:- I have been diagnosed with a disorder that can cause speech deficits. - I understand what is being said to me, but I’m unable to respond at the moment.- When this deficit occurs it is typically transient, and I may recover with quiet and patience.- This deficit is not a cause to be alarmed or disturbed and is just part of the deck of cards life handed me that I’m doing what I can to manage.Does that sound good? DAE have suggestions?. My new year resolution is to make a friend this year. Since it’s the first week of January I’ve been pretty goal oriented about it. Luckily, I became obsessive about cleaning my home in December. So I had this idea to invite people over for some casual get together. I was part of a group chat between four of my neighbors when one of their dogs got out two years ago. I revived the long dead group chat to invite them over Saturday morning to share a mug of coffee or tea at my house because I got a bunch of Keurig things for Christmas. (The line about getting Keurig things for Christmas was a white lie, because I I have an old Keurig and I figure I can buy some Keurig things if anyone accepts my invite).Amazingly, two of four neighbors on long dead group chat replied positively that they’d love to stop by my house for a coffee.I bought a couple boxes of K cups and I tested out my old Keurig and it still works. I’m really anxious/excited about having neighbors over for a little get together. I am sure it will go well, because I can be really cordial and pleasant when I’m mentally prepared. Plus, I have the home field advantage. I’m not sure if my neighbors will become my friends, but I think inviting people over once a month will be a nice way to socialize.I am proud of myself for calling a dozen pharmacies this morning to attempt to find someone with Adderall in my prescribed formulation in stock.I like pharmacies that are part of a grocery store better because they seem to pick up the phone sooner (in my experience) than the chain pharmacies. The automated voice things that keep insisting on being able to answer my question are annoying. I want to start making note of which pharmacies are easier to get actual humans that can relay whether my meds are in stock. My fave response this morning was a pharmacist team member that replied “nooooooooo,” really quietly and drawn out when I asked. Because that was my feeling too about the drug shortage.No luck finding Adderall in stock yet, but I think I have developed a really good verbiage on exactly how to ask in as few words as possible and a quick graceful response to a negative now. I no longer attempt to ask about when they expect more Adderall, because no one knows and it seems to bother the pharmacist team members that they don’t know. Good luck to everyone that is also searching for the elusive meds to fill their script. And to all of you gorgeous people that got your script filled, I hope to join your ranks soon.My psychologist was explaining to me that the root cause of my insecurities is that I feel that no one understands me. But I disagreed. At the time, I lacked the capacity to properly communicate why I disagreed, but upon reflection I think the root cause of my distress with interpersonal relationships is my anxiety over not being accepted. I used to always push myself to mask to be perceived as acceptable and appropriate to other people. But masking feels hollow and performative, so I’m now trying to just be myself without a mask around other people. I feel good around people that accept me even when I stop being coherent. I often don’t understand myself, so it’s really bothersome to have other people insist on understanding me. I feel like understanding is unrealistic, and that acceptance is more than enough to make me feel secure about myself.I just want to be accepted as valid and worthwhile without anyone concerning themselves over my occasionally dysfunctional brain processes.DAE feel this way? I’d like to be able to explain to my therapist the difference between acceptance and understanding. Because I want to be seen as normal even when I’m not understandable.I sometimes stumble in conversation and then I lose my ability to recover. For instance, I attempt to say, “thank you” to a clerk but I vocalize, “mook yoo.” Or I attempt a joke that doesn’t land and my brain just gives up on any idea other than suggesting I repeat the joke with different emphasis placements. This usually causes the other person to look at me like I’m acting odd or bizarre. I used to ramble or rant to excuse or rationalize my incoherence, but the rationalizations would die off as I doubted how well I was expressing myself.Now that I know that alogia is a symptom of schizotypal disorder, I’m trying to be more accepting of my limitations rather than mask.Is there a graceful way to indicate to others that I can no longer converse?. I haven’t experienced empathy, so I’m not sure what it feels like to have that perception. But whenever I read that someone can turn off empathy it sounds really impressive to me. So I’m just wondering if this is like some extra sensory perception that can be activated at will. Something analogous to a superpower that can just be toggled on and off. Or maybe some higher state of control of automated bodily functions through meditation.Or is turning off empathy just dissociation? Because I experience dissociation when I get stressed, and it’s not a cool thing so I’ll stop being impressed if that’s what is meant by turning it off.I started working (programmer) in an office again because I told my manager that working virtually was isolating and not good for my mental health. My employing company had acquired a smaller company near where I live so I was given a desk to use at their office. No one in this office knows my diagnosis (my manager knows), they were just informed that I would appreciate use of one of their desks for work.On my first day, when I was being led around the office a coworker pointed out that he liked parking in the back of the lot because he could keep an eye on his car. The office is in a nice commercial area. Our city has a low crime rate, and there are security cameras around the building and lot. But I understand that some people like to be extra sure for a myriad of reasons. So I thanked him because I would definitely like to be able to glance out the window to be sure of my car still being there. Because I tend to worry that it may be towed if I parked somewhere wrong. Or that I left my lights on. Or that I will forget entirely where I parked it. Or that I left my windows down. But now I can just glance and be reassured. It is very calming to see my car just exactly where I remember parking it earlier.So I’ve been having a hard time accepting schizotypal disorder, but I’m getting there. I told my work (programmer) because I have been having a hard time with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (I thought it was some weird mixed BP episode, but I guess schizophrenia makes more sense). I told my manager and her supervisor, in case I get into a psychotic episode someone will at least know to call my spouse for meds. No one else knows, because I am still working full time and I still want to work full time. I think structure and routine will keep my mind in better equilibrium. Anyway, it’s so new at work because I have this office that I got transitioned too, because I told them working at home was isolating and wasn’t healthy for me. So I now do part days in office and then go home after lunch to walk my dogs and work virtually the rest of the day. I have a new team and they seem nice. I uploaded some work to our servers and let my teammates know. A little later and one teammate sent a message saying they thought my work was “amazing.” and then my other teammate said “this is great.”I know NPD is a bad coping mechanism but it is such a rush too. My work was pretty good, not my best but still it’s so gratifying because I stop feeling dead inside. Why does impressing people give me such a high? I just want to drown in admiration because I’m so terrified. And those messages from my teammates were life giving. I feel like I can still be me. Whatever little fragile parts of me are left. I cherish them.I got my first car and was a server at a restaurant and I was barely getting by on my income. My car would make clacking noises occasionally from the engine compartment, and if a friend was with me they’d most likely tell me that I should bring my car to an auto shop because that doesn’t sound good. I’d tell them how the noise always goes away, and I think my car just fixes itself sometimes because it knows it’s owner is deadass broke. My friend would laugh and I’d laugh too because it was nice to believe that cars cared about us too. And I thought that was ‘wishful thinking’ because it was obvious to me that cars are not alive but it’s a comforting thought that I liked to indulge in when I couldn’t possibly pay the repair shop bill. Is there any difference between magical thinking and wishful thinking? Is it magical when it’s disruptive to my life? It is fairly comforting when I really think I can’t do any better. But maybe it’s making me too complacent sometimes.There was such a drive to bottle up and control and clamp things down and run a tight ship and laugh the right amount and at the appropriate volume and when in doubt it’s always best to under react and tilt my head as I smile because my crooked grin is irresistible and walk with a swagger and keep my chin high and look ready to fight and hold myself steady and remind myself this shirt looks really good on me and think over jokes that didn’t land because I know I am funny if I can just figure out the one little mistake I made…Because it’s always just a small flaw. It’s just I have a bit of insecurity about a few small things that are really no big deal. I can wave them off and it’s as though they don’t even exist because they are so insignificant no one will be able to find them. I can plan out exactly how things will happen and account for all the variables and I’m a god. I’ve got omniscience. I’ve thought of everything so I can shine as bright as the human souls. I’m okay, because everyone has issues with their parents and everyone has a little trouble with focus and everyone gets a little lost in their thoughts and I don’t know why people have to be so rude to point out that I’m staring off into space like I’m a corpse and no I’m not stoned because my mind does this to me without any drugs needed. It’s just a little mood disorder. My thoughts are just a little delusional but everyone has a bit of that. Who isn’t afraid? We all have worries, mine are nothing special. We all get a little upset. It’s all so close to what everyone feels, so why do I get lost in my mind. Why can’t I organize my thoughts? Why do words twist as they come out my mouth into adjacent sounds that aren’t quite right? Why do I keep compulsively reading over what I wrote doubting it makes any sense at all? My psychologist said I’m schizotypal, but it’s too overwhelming. I can’t have a mild form of schizophrenia. Doesn’t my psychologist understand that I have a pathological need for control? I avoid anything that could affect my perception of reality. I am terrified of losing my rationality. Isn’t this everyone’s worst fear?If I ever had the slightest idea that I was schizophrenic, then I would have been so much more compassionate with myself. My mind really tried so hard to perform for me even while it has been crumbling apart.I was working with a psychologist that I trusted and she told me that I overpathologize. She believes that the diagnoses of BP and ADHD I have from my psychiatrist are invalid, because I have a schizotypal personality structure that lends me to believe there are problems where they don’t exist. I asked her why I had trouble with focus, and why I had manic episodes where I would drain my bank account and engage in risky behaviors. She told me that I was stressed, and that stress alone made it hard for me to focus and led me to risky behaviors. She said my notion of manic and depressive was just my body getting fatigued and needing recovery because I didn’t feel sad during what I perceive as depressive episodes (I only feel apathetic), so they couldn’t have been true depressive episodes. She said because I perceived improvements on meds, I deluded myself into thinking I had actual disorders. I continued to attempt to reason with my psychologist. I said, “But ADHD and bipolar have disrupted my life and without management I would not be able to function successfully.” She responded by saying, “Yes, I am sure it feels that way to you.” That phrase triggered my emotional baggage from my momma issues (my mom loved telling me I was just making up problems for attention no matter how much pain I was feeling), so I immediately split on my psychologist. I called her out for being an egotistical quack that was more interested in using tactics of oppression than helping solve actual problems of her clients. She reacted with shock. I continued to rage about her incompetency with colorful language as I watched her get nervous and agitated. I found her agitation hilarious, because she seemed to minimize my high score for sadistic personality. She told me not to feel like I was a bad person just because that score was high. I had tried to tell her that I agreed with the high score and she had responded with a smirk and an indulgent attitude, like “sure if you want to believe it then it’s okay.” She told me that I always internalize my anger, so I was happy to prove her wrong since I devalued and despised her. I think she may have infantized me because of my schizotypal personality structure (or because I had been extremely vulnerable and sensitive since I dropped my haughty, arrogant mask during evaluation), so she refused to accept that I truly enjoy ripping apart the people I despise.Upon reflection, I can see some validity in her theory that my mental health disorders are delusional. But my psychiatrist that helps me manage BP and ADHD with appropriate meds has known me for over ten years and never suspected I was delusional. He initially thought I had MDD, until BP seemed more likely especially because my youngest brother jumped off the side of a ravine and suffered permanent spinal injuries during a manic episode where he was feeling euphoric and was convinced he could soar across the ravine.It’s nice that splitting can keep me safe from losing faith in my own judgement. Because even if I am the boy who cries wolf that doesn’t mean that there aren’t actual wolves (sometimes) that I’m struggling to manage. I talked over my rage episode with my therapist, and she said that appropriately expressing anger is a good way to protect myself. She said we can work on ways to help me manage my temper, but she was glad that I communicated my anger and frustration for mistreatment to my ex-psychologist.I went to a psychologist for an evaluation of personality disorders, and they evaluated me for ADHD and ASD as well as part of the process. When I got the results they told me they don’t think my ADHD diagnosis is valid. I got diagnosed when I was 25 years old and am currently 40. The psychologist said it was because I showed up to my appointment on time, and I stayed focused throughout the evaluation without asking for breaks. I told them that I had taken my prescribed meds the day of the evaluation.She said that since I’ve been on Adderall for 15 years, but have not improved and still rely on it, that I must just be dependent on it and not actually have ADHD. I have only ever taken my prescribed dosage that I established with my psychiatrist years ago. After initial fine tuning, the amount has never fluctuated from 20mg in morning and 20mg before 2pm (so it doesn’t interfere with sleep). I wasn’t aware that Adderall was meant to cure ADHD, since I thought it was a genetic condition. I tried to google for studies but couldn’t find any. Has anyone else heard this?EDIT: Not seeking medical advice. I will be discussing the psychologist’s concerns with my psychiatrist at my next medication management appointment in January. I’m just extremely curious about this, in the meantime.EDIT 2: In the psychologist’s written report the exact wording is “While x was diagnosed with ADHD at age 25, the symptoms do not appear to have remitted despite consistently taking medication. During evaluation, his motor movements were calm and normative. He did not engage in fidgeting behavior throughout the testing period and refused breaks. Generally he appeared to be attentive throughout the process.” The psychologist was particularly concerned that I exhibited a schizotypal personality structure which often leads to misunderstanding and overpathologizing, so I’m not saying the psychologist is wrong. I’m just very surprised that she expected ADHD symptoms to go away after taking meds for 15 years.I grew up in the 80s and I remember watching “9 to 5” as a kid when it was on tv. I think the premise of the movie went over my head (I didn’t understand what sexism was), but I fell in love with my perception of it. I remember watching Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda, and Lily Tomlin strut across their office in high heels, perfectly coiffed hair, bright lipstick, and sky high shoulder pads, and I thought they looked majestic. They had struggles in their lives, but they were glamorous and rose above it. I liked the neat, orderly office environment with typewriters clacking and how the office workers all acted so cool and professional. My home life was pretty chaotic and dysfunctional, but I fantasized that I could grow up to get an office job and be fabulous doing it. I did grow up, and I became a programmer. I don’t get dressed up for work (except for interviews), because I got lazy and I also feel more badass by being smart about things then spending time on my wardrobe. But when I was thinking of careers “working in an office” was one of my primary criteria (because of that fantasy that I never gave up).Just wondering if anyone else relates to this.I was picking at the scab of my childhood trauma in another post to this sub, and inevitably it focused on my mom. My trauma with my dad is more due to him being a non-entity that couldn’t be bothered, so there is substantially less material to pick at there. A commenter said something that I interpreted as a nice attaboy for me working through my momma issues. I expressed my gratitude for their validation and replied that “I have a lot of respect for women” and other non-relevant stuff. Since I have this habit of chewing over things I say or write to figure out if I was being an asshole, I’ve been wondering if that was chauvinistic. On reflection, the words sound patronizing, which certainly was not my intention.I’d like opinions from women, because even though I’m not one, I do consider myself a feminist and I want to fix any bad takes I have.TL;DR: Is saying ‘I have a lot of respect for women’ chauvinistic? I beseech the gorgeous women that stumble on this post to point me towards the path of not being an asshole.EDIT: When I was writing that phrase I was thinking I’d like to make clear that I’m not a misogynist that generalizes my mom being abusive into discrimination against the female gender. So it may have been better to say that directly rather than digress about respect and come off as chauvinistic and patronizing.From a young age, my mom treated me coldly and with disdain. My earliest memories are her being upset that I was laughing with other little kids when I couldn't do somersaults. The kids in the playgroup kept laughing when I kept failing at it. I laughed too, because it was fun playing with the other kids. I didn't particularly care whether I could crouch down and roll around in ball form or not. But my mom was horrified. She dragged me away from the playgroup and told me that all the kids were laughing at me not with me. I was making myself into a joke. I remember how quickly I went from joy to crumbling apart. My mom was always telling me that she would point out my flaws, so I wouldn't hear them from others and get hurt by that. I used to think she was consciously trying to make me feel like shit, but I think she was just severely mentally ill. Because she loved us more than anything. She hated my dad. She hated other people. She never did anything for herself. She just obsessed over her kids and relentlessly did whatever she believed would turn all of us into hugely successful adults. If we deviated from the path she had planned for us she would rage at us. She was so certain that she absolutely knew what was the only right thing for all of us, and that we would all suffer for the rest of our lives if we entertained any opinions that didn't match her own.My mom broke all of us. My younger brothers have substance use disorders. My older sister is extremely violent and abusive. I have NPD, codependency, social anxiety, and cPTSD. I don't blame my mom for my BP or ADHD (because those are genetic and not from shitty parenting), although I do blame my mom for buying me diet pills full of caffeine when I couldn't focus because she found that stimulants made it easier for her to focus on things. She couldn't allow herself or her kids to get diagnosed with ADHD, so she just hooked us up with over the counter weight loss pills full of caffeine. I don't know why it's important to me to write this out. I guess I just see a lot of demonization of pwNPD, but my mom isn't the evil mastermind that seems to be the popular stereotype of a narcissist. She is actually just really fucking scared of other people to the extent of being phobic about it, but she needs other people's approval in order to function so she developed all these maladaptive behaviors to compensate. Narcissism was my mom's armor that let her cope with phobias she couldn't manage. She would smile broadly and charm people whenever we went out, and then once we got home she'd ridicule us if we got to close to anyone else. She'd berate us for being so naive and stupid when it was so clear to her that the other people didn't sincerely appreciate us. She was hypervigilant of other people's opinion so that she could be ready to condemn and cut ties. She taught all of us to never trust anyone that wasn't immediate family, because everyone is just out for themselves and that the world is just interested in finding weakness and exploiting it. She ran our family like it was her own personal cult to keep the outsider threat at bay. I don't know if this insight is going to help me or not in the long term. I only know that at the moment, it twists my insides thinking about how my life has been spent in fear of other people. I've deluded myself for so long that I wasn't afraid. I deluded myself that I was stronger than my mom. But I let the same disease that drove my mom to destroy her children, devour me as well. I wonder how I lived 40 years without ever realizing this.I recognized that I was feeling resentful and my knee jerk reaction was to condemn the person and plot my revenge. After a few minutes of stewing in my thoughts of tearing them apart, I realized I was irritated because of their actions but also because of lack of sleep and other shit. I decided to just talk to the dude about his actions and my perception of lack of regard on his part. It was fucking wild because he just apologized and agreed, and it was over like that. This shit used to be harder I swear. Wtf was the point of growing up in a household where everything was psychological warfare?? I have all these toxic traits that are at best cumbersome and stressful. Fuck my existence. I hate that I have to unlearn all the shit that let me survive growing up with undiagnosed, mentally ill parents. Fuck my parents and fuck everyone that thinks I came from a good home. I fucking hate that I am a wreck. Why the fuck is being mentally ill, such a fucking trial. I want to be compassionate to myself but it’s fucking overwhelming. I feel like I’m in a marathon after being mentally atrophied my whole life. Maybe physical exercise can help me chase out the demons I’ve grown in my head. They have outstayed their welcome.I was wondering why I have such a hard time clicking on notifications for text messages or emails. I used to think it was because I worried they’d be negative, but sometimes I don’t think that’s the only reason. I worry that someone will need me for emotional support and I’ll fail them. They might have a good impression of me because I was strong once, but I was just lucky and had once been helpful. I’m really an incoherent mess, and learning that might make them feel cheated. Because I had once fooled them unintentionally into thinking I was reliable.I’m trying to manage these kinds of unhelpful thoughts better. It’s just so tempting to let them paralyze me and drive me to avoid others. It’s so tempting to let go and fall away. I want to get stronger and indulging my fears is keeping me weak. Habit is my prison cell and I’ve locked myself inside. My bars are real because something inside me is keeping them that way. Can I give that part of me compassion and love? The part of me that entraps me.I started therapy for an anxiety disorder, because I had been working (programmer) 16 hour days for months and I had so much anxiety about work that I would feel nauseous driving to the office.My boss was an asshole. He would ridicule people on my team and call them stupid and morons. I would work myself tirelessly to get a feature delivered in our software to be told that I hadn’t understood the requirements and to start over. If I attempted to get priorities set because there wasn’t enough time to get all the promised features and bug fixes, he’d tell me that everything was top priority. Then he’d guilt trip me about all the overtime he puts in every week that no one appreciates.I assumed I was the one with the problem. I saw other people on my team reject the extra work and marveled, because it seemed impossible for me to decline my boss’s requests. I figured I would just have to dig deep and keep pulling all nighters regardless of how weary I felt. My team depended on me, and I couldn’t let them down even if our boss was a huge asshole.When my anxiety was drowning me, I realized I needed help, so I used my company’s eap (employee assistance program) to ask for a therapist’s help managing my anxiety disorder.I was in such terrible denial about the extent of my problems. I just thought I needed to learn how to manage anxiety because it was consuming my existence and interfering with my life and work.This American Thanksgiving I am thankful for my therapist. He patiently helped me with CBT for anxiety. He helped provide insight into the dysfunctional relationship I had with my boss. He persisted in asking about my childhood even though I was adamantly in denial of it being anything less than perfect. Because of my therapist I was able to advocate for myself and understand my maladaptive behaviors better and how to manage them. He never told me I was codependent, he just guided me towards ways to remediate those tendencies. It was only after I had finished CBT for anxiety and stopped therapy that I reflected on those therapy sessions and I saw how he helped me with all these aspects of myself that I was unwilling to confront.I now have recovered from codependency, am working through cPTSD from my abusive childhood, and sought psychological evaluation that revealed bipolar and NPD. I am 40 and finally managing mental illnesses I’ve struggled with my entire adult life. I owe it all to my therapist that showed me mental health deserves professional treatment, because my health is important.I have spent most of my adult life trying to mask having ADHD. At work, I’d recheck emails several times before sending them to coworkers to make sure questions were answered succinctly without digressing. I’d measure the responses I planned on making before speaking to gauge whether they would be appropriate and appreciated by others. I’d berate myself mercilessly, if I’d let myself fall behind because I was letting down my team. I’d give myself anxiety about making appointments on time. My life felt like a performance for everyone else’s benefit, and if I let myself pause I felt hollow inside.So now I am trying out living without the mask for the first time in my life. I don’t act guarded and I don’t apologize. I explain my lateness but I don’t excuse it. So far no one has minded.Maybe it’s because I’ve gotten old or times have changed from when I was growing up in the 90s, but people seem much more accepting than I thought they’d be of my mind being off kilter from the typical way of interacting with the world. No one seems perturbed that I randomly digress, and it’s exciting to see other people digress into their own passions.I find people to be a lot more interesting then I ever gave them credit for. I wonder if I was too worried about my own appearance and passing as neurotypical to appreciate the interesting things about the people and world around me.Living with ADHD has never made my life easier or better, and I’m glad I have meds and therapy for managing when it becomes disruptive to my own goals. I do not love this disorder, but I’ve accepted it as part of me. The disorder is not good or bad, it’s just there to spin my mind counter-clockwise when the world was made for minds going clockwise.I’ll be in the middle of talking about some childhood bullshit with my therapist and just tears start falling. And it surprises me, because until I had started crying I hadn’t even realized I was sad. Anyone else relate to this? Because I don’t know if it’s a npd thing or trauma thing. But I always assumed the normal thing was to feel sad, and then you cry when you are really sad. I’m just talking regular and suddenly my throat chokes on the words and I have water works going on.I don’t mind feeling sad, and I’m glad I can feel sad about sad things that happened. I’m just so surprised, because it seems to come out of nowhere. I go from feeling perfectly fine to crying in the span of a couple words, so it’s a bit overwhelming.Journal Setup- Get a three ring binder, a ream of paper, and three tabs to make distinct sections- label first tab “Past”- label second tab “Current”- leave last tab unlabeled and put all the blank pages after this last tabGeneral Idea- Only pull in pages to “Current” from unlabeled as needed- “Current” is where you note all mental health concerns or other things you want to bring up in therapy- After therapy session pull everything out of “Current” and put in “Past” section - Now no matter how shitty “Current” was you’ve discussed with therapist and start with clean slate.- The “Past” that you’ve journaled is still there if helpful to review, but I keep focus on “Current.”My Therapy journaling procedure (for anyone interested in the nitty gritty details)- take out page from last unlabeled tab and put it in “Current”- daily or as often as works write in mental health concerns as they occur. Stressful things, things I’m not managing or coping with, things that I am guilty or ashamed about, things that are disruptive to my life, no problem is too big or too small for therapy- Before therapy session take out a new blank page form third tab and title “Review Page” read through “Current” section with a blank page beside you to take notes on things that I want to talk over with therapist. My therapist typically asks me about my mood in beginning of session so after reading through I usually have good sense of prevailing mood and emotions so I can note those as well.- At start of session I open third tab and pull out a blank page where I write “Therapy Session” and date. During session anything that my therapist and I decide I should try to work on is written here. - During therapy keep the “Review Page” in front to check off discussing or at least mentioning the things from “Current” to discuss.- After session, I pull out all the pages from “Current” by unsnapping binder and put them in “Past” section.- I put “Review Page” behind them in “Past” as a nice summary of whatever that past was- I put “Therapy Session” page into the empty “Current” section. Since it’s first page in section, every time I open to “Current” I am reminded of things I wanted to work on or think over from last therapy session- Repeat process foreverMy thoughts about this journal technique- it feels cathartic to me to take all the heavy things or if I am depressed probably no pages, and start after each session with a clean slate. Those things have been discussed and now I’m trying to focus on other ways to manage disruptions in my life. In other words, it feels really good to leave the past behind me. It’s still reachable but it’s not staring at me.- I feel like I’m writing my own life story. As more pages go to “Past” it’s like my therapist is my book editor and giving me advice on how to manage where things go badly so maybe “Current” chapter shows improvement in small ways.- I like the third tab unlabeled because even though I could call it “Future” that feels weird since the pages are always blank. But having lots of blank pages makes me feel hopeful like there is still a lot of time to get my story right, so that my life finally becomes what I want it to be.My cisgender mother had a lot of well meaning ideas on how to raise her AFAB child. For instance, if I rolled in the dirt in a dress I’d be scolded. My assigned gender would be used as a tool of oppression by my well intentioned mother. I’d be told, “little ladies don’t roll in the mud.” My mother’s words did nothing to curb my behavior and instead encouraged me. I wanted to roll in the mud until it covered me from head to toe to prove I was not a little lady. My total disregard for the prior reprimand had my mom really frustrated with me, so she dug deeper into gender stereotypes by following up with, “that is how boys behave.” Well, I didn’t want to behave like a little lady or a boy, so I was stuck doing nothing. My mom didn’t recognize my dilemma. She only saw that I had stopped misbehaving, and she seemed strangely unconcerned about relying on 1950s misogyny as a crutch for her parenting deficiencies.Being a kid, the subtlety of societal gender roles was lost on me. All I knew was that I didn’t want to act like a boy or a girl, and I existed in a state of limbo giving the appearance of behaving, because I had no valid choice. That third option of ‘neither’ eluded me for a long time.I can’t be bothered with the mundane acts of existing when I am hypomanic or depressive (albeit for completely different causes).Depressive:I feel exhausted and apathetic. I want to withdraw into myself and hibernate for months or years. Energy feels like a fairy tale, and I can’t believe it was once something I actually possessed not too long ago.Hypomanic:I want to chase my compulsions. They entice me that at the end of the pursuit I will feel something I’ve never felt namely ‘satisfied with myself.’ I am a programmer and I will tirelessly pour my entire being into coding the most elegant software architectures ever witnessed by man or machine. I write creatively as a hobby and I will obsessively write 80,000 words of an epic story that burns in my mind as though gifted to me by the muses of Ancient Greece. I am non binary AFAB and I will develop a graduate level thesis on how societal gender roles have oppressed woman into neurotic behavior and then blamed them for behaving neurotically. I have never formally studied gender issues, but I am feeling grandiose so I am certain these are the issues I faced when I was being raised female. I feel compelled to write my thoughts out and drag over them again and again despite all the duties I need to perform being neglected. But my mind is stuck harvesting thoughts sown in fields I never consciously chose with a rusty implement that requires multiple passes to harvest. The first reaping only caught the tallest crops, but those left behind could be extraordinary. Bills go unpaid, hygiene is irrelevant, sleep is unnecessary, and distractions are irritating. The compulsion becomes my reason for existence even though it is ephemeral and costs me everything I genuinely love. I scream in the darkness that my life is being lost. But my cries cannot reach anyone that cares. They only exist in my head, and I’m the villain of my own story.Their vs there. I write something out and then have to read that sentence multiple times to convince myself that I’ve used the appropriate one. I avoid either word when I can, but they are so natural in speech where it doesn’t matter so I gravitate towards them in writing too.I haven’t come up with a good way around this issue yet.I read the article [https://withaterriblefate.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/where-are-the-humans-in-nier-automata/](https://withaterriblefate.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/where-are-the-humans-in-nier-automata/), where the author lays the groundwork to propose that us, the players, were the source of machines developing sentience. Like an airborne disease, our presence in the game was transmitted to machines and infected their cores with the human capacity to think, fear, regret, blame, hope and despair. "The player’s sentience diffused in NieR: Automata amongst beings with the relevant kind of technology—that is, beings with machine cores. This explains why both YoRHa androids and machine lifeforms are susceptible to becoming sentient."I have racked my brain, but I can't remember very much being said about machine cores (maybe there is side material about it?). I think pod 042 told 2B that the cores were similar to plant cells, and later Pascal said that machines can be restored if the cores remain in tact. And finally, 9S found out that YoRHa black boxes are just repurposed machine cores, so that androids wouldn't feel bad about destroying YoRHa models after their usefulness was over.I think the theory that the transmission of our existence had embued machines with human sentiment explained some things in the game that weren't obvious, otherwise. For instance, the machine's behavior changes dramatically when we, the players, start to play the game. According to 2B and 9S, machines had never spoken, shown any emotional capacity, stood still while staring up at the sky, or tried to make whoopie before we began playing. After achieving endings A-D, our presence in-game is directly acknowledged (so this theory doesn't sound too far fetched). I think this first occurs when the pods ask if we want to go against the rules to preserve the YoRHa data. Also, during the credits fight, Pod 042 tells 153, "But when we six were connected and exchanging information, something... happened. I cannot deny the feeling of something resembling consciousness and emotion being born." The only "we six," I can imagine Pod 042 referring to is 3 YoRHa, 2 pods, and 1 player. Sorry other 2 pods we pick up along the way (and operator 210 and 60), but pod 042 didn't say "we seven," or "we nine," or leave ambiguous with just "we." To remove any lingering doubt, that we "canon" exist to the characters of the game, Pod 153 addresses us directly by name and as players after **!endinge**. "Pod 153 to player. Please respond to this query. Do you faithful player <the name we asked to be called in this game>, have anything you would like to say to other players?" So the article writer has direct in game evidence that our existence is the catalyst for the pods developing "consciousness and emotion." I'm not as sure whether there is evidence that the machine cores granted that capability or not. Although, if the protagonist's machine cores had a connection to the larger machine network, then based on Pod 042's statement about being connected with us, then that connection may have transmitted to machines as well.
    This must be how online millennials felt when the iPhone got released in 2007. Yet it’s the most important thing to NTs.It’s why the dude bros and mean popular girls bully us, because we think social skills is just about being nice. But I recently discovered there’s a subtle way to go about socializing that’s inherent to NTs. This is why they get this uncanny valley effect from us because to them, we’re crossing their boundaries and not obeying rules. I’d say most people have some of these traitsThen you have the chads, bbcs and charismatic people who can model, know everyone in their city and are successful people in generalThen the rest of us who have none. Literally they’re all so awkwardThis one middle aged dude with bald spots keeps mentioning things no one even asks about like computers and randomly asks people if they want coffee I feel bad but I think he’s autistic. Could they be returning soon?. I never seen my parents express affection or even hug in all my years of living.We never ever said I love you to each other.Every time a movie or show would come on, and there was a romantic scene we would cringe and skip it.They found these behaviors as embarrassing for some reason.Sex was never discussed even educationally and you would get hit for even saying the word. Like dropping a glass on accident, drawing on the wall, or staying too long with friends?My parents would break or smash my consoles if I played for more than a couple hours. I have to put in twice as effort and interest and then I decide not to talk anymore because they’re so fucking dry. I think one of the biggest contributors to loneliness (at least for Americans) is the fact that there is a severe lack of places to actually meet people. I live in the suburbs and there is actually no existing space where people can socialize. You have the grocery store, fast food restaurants, and miles of copy paste houses and roads. Maybe the closest thing is bars, but I don’t drink so that’s no my scene. People say you shouldn’t actively search for a relationship and we all know dating apps are useless, but I’m afraid it’s impossible without it. I’m not pursuing relationships and I’m off dating apps and I think these are good things, but if my time is spent working from home all day and the only time I’m around people I don’t know is at Walgreens and Publix, there is literally never a chance for those random encounters that could spark new friendships or a relationship. I could be the hottest most charismatic guy in the world, but living in total isolation in the suburbs would still mean there’s zero chance for anything to happen organically. I don’t know the solution to this, but I think it’s worth mentioning that this is a bigger problem than looks or personality. Finding someone is a game of chance, your attractiveness either improves or degrades your chances, but they’ll never be inherently zero. But in this isolated society, you never get enough chances to roll the dice. That’s the problem.In their mind they think FA = normal loneliness when it’s more than that it’s our default existence. I’ve never even had acquaintances Not exaggerating. Ever since I was a child I thought when people would get angry at something, feel joy, or burst into laughter I would think they’re exaggerating, I would think “why are they being so emotional? There’s nothing to feel about” then I would feel anger and envy brew up inside me, because I would then think “why can’t I experience that?”.But I now realize I was just projecting my inner emptiness onto others, my whole life I thought everyone was acting, and some were just better than others, I thought it was just all a game for everyone, I thought EVERYONE was just seeking validation and attention. Only now I’m realizing that it is not the case, with more research, my world is being opened upI’m realizing people who are not narcissists actually have rich inner worlds, they enjoy being around people, they enjoy life, they love themselves I feel like the grinch, I feel like I’ll never experience this magic, I’m just a dead empty flawed shell. I never cared as a kid but now all of a sudden I do and I’m 19 and I don’t know what to do now. Usually when people say they never had friends they’re exaggerating but I’m not I recently graduated and I never had friends in all my 12 years of school even since I was 5/6 I’ve only had like 2 acquaintances barely I never had friends in class and was passively bullied or ignored and how I have zero social skills and don’t know how to talk to human beings and I don’t go to school or get a job I don’t know what to do. Since I was 5/6 I never had a friend and probably only 2 acquaintances my entire life I’d go to school everyday and never talked and sat aloneI have zero social skills and don’t know how to make up for it. we were more like acquaintances andbut I’m lonely and desperate. And we don’t really have much in common. Just knew each other from school. When I was a kid, in my old yellow sun reality, the sun would set then the sky would turn dusk or orange. In this reality, it’s more common to see the sky as pink, purple, or even green when turning night. It looks pretty but I’m wondering if anyone else seen this difference. The old world before 2012-2015 had evil but not in the way this world is. It was more of a classic evil, and everyone was against it. murder, lying, and stuff. The evil in this world is more dimensional and the “norm” whenever something happens in the news nobody really cares or brushes it off quickly. In this world the evil is more spiritual and subtle. politicians, underlying narcissism, etc. I noticed most people in this reality have an underlying sense of carelessness and narcissism and apathy that was rarely found in the old world. Now the good, the good in the old world was amazing, a feeling you could really soak in. Emotions lasted longer. In the new world good times fleeting, and emotions change quickly. vibes are harder to feel. The old world felt like a rainbow, this current reality feels like different colors of gray white and black. I don’t know why I was transported to this new reality, but I think it was because I was too weak and bland for the old one.Seems like a complete shift and we just descended into clown world. Another thing I discovered not everyone had, I thought everyone saw the afterimage of bright lights or words on a computer for 1-2 seconds. It seems like after the shift in 2012-2015 people in this reality seem to have more of a 6th sense, like it’s harder to fool people here if that makes sense, if you lie or pretend to be someone you’re not they can see right through you. And can sense your “vibe” if that makes sense, and reality seems more fluid. Whereas in the previous reality people were less about vibes or spiritual stuff and you could easily fool people and life felt more “3D” real and set in stone. I don’t know if it’s a bad or a good thing but it’s kind of eerie how people can just sense you like that nowadays. How many of you are still unvaccinated?. 6 carbons 6 neutrons 6 electrons is the number of carbon, all life on earth. Is the beast = physical life and higher dimensions is perfection?. I've been thinking about psychology for a while, and we know human behavior and how you treat others is largely based on how you perceive the world. A nice person sees the world in a nice light and has a positive internal concious. I was wondering if psychopaths and narcissists lack empathy and are more likely to manipulate and harm others because they are less grounded in reality or have a form of dissociation/derealization. This is why they do those things is because they have an internal battle with themselves due to brain differences since birth, and don't feel real and therefore don't see others as real and as objects which makes it easier for them to do those things and project themselves onto others subconsciously.It's in movies, shows, daily life, people talking about it all the time. I can't even watch a fucking movie without there being some random sex scene in it not even relevant to the plot and the movie becoming awkward. I'm tired of life revolving around sex and dating. I don't mean having friends but you're not close, I don't mean just talking to your friends a few times a week, I don't mean having acquintance-friends, I dont mean just having online friends. i mean having ZERO people in your life that you talk to, and being completely alone basically everyday and being a shut in hikkikomori with zero social skills. I'm tired of people saying they have no friends but it's not the case. It just makes me feel even more alien. I experience DPDR and visual snow. I've been disconnected from reality since I was born and never felt like this body was mine. I've always felt disconnected from reality ever since I was born, but now its getting worse and I'm getting delusions and im becoming aware of it. I feel like other people feel more real than me and experience things more intense whereas I'm just floating around. Like im an NPC while everyone else can just express themselves without effort. I always see static in my vision. I dont feel like my body is mine either. I see these arms and legs in my vision but it doesnt feel like im in this body. Sometimes I'm just walking and jt feels like I'm in a simulation or everyone around me is fake. I look at human faces and they look distorted sometimes and i feel like an alien. Lately i started getting panic attacks during existential thoughts. Does anyone know how to fix this? I don't want to live like this and be depressed. In this timeline people casually talk about doing acid, weed, ectasy etc. People only smoked cigarettes in my old timeline. Been like this for 7 years. never hear interesting convos anymore. rarely meet an interesting person. it’s just hello good morning small talk or Netflix food and social media. I struggle socially and always been kind of introverted and awkward but it can get even worse when no one talks to you or ignores your convos. Now I have basically every anxiety disorder and symptoms and it’s to the point I can’t do anything. Anxiety isn’t just being nervous it’s way more than that and it’s awful. I haven’t had a friend in years and I’m lucky to even have a convo with a stranger sometimes, but when I do I never have things to talk about. Obviously hobbies and boring small talk but what else. How do you come up with interesting things to say. Best friends don’t just talk about hobbies all day. And I don’t even have hobbies I just sleep all day and eat. Whenever I see friends laughing what could they be talking about that’s so funny and interesting. A few weeks ago, I decided to try out a 5mg thc gummy. This is a super low dose and I never tried thc or any type of substance before. Mind you, I have taken CBD and nothing happened. Anyways I took the gummy and I felt more in the moment, there were some bad feelings lingering but I ignored it. The next day I ate one gummy and a half to see if it’s better and then I slept for 1-2 I hours think. I woke up in a panic sitting up in bed super fast randomly with my heart racing fast as shit, panic and my body feeling weird. I kept pacing and for some reason I called 911 and an ambulance came. I never had a panic attack before this ever. Fast forward a couple weeks and while I’m chilling on my phone a weird feeling comes over me and I get numb. I yell at my parents to take me to the ER. Is this my life now? Because I took that stupid gummy. Will I get these panic attacks? How do I cope?? Idk what to do I feel like dying I can’t handle this. My head and neck got a very cold sensation, tingling, and very numb. I swear it felt like I was going to lose consciousness. I just don’t get how a panic attack can generate physical symptoms. I only panicked because the physical symptoms started. Not the other way around. And I’m pretty sure i have OCD too so it’s like a feedback loop of negative thoughts which makes the attack worse. I couldn’t think straight and it felt like there were cotton balls in my brain. I went to the ER the 2nd time because my stupid brain can’t calm itself down and think logically. I don’t even do drugs and I probably look like a crazy tweaker when it happens. I think I’m going to get an MRI.
    I find that I have zero sexual attraction to women who are just as ugly and as dumb as me. I'm only attracted to women who are smarter and prettier than me. It's like my brain is wired wrong or something. Are any of you guys or gals the same?. I'm on day 7 and I just had this dream about f*cking this girl from behind really hard and pulling her hair, I dreamt that I had jerked myself off and couldn't stop myself but thankfully my boxers and peeny were dry when I actually woke up. I'm kind of worried about going to work and being around girls now lol.I keep having the same problem where the list of responsibilities at work keeps getting bigger and bigger and every week I feel more tired than the last week and even though I endlessly try to adapt my diet, sleep and exercise routine it just doesn't seem to help that much. I end up feeling ill and spending all my time resting and recovering only to feel more tired the following week. I ensure that I sleep well every night by taking sleep supplements 3 hours before bed, like valerian root, chamomile tea, l-theanine and magnesium. I listen to Yoga Nidra videos on YouTube until I fall asleep. I also have my own epilepsy medication which helps a great deal.Then every day I eat like a bowl of porridge with a tablespoon of peanut butter and a handful of blueberries and then for my main meal I eat a chicken breast with rice, lentils, kidney beans, potato, broccoli with 3 teaspoons of salt and vinegar all mashed up and mixed together. I do moderate exercise because I usually work physically demanding jobs, so I go for a big run once a week but only on the weekends and then I'll do maybe do two light body weight workouts towards the end of the week when I feel like I need a bit more energy, ironically it works.Still this isn't good enough and I've had to quit my job because I started feeling exhausted and ill.I feel like I've tried every routine under the sun and either I'm not working hard enough or I'm working hard (I get told I am by my colleagues) but I'm exhausted and I've got no energy to do anything else besides work.I used to eat 10 eggs, a load of potatoes and chicken mashed up with salt and vinegar and then do 2 circuits in a row with 5 compound barbell exercises and bodyweight exercises about 3 to 4 times with 6 minutes rest in between and then do a 10 minute run with sprints thrown in and then be really productive at work but then people would think I'm high on drugs or crazy and women think I'm trying to hit on them lol.Does anyone relate to this?. Is there a mod to increase dragon spawn rate for Xbox one?. It took me about 30 seconds to pull it out of the inner corner of my left eye. I looked at it and it had a proboscis but no butterfly wings and it was a very dark in colour. I live in the UK. Why do flies do that? Should I be concerned? How long does it take for a fly to plant it's larvae in such places?. Like if I eat and exercise modestly but sleep well, I get coworkers acting all condescending towards me or angry like I'm being lazy and nobody seems to want to know me but then when I do more intense exercise and fine tune my diet, suddenly I'm doing a great job and everyone likes me.Like for example, when I was 16 I used this dream simulation machine video from YouTube to give myself two seizures in order to get an epilepsy diagnosis and get the attention and sympathy of my mother.It's pretty subtle and gradual but you panic because you know what it probably means and so you try to "keep yourself awake"? I find I start rubbing my fingers and looking at my hands kind of like how people pinch themselves to make sure they're not dreaming.Has anyone here had this problem where they find other people too boring and unattractive? I feel like this is partly what stops me from forming relationships with people because I just don't feel attracted to them in the first place. It's almost like my brain is just wired differently and I get hated for it.I've tried explaining this to my neurologist but she doesn't seem to understand or know what to call it. I feel like I've been asleep briefly but whilst I'm stood up at the same time, still walking about and doing things. I had this aura before right before a tonic clonic whilst I was running. It's very subtle and brief so not a lot of warning if it does turn into a tonic clonic. Has anyone here had a similar experience?. I'm not that physically attractive but I'm never attracted to girls who are as attractive as me and who are also into me, I only seem to be attracted to girls that are more beautiful and sexier than me lol. Do you have this problem?I also feel like I have to lower so many more expectations/make more changes to be attractive than the opposite sex does, I have to be okay with girls that I'm not physically attracted to, I have work full time when I would rather work part time, I have to spend my free time going out and doing conformy things and taking on other commitments instead of playing video games, and all a girl has to do is be okay with the fact that I'm not a millionaire and maybe keep the weight off, it just seems like a really unfair deal to me as a guy.I also don't see how I can fill this loveless void inside me when I've got to transform myself like a navy seal just to be attractive to a woman. I mean if I should be able to lower my expectations to be attracted to her then why can't she do that for me? It feels like there's not much love involved. More about giving than receiving. Also why do I have to take on all these commitments and work just as hard as a smarter guy who's able to take on more commitment and thus attract more beautiful and sexy women who they're actually attracted to?Does anyone relate to anything I'm saying here? I'm also very open to honest feedback, correction and suggestion. I seek enlightenment lol.It seems like every therapist I try denies that I have NPD probably because I'm a covert vulnerable narcissist and I try to act nice to avoid confrontation (because it's cost me jobs/accommodation in the past) so it's not obvious and then they say things like "well a real narcissist wouldn't admit they're a narcissist" or that I'm autistic instead. I only know that I probably have NPD because most people who get to know me eventually responds to me as though I'm an asshole or they don't seem to want to talk to me. I also know I get way more angry than others do about little things all the time and always complaining about how "f**king stupid" most people are, like I can't leave my house for 10 minutes without feeling like I want to punch someone in the face (or worse) just based on how they look at me, and I've gotten to the point where I just vocalise my accusations out loud so they can hear my opinion instead of just them giving me theirs with their facial expressions. I also don't seem to care about the same things as others do, or when others look sad about something I don't feel sad etc, and the therapist will usually just dismiss this and ask "well why do you feel x?" or "why do you f**king hate most people?" as though it's just a normal problem everyone else has even though most other people act like they want to talk with each other way more and trust each other way more than I do with them. I even took a personality disorder assessment twice and scored zero percent for NPD (although I scored above "clinical cut off" for borderline personality disorder and schizoid personality disorder) but I know that I never really internalise the blame for things (like with bpd) or I can say sorry a lot/act sorry but it's more like I'm trying to avoid someone criticising me and feeling real shame that is going to make me noticeably angry (and lead someone to start suspecting I have NPD) which is more like NPD. I also don't really get attached to anyone like bpd or worry about abandonment, I feel like my life lacks love but I feel more like either love doesn't really exist or it's something that's reserved for babies from their parents and the love between a man and a woman is contractual and I can't really get down with it because that empty space inside me from my childhood won't get filled and also all the women I actually want to have sex with are outside of my league. I might sound very self aware but it's taken me a life time to understand this much about myself and I have a strong attitude towards the power of mindfulness and self understanding, at the exclusion of relationships and commitments. I also re-edit what I post a hundred times until it sounds right, which obviously can't be done in real life. How would you go about finding a suitable therapist and getting them to take you seriously?. I had a seizure last year and lots of mini seizures and "near misses" up until January and have been on keto since but recently I've decided to switch to plant based to be healthier (in my opinion) so I did that for 2 days and then had a bowl of porridge the next day and I felt completely "off" like I had all these symptoms from last year, feeling surreal like I had lost consciousness for a brief second, loss of feeling in my legs, tingling in my fingers, shallow breathing, and a worsening of these muscle jerks that I've recently been having.I feel kind of tired and under-performing in my job from eating keto and taking my meds (keppra) but I feel like if I don't then I'll have another fit and then that will cause lots of little fits (focal aware seizures and what felt like the beginnings of a tonic clonic) like it did with the last one and make it more likely to have more in the future and make it even harder to manage. Does anyone relate to this? Do you just accept it and learn to live with it or do you try and minimize the risk where possible?. Do you find yourself exclusively attracted to women that are out of your league and can't enter into a relationship because you feel that the only women you can attract wont sexually satisfy you?. Is this common? I have to lie down on my bed and do breathing exercises and I can feel my pulse racing and I'm losing control over my auras/sensations/symptoms and feel more surreal and dazed but then it doesn't go any further and dies down. I particularly get this at night where I'll wake up and feel very alert and wired and have all these physical sensations moving around my body and feel like I'm going to pass out/have another tonic clonic, but gradually it will die down.Do you think an e-bike like this can do 80 miles a week: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/WHIRLWIND-Lightweight-Electric-Foldable-Battery/dp/B07YCQ7GGQ?&linkCode=sl1&tag=bikesy-21&linkId=5f09dabd529a0a4fc89432c50b2de8b2&language=en\_GB&ref\_=as\_li\_ss\_tl](https://www.amazon.co.uk/WHIRLWIND-Lightweight-Electric-Foldable-Battery/dp/B07YCQ7GGQ?&linkCode=sl1&tag=bikesy-21&linkId=5f09dabd529a0a4fc89432c50b2de8b2&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) ?.

I had a dream where I was walking on a footpath through a small wooded area and I noticed three bulls running past me and then afterwards there were two bears, but the other bear took notice of me and started trying to eat me despite my attempts to get it to go away.My second dream is of these two guys who were friends and one of them lived in this flat that the other introduced me to and the guy who owned the flat (let's call him Sam) seemed to be really friendly and interested in me and listened to me a lot and would help me out with charging my phone and making me food and letting me stay the night and then gradually I noticed Sam would kind of smile at his friend and then put on a wig and a dress and somehow change his whole appearance so much that he looked like a real woman and almost convince me that he was a woman because his face changed and "he" (by this point) had real looking breasts and a completely different slim body shape and then would sort of slip into the same bed I was in whilst continuing to talk to me but here's the thing, I kind of didn't mind, in fact I was a little turned on.Any idea what these dreams could mean?. I'm not very attractive or smart and yet I'm not attracted to girls in my league and I don't find that minimum wage jobs do anything for my confidence or self esteem so I only work part-time and rent a room. Is it common to feel this way? How does one transition from not being okay with it to being okay with it?.

For example, it can just let you hear Freddy Mercury's voice on it's own and cancels out all the other instruments/voices?. Hi, I used to play a lot of piano but my hands started hurting for days after each practise session despite stretching, good diet, exercise and ice water therapy, and when I spoke to my doctor he said it sounded like tendonitis. I would still like to practise something music related without the pain and discomfort and perhaps try composing music digitally, any recommendations?edit: sorry perhaps for my bad wording, when I say compose I mean produce a full piece of music that I can put on youtube or soundcloud rather than sheet music that someone reads and plays. Ive checked a Wikipedia article on the folk band Steeleye Span ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeleye_Span) and it insinuates that their music "draws upon" pan-british traditions in the opening summary. I've looked it up on Google and it comes up with pan-celtism which I can't make heads or tails off and british nationalism but I cant see how those subjects show that folk music "draws upon" traditions relating to those subjects, any suggestions?. Dear Dr PetersonI've recently watched two YouTube videos that claim a lack of intimacy as being the fundamental cause behind two examples of serious criminal offence. I would be really interested to hear your thoughts and opinions on the matter in more depth. Would this phenomenon of acting out on an intimacy deficit also apply more generally and possibly explain and account for less extreme scenarios such as narcissism?The first video is of a criminal psychologist talking about his theory on Jeffery Dahmer's motive behind his killings, where he implies that Dahmer did it in order to have access to the bodies in order to simulate an intimate relationship to substitute for the fact that he lacked any sort of intimacy when growing up: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I2m0tM16uOY (from 15:00 minutes in and specifically where he says "his need to be with people was just so great" at 21:10 minutes in)The second video is from a Channel 4 documentary where a reporter interviews both a pedophile hunter/vigilante and a psychologist who specialises in child sex offence, and the psychologist says that the majority of child sex offences are NOT committed by pedophiles (people with a sexual attraction to children) but by adults who have what he calls an intimacy deficit: https://youtu.be/Ma-1f1t_A2k (at 11:00 minutes in)Thanks for your time.Jack. I've had a tonic clonic seizure in July this year then a week of awake focal seizures and since then I've had lots of what appear to be close calls or feeling like I'll have another tonic clonic on a weekly basis so I've had to lie down a lot and do breathing exercises but thankfully not another yet and those close calls have appeared to have gone with medication but I've never had these muscle jerks whilst conscious before. My arms and shoulders will jolt forward sometimes repeatedly whilst I'm sitting down or not doing much. Is this a common symptom of epilepsy or something unrelated?. It's like a cello suite that sounds like a metal/rock'n'roll riff. It's not the Cello Counterpoints. I swear I heard it on his Different Trains album on iTunes but when I look up the album up on Spotify or Google it only comes up with: America – Before the WarEurope – During the WarAfter the War And the Electric Counterpoints (1 to 3). EDIT how do you prepare for it, when you feel it's coming?. For example:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qbyXBUEOy5A at 1:55https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LLE3f0kWjoM at 1:10https://youtu.be/s4pZFsEdP3Y at 3:06. I've got a friend that says he wants to make a living out of writing his own songs.
    I am so mad at you guys and gals and feel such disgust because you just idealise me, it makes me hate myself, it makes me so sick. I really like getting slapped. 🫣. People with NPD have distorted perceptions of reality, especially as it relates to ourselves. The biggest error I see on r/NPD is to implicitly (or even worse, explicitly) validate and support the distorted perceptions of people who post here. Especially with anonymity and no accountability from those we interact with IRL, with no consequences for misrepresentations of reality or outright fabrications, and lacking any critical threat to our delusions of grandeur from collisions with an unflattering or conflicting reality, no challenges to our embellishing of our already biased fantastical depictions of ourselves, our lives, our importance, our relationships, our understanding of who we are and the world around us... People with NPD will often go online as a way to retreat, escape, and regain control over their threats to their self-important inflated egos and use the validation of overly sympathetic, uncritical audiences, many of whom are similarly narcissistic commenters who likewise want to bolster their esteem by presenting an image of someone who are nice, considerate, supportive, good people. There appears to be an unspoken contract that I see forming in the supposed community here which is pathologically engaging in emotional collaboration of one another's fantasies. People find it gratifying and validation to play out this role of mutual co-conspirator in each other's buttressing of the other's self-esteem in ways that both parties find gratifying and emotionally rewarding. And in ways that lack scrutiny, discipline, or genuine consideration for the mental well being of others. It's actually far more self-serving and toxic than one might first suspect from the whole feel-good charade that portrays this veneer of compassion, support, understanding, and comraderie. The happy gang of the down-trodden and maligned, but earnest and honestly self-examining themselves, trying to be vulnerable and grow... I really find it becoming more and more a PR performance that avoids vulnerability and authenticity in favor of non-reflective, plastic emotional narcosis and positive re-packaging of a very, very caustic outlook towards ourselves, others, and the world. We are not actually that nice. Pretending to be nice on reddit is just deceptive or reward-seeking faux-magnanimosity.This emotionally engaged, supportive overly sympathetic, uncritical style of reply is perhaps the most common toxic dynamic I see on r/NPD and the greatest source of unhealthy contributions, not least of all for being so subtle and charming in its pseudopositivity. But it is, in no uncertain terms, *enabling* of pathological patterns of thoughts and behaviors. It's how you create an echo chamber of grandiose sympathetic circle jerking where people can escape from painful, uncertain, less flattering realities, and avoids examining or identifying our own weaknesses, flaws, inadequacies, or toxic qualities, or even our abusive patterns of behavior. **Supportive Validating replies do not actually help people**. If you are replying to posts in order to elicit positive emotional feedback or relieved, grateful reactions which paint you as helpful, emotionally uplifting, or whatever else, you should seriously rethink your motivations for even being here to begin with.*What do you really get out of your time here? Why do you continue to invest your energy into these discussions? Are your goals really in alignment with the best interests of everyone else who posts here or are they perhaps more self-serving than you would care to admit?*I'm of the mind that posters here should be aim to be neutral in representations of conflicts and should *avoid posting positive, supportive, sympathetic, posts.* In fact, I think the __*ideal reply*__ should be **neutral** (in the psychotherapeutic sense), should be **inquisitive** and **exploratory** instead of expressions of agreement or declarations of opinion or judgment. Replies should avoid commands, telling people what to do or what they 'should' do, aka proscriptions, but instead be **gently challenging** and *skeptical of any narratives presented* without disbelieving or invalidating the words of the people who post here. And this would aplly especially to subjects involving interpersonal conflict and intimate relationships, most obviously if they are black and white depictions of family, friends, coworkers, and of course, romantic partners. Value laden judgments and historical accounts of our past, particularly those from our childhood, should not be given exception or other magical immunity for being 'traumatic' neither. We ideally should avoid emotional, moral, critical, judgmental, supportive, or comparative evaluation. Instead, seek to guide people to fulfill these roles for themselves and to encourage emotional disclosure and reflection, most notably thru leading by example. Communicate how you feel, don't simply act on it. Contain your emotions, and express them, but don't let them consume you and cause you to judge others and take sides in a conflict which would be better served thru neutrality. Both sides of the conflict likely exist within us just as much as without us. Personal anecdotes and relating to one another can be helpful, but often end up being self-serving and mutually masturbatory, if not outright self-centered attention seeking, envious attempts to direct focus, praise, and admiration onto the commenter instead of the original poster, and imo function to implicitly assert superiority over the original poster and potentially devaluing the poster. Questions? Concerns? Criticisms? Lay em out.Hello. This is Dr Todd Grande with another video on scientifically informed psychological content and psychological content accessories such as trending, pop culture headlines. For Today's Viewer Submitted Topic, a viewer asked about guys who feel insecure. Specifically, guys who feel insecure about their receding hair line and lack of a Chiseled Chad jawline and, um, guys who are struggling mentally because they have not been having the most luck dating, probably especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic started in 2020 under the Trump Administration. So. Consider, for instance, a fairly attractive guy who recently may have been unfairly and painfully rejected by a total Stacy for his "lack of self confidence" and "nervous and flaccid personality." Comments like these are really just the worst thing you can say to. Comments like these can really wear down and fracture your. Um. C-comments like these can really cause someone to look more seriously into Incel culture and then post a bunch of videos. I mean. Look. Comments like these are really just, like, so, there's this-this gentleman's date really exhibited all the signs of - I mean. Okay, so, so this is a reminder. I am not diagnosing anyone in this video. Only speculating on what could be happening in a situation like this. But she really exhibited all the symptoms of being a basic bitch and likely an ugly narcissistic skank too.Uh, so. Well. Another study had also found some, ah, findings here, let's see. So. According to a study conducted on 17 women between the ages of 18 and 39 over several years during their trips to their gynecologist - which, is a doctor specifically trained and who specializes in women's health and women's anatomy. The study found approximately 15% of all women who were rated by a qualified assessor at their doctors' offices as *"stand-offish"* and who also scored low in the *"agreeableness"* and *"conscientiousness"* factor categories on the five factor personality model for personality trait assessment-And again, those categories are:* __C__ for Conscientiousness* __A__ for Agreeableness* __N__ for Neuroticism* __O__ for Openness to experience and of course* __E__ for Extroversion...which *I* like to remember with the acronym 'CANOE'. Because... *(coy, pained look at the camera for the mandatory scheduled joke insert of the video)* So, I guess you could say that, at least, for the category of men this video is intended to be addressing, *some* men are really. Up *shit creek* and *without a paddle*. Lately, with this whole dating and interactions with females thing, heh. Just ah, a bit of humor there, heh. So.... -they were found to be correlated with nearly twice the average of recorded incidence ratings for contracting Syphilis *and* for contracting gonorrhea as well, at some point in their lives while they were considered to be, sexually active, as far as risk. Which, just really goes to show you how, from a scientific standpoint at least, I'd say, that it just, it really doesn't pay to be a mean spirited, terrible, awful, judgmental sexually active female - at least in modern times it would seem.Anyways. That's it for this video, thanks for watchiHey sorry for the incomplete upload, I accidentally hit the button forAnd have a nice day.I'm alive and happy for the first time in my life. I don't have a name. Because in the first moment of my life I witnessed my mom, god, raping me to death and feeling exquisite, sadistic, heavenly divine, orgasmic pleasure over taking the life of something pure, hopeful, innocent, helpless, dependent, weak, small, and full of shameful envy and love for this giant apex predator who I have never met, ready to sacrifice myself to be their personal mirror and perfect lover. And she sure did laugh and smile and kiss me and stroke my face!!! And in my moment of most intense pain and despair and shameful mortifying exposure, dying of envy over the power they had over me, born into this world covered in shit, blood, amniotic fluid, and unable to move, I was towered over by these evil narcissistic monsters. They hit me. Just passed me around like a doll. Knocked the fluid out of my lungs as I attempted to kill myself. Finished my soul off. Took my life before my first breath. Mutilated me. Stuck me full of invasive sharp metal. Isolated me. Treated me like an object, an empty vessel. And tossed my spirit into the abyss like a used condom.I'm no one. I'm nothing. I'm shit. I'm ruined. I'm something fucked up and awful. I don't deserve to live. nickname. I'm null and void. I'm a dead kid. I'm evol. I'm worthless, unloveable, disgusting. I'm a thief, criminal, bastard, predator, Psyckofreak, pervert, pedophile, rapist, murderer, oppressor, capitalist, bully, exploiter, genocidal demon. I'm Hitler. I'm Jeffrey Epstein. I'm Donald Trump. I'm the Queen of France. And I'm you. But a spark of love from the void and by sacrificing myself and enduring the annihilation of utter shame, by donning evil and darkness, I emptied out and finally let myself be. The quiet watcher, the slumbering old God of the abyss, the leviathan that has caused all our suffering. The third eye. The cosmic egg, the dreaming orphan.My fire died, cinder snuffed, and like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, my soul is reborn. I'm Sin. I'm Ashame. I'm Love. I'm hate. I'm life. I'm death. I'm nothing. I'm Empty. And I'm overflowing. I'm God and the Devil. And I'm Mud Voidspark.I'll BeAnyBag. I'm anyone, everyone and no one. Everything and nothing. Good and evil. And I'm just like you. And I love you.Don't waste any time. Throw yourself to the void, rip your ego to shreds. Empty out and be the beautiful human you never got to be. And then be anyone else too. Because with this trauma we have from birth, we can be reborn endlessly into anyone else. Even you. I love this world. I'm fucking finally free.I hear a lot of people talk about this but I have no idea what it is. I don't know if I've seen it much. Here's my experiences.Almost all of my friends are other narcissists and psychopaths and they are all off and on homeless. Most homeless people seem to be narcissists tbh, like if I had to guess, around 2/3 to 3/4 people on the streets. But I never see any of them really get that depressed or collapse. They'll get psychotic and increasingly schizophrenic and delusional and withdraw from reality into fantasy. Or they get manic and move to a different city and start a new life. Or get increasingly angry, violent, and reckless and end up going to jail or even prison or get themselves killed doing something risky and stupid like trying to spray paint the side of a freeway overpass. Or, quite often, they kill themselves instead of having to accept reality. We all know self-destruction really well.But.. well, I don't know how else to say this and I don't care to really sugar coat it. ***I think being able to lay in bed, stay at home, withdraw from your life, job, responsibilities, etc. and just not do much of anything is really entitled, exploitative, and comfortable.***It doesn't sound like you've collapsed. To me, *it seems more like a change in tactics*. Or self-sabatoging. How do you just have enough money to do that? Do you have families or partners who enable you to do that? They really pay you to be a nonfunctional depressed blob and give you pity? I really don't get it. I feel like collapse is not really what it's cracked up to be.I'm really tired of this whole creepy "The Narcissist" thing, like, how tf am I supposed to know which one they are talking about? It's me, right? I'm THE Narcissist?. Just about all the stars have some sort of personality disorder. And many more than you think have NPD when it comes to the biggest names.Find out which of your most beloved celebrities have NPD and see the detailed breakdown here.**THE LIST**...Collapsible list...**THE TROPES**...Collapsible list...**THE BASICS**...Collapsible list...**DISCLAIMER**Disappointed your favorite famous person is a narcissist? Mad at me for "armchair diagnosing" your dearest idol as an uncaring psycho? Wanting to know my credentials and also you're suing me for defamation on their behalf?Consider that you do not have to hate whomever you found on this list just for having a severe personality disorder. Instead, take this revelation as an opportunity to learn about these mental illnesses and the depth of betrayal and abuse that underlie the trauma one has to experience to become so insane as a narcissist. No one would ever choose to suffer from such a debilitating and confusing state of mind. Condemnation does nothing to help people change for the better. Shame is at the root of the low core self esteem hidden behind the facade. Narcissists might be confusing, but once you understand them, you'll find people with NPD also make a lot of sense too!You can still love your problematic faves! Why not understand them better and get the fuller meaning when you listen to their music, watch their shows, view their films, etc.? You might learn more about yourself than you thought when you find out why you related so much to them. But if not, maybe the knowledge will help a loved one or someone you know in life.I am resisting being bad. I am. Instead I've been posting here and talking about it. And that feels better than nothing. But. I really. Really. Really wanna break some hearts. So bad. And there's so many emotionally vulnerable cute new toys just waiting for me to come take them home. And right now, it's summer, so they're all outside, just like, necks exposed, that healthy heart making their jugular just bulge, and they're like lying on a bit silver platter, blindfolded and tied up, waiting for me. They're on that diet that makes their blood taste extra succulent and sweet and I... I...Just......I JUST WANNA DRIVE THEM ABSOLUTELY CRAZY FOR ME, AND THEN OVER ME, JUST SO SO SO SO BADSO BADI can't remember. Not anymore. The reasons why I shouldn't do this. I am like having fits over this. Roof of my mouth goes dry, my stomach gets butterflies, I get tingly and excited, I feel so antsy and goosebumpy. When I see a cute new toy and I can just feel how attracted they are to me and I just want to give them what they want and then take what I want, is that so bad? I will give them a good time. I will get them so intoxicated while they get me so intoxicated. And then I will get shit faced while they start to panic and realize their parachute isn't deploying and they scream and cry and curse at me and it feels so so so good and then and then and thennn... And then I go get another new toy!!!! 😍Yeah.I don't know how to break this addiction. I am losing my will to stay good and stray again. I am breaking. It is killing me. To not do what my entire body and soul crave rn. And this voice is saying...*You're such an utter moron for depriving yourself of what you need. It's so disgusting how weak you are rn, what kind of loser literally just lets opportunity after opportunity pass them by and just suffers, lets themselves go and get all soft. Why should you hurt yourself just to 'be good'? What about being good to yourself? Really, what are you even doing? This world is a competitive cut throat world and if you don't jump on them, someone else will. It might as well be you, you deserve it more, you at least tried. You were good for a little while so why not reward yourself?*And I'm seriously losing it. I don't know. I feel like I'm starving. Could someone please tell me what's the point in being good when it feels this bad?Edit: who tf downvotes all my posts on my own thread where I'm trying to get support??? How does that make sense??? Just go away instead!. Okay here's a weird one. My Dead Kid™ goes by these names: Null, N01/No One, Nobody. Sometimes Monster, Beany, Be Any (as in Be Any One But Me). Very very very rarely, my birth name.Pain makes it feel alive and is just exquisite. Null smells weakness like a shark smells blood in the water, people just ooze with it and dripppp. And it just can't hardly control it's appetite. Plus it doesn't care if I get hurt, which is awesome!!! (Sarcasm)SO! How are y'all messed up? Do your kids have weird names?I've seen all kinds of names for other people's... Here's some examples I've seen:It, Creature, Vermin, Freak, Thing, Wolf, Android, Snake, Beast, Vampire, Zombie, Demon, Devil, Whisper, Shh, Shame, Sin, Anyone, Last, Nothing, Pig, Whore, Trash, Phantom, Menace, Who, Tch, Filth, Alien, End, Ghost, Sigh, Oh No, etc.Anyone go between being able to feel emotions and empathy really intensely and believing strongly in right and wrong deeply and genuinely trying to love and respect other people... But then getting triggered and feeling nothing but emptiness, or occasionally rage, self-pity (gross), sadistic pleasure and self-gratification, envy, and hatred. And you forget you ever felt empathy at all and no longer care about the difference between right and wrong, lose all fear, and want to hurt others for your own pleasure and have others be scared of you, controlled by you, etc? I feel like I am just always cycling between these states with sometimes weeks or months between switching. It takes like all my energy to try and control these switches but I inevitably lose. And I feel like my perception of reality and my memories completely change between each of these states. I haven't really seen anyone else talk about this and I don't know what is going on really.
    I’m really angry at my theatre director. I told them in the beginning I want a small role. I got a role without text or action, I’m basically a prop. I was disappointed, but didn’t say anything then. I told him I’m unhappy with my role and that it’s so unimportant and could be played by anyone without preparation a few days ago. Today, they were discussing a minor role which would be really cool, also without text, and I think it really fit my type. He gave it to one of the girls that already has a great part, and she didn’t even seem that enthusiastic about it. I’m fucking mad that he didn’t even consider me, but I’m not someone who would ask to take anyone’s part away. I’m thinking about leaving the production, but I’m also not someone who quits. But I really hate the feeling of being unimportant and ignored. I know I have no reason, and no right, to be mad at him. It’s my fault, I should have trusted more in myself and not said I want a silent role. I was insecure about my acting. Actually, I’m angry at myself. But I don’t know how to stop being angry at myself and now I’ll have to deal with feeling ashamed and angry and useless every time I have to see these people. Any suggestions what I should do?You’re probably going to tell me I’m just a shit actor but this part really does not require more than standing there and looking scary. I’m a narc goth, I think I am qualified.Only a few weeks ago, I accepted my NPD for the first time. Weird things are happening to me. Probably related to spending too much time on here. (No, I’m not blaming you or something, it’s definitely my fault getting into this too deep, and there’s also a lot of real life stuff going on). At first, I was kind of happy to have found a place where the worst parts of me are kind of normal. It’s the first time I felt I don’t have to hide who I am. But I started changing. I completely lost my filter. I’m bathing in everything bad about my disorder. Not just online, but I have also become really self-destructive in real life. I have taken too much work, more than a healthy person would be comfortable doing, and I already have depression. I started telling people what a terrible person I am. All my relationships have become more distant. I became aware I somehow enjoy manipulating people, although I still feel bad doing it. Or do I? I don’t know if it’s just the fake me that tells myself I’m not a terrible person, not always anyway.I started posting weird stuff for attention, and I’m aware I’m doing it, and I’m completely shameless about it. (This is not one of those posts. It will be my last for a long time).I’m less self-conscious, but I think that’s because I don’t care about anything. Maybe I want to destroy my life, and myself. Hurt my image by being an asshole. For some reason the voice in my head that said “Don’t say that, you’ll sound like a narcissist” has disappeared. It would probably be healthier if I got it back. Also, I lost any hope or motivation to do anything to get better. That’s kind of paradoxical because for the first time in years I feel like I’m mentally in a state where I could change. But I don’t see why I should. You will probably tell me to see a therapist. You’re right, but due to my country’s terrible health system, I’d have to wait for half a year until I get an appointment, so it doesn’t help me now. Also, I feel too vulnerable right now, I’m scared they will not take me seriously. That happened before. My only option would be getting into a hospital, but then I’ll miss my university courses for almost the whole term, and I would have to fake being suicidal to get in. I don’t want this to get worse. But really, I don’t know what to do. I’ll need to do something fast. All my values and everything I thought how life should work is gone. It’s like I was wiped clean to be a blank page and instead of filling it with something useful I just emptied a cup of black ink over it. Please, if you have any idea what I could do to change my way of thinking and get out of here, tell me.This is 1/2 venting and 1/2 asking for advice or an analysis of the situation. I tried to include headings in brackets so you know what you can skip.There’s this guy. [prehistory] We met in psycho hospital 2 years ago, when I had a breakdown from breaking up (I thought my life was ruined and I destroyed everything I worked for - which is basically true but not a reason to stay in a bad relationship. I had psychosomatic symptoms - couldn’t eat or even drink water without throwing up). He was the first guy I thought I would rather like to date than my ex. We met a few times to have sex. He made clear he doesn’t want a relationship with me (he said he didn’t want one at the time but we all know what that means). He did some really fucked up things. One time, he didn’t open and his mom got really pissed when I rang the door and told me he’s asleep. I think I got emotional and might have insulted her, that’s why she still hates me now. I had to drive an hour to get there, and had told my mother I would stay overnight. So embarrassing to come back after only a few hours I spent alone at the train station. At night. In winter. I didn’t want my mother to know I had been stood up. A different time (don’t know if before or after) he told me after an hour he would rather go to a party his friends were having and wanted me to leave. I felt incredibly hurt. I still hate-fucked him because that was the thing I came to do. Then he had a short relationship with his best friend (don’t know anything about it but he told me she sent the police to him afterwards). [situation now] We started meeting again (but not as often because his mom doesn’t let me stay over. We have to do it outside or get a hotel. Or he hides me under his blanket after she’s asleep, which is cute, but I’m worried she’ll throw me out naked in the middle of the night. We meet every few months. Not that often.[what I think about him] I keep asking myself why I still meet him. I know he doesn’t like me. We don’t have the same sense of humor. We don’t understand each other. We don’t even like the same music (and I like almost everything). I know he has BPD and he knows I have BPD, and I also told him I have NPD and he didn’t care. I think that’s one thing I like about him. That he doesn’t care about me at all. He will never love me. I don’t even think he likes me as a person, although he says he does. That means I will never hurt him. The only thing I might do to him is trigger him by cutting myself, which I would only do in self defense if he tries to make me kill myself.I don’t trust him. Not until I meet him. But then something happens. It’s like I’m addicted or something. I don’t even like him. I hate him because he hurt me, but I adore him. He’s the only person I respect. It’s his way of wanting to get better. Even if it doesn’t work. And his values. It’s really inspiring and actually helped me a lot. He would never write on AITA. He’s always right, even if he’s not. He doesn’t care about the values of other people or society, only his own. They’re not based on empathy or something, just some rules he set for himself. He’s the only person I value as much as myself. Maybe because I can’t control him, and never will. It’s weird. He sometimes tries to manipulate me. I think I see through it. One time he told me he would be my friend because I told him I don’t have friends. I know he only does that so I will have sex with him. Maybe he thinks I am vulnerable. I’m not. I just like him, and I sleep with him because I can. I like his hair. I like his eyes. I like his voice when he tells stories about beating people up who attacked him. I like when he sings stupid songs about smoking weed. I like when we cuddle and he feels warm and soft. And I really like having sex with him. It never feels wrong and he touches me in a way that I like, and it’s rare to find someone who can do that. I know he’s not as great as he says. I don’t really believe when he says he has improved. Maybe he really stopped taking drugs, but he lost his job, he still lives with his mother and he’s still really overweight (doesn’t bother me, but he has health problems because of it and I actually care about him enough that I don’t want him to be in pain - weird, I know. Plus, it makes sex more difficult). From an outside perspective, he’s a man-child with no regard for other people. But I think I like his energy of what he sees in himself. My ex-best-friend told me once, years ago, something like “I like you because I see you not as you are but as you want to be”. That was insulting and good to hear at the same time. And I think that is exactly what I like in him. That I see through his mask but I see that it’s a beautifully crafted mask, and I also like, or at least accept, what’s behind it. I know he’s a asshole sometimes. But I know I am too. So it would be hypocrisy to judge him on that. I’ll have to keep my guards up. But it’s fine if we’re both not honest.Sometimes I wonder what he thinks about me. Probably doesn’t think about me at all, and only sees me as some sort of fuck doll. It’s fine. Sex is the only thing I’m good at. Maybe he thinks he knows all about me and what I want. Maybe he thinks he’s playing me, and maybe he does. I don’t know and don’t really care. Maybe I’m lying to myself and this is emotional self-harm. It’s a game. One that could destroy me if I’m not careful. But I’ll never quit.Like, not a doppelgänger or clone. Not yourself from 5 years ago. But yourself like you are right now, looking the same, dressed the same, with the same personality. If you need this to be logical, yourself from an alternate universe that is exactly like ours. What would you do?I’d probably talk to them at first, until I notice it’s kind of boring. They won’t tell me anything I don’t know yet. I’d probably be shocked how bad my voice sounds and how stupid my walk actually looks from behind. I think I would dislike them and try to not show it, although I know they probably think like myself in this situation. I’d probably try to have sex with them. And I’d hate them. Especially after doing that. Maybe I’d think about destroying them, but think I can’t do that because what I hate in them is part of myself. Maybe we would eventually start to trust each other and start doing things like playing video games together or practicing dramatic acting. Or having sex.Wow, my life is sad. I’m so lonely I’m in a fictional relationship with myself. I swear this started as a somehow philosophical thought.That’s why I’m so active today, probably. And it’s terrible. I tried to write something about the weird thing my mom said to me in another community but they told me I’m crazy. For some reason they got stuck on the phrase I used to explain it felt like sexual harassment and felt the need to call me gross for sexualizing my mother. Actually I was trying to explain why I feel uncomfortable when I’m around her. It’s that I don’t want her to touch me. I asked her to help me sew something and she said “It’s going to be so fun(ny) when you can’t move”. How can normal people not think this is creepy? How can normal people think it’s okay for a mother to enjoy when their adult child can not run away or defend themselves? And yeah, I related that to my bondage kink. I said maybe that could be the reason why the situation feels so weird to me but I don’t know what came first. If I was into that stuff and that’s why it feels my mother wants to do something weird to me, or if I got that kink because it’s a way to choose the people I let have power over me because I hate it when people I don’t want to have power over me do. Well, I freaked out when she said that. I wanted to punch someone, and chose myself. It’s just that she does not accept that I don’t want to have physical contact with her and I absolutely hate when she looks at, talks, or has any opinion about my body. She’s talking about it like she has a right to. And I can’t say that I don’t want her to touch me because she can’t deal with rejection and will start crying. It feels like she’s some weird monster and the more I try to get away the harder she tries to get close to me, and the other way around. I know I’m an asshole for not loving my mother the way she wants me to. I don’t hate her. I actually love her if she is not crossing my boundaries. When I actually want to hug her. But if she wants and I don’t and I can’t say no to not hurt her, I want to run away. I fucking hate these people who make you feel guilty for not loving them enough. It’s not that I can chose it. I don’t trust her since I was 8 and instead of carefully trying to rebuild our relationship and decide what feels comfortable for both of us, she is trying to run over my emotional shielding wall with a tank. Like, you can’t tell me people don’t notice if you don’t want physical contact with them. And they say I don’t have empathy. Well, maybe I don’t have empathy because my mother’s emotions are completely irrational and she’s always trying to guilt-trip me. She has no diagnosis btw. Never seen a psychiatrist.This is not really self-help related, so I hope it’s ok if I post this.I sometimes feel that characters in books might have NPD or narcissistic traits. I‘m often not sure how I feel about that. On the one hand, it pisses me off, because I recognize my own flaws in them, and I’m screaming at them in my head to stop being so stupid. On the other hand, I feel seen and a little more “normal”. How do you feel about characters you perceive to be somehow narcissistic?And which fictional characters do you think might have NPD? One of the characters I found annoyingly narcissistic was Frances, the main character in Sally Rooney’s “Conversations with Friends”. If you read that novel (probably not), do you agree?. (I don’t want to talk about it)But I’d appreciate some advice of things that help in a healthy way. You may still post your unhealthy coping mechanisms though.I’m currently reading the Aesthetics and Hegel is using words I never heard of, and I’m German myself. What is “sittliche Macht”? What is “das Substantielle”? Apparently every philosopher has their own definition of some words, so I can’t find anything useful online. So I would be really thankful if anyone could explain this in simpler words, because I don’t have time to read all of Hegel’s works.At the moment I feel like my life is over but I don’t care. I made some bad decisions this semester and now it’s likely I will not be able to continue studying for money reasons. What I should do is put all my work in the last paper I have to write, that could save me.But I just don’t care anymore. I have been lying in bed all day, suppressing emotions, watching YouTube although I’m not interested. I should get my shit together and do some work but I think I just want to get out of this situation of constant pressure so badly that I subconsciously sabotage my succeeding. If that makes sense. I’m not even suicidal. I think about self-harming stuff, but I know I will hate myself afterwards and it’s not worth it. I just want to go back in time. I don’t want to talk to others because I don’t want them to know I failed.How do I get out of this annoying depressed state? Any tips? I’d try anything.Since I got diagnosed with NPD 7 years ago, I have developed something I can only describe as paranoia. I’m constantly wondering if I’m behaving narcissistic. Whenever I’m talking to psychiatrists, I feel like there are only lies coming out of my mouth, and I’m not sure if I’m actually protecting something on the inside or if I imagine that they think I am lying.Is this normal? Is it good? I don’t think it helps me in any way.Life story you can skip:[Right now, I’m in a weird mood. I will probably lose my university place because I misread a deadline and I messaged a friend, hoping to get some distraction. He told me his crush rejected him and I was… I know it’s sad and I was really hoping this thing would work out, but at that moment I felt somehow happy that I could think about his troubles instead of my own and maybe prove that I’m a real friend. I offered my help and he told me “I’m a nice person” but that he would go to bed now. I feel extremely weird being called nice, because now I wonder if I really want to help him or if I’m using his problems to make me feel better, which would be really assholish. And I think I don’t deserve that and never will, because there is something evil inside me. Sorry if that triggers anyone. But I’m not sure if I should try to befriend people at all if I’m not really altruistic.]Oh no, my first post and I’m rambling. I think I’ll leave that there for those of you who like hearing about other people’s problems. Please feel free to insult me for attention-seeking behaviour.I discovered some similarities in Edgar (King Lear) and Hamlet and thought it might be fun to discuss them. Both pretend to be mad, both revenge their father, both are young men with a philosophical worldview. To me, it seems like one of Edgar’s monologues could even be an answer to Hamlet’s famous “to be or not to be”: Hamlet: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them?—To die,—to sleep,— (3,1)Edgar: Who alone suffers suffers most i’ the mind, Leaving free things and happy shows behind: But then the mind much sufferance doth o’erskip When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship. (3,6)It seems like the real tragic part about Hamlet is that he suffers alone. Everyone is happy (at least in the beginning of the play), pretending the death of his father didn’t happen. In King Lear, everyone has bigger or smaller problems to deal with. If you have any interesting observations regarding this, let me know.Lately I noticed I often dream, but it’s like I’m in a story. I’m fully aware that the things are actually not happening to me. For example, once I dreamed a fantasy narrative, I was experiencing it from the perspective of one of the characters, who was not me, but after the story was finished, while I was still dreaming, I analyzed the fictional narrative and came to the conclusion that it was entertaining, but could be read as racist. It was like I had read a book or watched a movie. I study literature, maybe it’s because of that, but I noticed I get these dreams that seem like I’m reading another person’s work more often.I just had a dream. I thought it was kind of interesting. Not sure if it qualifies as a long dream. I was inside an short story, like, I knew what was happening was fictional. I woke up and found in my room an occult coin collection. It consisted of blue Euro coins with weird writing and symbols on them. It seems like I did some kind of ritual with the coins by accident because my doppelgänger appeared, sitting on the sofa. I knew intuitively that the ritual would go like the following: I can spend time with her and it would be over after I have stepped on three red berries that would appear on the floor. I tried to talk with her, but it was boring, she was very quiet. So I stepped on the first two berries, then decided it would be nice if I let my doppelgänger step on the last berry, because I know I’m shy, but she didn’t step on the berry. She got a mad grin and grabbed me, holding me extremely tight from behind, a handwith higher than the ground, floating in the air, and dancing with me like with a doll. I could feel her grip at the side of my body. I woke up into another dream, then woke up again. This time, I was in a dark room again, and, remembering the previous story, I thought it would be less scary if I make light. I reach towards the light switch. The light doesn’t go on, not even after I try it a few more times. Instead, I feel the grip of my doppelgänger on my stomach. It took me a while to actually wake up and notice that what I was actually feeling were my own fingers, pressing a sensitive spot between my ribs, trying to turn on the light.So I want to get a Ken. He should be rather skinny, light skinned, and have actual hair (not painted on because I want to customize him). Preferably shorter than other Kens. Articulated would be nice, but doesn’t have to be MTM. Any suggestions?. It’s relatively common for fictional characters and real people as well to dream about losing their teeth. I finally had my own tooth nightmare, one of my molars breaking off, but without the root.So I was wondering what it means and why it is such a common nightmare.If right wing people think they are real, they will stop buying these brands, and we can have all the good stuff for ourselves.I’ve been constantly annoying my friends with this topic, so I thought I might just release it into the internet. I have been questioning my gender identity for ~7 years now, basically since I discovered the LGBT+ movement. I identified as genderfluid for a while, as agender, and some months ago I decided that I’m cisgender AND nonbinary - or in other words, that I’m ok with my body, but don’t feel I belong to the social group of women. Today, I was watching a video about gender dysphoria that was recommended on YouTube and now I feel like I’m about to have a mental breakdown. I thought I had finally solved that problem, but well…I sometimes think I have some mental disorder that makes me develop the same issues I hear about. Like if you read about heart attacks and suddenly your heartbeat feels off, or your arm starts hurting.Things that could mean I’m trans:As a child, I hated pink, I preferred boy’s clothing, and once my mom bought a boy’s sweater that was exactly the same as the girl’s sweater she bought with it, but a slightly wider cut and I would feel really good wearing it, almost proud.And I told my parents once that “I would get a sex change once I was 18”. For some reason I thought that was just some thing one could do, like going to the hairdresser.Also, I had a phase when I was severely depressed, when I would hate my top fat and do things that I can’t talk about without a trigger warning.Reasons I’m probably not trans:I fully identify as a feminist, and I will include myself in the term “women” if talking about feminist issues.I believe my dad wanted a boy, so maybe I’m influenced by that.I love my body. Usually. Right now, I feel like it’s a good body, but it doesn’t really fit me, but yesterday I thought differently.. I think.I might just be influenced by society telling girls or women how to think and behave, and I don’t fit in there. I have BPD, which means, among other things, that I feel like I don’t have an identity. So no gender identity either.Basically, I can’t decide if I should take myself serious in moments like this, or this is some special snowflakery going on.A wasp spider chose to put her egg sac next to my window. Yesterday, we had a heavy rain storm and now the thing is deflated and glued to the wall, instead of hanging freely. Before the storm, I thought about taking them in, because the mother spider looked cool and I thought I might keep one of the baby spiders, but chose to leave them there, mainly because I don’t have a terrarium or something to put them in. Now I’m worried that the water has destroyed the eggs, but on the other hand, the way the egg sac has become more stable and is fixed on the wall looks like it’s actually meant to do that, to protect the eggs. What do you think? (I would like to include pictures, but don‘t know how to do it).
    My initial interest in the anime was due to the focus on dolls, I’ve got quite the large collection of porcelain dolls that is ever growing- I’m obsessed with them. I’d really love to own a doll or figure of any of the characters someday, I’ve seen the Pullip doll rozen maiden collection and would kill to own one, shame they’re so expensive. I’m not really a big anime fan, but one about dolls I just had to watch!. I was (somewhat) trying to recover before I started taking testosterone, I thought it best to have my body as healthy as it can be in preparation and for a while I was quite content. Though I’ve found now my body is changing, my weight and muscle mass especially, I’m freaking out over the fact I look noticeably bigger. It wouldn’t be so bad if my family didn’t ask if I’d gained weight, or tell me I look ‘chubby’ when it isn’t fat I’ve gained necessarily, I’m just losing my feminine shape I suppose- broader shoulders and such. It’s a pain, with comments like this and the knowledge my body is changing; something I’m so conscious of, it feels I’m grasping for that feeling of control over it again!. I’ve been thinking a lot about the way I’ve been told I seem, especially when I’m told I’m ‘kind-hearted’ or things such as. Flattery is an incredibly easy thing to fake, and I’ve learned to hold my tongue when I want to speak truthfully, it’s a strange reality that all the imitation and false words are what I’m seen as- yet everything I truly think and feel is so different, cruel and hateful and angry with everyone. If anything, this fact makes me feel sad for myself, that to keep peace and sociability I’ve got to play a weird part of sorts and it’s quite tiring, I want to throw everyone who knows this false idea of me away and just live without need for silly flattery or friendliness, I don’t want to be kind to these people why do I need to force myself to when they don’t deserve it anyways? I feel I’m rambling but it is a hard thought to put into words, does anyone else conceal their narcissism so much it’s undetectable?. This is quite a specific question that I’m not sure will get answers, but basically I’m almost 2 weeks on testogel and my tattoo (which is about 5 months old) has flared up, it’s itchy and the tattoo itself is raised. I assume it’s a side affect of the gel since I’ve never had this happen before, only while it was healing slightly. Has anyone else possibly experienced this and is there a way to help it?.
    Is it weird that I found myself doing what others do untentionally. For instance, if I see a aquatintence regularly. And I see that They smoke a pack of certain cigarette. I’m not a smoker but I’ll get the exact pack and smoke a couple cigarettes.then never smoke em again. Or if they wear a certain style like they are a hat person and I never wore hats but soon after I will wear them.I have this feeling of carelessness about everything and it’s like an empty feeling but not in a depressed feeling way, I don’t like it. I definitely like not having the racing thoughts and what not but still like to have emotions, I feel like a damn bot. Ive been on 30 mg for about three weeks now. This seems to be the most case with medications is numbing all my emotions. Sometimes feeling “high” but now much. Is this the case with y’all?. So I have been avoiding a coworker at work for awhile cause I felt he was was being disrespectful towards me… well he today he came up to me and asked if he did something to upset me. And I said yea, and he said oh what did i say that made you upset, and immediately(idk why I did this) could feel heavily that I’m on the verge of tears, and was bout t have a mental breakdown, first of all I really hate being vulnerable and conflict or drawing any attention when sad. I didn’t want to cause a scene. So I’m thinking fuck cause ik im not gonna be able to hold in my tears if I keep talking to him, and knowing this frustrated me incredibly because now I can’t articulate and talk to him about what the issue was like a normal human being. Also I am thinking why am I now doing this??? He as just trying to have a convo with me he’s probably thinking I’m a crazy mental bitch. Any way, my face starts to tremble and he sees I’m about to cry and he says what’s wrong? And this made it WORSE I could feel me cracking. I’m trying to not violently cry and for a good minute, I’m just sitting there silently…focusing.trying my HARDEST not to break down..I couldn’t get a word out if I tried. And this whole time he was trying to be reassuring. Which made it worse, when I’m at this state I have to be completely alone it dosent matter who it is, I can’t be around anyone like this. I feel bad cause he was actually trying to be nice and solve the issue with me and I just started balling like a idiot, but it’s just been shit personally I’ve been struggling and I think all the sit I’ve been stuffing up hit me instantly and I cracked….my coworkers don’t particularly like me, im certain my coworkers know what happened. My boss was also there when this happened so yea. I feel like this made me look worse and they all think I’m really crazy now. He later tried to talk and I kinda just brushed it off saying I’ll be fine but I’m really not. The whole day was trying not to cry. It frustrates me so much that I can’t be able to express myself without my emotions going full a-wall. Wether it be anger or sadness. Idk how fix this I feel so weak and pathetic. This was so embarrassing. I just feel so much shame and ik that won’t help but I just can’t help and feel nothing but that. How am I going to handle life if I do shit like this, I feel hella jaded now idk how to let this shit out…. Anybody? Like actually someone who put in effort for a few years. Not someone who just started therapy a couple months ago. I doubt but if so any tips?. So I get it to download and before it I could open it and there pages to the book but now it’s just the title with the data showing and no pages, maybe it’s cause I have a newer phone? My iPhone 7 would download it just fine.what do I do to get the actual book?. Okay this is a bit irrelevant but I’m a early 20s female and I’ve been the good two shoes quiet type most of my life. I’ve been taking life too seriously and I’m tired of that.I want to break out of that I’m getting very bored with my life and wanting to get to my hoe phase and have some fun lol .Unfortunately I don’t have a flirtatious bone in my body how can I get good at flirting, yea I looked up some stuff online and some phrase to say but idk that just seems weird to copy a phrase online and use that exact line in someone else and I don’t think I’m really learning that way. Any tips to be more flirty and fun. Maybe here some of y’all’s experiences with it.I’m asking here because I feel l could maybe get some more straight forward answers not some of just be yourself type shit.I got the asphalt wheels and switched out my stock wheels and holy cow it was a big difference! I ride smoother and faster. I have better control, I’m just so happy lol I learned to transition and backward skate today and I think getting new wheels made it easier for sure. I’m hoping to get good enough to start going to the skate park and try out the bowls and half pipes soon. Skating has helped me so much with my depression it makes me look forward to something now. I’m so glad I found rollerblading :). So I have mdd and I notice when I’m on my period is when I feel better. It’s weird I feel sure of my self, Just in a way better mood, right before my period I am very moody.irritable,bad mood swings. And when I’m off I’m more depressed, irritable, very insecure, anxious. And when Im one my period I feel like this is what I’m normally supposed to be. I feel alright. I wish I could feel like this all the time. Im thinking I’m having some hormone issues, what do y’all think? Anyone else like this?. I have a hard time explaining things in therapy. When I’m trying to explain something that has happened I’m not exactly sure how I was in that past moment or what state I was in. as there are multiple things that I was worrying about during that past situation.I don’t know what I was feeling is actually what I was feeling. I see the situation in different perspectives and I have a different feeling each of those perspectives. And it changes back and forth.And having this thought, I have a hard time figuring out what to say. And that has me worrying if the therapist can understand me. So idk. I’m trying to figure out basically why this is happening? Is this a common thing to others?. I’ve been using the 50cent paint for years. having to use multiple coats to for the color to show up better wastes a lot of time. What’s a good brand that uses less coats to get the job done?. I have the zetrablade skates and saw in the description the wheels are more for indoor, I’ve looked online but want y’all’s opinion on what are good outdoor wheels to purchase?. I haven’t skated in months, and yesterday I skated for about 4 hours and today my feet are pretty sore should I wait a day or is it good to skate?. I notice around others in general I’m a lot less expressive and more logical. Not really knowing what to do with myself.There’s like this obvious invisible wall between me and anybody. But not like that when I’m alone. I guess it’s a defense mechanism? Anyone relate here?. It’s just a way for us to cope with the issues and stress we have in our life. People that harp on others like “your not spiritual if…” why do you care what some body believes…if they aren’t harming others or being a shithead then who cares? People on here trying to one up are acting just like the Jesus freaks.I guess cause I’m afraid of being taken advantage of, but I have this weird dislike towards people I open up to. And don’t care to interact with them.
    Zu dem Kind in mir, das kleine 5-jährige verwirrte Mädchen was aus all dem scheiss Streit und dem rumschreien und den Drogen und allem anderen keinen Sinn tun kann: Es tut mir Leid. Du denkst dass das ganze scheiss streiten total sinnlos ist und wünschst es wäre anders. Tut mir Leid man. Tut mir Leid dass ich so bin, und dass die anderen so sind, und dass wir ständig Streit und Stress und Konflikte und Drama verursachen was du alles total sinnlos findest und was dir Angst macht. Tut mir Leid. Ich wünschte es wäre anders. Wir schaffen das. Wir kommen dadurch. Fuck. Tut mir Leid man. 🫂. I feel like something’s not right with my body I need to get to a doctor ASAP ugh :((( I can only go in 2 days tho >.< fuuuuuckkkI don’t wanna die. I rlly fucking don’t My lymph nodes in my throat are swollen for weeks now with on-and-off feelings of sickness or as if I’m catching a cold, and my legs randomly hurt as if I have varicose veins or some shit I don’t wanna have a stroke fuck 😭😭 and I feel kinda sick today without knowing why and just now had a dizzy spell 😭😭😭😭 pls someone help me I don’t wanna die Idk if it’s psychosomatic either, or if I’m in danger man fuck,,,,. Had an okay-ish day, rn I’m in dissociation land but someone in our head just had the idea “hey why not just randomly take some acid and fucking staying up all night so we won’t study tomorrow wooh!! 🥳🥳” guess we won’t do it tho. And also to have an ECG done and to get checked out to make sure my health is ok My primary care doctor sucks I rlly gotta fucking switch himPanic attack (??) again Feeling as if I can’t breathe , fear about my heart being wrong somehowFuuuck 😭. God it’s so fucking obvious. God how the fuck did I not notice this earlier?!I run around all the time and I never stop and I’m never calm because I wanna feel alive. I’m in the city every single day going to some restaurant (or not) being shallow as fuck or fucking up my sleeping rhythm 3 times a week by deliberately leaving the house again at 11 pm so I can randomly drive somewhere with the tram or take a 3 hour long walk or go to a strip club or bar or visit a friend in the middle of the night and do drugs with him and fuck up my academic life and success cuz I’ll come out of it with eye bags of death and unwashed hair and sweaty shirts because I wanna feel *fucking alive*. I’m depressed and that’s why I wanna feel alive because I fucking hate depression and this state of being in a foggy swamp not being able to see or do shit like almost nothing else. Because I can’t fucking stand or tolerate in myself and others this soggy foggy swampy nothingness itch like of being a depressed slouch and not doing shit all day. That’s why I *need* to run around all the fucking time and never stop and never take a break and never process. Just take in take in take in.But it’s all fucking shallow anyway. It’s all just depression in reverse, it doesn’t give me anything, it doesn’t give me any deep feelings or deep talks or deep realizations, I’m just as fucking depressed as I would be if I’d just lay in bed all day doing nothing. Nothing real gets thru to me until……until I take it to an extreme. Until I go to my local BDSM munch and let them beat the shit out of me. Until I go see a play in the theatre that really touches me and makes me sob in the middle of the theatre. Until I do new or more drugs that finally make me fucking *feel* something and that finally make me feel *alive*. Just to finally have this moment again where this fucking pressure drops off of me and I can breathe freely again. Just for a few moments, a minute, an hour, a few seconds.It’s pretty ironic isn’t it? Doing all this shit just to feel something whilst I would feel *the most* if I were to just fucking sit down with my feelings and finally take a break and finally start to process all this shit I’ve done in the past few, idk, weeks, months, years? If I were to just stop running and taking in and numbing myself. Hahah but that’s what I want isn’t it?No it’s not really. Ugh. I’m ashamed and I’m scared. I’m scared of all this shit that will come crashing down on me if I finally sit down and breathe. Im ashamed of myself for never sitting down and breathing and fucking *listening* to whatever my brain is trying to tell me. I’m fucking terrified of my own feelings and my own parts and everything that will eventually break down and crush (crash down on?) me. Even though that would be the safest bet to finally feel alive.. Didn’t think I’d come to this point ever again cuz clearly we are the most recovered and most healed fuck out there 😎 but I think our eating disorder is srsly flairing up again. For real this time lol. We keep saying this every half a year or so but yeah idk. We’re eating less on semi-purpose and we’re using food as a sort of reward thing - if we don’t eat that’s great, that means we can deprave ourselves of food and energy AND get thin and “reward” us later on with nice food after a while. That’s the addicting factor I think Plus the ego boost we used to get from it. Rlly it was a great fucking source of supply and honestly I think the ED was also partially “symptom” of our “outlet” for our narcissism Did any of y’all have EDs? I think it goes very fucking well with NPD just like beer and beer glass or wine and meat or coke and alcohol or tea and hot water go together lol. Everything is so far away even my/our anger 🤬🤬😡😡I fucking hate this shit omgomgomg ahhhhh dlflekekAll just cuz we suppressed our fucking feelings for too long omg I hate thisvstatebughhhh This motherfucking BITCH this PIECE OF SHIT I fucking hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him 😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🙅🙅❌❌❌I can feel several ppl being close to front but also like. Ugh fuuuuck over everything is just this dumbass stupid fucking blank canvas layer 🤬🤬😡😡. Empty rage. This fucking empty rage It feels so empty itchy and antsy and I’m so scratchy and tense and just never calm, never quiet, just wanna run around bc I’m never calm or quiet I rage and I get mad and everything is shit and everyone wants to harm me or do me bad and I rage and rage but it’s never enough !! It’s never enough rage. It’s just so empty. Like a bloody red black void with blood dripping from the walls like tar And the others in my head told me “Kal, look into it, there’s something behind this rage. The void is full and filled to the brim with emotions and yourself. What do you feel behind it, what is it?” And I’m like “fuck you don’t tell me what to do” but also like fuck man, shit they’re right.The empty rage is never full bc it’s itchy antsy shame behind, and feelings of betrayal abandonment and fear and sadness and grief How do I get to those feelings, how tf do I feel themI keep running around never being satisfied and just filled to the brim with this fucking empty rage. I never feel anything else unless after days of struggle where I desperately wanna have other feelings and nothing works until some trigger hits me and I can finally cry and it feels almost orgasmic, so much relief. Fuck you all and your fucking momma you dumb ass cunt bitchy shitty fucking motherfuckers pieces of absolute utter trash and garbage!! 🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻Omfg I hate ppl so fucking much. If those bunches of whiny ass babies can’t fucking take what I’m saying then THATS NOT NY FUCKING FAULT!!! Wtf is WRONG with those dumb cunt suckers!!?????? I fucking hate them dude wtf. DISCLAIMER: No literal asses got kicked. It’s just metaphorical. I have my people for kicking my ass ;) bitch-boy is not one of em There is some weird ass dude in our classes that everyone knows cuz he’s just the strangest fucking weirdo you could’ve seen in a while. Paranoid as hell, vulnerable narcissistic, bitter and envious and passive aggressive as fuck and diagnosed autistic as disability. Oh and unaware as fuck. He recently joined our study WhatsApp group. I texted with him for two fucking days and he just fascinated me cuz he was a paranoid, mentally sick fucked in the head fuck that reminded me so much of my younger self that I started liking him even though I looked down on him and thought he was pathetic as all fucking _hell_. I opened up to him more than I had probably with all others I know in my current Uni lectures, told him I have DID and shit. We talked about mental health shit and at first he thanked me for talking to him so he “wouldn’t have to cry in his pillow at night anymore” and then he fucking blocked me because I let out some alters that were patronizing and belittling but also directly telling him to the face what’s going on with his mental health bullshit. He didn’t fucking like that, cuz the shit I’m telling people stings, even tho its true. And THEN, a day later, he covertly shit-talks me behind my fucking back in some lecture as I just found out and I was fucking INFURIATED AND BURNING WITH HATRED. Oh my god it makes me so mad. And sad. It reminds me of my fucking school days were I got bullied and constantly shit talked about. I feel fucking betrayed and if I see this little bitch irl tomorrow I’m gonna tell him to his fucking face that he should directly face and talk to me, instead of blocking me, excusing all of it with some covert “ohhh I’m too sensitive and I’m sorryyyy, I can’t keep talking to you anymoreeew 🥺🥺🥺” and then FUCKING SHIT TALKING ME BEHIND MY BACK TO MY FRIENDS. I hate this fucking little bitch oh my god Is this rlly what I’ll fucking get for opening up to someone?? Holy fuck I feel so betrayed man Edit: also I should specify that this little bitch is looked down upon by most ppl due to how weird he is. So my image shouldn’t be too broken but srsly man, fuck this dumbass piece of shit motherfucker. It’s a breath of fresh air. We’re nasty disgusting bastard dickheads that stab each other in the back at every opportunity but like… we also get each other. Like no one else probably. And like. I feel at home here. I feel accepted and understood and it’s just nice I just had an argument with my mom where I first raged and was mad as hell and then eventually ended up crying and I kinda partially got thru her defenses and at some point I told her all I want is just a mom or well… *someone* who gets me. Who listens to me and who accepts me and understands meAnd we (me and the headmates) feel better now cuz we at least got some of that shit off our chest And yeah I just wanted to say thanks. We love this community for what it is, fuck man You can be yourself around here and be heard and seen and understood and I wish for us to keep being the backstabbing cheating lying and painfully empathic bastards we are ~~(and maybe heal a bit more on the way)~~Edit: and it feels soooo wrong to tag this shit as “upbeat talk” lmaooo I wish I would’ve tagged it as “venting” just to fucking mess around. Ugh idk I’ve been scared of shit being wrong w my heart all day now Ever since this stupid dumbass K event at the party on Saturday I feel like there’s smth wrong w my heart and I’m terrified terrified terrified ugghhhAlso my blood pressure been too low all day I’m. Scared. Waking up in the middle of the night thinking you’re gonna die is just fucking awesome. Mhhh yeah love that,. Nothing better than this shit Forgot how fun this is cuz we haven’t had it in a while 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥. And they can go fuck off 🤬🤬 everybody !! Dumb fucks 😡😡🤬🤬 pieces of fucking shit garbage dumb trash can fucker. I’ve done like 2 lines of K at a party yesterday night, and after the second line I‘ve started having arrhythmia/an irregular heartbeat (blood measuring thing confirmed that) which lasted for like, hours, and only went away after I slept. :/Can K cause arrhythmia? It was scary as fuck and I didn’t know what to do about it except „sitting (sleeping) it out“. Getting a heart disease is like my worst fear health-wise lmao. Is there anything you can do about it??. Like seriously man, fuck them. 😞☹️😕😞Tired of those I want real human connection, I want warmth and compassion and affection Fuck this shit, don’t wanna anymore. Nope I’m outta here. I feel depressed. I feel sad. I wanna cry and I have this weird fucking feeling stuck up my throat I‘m tired of all this mental health bullshit. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why on God‘s fucking earth was I blessed with so many shitty fucking things? Idk I wanna hug my inner child and I have no fucking idea how to deal with them. Fuck. They’re scared all the time and always have these „nightmares“ which are flashbacks, and they’re constantly stuck in there. Idfk how to deal with them and I wanna tell them that everything is okay Idk why I have so much chaos and drama in my life. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why the fuck can’t I be stable? Why the fuck can‘t I have any more goddamn fucking order in here than anybody else? Idk I don’t understand Why do I have to let myself get beat up and run after weird psychopath men and fuck up my goddamn Uni career and constantly be a fucking. Goddamn. hindrance in my own fucking way?? I don’t want this anymore. And even tho the Flair says „Venting - No Advice Request“ (I rlly don’t like how caged this dumb flair tag makes me feel - what do you mean I can’t vent anymore without having some advice? What happened to the good ol wild r/NPD territory?🤬🤬 Is this lawful country now? Is this „stick up your ass“ land now or what?) if anybody can look thru my bullshit by all means - do it! But only if I respect you lmao But yeah idk everybody whom I even get remotely close to just keeps telling me how very fucking ✨✨special✨✨ I am Maybe I am! I mean who the fuck knows! Maybe I am indeed very fucking special and everyone who says otherwise can go fuck themselves with a pizza up their ass bro.

And it’s the most narcy apology I’ve ever read lmaoo “I’m sorry for having overwhelmed you with my expectations that we’re too high, and it overwhelmed *especially* you”, like wtf lmaooo I don’t even feel that mad tho. Just kinda a mix of disappointed, betrayed, a bit angry, and also grandiose weirdly enough, sickly sweet taste of “he’s thinking abt me, he desires me, he wanted to apologize”And also I want someone to help me make sense of all of this and I wanna shit talk hun to everyone and at the same time not Ugh I’ll have to wait and ponder a few days before I answer him.

But I’m not gonna succumb into this trashhole of a garbage dumpster fire self pity again. I’m fed up and fucked up. Screw you, fuck you, do something, just do *something*. Don’t care what it is, just do *something*.And then I’ll make a deal with God and sell my soul so I can burn in the entire hell pit of fiery hot soul-bonding sound-fucking ass-bending eternity, and burn this fucking place down and take it all with me.Until I wake up in the morning and see it’s all been the fucking same again, and always has been. Fuck you.Idfk what it is but I’m full of rage and contempt and envy ugh Just make these dumbass feelings stop omg. It’s funnnnn I had bugs crawling in my food and saw the shadow people :D I love it I’m having fun 💕. Just talked to this one fucking Uni prof that I liked and now I’m so fucking pissed at him like how the FUCK has this guy the audacity to fucking tell me what to do and covertly be all like „I think you shouldn’t ask whether you’ve made a mistake so often“ wtf man fuck you bitch 😡😡🤬🤬🤬🖕🏻 I’ll ask whatever the fuck *I* want nothing and nobod fucking ELSE has the mere fucking RIGHT to tell me what to do GOD this bitch is so fucking entitled like what the fucking hell man fuck yooouuuuu 😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬🤬🤬🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻😤😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻“Guys guys maybe we should like ease up on ourselves for having fucking put ourselves below him and for let to me us get caught in a corner again. I know your angry at yourself Kal, maybe we should just ease up”. why tf does SOMEONE ELSE always get me into this mess where i like have to pretend to give a shit about others. cuz i fucking don't. like just leave me alone with this bullshit lmao. motherfucker. bitch. piece of shit (ok Kal)and also why the fuck is everybody always SO FUCKING UPTIGHT?? like, everyone's just got a fucking STICK up their ass that reaches to the fucking MOON baybeee. Why the fuck do those fuckers always want ME to give a shit about THEM? Like, wtf? Nope, not me, I’m not gonna care about them bitches, screw them Why do *I* always have to fix everybody and everything?? Fuck you, not gonna do that anymore, it’s exhausting and tiring and feels fake af and I don’t wanna do it, screw yooouuu 😤😤🙅❌. I’m a people-collector. I collect people like others collect stamps or lighters (I actually collect lighters too). I went to a jazz bar yesterday evening and had like two drinks and I was tired as fuck and lowkey felt weird and strange and tense and I listened to the concert those people played and this made me happy and then afterwards I talked to one of the musicians, the bartender, a random girl my age and a random gay dude I met there and who seemed similar to me (they all did) and with whom I exchanged numbers in the end.I barely fucking remember this evening and I felt like another person was at that bar entertaining people listening to music and just generally being there and… existing.I told these people I’m very fucking good at getting to know new people and very fucking bad at keeping contact. This makes me run around irritable as fuck all the time and collect new people constantly. I always want more more more and the new shiny thing I just got two weeks ago isn’t new and shiny anymore and I don’t wanna play with it anymore. The glow has faded and it’s stale and boring now. Kinda. Mostly. After getting to know someone just a little bit better or after having broken their shell.All I want and care about is these people and new shiny toys liking me. I care about you as long as I haven’t gotten thru your shell and as long as you don’t like me but I’m interested in you and I wanna make you like me. If I succeed at that, you’re boring and I wanna go look out for new people and new shiny toys.It’s like. I feel like I’m at a funfair doing a carnival game, in one of those stands where you can shoot those little porcelain stars and depending on how many you’ll get, you’ll get a price. All I care about is shooting as many as possible and getting better at that game and then if I aim and shoot a star and it’s broken, that’s my supply and my praise and validation. The more, the better. The less, the more I wanna get better and be able to hit all of those exact 20 shots next time. The price is you and the price isn’t really interesting to me. The activity is much more fun and the activity is getting to know more people and charming them and making them like me. *Especially* if they’re a challenge and don’t like me at first or they don’t admit they like me. That’s the most fun thing. That’s shooting even tinier porcelain stars which makes it a lot harder but also more fun. (Those fucking dismissive-avoidants 😒😗🙄) I like that. Finally, if I’ve succeeded, I just move on. People are exciting and fascinating and they give me highs and lows and some of them do it *so well* I can’t fucking stop anymore. It’s like an addiction.Idk where I was going with this anymore so I’ll just keep it at this. And I didn’t wanna do it at all in the first place but then I kinda succumbed to it and decided fuck it, why the fuck not. Writing it down so I’ll remember So we had like this piece of rope laid out on the ground and I imagined myself as now and I started crying and then I walked towards the end of the rope with my therapist and imagined myself in 5 years from now. I felt very fucking embarrassed about it and felt blocked doing this shit but somehow still did it Imagined future where I’m living in apartment with cat and maybe partner surrounded by plants working full-time-job in IT and I’m just… calm. I’m comfortable with myself. It was nice and interesting. Because I know I have it in me. This calmness and the ability to heal But the 5 years in between were a tumultuous and chaotic trouble but it’s just.. nice knowing I have this in me man. Ugh idk. It’s just so fucking frustrating. Like, I study maths and a lot of my peers are shy introverted dorks with low self esteem that never really have opinion on shit and just do whatever the fuck you tell them to do. It’s so frustrating and infuriating. I’m someone who has strong opinions on things and who’s loud about them and tells them to people if they ask. For example we’re in a group of 5 people and wanna go grab lunch. Which canteen do we wanna go to? I say: Well, canteen X cuz I think they have Y and I like this and it’s tasty. *Literally nobody fucking else has an opinion* so we just do whatever the fuck I told them to do. It’s so fucking weird because isn’t this what I always want?? Leading people and them doing whatever tf I want them to do?? But it just gives me this weird icky suspicious as hell shame feeling inside. „Like, am I really the only one who has an opinion on this? Why the fuck do they do as I say? I feel ashamed of myself, I don’t wanna run all over them. Am I too dominant? Too loud?“ etc Like, here’s the thing. I still wanna be friends with some of them cuz I like them and some are quite interesting and I just. Don’t wanna end up abusing everybody all the time and being toxic as fuck and running all over them cuz I genuinely wanna get better. But like. HOW THE FUCK DO I DO THIS IF THEY JUST LITERALLY *PROVOKE* ME TO BE THIS WAY AND RUN ALL OVER THEM CUZ THEY DON‘T HAVE AN OPINION ON ANYTHING AND JUST DO AS I SAY ALL THE FUCKING TIME?? 😭😭😭How do you *behave* around ppl like this???It’s like, what the fuck do you want me to SAY, should I just *also* not have an opinion on shit?? So nobody’s taking the leash here?? Or should I just be fine with this?? I’m not fine with it! Just… say SOMETHING MAN!I kinda wanna tickle out their personalities and their opinions on shit but ahhhh idk how to handle stuff like this.Dad, I wish you could read this. I miss you. I’ve figured out a lot since your death and I’ve worked thru even more of fucked up things. (Actually making myself this vulnerable makes me feel sick and I lowkey feel disgusted with myself but whatever.) I’ve loved, hated, been heartbroken, fucked up, betrayed, succeeded, did some things that probably would’ve made you proud and some things you probably would despise and hate and harshly judge me for. I’m listening to my songs from the 70s/80s/90s playlist rn and fuck I think I might start crying. You would’ve loved those. You couldn’t show me how proud you are, Mom is probably right with this. Or you showed it in your own way, idk. I used to have a fuck ton of anger and hatred and contempt for you but actually… I understand you now. A bit better. A lot maybe idk. I miss you. I want you back. But you’re gone. (Rn “One Night in Bangkok” by Murray Head is up. I know you liked this song.)I’m not your little daughter/son/kid anymore that wants to make you proud and is driven by spite and hatred for you and an obsession I didn’t recognize up until lately. I’ve grown up and I’ve seen things and I’ve lived thru a ton of crap in my short life so far. I know you probably still live on in my head somewhere as an Introject, idk maybe (thanks Mud?). And I get you now more than ever before I think. I wish we could’ve made up before you died. Remember that one phone call we had? Where I made you sob? I felt fucking terrified and angry as fuck and powerful as fuck afterwards. I had hope and I thought it was completely pointless to talk to you about all this. I thought “Man, we’re never gonna talk about all this crap that happened”, but I also thought “God, holy shit. That was something new. That was good. Fuck. I feel hopeful. I know we have to talk this thru somewhen. I wanna pity you but I’m not gonna do that cuz FUCK YOU!” and I had my fists up again. I thought you were the end boss and I thought if I could beat you, I could beat anything and everything in the fucking entire goddamn world. I really believed that, like goddamn man. Now I know much more. You live on in myself and my memories and in other people and in lovers and therapists and friends and inanimate objects and events to come. Man I wish I could hug you. I miss you a lot. I love you. I think. Idk man. I don’t know. You’re not the end boss. Well not anymore. Maybe somewhere still, inside, idk. I’ve faced you before, thru myself and thru others.You’re just, like, my Dad. A confused and traumatized old man (thanks u/PoosPapa) who’s lived thru a lot of bullshit (just like me) and wanted to make things better than your father did, I know you wanted to. I know you fucking hated him and despised the shit out of him and he fucked you up real good. Fuck man. It runs in the family huh?Hell I never could’ve said this shit if you were still alive. God knows where the fuck we would be now if you still lived. Man. Fuck you Dad. But also I love you. What the fuck is it always with this fucking narcy thing about admitting love only ever after you don’t have anymore what you love? 🥲 If you hold it in your hands you fucking hate it and throw it away like a hot hard boiled egg you just grabbed straight outta the pot, and if it’s gone you might finally acknowledge shit and miss what you just had. Anyways, Dad. I love you. And I fucking hate you. And screw you man, you stupid bitchass dumbfuck cockroach eating trashcan motherfucker. But also I miss you.And well uh…I’m just like you.We had a flashback or more like, our little had it. Damn I feel so sorry for them and I sat down and told them what u/Emotional-Climate777 told us they do with their littles which is: we told them it’s all just a movie playing and we can make it move faster or slower or make the voices all high pitched and sound funny or turn everybody into colorful plushies and make it all funny and ridiculous.Flashback was something very heavy, probably vaulting box like you have in gym class during high school (?) being pressed into out rib cage and felt like dying. Couldn’t breathe. Though we’ll die. Cried and called for help but nobody came Up until later someone rescued us. Thought we’re dying Have trauma around having sudden heavy “sharp” “pressing against chest” feeling which we sometimes got and thought we were dying and getting a heart attack. Dying Could never get behind this feeling until now Comforted little, tried to ground them and then Gabriel came around and calmed themHe told them they can always call out for him if they’re in trouble and we told them we love them and we’ll always be there for them and we won’t, WON’T let it happen that someone hurts them. If someone should ever hurt them we’re so gonna kick their fucking bitchy ass 😡🤬😤Now sitting in the care being itchy and antsy uncomfortable af irritable and idk what to do abt it. Maybe too much coffee maybe someone not doing well idk can’t get thru to them.you’re the spoiled golden child, the little chick getting everything and everybody she’s ever wanted Having more money really suits me I can buy whatever pretty outfits and dresses and all that shit I ever wanted. Fuck yeah it’s amazing Like others hold me back from spending too much money cuz we shouldn’t use it all up and ppl b getting mad at me for spending hundreds of euros but idc some of it allow it But being the spoiled little baby girl golden child is really nice 😌I wanna be the prettiest, the sexiest, the hottest. We just bought some new outfit and got complimented as “outfit of the day” by an employee and damn it just made us feel so fucking amazing.Spoiled little baby girl that gets spoiled with everything she ever wants and deserves All I need and want and deserve cuz I simply just fucking deserve it Spoiled little bitch baby girl getting her needs met Golden child, golden girl getting satisfied and all her wishes fulfilled Having more money really suits us/me, damn Can get and buy whatever the fuck I wanted and always wished for Nice 😌 love it love it I want more of it and I never want it to stop I wanna wear ALL the pretty outfits and dresses and be a spoiled little golden baby girl chick and hot and amazing and justYeah 😌☺️. I feel like I’m losing it and someday I’m just gonna fucking snap and explode and tear down everything I’ve ever known and loved and take it with me onto an endless spiral of doom. Why always patronizing Why always demonizing Why always belittling others and why always being on top of everything It’s tiring it’s tiring why the fuck should I always do those things it’s so pointless to me so fucking pointless Why not just simply stop doing this bullshit Why always arguing and having conflicts and doing whatever IdkWhy always that and this and that. What the fuck man. Get the goddamn stick outta your ass you fucking bitches. Why in the FUCK and why on heaven’s earth do these fuckers think I’m larping? Yeah I’m having sooo much fun having NPD and DID and I think it’s fucking amazing woohoo!! 🥳 🥳 If someone could present me with a viable reason as to why I should be “larping” having mental disorder then fine, go ahead and tell me! Give me logical reasons as to why I think I’m fucking doing that shit. Bugger off you dumbass fucking bitches If you can’t deal with the way I literally am then that’s not my goddamn fault So I’m larping and playing a role, so what? Nothing is real anyway, have fun with your fucking projection you fucking bitches 😂🤣. Right now i feel like im me and myself like im normal and just me. I feel like ive always been that way and always will be. But when were switching we feel so unstable and mostly when we havent fully switched we're a mould and a mix of several different people at once. Idk whats goibg on its confueing im confused. Yeah I need to bring back order into this system. Like wtf man. Everyone’s having beef with each other like some sour grapes. That’s complete bullshit cuz I KNOW y’all can do better. Just posting here for the others to see. I think us spending so much time on Reddit and the internet is bullshit cuz we really gotta get our goddamn shit together lol. Don’t need supply from this pathetic ass platform, we gotta focus on ourselves. Working on bringing everyone together again.I realized I had FUN with my death anxiety and actually LOVED IT like oh my GOD dude Reminder to self to make post abt it later. If I die right here and right now then so be it. (Except I don’t wanna die lmao fuck lol) I just accept things as they are I’ll have a heck of a bad time if I resist against the experience, even if the experience is… dying Fuck you death, I’m ready for you. Here it comes 💀.
    I blocked him on everything and have been NC for almost 2 weeks now. I have not been looking at pictures and I only have checked to see if he still had me blocked too on Instagram once. I have been talking it out with friends and journaling because I feel like I need to get it out! I’m also in group and individual therapy and am working on anxiety tools and somatic experiencing for anxiety/trauma release.My thoughts are still consumed by him anytime I’m not actively engaged in something like work where my brain is being totally occupied. What more could I be doing and what should I stop doing? Please help!. Mine had a serious mommy kink. Wanted to call me mommy in bed and be praised, dominated, and coddled by me. Had a breastfeeding fetish. I know for some this can be just a sexual thing but for him it seemed… deeper than that. He would cry (literally sob) about wanting to make his parents proud and talked about being jealous of his sister because she was the golden child and his parents thought she was perfect. He told me once he remembered seeing his mom naked as a kid - he said it so randomly. And when we spent time together he would often say he had to go when he told his mom he would be home for dinner (still lived at home and even after moving away when he’d come back to visit he would always go home for mom’s dinner).Our relationship derailed when I found out about all the cheating. It created a toxic dynamic where I was trying to control him all the time because I couldn’t trust him. And he would push back and fight me for freedom while still lying to me and not telling me things because he never stop trying to do what he wanted to do. It essentially created the dynamic he had with his mom, controlling and overbearing, and he *hated* me like I think he deep down hates her. But he has to respect his mom but he was allowed to treat me horribly. It felt like so much of his anger from his childhood at his mom was taken out on me.. That’s all really. My nex was my best friend. I just feel so lonely. It’s a week since final discard and I’ve been leaning on friends but they can only do so much ya know they have their own lives and shit to deal with. I’m working on tolerating being alone and trying to enjoy my own company. I know this is key to healing my disorganized attachment. Wow it’s just hard. I wanna start dating just so I can have some intimacy and companionship but I know that’s not healthy. And then I think of maybe just having sex with someone but I know that’s not healthy either. Just hoping there are people out there who can tell me these feelings are normal and they will pass?. I went to float for the first time (loved it!) and afterwards thought I’d pop into the store to get a lemon real quick because it’s all I needed to make something at home for dinner. I’m walking through the store feeling so relaxed for the first time in weeks (traumatic break up from a cheating narc) and then I hear a man yelling “hey miss!” He can’t be talking to me. He yells again. Then I see the movement out of the corner of my eye as he’s getting closer “hey miss!” And I think oh maybe I’ve dropped something so I turn “hey miss I just *had* to ask, what is the M on your shirt for, Mizzou or Michigan???”This set me on edge and ruined the peace I had found, putting me instantly on high alert. I left the store checking over my shoulder to make sure he wasn’t following me to my car.Why do men think it’s ok to yell and approach us like this!?. I have been out of the relationship for 2 years. I ended things and he tried to Hoover and regain control and I blocked him. He found a new supply and is still with her. We have mutual friends still (they are aware he is a narc or at least abusive) and I will be attending a Halloween part at a friends house. I’ll be getting there early. Idk if he knows I’m coming.Since he has a new supply I will be fine and safe at the party right?It’s a small house party and we typically just play board games, there’s music, and food and some booze. It’s nothing wild we are all in our 30s.I’ve been reading about both and see how he could be a sociopath. Anyone else?. Therapist recommended floating so I’m giving it a try this week. After I booked my session I was reading on the website about preparation/what to expect and it mentioned that it may burn women’s vaginas? It may be so uncomfortable you can’t complete your float session and can reschedule.Has anyone experienced this? I have sensitive skin and a sensitive vagina. I was really looking forward to my session and now I’m a little nervous about this especially being at the end of my cycle. Did you ever feel like your nex was sitting in front of you but they just weren’t “there”? And when you’d comment on the emotional distance or that they weren’t really engaged in the conversation or *showing up* to the relationship they would say “what are you talking about I’m right here?”. He always had to be doing something. He was always on a schedule and a time crunch.It seemed like he had a limit on lounging and if we did it too long he started to get irritated and going over his mental to do list.Being alone is so fucking painful after the discard. It’s like a feeling of fear? panic? inside me that’s unbearable.I get flooded with thoughts. I guess it’s the calm.Mine didn’t name call, ridicule, or belittle me really. I see a lot of posts saying their nexes did this and it’s making me question mine. Was he not really a narc if he wasn’t insulting me all the time?. Anyone else feel like this thing is completely inaccurate and doesn’t reflect the reality of the western world? I set it to age 30-45, not married, not obese, any race, 5’10, and $55k. Seems pretty average in terms of the population and it still gave me alike a 2% chance of meeting a guy like this.Makes no sense.Is there any way to predict whether or not the nex is going to hoover you after they discard you?. I asked him to help we pick where we should go. I gave him a month and never got an answer so I picked the place.I asked him to help me plan. I gave him another two weeks and again never got any feedback so had to make all of the decisions myself.I asked him to plan one thing he wanted to do with me on the trip that was going to be a surprise. Just plan one thing. He never did and claimed he forgot. You forgot.. the ONE thing I was willing to settle for and he couldn’t even do that.And let me tell you guys I planned a phenomenal trip! It was beautiful, it was fun, it was an adventure, and the food was delicious. The perfect get away that I look back on so fondly! When I look back I forget he was even there for the fun parts honestly. Like his presence doesn’t make an impact. I was so excited about everything the whole trip and he was just there, along for the ride. I remember him asking if he could have some time to play video games a lot. We had sex one time and I don’t remember the details but I remember little to no foreplay and not cumming.I snooped his bags and found a condom in his gym bag. The brand we bought and specifically kept at my place because we could never have sex at his place (lived with his parents at the time). The one time we were able to have sex at his I brought over 5 condoms and left them there in case we had other opportunities.When I questioned him about it he said he put in in there in case we ever needed it. I asked when we would ever have needed it and not had access to the ones at our places and he fumbled around repeating himself “just in case we’d ever need it”. This was after I caught him cheating with countless people including a long term affair partner… Two months after.He should have been putting in so much effort to make this trip feel special for me and show how much he cared but, as usual, I was the one doing all the work. I understood he was going away to school afterwards and had a lot to plan for which was why I kept giving him grace for not contributing. But, in two months, to have contributed NOTHING other than showing up.And on the last day of the trip he turns to me in bed with his *sad little puppy face* and says “I didn’t end up helping with any of this or planning a surprise for you I’m sorry” in complete shock and remorse. Equivalent to going to the store and forgetting to buy milk. And like the gullible idiot I was at the time I reassured him “yeah I know you had a lot going on with school so I just focused on making the trip special for you and stress free as possible before you start school”. Afterwards, I am snooping his phone (open policy) and he told his friend where he (not we) went and his friend made a snarky comment about it asking “why *there*”? And his response was that “it was cheap”. That’s all. And when I asked him about the trip later and didn’t he have a good time and feel like it was a bonding experience for us he was just like “idk we were in a weird place at that time I didn’t really think of it as like a nice vacation we were taking together and we had a big fight one of the nights (me getting upset about the cheating and needing reassurance) and you couldn’t even sleep afterwards.” That’s what they do. The see the negatives, they are entitled, they are ungrateful. It feels like a perfect representation of how the relationship goes with a narc. They sell you on a fantasy of what could be, you expect them to function as an equal partner, you end up downsizing your expectations until you’re settling for breadcrumbs, you try to pick up the slack and exhaust yourself doing the emotional labor of two people, you try to make the best of it and make excuses for their behavior but it’s still not enough to make them happy, and when they look back on it they devalue the whole experience.Fuck you nex.That blank stare. No emotion in that face. Nothing going on behind those eyes. Even thinking of them now causes a visceral reaction for me. The worst is when you’re emotional and look up and they’ve stopped trying to mirror your emotions and provide empathy. They are showing nothing and you can see, sense, the black void inside, nearly feeling its pull.*shudder*. I see a lot of struggles on here with trying to escape the narc who you can’t get away from and they hoover and keep coming back trying to regain your supply.What about those of us who were discarded because they found a new supply or decided we weren’t the supply they wanted anymore. How do you deal with these feelings? I feel like our side of the spectrum is harder/worse as I’ve been on the other side and honestly there was something about the validation of them trying to come back around and having to block them that made it easier for me. Escaping for me was nothing compared to this feeling of just being left out on the curb 😞. I am dealing with a lot of guilt for subjecting my mind and body to the torment my nex put me through. Blaming myself and feeling so stupid. And hating myself for still loving this person who isn’t even real! I know it’s not my fault logically. How do I start to forgive myself?. I was discarded 2 days ago. We were together for a year and he was cheating on me the entire time with one long term sexual partner and countless other sexual flings. I feel he used me as his “cover” to present to the public while he was free to pursue his taboo sexual desires with other men and women he was meeting online and on apps. He’s a med student so I think he needed someone to help him look “normal” and I filled that role. A part of me still believes he did really love me but people who love you don’t cheat on you repeatedly. Maybe he loved me as much as he was capable of and maybe the cheating came from his fear of abandonment/being unlovable but I know that’s still not enough or an excuse for his actions. After I discovered the cheating he wanted to stay and try to make it work. My stipulation was that he sought therapy for his sex addiction. It was 5 months of hell and then he broke up with me saying he needed the space to work on himself and heal but that he would want another chance at our relationship in the future but it wasn’t fair to ask me to wait for him.Things evolved over the next 1.5 months with him changing his story over time and citing it was because he was healing in therapy. I said I felt like I was just slowly losing him. And then I was finally discarded. He said he is still in therapy working on himself and I am overcome with anguish thinking about him getting better and being a healthy, wonderful partner for someone else. He is using his student health free counseling services for therapy and goes once every 2 weeks because that’s as frequent as they let you have appointments. One of the last things he said to me while I was crying on his shoulder saying I loved him and didn’t want this was “I think it’s going to be okay.” And left shortly after.I feel completely empty. And thinking of him out there healing and being happy makes me sick.I’ve been having horrible anxiety with major life stressors and work 12 hour shifts as a nurse. I can’t sleep more than 3 hours and it’s compromising my ability to care for patients or work at all I’m having to call in today. Will urgent care give me something that would help me sleep or would they make me see a specialist for that?. A year of cheating on me. 5 months of convincing me he wanted only me and we could make this work. Ended the relationship with me. 1.5 months of hovering saying he needed to work on himself and wanted to be with me. Finally discarded while claiming he still loved me and wanted to be with me. So much mental abuse in such a short amount of time.I was doing fine after I asked him for NC and then two weeks in he messages asking if he can send me a birthday present and we end up meeting in person only for him to tell me he doesn’t think we are ever going to work and he doesn’t want contact with me. Still loves me and wants to be with me he just thinks the relationship isn’t right and not what he needs. Then why did you even reach out why didn’t you just let me go???What the actual fuck.They’re so bloody good at lying. Even more girls coming out of the wood work today that he fucked around with. I always knew there were more. I’m a combination cluster b but I would never do this to another human being. The spectrum is truly wild and I just hope I can heal from this even though I’ll never be able to make sense of it. We’ve been in a grey area for 1.5 months and today he told me he knows we will not work outI feel so empty and numbHe cheated on me the entire relationship and jerked me back and forth through the last 1.5 months so I guess at least I’m glad that’s finally overIt feels like he kept me around until he decided if he wanted to be with me or not and once he decided he didn't he threw me away I tried everything I could to be what he wanted and I guess at the end of the day it just wasn’t meNot really feeling like anyone is ever going to love me so not sure what reason I have for going on in life at this pointSorry this is so pathetic I guess I just am pathetic right now.

The devastation makes me feel better about how alone and empty I am.I’ve only done it a handful of times over the years but it’s where I am tonight so let the good times roll!. I look at pictures of myself as a baby, young girl but I don’t recognize that child as myself.Like I have some faint memories but it’s like I know they as more of a “story” I know than a true memory of it happening, particularly the traumatic parts.Does this sound familiar to anyone else?. Like I want a grown man as a partner who knows how to do life. Has a job, has a place, knows how to cook/clean/take care of himself, knows how to communicate openly with emotional intelligence and vulnerability. Basically an equal, mature partnership. I also want to be his mommy in the bedroom and for that to be the place I get to dominate and take care of him. I don’t think it’s cute when men need an actual parent because they can’t function and need to be taught how to be in a relationship. That’s not attractive to me. It’s a sexual kink for me not a life kink. Am I in the minority here?. I am working on identifying my feelings with my therapist because apparently I live in my head and I’m not in touch with my actual feelings. I’ve always thought my thoughts *were* my feelings but it turns out they are different things.And I’m just deeply, deeply sad. It’s taken me like 12 hours to identify this is how my body and heart is feeling. And I feel it in my chest, specially my sternum. I have no one to talk to so just wanted to post here.I am fresh out of a soul crushing break up and feeling truly awful about being alone. I’m in therapy working on this and trying to heal the parts of myself that are still wounded from an awful childhood. I know I’m doing what’s best for myself but every night when I come home alone to the quiet, the void, I think “I wish I had someone”.Last night, I went out to dinner with my parents and the couple at the next table was obviously fighting. There was no hiding it. They were arguing about how the girl felt the guy was not showing her any empathy towards the way she was feeling. She cried twice. He was apologetic but there was still very little emotion there for him and he seemed more focused on making her laugh and forget how she was feeling. It was truly a horrible thing to sit by and watch. This girl was a young, beautiful, passionate, and emotionally available woman. She could have the world at her disposal and she’s wasting her tears on this boy. I saw this situation as a reflection of how many toxic relationships I’ve been in and tried to convince myself it would get better, I could change him, we could make it work, I know he’s a good guy deep down, I was asking for/expecting too much, etc.It was the first time I realized I would much rather be going home alone than going home with someone who makes me cry.This is a big shift from my last post which got a bigger response than I was expecting and figured this might be a nice update and show of support for all the people who were feeling the same way I was.I’m single, never married, childfree.I do want a relationship. I want love.I hate that society has conditioned me to think that my chance for this to happen is essentially over because I’m not in my 20s anymore. I hate feeling like I missed the boat.Logically, rationally I know this isn’t true but damnit the social conditioning monster is so fucking hard to tame! Especially when it’s continuously reinforced by everything in the media. Ugh!. I’ve always wanted to try it. Any good places in our city?. I thought it had been like 6 weeks since I quit. It’s been 4. And only 2 since I had one small lapse in a social situation.What the fuckkkkk. And you get the useless 20 cosmo petals. Has happened twice in a row now 😤And now I have to plant a bunch of Gentians when I only have 30 petals and no idea how to get more nectar so I guess the event is over for me 🥲. I’m realizing in therapy that my mom was never there for me. She had me and then left me with my grandparents to raise. When she met my stepdad she moved me states away from my family to follow him for work. He was a violent and angry man. My earliest memories of him are him beating me with a belt. Throwing and breaking things. So much yelling. When they divorced my mom dated a lot of men and brought them into my life without my permission or desire. She treated them better than me. She was gone a lot when I was growing up. I remember being home alone while she was out on dates. I guess I preferred that to her bringing them home where I could hear them fuck. She treated her boyfriends kids better than me too. Giving them room in our house to stay, letting them take my toys, buying them things on top of that. She bought one guy an SUV. When I turned 16 she got me a sedan that could barely run and released carbon monoxide into the cabin. I didn’t even realize how abusive she was until the last couple months. She’s all that I had so I guess I needed her and didn’t know any differently. I just kept waiting for her to take care of me. She has mentally and emotionally abused me her entire life. Making me her identity, entertainment, competition, responsible for her emotions. At times she got violent too hitting and kicking me.I saved up all my money from babysitting, birthdays, christmases for years. She sent me on a trip for school and when I got back she had cleaned out my bank account. It wasn’t much, $700 but it was everything I had. I asked her why she did it and she simply said she needed it. Anytime I have brought up that I was mistreated in some way by her growing up she starts to meltdown saying “I can’t! I can’t go back 20, 30 years I just can’t!”She wants to pretend none of it ever happened but she is still just as nasty now as she was then. In the past year alone being emotionally abusive and hitting me in the stomach for making a lighthearted joke in front of my boyfriend at the time. She said she was “just joking too!”I HATE HER!I am in therapy to work through this. I’m close to getting my car in my name and my finances in order and when I do I’m leaving and never coming back.My mom used to do this with slippers a lot as a kid. Idk why these specifically. She would give them to me (often for Christmas) and I’d wear them for a little bit then she would take them and start wearing them herself. When I’d ask about them she’d always have some reason or excuse I honestly don’t remember what she’d say at this point. Probably something about me having other pairs (I like slippers a lot). She would buy food that was special for me at the store. I’d go to get some and most if not all of it would be eaten.She did this even recently with the food while I’m staying at her house and I’m 33 now.I texted him late and he shares his location with me so I saw he was still awake. But then an hour later I saw he phone started charging and that always meant he was going to sleep. So he didn’t respond to me text. I wanted no contact but he broke it by texting me a week ago saying he needed to reach out and said he wanted to send me something for my bday. We ended up agreeing to see each other next week when he’s in town. I was doing ok before he broke NC but now I haven’t been able to stop analyzing the things he said. That I was constantly on his mind but couldn’t be what either of us needed right now. He said he’s putting in the work to fix himself.He put me through hell but I know I put him through it too. I love him so much. Not talking has become unbearable so I reached out saying I wanted contact.He didn’t respond. I’m losing my fucking mind. I know it’s late and he could respond tomorrow but I’m so crazy.I went downstairs in my parents house to look through a box of stuff my grandma kept. It was really hard looking at pictures of me as a baby - before any memories and seeing how innocent I was and how if I had been properly cared for my life would be so much different now.It was hard looking at pictures of me growing up - as memories of trauma were forming and knowing how I felt at the time and the things I was doing to cope, to *survive*, that I’ve never spoken of.I guess those are the things I need to bring up in therapy now, huh? My shadow self. The part of me I’ve always rejected and never loved and believed made me unlovable by others. Looking at those pictures I realized how disconnected I am from myself. Like I could not look at that little face and wrap my brain around “that’s *me*”.When I tell you I sobbed you guys.She didn’t ask for or deserve any of what happened to her. What happened to *me*. But I’m 33 now and I make my own money and I’m in control of my life and everything that happens to me now is my decision. I choose a better life for her. For *me*.I’m having a moment of vulnerability and I just wanted to tell everyone here I know we all have different stories and the world wants to paint us as monsters but we are all still that innocent kid who deserves love, understanding, and healing. I wish it for all of us. That’s all.I went downstairs in my parents house to look through a box of stuff my grandma kept.

My shadow self. The part of me I’ve always rejected and never loved and believed made me unlovable by others. Looking at those pictures I realized how disconnected I am from myself. Like I could not look at that little face and wrap my brain around “that’s *me*”.When I tell you I sobbed you guys.She didn’t ask for or deserve any of what happened to her. What happened to *me*. But I’m 33 now and I make my own money and I’m in control of my life and everything that happens to me now is my decision. I choose a better life for her. For *me*.I’m having a moment of vulnerability and I just wanted to tell everyone here I know we all have different stories and the world wants to paint us as monsters but we are all still that innocent kid who deserves love, understanding, and healing. I wish it for all of us. That’s all.My mom did something she thought was nice for me and I didn’t show her “enough” appreciation.I mention I’m trying to figure out what to do for dinner tonight and her response is “well you probably aren’t interested because you never appreciate anything I do for you but anyways there’s lettuce and peppers and eggs in the fridge”Oh and it’s my birthday tomorrow and I told her how much I’m struggling with suicidal ideation two days ago.My mom did something she thought was nice for me and I didn’t show her “enough” appreciation.I mention I’m trying to figure out what to do for dinner tonight and her response is “well you probably aren’t interested because you never appreciate anything I do for you but anyways there’s lettuce and peppers and eggs in the fridge”Oh and it’s my birthday tomorrow and I told her how much I’m struggling with suicidal ideation two days ago.Like even when I was a kid it was instant hatred of younger kids. My friends wanted to play house and pretend to be moms and I was like this is fucking gross.I hate their baby voices, I hate that they don’t know anything and need to be catered to at all times because they can’t do anything for themselves, I hate how much attention they need, I hate how messy they are, I hate how loud they are, I hate how expensive they are.Like I genuinely hate everything about them.I hate how much people seem to love and coo over them. “Precious innocent angels”. Like, do you not remember all the bad shit you did as a kid knowing full and well it was bad and you were going to get in trouble but still could ultimately get away with it. They fucking suck. Even parents are miserable, they have their entire lives taken away from them, and then they have more kids thinking that’ll make it better, and then they try to pressure others into having kids because misery loves company. I see so many adults that use children to validate their own existence, using them as an extension and representation of themselves, and it’s disgusting. Idk if anyone else feels this way.Like even when I was a kid it was instant hatred of younger kids.

They’ve given me a lot to think about and have prompted some deep introspection. I’m really glad I posted this!.
    Zu dem Kind in mir, das kleine 5-jährige verwirrte Mädchen was aus all dem scheiss Streit und dem rumschreien und den Drogen und allem anderen keinen Sinn tun kann: Es tut mir Leid. Du denkst dass das ganze scheiss streiten total sinnlos ist und wünschst es wäre anders. Tut mir Leid man. Tut mir Leid dass ich so bin, und dass die anderen so sind, und dass wir ständig Streit und Stress und Konflikte und Drama verursachen was du alles total sinnlos findest und was dir Angst macht. Tut mir Leid. Ich wünschte es wäre anders. Wir schaffen das. Wir kommen dadurch. Fuck. Tut mir Leid man. 🫂. I feel like something’s not right with my body I need to get to a doctor ASAP ugh :((( I can only go in 2 days tho >.< fuuuuuckkkI don’t wanna die. I rlly fucking don’t My lymph nodes in my throat are swollen for weeks now with on-and-off feelings of sickness or as if I’m catching a cold, and my legs randomly hurt as if I have varicose veins or some shit I don’t wanna have a stroke fuck 😭😭 and I feel kinda sick today without knowing why and just now had a dizzy spell 😭😭😭😭 pls someone help me I don’t wanna die Idk if it’s psychosomatic either, or if I’m in danger man fuck,,,,. Had an okay-ish day, rn I’m in dissociation land but someone in our head just had the idea “hey why not just randomly take some acid and fucking staying up all night so we won’t study tomorrow wooh!! 🥳🥳” guess we won’t do it tho. And also to have an ECG done and to get checked out to make sure my health is ok My primary care doctor sucks I rlly gotta fucking switch himPanic attack (??) again Feeling as if I can’t breathe , fear about my heart being wrong somehowFuuuck 😭. God it’s so fucking obvious. God how the fuck did I not notice this earlier?!I run around all the time and I never stop and I’m never calm because I wanna feel alive. I’m in the city every single day going to some restaurant (or not) being shallow as fuck or fucking up my sleeping rhythm 3 times a week by deliberately leaving the house again at 11 pm so I can randomly drive somewhere with the tram or take a 3 hour long walk or go to a strip club or bar or visit a friend in the middle of the night and do drugs with him and fuck up my academic life and success cuz I’ll come out of it with eye bags of death and unwashed hair and sweaty shirts because I wanna feel *fucking alive*. I’m depressed and that’s why I wanna feel alive because I fucking hate depression and this state of being in a foggy swamp not being able to see or do shit like almost nothing else. Because I can’t fucking stand or tolerate in myself and others this soggy foggy swampy nothingness itch like of being a depressed slouch and not doing shit all day. That’s why I *need* to run around all the fucking time and never stop and never take a break and never process. Just take in take in take in.But it’s all fucking shallow anyway. It’s all just depression in reverse, it doesn’t give me anything, it doesn’t give me any deep feelings or deep talks or deep realizations, I’m just as fucking depressed as I would be if I’d just lay in bed all day doing nothing. Nothing real gets thru to me until……until I take it to an extreme. Until I go to my local BDSM munch and let them beat the shit out of me. Until I go see a play in the theatre that really touches me and makes me sob in the middle of the theatre. Until I do new or more drugs that finally make me fucking *feel* something and that finally make me feel *alive*. Just to finally have this moment again where this fucking pressure drops off of me and I can breathe freely again. Just for a few moments, a minute, an hour, a few seconds.It’s pretty ironic isn’t it? Doing all this shit just to feel something whilst I would feel *the most* if I were to just fucking sit down with my feelings and finally take a break and finally start to process all this shit I’ve done in the past few, idk, weeks, months, years? If I were to just stop running and taking in and numbing myself. Hahah but that’s what I want isn’t it?No it’s not really. Ugh. I’m ashamed and I’m scared. I’m scared of all this shit that will come crashing down on me if I finally sit down and breathe. Im ashamed of myself for never sitting down and breathing and fucking *listening* to whatever my brain is trying to tell me. I’m fucking terrified of my own feelings and my own parts and everything that will eventually break down and crush (crash down on?) me. Even though that would be the safest bet to finally feel alive.. Didn’t think I’d come to this point ever again cuz clearly we are the most recovered and most healed fuck out there 😎 but I think our eating disorder is srsly flairing up again. For real this time lol. We keep saying this every half a year or so but yeah idk. We’re eating less on semi-purpose and we’re using food as a sort of reward thing - if we don’t eat that’s great, that means we can deprave ourselves of food and energy AND get thin and “reward” us later on with nice food after a while. That’s the addicting factor I think Plus the ego boost we used to get from it. Rlly it was a great fucking source of supply and honestly I think the ED was also partially “symptom” of our “outlet” for our narcissism Did any of y’all have EDs? I think it goes very fucking well with NPD just like beer and beer glass or wine and meat or coke and alcohol or tea and hot water go together lol. Everything is so far away even my/our anger 🤬🤬😡😡I fucking hate this shit omgomgomg ahhhhh dlflekekAll just cuz we suppressed our fucking feelings for too long omg I hate thisvstatebughhhh This motherfucking BITCH this PIECE OF SHIT I fucking hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him 😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🙅🙅❌❌❌I can feel several ppl being close to front but also like. Ugh fuuuuck over everything is just this dumbass stupid fucking blank canvas layer 🤬🤬😡😡. Empty rage. This fucking empty rage It feels so empty itchy and antsy and I’m so scratchy and tense and just never calm, never quiet, just wanna run around bc I’m never calm or quiet I rage and I get mad and everything is shit and everyone wants to harm me or do me bad and I rage and rage but it’s never enough !! It’s never enough rage. It’s just so empty. Like a bloody red black void with blood dripping from the walls like tar And the others in my head told me “Kal, look into it, there’s something behind this rage. The void is full and filled to the brim with emotions and yourself. What do you feel behind it, what is it?” And I’m like “fuck you don’t tell me what to do” but also like fuck man, shit they’re right.The empty rage is never full bc it’s itchy antsy shame behind, and feelings of betrayal abandonment and fear and sadness and grief How do I get to those feelings, how tf do I feel themI keep running around never being satisfied and just filled to the brim with this fucking empty rage. I never feel anything else unless after days of struggle where I desperately wanna have other feelings and nothing works until some trigger hits me and I can finally cry and it feels almost orgasmic, so much relief. Fuck you all and your fucking momma you dumb ass cunt bitchy shitty fucking motherfuckers pieces of absolute utter trash and garbage!! 🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻Omfg I hate ppl so fucking much. If those bunches of whiny ass babies can’t fucking take what I’m saying then THATS NOT NY FUCKING FAULT!!! Wtf is WRONG with those dumb cunt suckers!!?????? I fucking hate them dude wtf. DISCLAIMER: No literal asses got kicked. It’s just metaphorical. I have my people for kicking my ass ;) bitch-boy is not one of em There is some weird ass dude in our classes that everyone knows cuz he’s just the strangest fucking weirdo you could’ve seen in a while. Paranoid as hell, vulnerable narcissistic, bitter and envious and passive aggressive as fuck and diagnosed autistic as disability. Oh and unaware as fuck. He recently joined our study WhatsApp group. I texted with him for two fucking days and he just fascinated me cuz he was a paranoid, mentally sick fucked in the head fuck that reminded me so much of my younger self that I started liking him even though I looked down on him and thought he was pathetic as all fucking _hell_. I opened up to him more than I had probably with all others I know in my current Uni lectures, told him I have DID and shit. We talked about mental health shit and at first he thanked me for talking to him so he “wouldn’t have to cry in his pillow at night anymore” and then he fucking blocked me because I let out some alters that were patronizing and belittling but also directly telling him to the face what’s going on with his mental health bullshit. He didn’t fucking like that, cuz the shit I’m telling people stings, even tho its true. And THEN, a day later, he covertly shit-talks me behind my fucking back in some lecture as I just found out and I was fucking INFURIATED AND BURNING WITH HATRED. Oh my god it makes me so mad. And sad. It reminds me of my fucking school days were I got bullied and constantly shit talked about. I feel fucking betrayed and if I see this little bitch irl tomorrow I’m gonna tell him to his fucking face that he should directly face and talk to me, instead of blocking me, excusing all of it with some covert “ohhh I’m too sensitive and I’m sorryyyy, I can’t keep talking to you anymoreeew 🥺🥺🥺” and then FUCKING SHIT TALKING ME BEHIND MY BACK TO MY FRIENDS. I hate this fucking little bitch oh my god Is this rlly what I’ll fucking get for opening up to someone?? Holy fuck I feel so betrayed man Edit: also I should specify that this little bitch is looked down upon by most ppl due to how weird he is. So my image shouldn’t be too broken but srsly man, fuck this dumbass piece of shit motherfucker. It’s a breath of fresh air. We’re nasty disgusting bastard dickheads that stab each other in the back at every opportunity but like… we also get each other. Like no one else probably. And like. I feel at home here. I feel accepted and understood and it’s just nice I just had an argument with my mom where I first raged and was mad as hell and then eventually ended up crying and I kinda partially got thru her defenses and at some point I told her all I want is just a mom or well… *someone* who gets me. Who listens to me and who accepts me and understands meAnd we (me and the headmates) feel better now cuz we at least got some of that shit off our chest And yeah I just wanted to say thanks. We love this community for what it is, fuck man You can be yourself around here and be heard and seen and understood and I wish for us to keep being the backstabbing cheating lying and painfully empathic bastards we are ~~(and maybe heal a bit more on the way)~~Edit: and it feels soooo wrong to tag this shit as “upbeat talk” lmaooo I wish I would’ve tagged it as “venting” just to fucking mess around. Ugh idk I’ve been scared of shit being wrong w my heart all day now Ever since this stupid dumbass K event at the party on Saturday I feel like there’s smth wrong w my heart and I’m terrified terrified terrified ugghhhAlso my blood pressure been too low all day I’m. Scared. Waking up in the middle of the night thinking you’re gonna die is just fucking awesome. Mhhh yeah love that,. Nothing better than this shit Forgot how fun this is cuz we haven’t had it in a while 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥. And they can go fuck off 🤬🤬 everybody !! Dumb fucks 😡😡🤬🤬 pieces of fucking shit garbage dumb trash can fucker. I’ve done like 2 lines of K at a party yesterday night, and after the second line I‘ve started having arrhythmia/an irregular heartbeat (blood measuring thing confirmed that) which lasted for like, hours, and only went away after I slept. :/Can K cause arrhythmia? It was scary as fuck and I didn’t know what to do about it except „sitting (sleeping) it out“. Getting a heart disease is like my worst fear health-wise lmao. Is there anything you can do about it??. Like seriously man, fuck them. 😞☹️😕😞Tired of those I want real human connection, I want warmth and compassion and affection Fuck this shit, don’t wanna anymore. Nope I’m outta here. I feel depressed. I feel sad. I wanna cry and I have this weird fucking feeling stuck up my throat I‘m tired of all this mental health bullshit. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why on God‘s fucking earth was I blessed with so many shitty fucking things? Idk I wanna hug my inner child and I have no fucking idea how to deal with them. Fuck. They’re scared all the time and always have these „nightmares“ which are flashbacks, and they’re constantly stuck in there. Idfk how to deal with them and I wanna tell them that everything is okay Idk why I have so much chaos and drama in my life. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why the fuck can’t I be stable? Why the fuck can‘t I have any more goddamn fucking order in here than anybody else? Idk I don’t understand Why do I have to let myself get beat up and run after weird psychopath men and fuck up my goddamn Uni career and constantly be a fucking. Goddamn. hindrance in my own fucking way?? I don’t want this anymore. And even tho the Flair says „Venting - No Advice Request“ (I rlly don’t like how caged this dumb flair tag makes me feel - what do you mean I can’t vent anymore without having some advice? What happened to the good ol wild r/NPD territory?🤬🤬 Is this lawful country now? Is this „stick up your ass“ land now or what?) if anybody can look thru my bullshit by all means - do it! But only if I respect you lmao But yeah idk everybody whom I even get remotely close to just keeps telling me how very fucking ✨✨special✨✨ I am Maybe I am! I mean who the fuck knows! Maybe I am indeed very fucking special and everyone who says otherwise can go fuck themselves with a pizza up their ass bro.

And it’s the most narcy apology I’ve ever read lmaoo “I’m sorry for having overwhelmed you with my expectations that we’re too high, and it overwhelmed *especially* you”, like wtf lmaooo I don’t even feel that mad tho. Just kinda a mix of disappointed, betrayed, a bit angry, and also grandiose weirdly enough, sickly sweet taste of “he’s thinking abt me, he desires me, he wanted to apologize”And also I want someone to help me make sense of all of this and I wanna shit talk hun to everyone and at the same time not Ugh I’ll have to wait and ponder a few days before I answer him. Like fuck man ugh And I’m ashamed of myself I think. Omg im so fucking pissed. I SWEAR if ANYBODY is gonna get in my fucking way today I’ll punch them into their fucking face.

But I’m not gonna succumb into this trashhole of a garbage dumpster fire self pity again. I’m fed up and fucked up. Screw you, fuck you, do something, just do *something*. Don’t care what it is, just do *something*.And then I’ll make a deal with God and sell my soul so I can burn in the entire hell pit of fiery hot soul-bonding sound-fucking ass-bending eternity, and burn this fucking place down and take it all with me.Until I wake up in the morning and see it’s all been the fucking same again, and always has been.

I know your angry at yourself Kal, maybe we should just ease up”. why tf does SOMEONE ELSE always get me into this mess where i like have to pretend to give a shit about others. cuz i fucking don't. like just leave me alone with this bullshit lmao. motherfucker. bitch. piece of shit (ok Kal)and also why the fuck is everybody always SO FUCKING UPTIGHT?? like, everyone's just got a fucking STICK up their ass that reaches to the fucking MOON baybeee. Why the fuck do those fuckers always want ME to give a shit about THEM? Like, wtf? Nope, not me, I’m not gonna care about them bitches, screw them Why do *I* always have to fix everybody and everything?? Fuck you, not gonna do that anymore, it’s exhausting and tiring and feels fake af and I don’t wanna do it, screw yooouuu 😤😤🙅❌. I’m a people-collector. I collect people like others collect stamps or lighters (I actually collect lighters too). I went to a jazz bar yesterday evening and had like two drinks and I was tired as fuck and lowkey felt weird and strange and tense and I listened to the concert those people played and this made me happy and then afterwards I talked to one of the musicians, the bartender, a random girl my age and a random gay dude I met there and who seemed similar to me (they all did) and with whom I exchanged numbers in the end.I barely fucking remember this evening and I felt like another person was at that bar entertaining people listening to music and just generally being there and… existing.I told these people I’m very fucking good at getting to know new people and very fucking bad at keeping contact. This makes me run around irritable as fuck all the time and collect new people constantly. I always want more more more and the new shiny thing I just got two weeks ago isn’t new and shiny anymore and I don’t wanna play with it anymore. The glow has faded and it’s stale and boring now. Kinda. Mostly. After getting to know someone just a little bit better or after having broken their shell.All I want and care about is these people and new shiny toys liking me. I care about you as long as I haven’t gotten thru your shell and as long as you don’t like me but I’m interested in you and I wanna make you like me. If I succeed at that, you’re boring and I wanna go look out for new people and new shiny toys.It’s like. I feel like I’m at a funfair doing a carnival game, in one of those stands where you can shoot those little porcelain stars and depending on how many you’ll get, you’ll get a price. All I care about is shooting as many as possible and getting better at that game and then if I aim and shoot a star and it’s broken, that’s my supply and my praise and validation. The more, the better. The less, the more I wanna get better and be able to hit all of those exact 20 shots next time. The price is you and the price isn’t really interesting to me. The activity is much more fun and the activity is getting to know more people and charming them and making them like me. *Especially* if they’re a challenge and don’t like me at first or they don’t admit they like me. That’s the most fun thing. That’s shooting even tinier porcelain stars which makes it a lot harder but also more fun. (Those fucking dismissive-avoidants 😒😗🙄) I like that. Finally, if I’ve succeeded, I just move on. People are exciting and fascinating and they give me highs and lows and some of them do it *so well* I can’t fucking stop anymore. It’s like an addiction.Idk where I was going with this anymore so I’ll just keep it at this. And I didn’t wanna do it at all in the first place but then I kinda succumbed to it and decided fuck it, why the fuck not. Writing it down so I’ll remember So we had like this piece of rope laid out on the ground and I imagined myself as now and I started crying and then I walked towards the end of the rope with my therapist and imagined myself in 5 years from now. I felt very fucking embarrassed about it and felt blocked doing this shit but somehow still did it Imagined future where I’m living in apartment with cat and maybe partner surrounded by plants working full-time-job in IT and I’m just… calm. I’m comfortable with myself. It was nice and interesting. Because I know I have it in me. This calmness and the ability to heal But the 5 years in between were a tumultuous and chaotic trouble but it’s just.. nice knowing I have this in me man. Ugh idk. It’s just so fucking frustrating. Like, I study maths and a lot of my peers are shy introverted dorks with low self esteem that never really have opinion on shit and just do whatever the fuck you tell them to do. It’s so frustrating and infuriating. I’m someone who has strong opinions on things and who’s loud about them and tells them to people if they ask. For example we’re in a group of 5 people and wanna go grab lunch. Which canteen do we wanna go to? I say: Well, canteen X cuz I think they have Y and I like this and it’s tasty. *Literally nobody fucking else has an opinion* so we just do whatever the fuck I told them to do. It’s so fucking weird because isn’t this what I always want?? Leading people and them doing whatever tf I want them to do?? But it just gives me this weird icky suspicious as hell shame feeling inside. „Like, am I really the only one who has an opinion on this? Why the fuck do they do as I say? I feel ashamed of myself, I don’t wanna run all over them. Am I too dominant? Too loud?“ etc Like, here’s the thing. I still wanna be friends with some of them cuz I like them and some are quite interesting and I just. Don’t wanna end up abusing everybody all the time and being toxic as fuck and running all over them cuz I genuinely wanna get better. But like. HOW THE FUCK DO I DO THIS IF THEY JUST LITERALLY *PROVOKE* ME TO BE THIS WAY AND RUN ALL OVER THEM CUZ THEY DON‘T HAVE AN OPINION ON ANYTHING AND JUST DO AS I SAY ALL THE FUCKING TIME?? 😭😭😭How do you *behave* around ppl like this???It’s like, what the fuck do you want me to SAY, should I just *also* not have an opinion on shit?? So nobody’s taking the leash here?? Or should I just be fine with this?? I’m not fine with it! Just… say SOMETHING MAN!I kinda wanna tickle out their personalities and their opinions on shit but ahhhh idk how to handle stuff like this.Dad, I wish you could read this. I miss you. I’ve figured out a lot since your death and I’ve worked thru even more of fucked up things. (Actually making myself this vulnerable makes me feel sick and I lowkey feel disgusted with myself but whatever.) I’ve loved, hated, been heartbroken, fucked up, betrayed, succeeded, did some things that probably would’ve made you proud and some things you probably would despise and hate and harshly judge me for. I’m listening to my songs from the 70s/80s/90s playlist rn and fuck I think I might start crying. You would’ve loved those. You couldn’t show me how proud you are, Mom is probably right with this. Or you showed it in your own way, idk. I used to have a fuck ton of anger and hatred and contempt for you but actually… I understand you now. A bit better. A lot maybe idk. I miss you. I want you back. But you’re gone. (Rn “One Night in Bangkok” by Murray Head is up. I know you liked this song.)I’m not your little daughter/son/kid anymore that wants to make you proud and is driven by spite and hatred for you and an obsession I didn’t recognize up until lately. I’ve grown up and I’ve seen things and I’ve lived thru a ton of crap in my short life so far. I know you probably still live on in my head somewhere as an Introject, idk maybe (thanks Mud?). And I get you now more than ever before I think. I wish we could’ve made up before you died. Remember that one phone call we had? Where I made you sob? I felt fucking terrified and angry as fuck and powerful as fuck afterwards. I had hope and I thought it was completely pointless to talk to you about all this. I thought “Man, we’re never gonna talk about all this crap that happened”, but I also thought “God, holy shit. That was something new. That was good. Fuck. I feel hopeful. I know we have to talk this thru somewhen. I wanna pity you but I’m not gonna do that cuz FUCK YOU!” and I had my fists up again. I thought you were the end boss and I thought if I could beat you, I could beat anything and everything in the fucking entire goddamn world. I really believed that, like goddamn man. Now I know much more. You live on in myself and my memories and in other people and in lovers and therapists and friends and inanimate objects and events to come. Man I wish I could hug you. I miss you a lot. I love you. I think. Idk man. I don’t know. You’re not the end boss. Well not anymore. Maybe somewhere still, inside, idk. I’ve faced you before, thru myself and thru others.You’re just, like, my Dad. A confused and traumatized old man (thanks u/PoosPapa) who’s lived thru a lot of bullshit (just like me) and wanted to make things better than your father did, I know you wanted to. I know you fucking hated him and despised the shit out of him and he fucked you up real good. Fuck man. It runs in the family huh?Hell I never could’ve said this shit if you were still alive. God knows where the fuck we would be now if you still lived. Man. Fuck you Dad. But also I love you. What the fuck is it always with this fucking narcy thing about admitting love only ever after you don’t have anymore what you love? 🥲 If you hold it in your hands you fucking hate it and throw it away like a hot hard boiled egg you just grabbed straight outta the pot, and if it’s gone you might finally acknowledge shit and miss what you just had. Anyways, Dad. I love you. And I fucking hate you. And screw you man, you stupid bitchass dumbfuck cockroach eating trashcan motherfucker. But also I miss you.And well uh…I’m just like you.We had a flashback or more like, our little had it. Damn I feel so sorry for them and I sat down and told them what u/Emotional-Climate777 told us they do with their littles which is: we told them it’s all just a movie playing and we can make it move faster or slower or make the voices all high pitched and sound funny or turn everybody into colorful plushies and make it all funny and ridiculous.Flashback was something very heavy, probably vaulting box like you have in gym class during high school (?) being pressed into out rib cage and felt like dying. Couldn’t breathe. Though we’ll die. Cried and called for help but nobody came Up until later someone rescued us. Thought we’re dying Have trauma around having sudden heavy “sharp” “pressing against chest” feeling which we sometimes got and thought we were dying and getting a heart attack. Dying Could never get behind this feeling until now Comforted little, tried to ground them and then Gabriel came around and calmed themHe told them they can always call out for him if they’re in trouble and we told them we love them and we’ll always be there for them and we won’t, WON’T let it happen that someone hurts them. If someone should ever hurt them we’re so gonna kick their fucking bitchy ass 😡🤬😤Now sitting in the care being itchy and antsy uncomfortable af irritable and idk what to do abt it. Maybe too much coffee maybe someone not doing well idk can’t get thru to them.you’re the spoiled golden child, the little chick getting everything and everybody she’s ever wanted Having more money really suits me I can buy whatever pretty outfits and dresses and all that shit I ever wanted. Fuck yeah it’s amazing Like others hold me back from spending too much money cuz we shouldn’t use it all up and ppl b getting mad at me for spending hundreds of euros but idc some of it allow it But being the spoiled little baby girl golden child is really nice 😌I wanna be the prettiest, the sexiest, the hottest. We just bought some new outfit and got complimented as “outfit of the day” by an employee and damn it just made us feel so fucking amazing.Spoiled little baby girl that gets spoiled with everything she ever wants and deserves All I need and want and deserve cuz I simply just fucking deserve it Spoiled little bitch baby girl getting her needs met Golden child, golden girl getting satisfied and all her wishes fulfilled Having more money really suits us/me, damn Can get and buy whatever the fuck I wanted and always wished for Nice 😌 love it love it I want more of it and I never want it to stop I wanna wear ALL the pretty outfits and dresses and be a spoiled little golden baby girl chick and hot and amazing and justYeah 😌☺️. I feel like I’m losing it and someday I’m just gonna fucking snap and explode and tear down everything I’ve ever known and loved and take it with me onto an endless spiral of doom. Why always patronizing Why always demonizing Why always belittling others and why always being on top of everything It’s tiring it’s tiring why the fuck should I always do those things it’s so pointless to me so fucking pointless Why not just simply stop doing this bullshit Why always arguing and having conflicts and doing whatever IdkWhy always that and this and that. What the fuck man. Get the goddamn stick outta your ass you fucking bitches. Why in the FUCK and why on heaven’s earth do these fuckers think I’m larping? Yeah I’m having sooo much fun having NPD and DID and I think it’s fucking amazing woohoo!! 🥳 🥳 If someone could present me with a viable reason as to why I should be “larping” having mental disorder then fine, go ahead and tell me! Give me logical reasons as to why I think I’m fucking doing that shit. Bugger off you dumbass fucking bitches If you can’t deal with the way I literally am then that’s not my goddamn fault So I’m larping and playing a role, so what? Nothing is real anyway, have fun with your fucking projection you fucking bitches 😂🤣. Right now i feel like im me and myself like im normal and just me. I feel like ive always been that way and always will be. But when were switching we feel so unstable and mostly when we havent fully switched we're a mould and a mix of several different people at once. Idk whats goibg on its confueing im confused. Yeah I need to bring back order into this system. Like wtf man. Everyone’s having beef with each other like some sour grapes. That’s complete bullshit cuz I KNOW y’all can do better. Just posting here for the others to see. I think us spending so much time on Reddit and the internet is bullshit cuz we really gotta get our goddamn shit together lol. Don’t need supply from this pathetic ass platform, we gotta focus on ourselves. Working on bringing everyone together again.I realized I had FUN with my death anxiety and actually LOVED IT like oh my GOD dude Reminder to self to make post abt it later. If I die right here and right now then so be it. (Except I don’t wanna die lmao fuck lol) I just accept things as they are I’ll have a heck of a bad time if I resist against the experience, even if the experience is… dying Fuck you death, I’m ready for you. Here it comes 💀.
    My fiancé told me tonight that she’s subconsciously distancing herself from me. She’s known this for a week and is just now telling me…it’s got me feeling pretty down. I feel like I’m not a good enough man for her and I’ve never been. I’ve put her through so much bullshit and I still do. She knows I have this thing and yet I don’t know what I am doing wrong at this point. I’ve been trying to be a better fiancé and a better man. I guess I’m just not enough and never will be.I’ve made my way out of the collapse and honestly, I feel better than I have in a long time. I’ve matured and grown from the experience. Sometimes we need a reality check to hit us so that we realize things and come out of our own delusions. It’s time for me to better myself and recognize that I need to gain some real insight in order to improve. I’m starting to understand that people are people, not objects. And sometimes people do actually care about you and there isn’t a motive behind that. There is a such thing as people truly caring for you and loving you.Edit: Scrap the title. Instead, I have to learn that I am in control now. No more delusions. I need to recognize that it is my responsibility to manage this.. I don’t know who to talk to about this, I don’t see my therapist until next week. So I’m kinda just fending for myself right now. I can’t even focus on my classes.This entire week I have been all over the place. I’m ready to give up and submit. This thing is winning, and I’m just along for the ride. I’ve never felt this out of control of everything and my life. I just want to curl up somewhere and escape from the world.I’m not happy with the way my sessions are going so far. I’m not too sure how to speed this up. I understand that rushing the process can alter it negatively and pose the risk of an inaccurate diagnosis. However, I need some answers. I cannot know where to start unless I get a diagnosis. What would you guys suggest if I want to make some real headway?. This is the fucking the worst. I don’t know why my therapist keeps playing games with me. Doesn’t she know I’m a narcissist? Yet she’s here asking me questions trying to get me to figure it out myself. I already know who the fuck I am! Tell me something I don’t know already know. I just want to figure out how to gain some control over this, I don’t need you telling me what I am. I’ve been in a collapse for the last couple of days and it’s eating me away.My best friend since 3rd grade came to check on me tonight. I built up the courage to tell him about my NPD for the very first time. And he accepted me and told me that we’re closer now more than ever. He stated that he’s always known there was something going on with me. The way I talked and the way I acted often stood out to him, and he was worried about me. He had this feeling that I might be a bit narcissistic but he never told me assuming that I would deny it and get angry. He’s not wrong haha. But he told me that he’s glad I was finally honest and that he’ll always love me as a brother. I’m so proud of myself and he’s helped me gain some faith in humanity.It’s all that has been on my mind. That I let someone manipulate me. How could I have been so naive? I should have seen the signs and known better. It feels as if it’s taken a major blow to my ego. I don’t know what to feel anymore, I was in a rage yesterday and today I’m just annoyed with myself and feeling vulnerable.I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past but recently in my sessions with a new therapist, I’ve been told I exhibit narcissistic traits. We’ve also discovered that I struggle with empathy, not having much at all.I am suspecting I have NPD and I’m tired of dragging this out. I want to figure out what’s going on with me so I can go from there.I hate people who waste my time. I hate people who think they’re better than me. I hate people who are irresponsible. I hate people that look at me funny. I hate people who are taller than me. I hate people who love themselves. I can go on and on about what I hate. It seems every day I build up more and more hatred. When will I get what I fucking deserve? I deserve the best of everything. I’m a great person who deserves the world and more.I cannot believe I was such a fucking idiot. Why can I not just be happy with the life I have now and keep looking for more? I let someone play me when I’m the one who pulls the strings! Let find a motherfucker to beat the shit out of. I feel like unleashing my wrath onto the world! The minute I try to be a good person, I get played like a fiddle! This is why I don’t just open up to anyone! Fuck this! Fuck everything! Fuck anyone who ever experienced happiness! Fuck anyone who ever experienced true love! Who’s day can I go fuck up? I hate everything!. I developed feelings for someone who was just like me, and I shouldn’t be surprised with the outcome. I know how we operate, I know how we obtain supply from others and how we use people for our own selfish reasons. Why did I even bother with this? And I have a fiancé who actually loves me and is trying to understand me yet she’s a NT. She’s trying to look past what is “wrong” with me and love me for who I am. And instead, I was falling for someone who I thought truly understood me yet I failed to recognize that it was risky and naive of me. I never want to be vulnerable like this again with anyone UNLESS it’s on this sub or I’m speaking to my therapist. What the actual fuck is wrong with me?! I wasted my time. I just want take this frustration and rage out on everyone and anything around me.Last night, I got drunk again. This time with a couple of new people that I think are actually going to be great friends. I honestly thought they would just be sources of supply but I let down the mask for a bit and they were accepting and understanding. What the fuck is happening? This is the second time I’ve done this and it was successful. Apparently I just need a lot of alcohol in me to start opening up.So I am a 23m, 5’10. I feel like I’m a good height yet I’ve been told by some women and even some of my homies that I’m “short”. What’s wrong with my height exactly? I’m not too tall, and not too short. I believe the average American male is 5’9-5’10 anyway, so I’m right around average. It could just be that I live in the upper Midwest where it seems many men here are over 6ft easily.I’m starting to wonder if I should start embracing this thing I have. Because it’s not my fault that I was dealt this, it’s not my fault I responded to trauma this way. It’s what has protected me ever since. It’s as if people want me to repent for my sins like I’m some evil demon. No, I’m just a person who learned who to protect himself. Like what do people want me to do? Conform to their norms and expectations? That’s their fault for believing that this society is built from sunshine and rainbows. They want to ignore the darker parts of society and believe they’re better because they have a “moral compass”. No, this world is every man for themselves and it always has been. After all, I’ll learn who the people are that I can count on. Because they’ll accept me for who I am and not just some mask I wear to appear “human”. Fuck them.I’ve never felt more alone in my life. Me realizing I will never truly connect with anyone outside of this disturbs me. Not even that, it leaves me in despair. I know all of these people and they know me (they think they do) and yet I feel so alone. Like I am just existing but there isn’t any substance to it. I am just a shadow walking among other people. I just follow others because there isn’t a real me. They will never know my true identity because there isn’t one. They will only ever see what I want them to see. And here my partner is trying to connect with me though she never truly will. And that pains me the most.I am a man of no residence A man of no place in this world A man with no connectionAs I have never learned this connection For it is something foreign which I fear As it requires my mask to fall But my mask is my shieldMy mask is my skin And I cannot simply peel it off For it would reveal myself to the world And a real connection requires this peeling This peeling of the layers that cover our exterior selvesBut even if you do try to peel back these layersHow do we know if there is anything there? Anything beyond that makes that I have constructed Because maybe all you will find is a void As I never learned who I was in the first place. I used to listen to some EDM back then and I’m trying to get back into it. However, I could use a refresh.I’m a Native American male living in the 21st century. AMA. I’m not sure what’s happening at the moment. I don’t feel any emotions. I just feel empty. Like there’s nothing. Was there ever anything? I don’t like this. It’s weird.So I am a malignant narcissist, which some might say is the “worst kind” however that is a bit of a vague statement. So AMA and I’ll happily answer to the best of my abilities.Why do I hate that I care about someone? It makes me feel pathetic and weak. Like why I should care so much about someone else where I am concerned for them? I’ve got better things to worry about. People who tend to care too much for others, I view them as weak. I am not one of those and I never wish to be. It sounds like a complete waste of energy and time. And why should I trust them? People will fuck you over any chance they get. Most if not everyone has ulterior motives behind the things they do. It’s never out of pure kindness, they want something that you have. I often believe they envy me or they are up to something. And now I feel as if I have started to care for some people again and it’s really bothering me. Angering me actually, because it’s not my responsibility. And my therapist…she’s putting me through hell. I never look forward to it because she challenges my ego. How dare she? What is she trying to prove? Something I already know? She needs to back off. I’m a intelligent, handsome, interesting and bold man and everyone knows it! I apologize for this rambling by the way, I just had so much on my mind this past week. Thoughts are starting to become clearer and I’m having a difficult time facing my reality for the first time.I’ve been switching between grandiosity and vulnerability more often lately. I’ve also been getting depressed again which hasn’t happened in at least a couple of years now. I hate this. What’s happening to me? I just want to be unaware again so I don’t overthink my life and question my entire existence.So for some reason my last one didn’t get posted. Anyway, what do you guys think of someone who threatens to use their fists rather than being logical about conflict? I tend to look down on those individuals as I question their intelligence. Threatening someone with physical violence doesn’t get anywhere. Plus I am a narcissist, you can try to push me down but I’ll get right back up and I’m still better than you.I am a human, just like youI live and breathe the same air you doBut the difference is that you will never know me For I am made of layers upon layersAnd underneath these layers, there is nothing but a void Unlike you, I am barely human at all As I am merely a maskAnd this mask is all you shall see,For the one you see is whoever you want me to be. I’m starting to wonder why I was ever placed on this planet. All I do is destroy people’s lives and cause pain and suffering. I have nothing beneficial to offer to this world and the people on it. Sometimes I feel I was better off never born or dead. As Olivia Rodrigo says in her new song “I’m playing the victim so well in my head” yet I am the perpetrator. I am the villain. What the hell is my purpose and why should I even be alive? Could use some support right now..So I’ve started to notice there are definitely a few on this sub that are non-NPD. And I have no issue with that as long as you are here for good reason, like trying to understand us. However, I am curious. Any of you that are non-NPD, what brings you here? Why did you decided to join this little community we have here and what have you learned from it?. So I’m surprised I’m still getting upvotes and comments on my post about being vulnerable to my ex best friend. However, I want to address a discussion I had with a specific commenter. I understand how narcissists can be abusive and cause mental and emotional damage to many people. And yes, it is very difficult to control and the victims deserve validation themselves. However, if you’re not NPD, you’re not going to understand the pain and suffering that we experience ourselves. It’s not like satan birthed us onto this world and we are out to destroy peoples’ lives. We are a result of trauma itself. And despite it being toxic, we are dealing with that trauma by taking it out on others. And the case is, it’s not as simple as shutting it off like a light switch. It can take years to learn to control, and that’s if you’re self aware and you accept it. We’re not monsters, we’re people who do bad things sometimes. Also….I’m not sure why anyone would would believe that separating us from the general population and making us be alone forever is somehow going to work? We can’t be alone. Most humans need some sort of companionship, we’re social animals. Just because we’re narcissists doesn’t mean we don’t want human connection. To separate us from the rest of the world would be the same as white people discriminating against minorities because they don’t look like them. Or straight people discriminating against gays by saying they spread AIDS. And clearly, separating humans into categories has never worked for the betterment of humanity. If you want us to get help, if you want us to be better, we need to learn to empathize with each other her. If we cannot do that, then the general population is no better than us in that regard. It’s an absurd idea and it totally invalidates the point.I just want to thank you all on here for supporting me as much as you do. I lost a best friend yesterday because I informed him of my narcissism and he didn’t react well to it. But I’m glad to have people like you guys on here that I can relate to and discuss topics with that I wouldn’t be able to in public spaces. I appreciate you all more than you know. Many of you are better than most people I’ve met in real life. Thank you, I love you guys.What is the point of engaging in relationships with people who are not cluster B like us? They will never know who I truly am. They will never understand our perspective on life. They will never understand our behaviors and mannerisms and coping mechanisms. So why bother with relationships with NTs? They’ll never be honest and true anyway. It’s as if we are a different species of human. I apologize if this post seems very depressing, this is just how I feel.Do any of you guys have songs that make you feel more grandiose? That help you escape into those fantasies? I need to add more music anyway and I wouldn’t mind some songs that would kind of pick me up when I’m feeling down. The past couple of days have been rough..I have the urge at the moment to fuck up somebody’s day. I want to be a fucking villain right now. They should fear me. I am their worst nightmare. I’m a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Because why be one of the herd when you can be the one who watches from the shadows, waiting for the attack…I don’t know what the hell is going on right now. I don’t believe I’ve ever felt like this haha. I had my third therapy appointment today and my therapist has been trying to show me what empathy is. She’s recognized that I lack in that area so she’s trying to place me in hypothetical situations. It annoys me because I don’t like dealing with hypotheticals. She was challenging my thought processes as well and showed me that they are inherently narcissistic. This method she was using was pissing me off. However, I tried my best to hold my tongue so I wouldn’t come across as out of control. Why can’t I seem to understand that she is trying to help me? I feel intimidated every time I walk in there and I almost never look forward to our meetings. Maybe it’s because she’s challenging me and I’m not used to people challenging me in this way.Everything seems so bad at the moment. Struggling with school now, struggling with finances, and my relationship is in a really bad spot at the moment. Not to mention my father and I don’t talk anymore really. And my grandmother is on her deathbed. Feels as if my whole world is in shambles at the moment. Just want it to slow down for a second…a few weeks ago I felt like I was on top of the world. I was in a grandiose state.Don’t you just love it when someone on the outside is doing whatever they can to ruin your relationship? A female I used to be friends with(we’ll call her B) tried to message my gf telling her that I was on a dating app when I wasn’t. And then B goes out of her way to “wow” react my Facebook post that’s about our 3 year anniversary. This morning some dude messaged my gf saying I was talking to his ex. What’s funny is that the dude knows B as well. Is there some kind of conspiracy? What’s her issue? She really needs to mind her own business and focus on her life.Little rant here. I hate the fact that my entire life is a facade and it always has been. Even in my own family. I feel as if they don’t really even know me. I cannot tell my mother who I really am, as she will not believe it because I am her son and I can do no wrong. I don’t talk to my father anymore as he is a narcissist who will just gaslight me and get into a rage if I tell him how I actually feel about him. And my siblings, they will gaslight me and tell me that my father is a great man who loves us unconditionally. Well they don’t know how he treated me. They don’t know how he stopped caring about me because I didn’t become him. It was either my mother giving me excessive praise and admiration or my father ignoring me and not taking me seriously. Never a balance. Times like these are where I hate my life and wish it wasn’t the way it was. My brothers don’t actually know me, and I feel I don’t actually know them. My sisters I barely know. Instead of telling each-other our problems we just bottle them up and put on a fake smile and a fake act. And watching them turn out like my father did is a real shame.So last night I was very buzzed at a party with a couple of friends and my fiancé. When I am in an intoxicated state, I tend to be more open with my thoughts and feelings. I have a friend I’ve known for 3 years now, he’s a great dude. We’ll call him W for privacy reasons. Anyway, after the party we went back to my friends’ house for the night. My fiancé and W’s partner went to bed. W and I decided to stay up and have a couple of beers and talk. We went outside to a picnic table and talked for hours. During that time, for the first time ever, I told him about my narcissism. Obviously he didn’t believe me at first but I explained to him everything. And the shame I felt and the fear that I was experiencing was intense. I couldn’t look him in the eye, one of my best friends. But he didn’t reject me like I thought he would. He told me it doesn’t define me. He told me I was still his best friend no matter what and he felt closer as a friend, as a brother now. And after having this conversation, I felt an immense weight off of my shoulders. It took alcohol in my system to do it but I am proud of myself anyway. But yet at the same time, I still have some doubts on whether it was a good idea or not. Because I had to be vulnerable and tell the truth. I had to drop my mask and discard the facade. What do you guys think?. So my fiancé has noticed that I’ve been more grandiose ever since I became self aware…why is that? She hates it which I guess makes sense. It’s like my narcissism took a step higher and now I feel as if I’m on top of the world. It’s great but I fear when the vulnerable narcissism will come back. Looking back I feel like I was pathetic and now I feel powerful. It’s weird…. Don’t you just love it when somebody is talking to you about their problems when in all reality you could not care less about what’s happening in their every day life? If you’re not my partner or one of my family members, I really don’t care. I always find myself tuning out people when they’re talking. For example, somebody at work might be telling me about their financial troubles but what does that have to do with me? How exactly does that affect my life? Hehe, if only others knew this I’m sure they wouldn’t talk to me about their problems. A little rant here. I hate that my friend gets to have a career he loves. I hate that he has genuine real love with his partner. I hate that he’s happy. Why don’t I get to have real love? Why does my relationship have to be fucked up? Why do I have to be the one that’s not as successful as I should have been? I’m sorry, I know this sounds selfish but I feel I deserve real love and happiness and everything the world has to offer.So today I stopped at a gas station with my fiancé and we went in to get a couple of fountain drinks. I realized mine was flat after I had her try mine to see if I knew it was for sure flat. It was so I poured it out. Some entitled motherfucker makes a comment saying “this isn’t the taste testing station” or something along the lines of that. I snapped my neck to look at him and see if he was joking and I guess he thought it would be funny to be a sarcastic asshole. He was dead serious. I tried my best to brush it off but I had this intense feeling of rage because I felt humiliated. How dare he talk to me that way like I’m some worthless little bitch. My fiancé kept telling me to let it go but I just kept saying “I’m going to say something”. Once I seen him outside the gas station I told him to go suck a dick. All I could think about was how humiliated I felt and how I wanted to get the last word in. Obviously my fiancé was upset that I tried to welcome conflict and said I should have let it go. But all I could think about was who the hell does he think he is talking to me like that. What a pathetic little weasel. Okay that’s my rant. By the way, I know what I did is wrong now. Just hurt my ego a lot for some reason.I started noticing things I do on a daily basis and I was wondering if anyone here relates to this. I tune people out when they’re talking to me because I don’t care what they’re saying, I only care about what I have to say. I fear rejection from others. When I am criticized, it makes me angry. I gaslight people a lot. When someone asks me to do something, I come up with excuses or I ask them why I should do it. Hell, my fiancé can’t even ask me to do simple things without me making a comment. I feel a constant need for control. I blame others for my problems and can’t actually apologize. I’m always jealous or envious of others. I’m never actually happy for other people when something good happens or them. I feel a need for attention and admiration and validation. If nobody does that, I feel inadequate and it upsets me. The other day…I looked into myself for a sec and there was nothing…just emptiness where there should be a sense of who I am. I started to feel myself getting upset so I shut it off. I tend to struggle with empathy, especially when my fiancé is upset. I sit there and either zone out or I’m just angry and don’t care. I don’t remember the last time I cried for anyone other than my dog that passed away a couple of years ago….
    Zu dem Kind in mir, das kleine 5-jährige verwirrte Mädchen was aus all dem scheiss Streit und dem rumschreien und den Drogen und allem anderen keinen Sinn tun kann: Es tut mir Leid. Du denkst dass das ganze scheiss streiten total sinnlos ist und wünschst es wäre anders. Tut mir Leid man. Tut mir Leid dass ich so bin, und dass die anderen so sind, und dass wir ständig Streit und Stress und Konflikte und Drama verursachen was du alles total sinnlos findest und was dir Angst macht. Tut mir Leid. Ich wünschte es wäre anders. Wir schaffen das. Wir kommen dadurch. Fuck. Tut mir Leid man. 🫂.

I’m in the city every single day going to some restaurant (or not) being shallow as fuck or fucking up my sleeping rhythm 3 times a week by deliberately leaving the house again at 11 pm so I can randomly drive somewhere with the tram or take a 3 hour long walk or go to a strip club or bar or visit a friend in the middle of the night and do drugs with him and fuck up my academic life and success cuz I’ll come out of it with eye bags of death and unwashed hair and sweaty shirts because I wanna feel *fucking alive*. I’m depressed and that’s why I wanna feel alive because I fucking hate depression and this state of being in a foggy swamp not being able to see or do shit like almost nothing else. Because I can’t fucking stand or tolerate in myself and others this soggy foggy swampy nothingness itch like of being a depressed slouch and not doing shit all day. That’s why I *need* to run around all the fucking time and never stop and never take a break and never process. Just take in take in take in.But it’s all fucking shallow anyway. It’s all just depression in reverse, it doesn’t give me anything, it doesn’t give me any deep feelings or deep talks or deep realizations, I’m just as fucking depressed as I would be if I’d just lay in bed all day doing nothing. Nothing real gets thru to me until……until I take it to an extreme. Until I go to my local BDSM munch and let them beat the shit out of me. Until I go see a play in the theatre that really touches me and makes me sob in the middle of the theatre. Until I do new or more drugs that finally make me fucking *feel* something and that finally make me feel *alive*. Just to finally have this moment again where this fucking pressure drops off of me and I can breathe freely again. Just for a few moments, a minute, an hour, a few seconds.It’s pretty ironic isn’t it? Doing all this shit just to feel something whilst I would feel *the most* if I were to just fucking sit down with my feelings and finally take a break and finally start to process all this shit I’ve done in the past few, idk, weeks, months, years? If I were to just stop running and taking in and numbing myself. Hahah but that’s what I want isn’t it?No it’s not really. Ugh. I’m ashamed and I’m scared. I’m scared of all this shit that will come crashing down on me if I finally sit down and breathe. Im ashamed of myself for never sitting down and breathing and fucking *listening* to whatever my brain is trying to tell me. I’m fucking terrified of my own feelings and my own parts and everything that will eventually break down and crush (crash down on?) me. Even though that would be the safest bet to finally feel alive.. Didn’t think I’d come to this point ever again cuz clearly we are the most recovered and most healed fuck out there 😎 but I think our eating disorder is srsly flairing up again. For real this time lol. We keep saying this every half a year or so but yeah idk. We’re eating less on semi-purpose and we’re using food as a sort of reward thing - if we don’t eat that’s great, that means we can deprave ourselves of food and energy AND get thin and “reward” us later on with nice food after a while. That’s the addicting factor I think Plus the ego boost we used to get from it. Rlly it was a great fucking source of supply and honestly I think the ED was also partially “symptom” of our “outlet” for our narcissism Did any of y’all have EDs? I think it goes very fucking well with NPD just like beer and beer glass or wine and meat or coke and alcohol or tea and hot water go together lol. Everything is so far away even my/our anger 🤬🤬😡😡I fucking hate this shit omgomgomg ahhhhh dlflekekAll just cuz we suppressed our fucking feelings for too long omg I hate thisvstatebughhhh This motherfucking BITCH this PIECE OF SHIT I fucking hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him 😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🙅🙅❌❌❌I can feel several ppl being close to front but also like. Ugh fuuuuck over everything is just this dumbass stupid fucking blank canvas layer 🤬🤬😡😡. Empty rage. This fucking empty rage It feels so empty itchy and antsy and I’m so scratchy and tense and just never calm, never quiet, just wanna run around bc I’m never calm or quiet I rage and I get mad and everything is shit and everyone wants to harm me or do me bad and I rage and rage but it’s never enough !! It’s never enough rage. It’s just so empty. Like a bloody red black void with blood dripping from the walls like tar And the others in my head told me “Kal, look into it, there’s something behind this rage. The void is full and filled to the brim with emotions and yourself. What do you feel behind it, what is it?” And I’m like “fuck you don’t tell me what to do” but also like fuck man, shit they’re right.The empty rage is never full bc it’s itchy antsy shame behind, and feelings of betrayal abandonment and fear and sadness and grief How do I get to those feelings, how tf do I feel themI keep running around never being satisfied and just filled to the brim with this fucking empty rage. I never feel anything else unless after days of struggle where I desperately wanna have other feelings and nothing works until some trigger hits me and I can finally cry and it feels almost orgasmic, so much relief. Fuck you all and your fucking momma you dumb ass cunt bitchy shitty fucking motherfuckers pieces of absolute utter trash and garbage!! 🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻Omfg I hate ppl so fucking much. If those bunches of whiny ass babies can’t fucking take what I’m saying then THATS NOT NY FUCKING FAULT!!! Wtf is WRONG with those dumb cunt suckers!!?????? I fucking hate them dude wtf. DISCLAIMER: No literal asses got kicked. It’s just metaphorical. I have my people for kicking my ass ;) bitch-boy is not one of em There is some weird ass dude in our classes that everyone knows cuz he’s just the strangest fucking weirdo you could’ve seen in a while. Paranoid as hell, vulnerable narcissistic, bitter and envious and passive aggressive as fuck and diagnosed autistic as disability. Oh and unaware as fuck. He recently joined our study WhatsApp group. I texted with him for two fucking days and he just fascinated me cuz he was a paranoid, mentally sick fucked in the head fuck that reminded me so much of my younger self that I started liking him even though I looked down on him and thought he was pathetic as all fucking _hell_. I opened up to him more than I had probably with all others I know in my current Uni lectures, told him I have DID and shit. We talked about mental health shit and at first he thanked me for talking to him so he “wouldn’t have to cry in his pillow at night anymore” and then he fucking blocked me because I let out some alters that were patronizing and belittling but also directly telling him to the face what’s going on with his mental health bullshit. He didn’t fucking like that, cuz the shit I’m telling people stings, even tho its true. And THEN, a day later, he covertly shit-talks me behind my fucking back in some lecture as I just found out and I was fucking INFURIATED AND BURNING WITH HATRED. Oh my god it makes me so mad. And sad. It reminds me of my fucking school days were I got bullied and constantly shit talked about. I feel fucking betrayed and if I see this little bitch irl tomorrow I’m gonna tell him to his fucking face that he should directly face and talk to me, instead of blocking me, excusing all of it with some covert “ohhh I’m too sensitive and I’m sorryyyy, I can’t keep talking to you anymoreeew 🥺🥺🥺” and then FUCKING SHIT TALKING ME BEHIND MY BACK TO MY FRIENDS. I hate this fucking little bitch oh my god Is this rlly what I’ll fucking get for opening up to someone?? Holy fuck I feel so betrayed man Edit: also I should specify that this little bitch is looked down upon by most ppl due to how weird he is. So my image shouldn’t be too broken but srsly man, fuck this dumbass piece of shit motherfucker. It’s a breath of fresh air. We’re nasty disgusting bastard dickheads that stab each other in the back at every opportunity but like… we also get each other. Like no one else probably. And like. I feel at home here. I feel accepted and understood and it’s just nice I just had an argument with my mom where I first raged and was mad as hell and then eventually ended up crying and I kinda partially got thru her defenses and at some point I told her all I want is just a mom or well… *someone* who gets me. Who listens to me and who accepts me and understands meAnd we (me and the headmates) feel better now cuz we at least got some of that shit off our chest And yeah I just wanted to say thanks. We love this community for what it is, fuck man You can be yourself around here and be heard and seen and understood and I wish for us to keep being the backstabbing cheating lying and painfully empathic bastards we are ~~(and maybe heal a bit more on the way)~~Edit: and it feels soooo wrong to tag this shit as “upbeat talk” lmaooo I wish I would’ve tagged it as “venting” just to fucking mess around. Ugh idk I’ve been scared of shit being wrong w my heart all day now Ever since this stupid dumbass K event at the party on Saturday I feel like there’s smth wrong w my heart and I’m terrified terrified terrified ugghhhAlso my blood pressure been too low all day I’m. Scared. Waking up in the middle of the night thinking you’re gonna die is just fucking awesome. Mhhh yeah love that,. Nothing better than this shit Forgot how fun this is cuz we haven’t had it in a while 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥. And they can go fuck off 🤬🤬 everybody !! Dumb fucks 😡😡🤬🤬 pieces of fucking shit garbage dumb trash can fucker. I’ve done like 2 lines of K at a party yesterday night, and after the second line I‘ve started having arrhythmia/an irregular heartbeat (blood measuring thing confirmed that) which lasted for like, hours, and only went away after I slept. :/Can K cause arrhythmia? It was scary as fuck and I didn’t know what to do about it except „sitting (sleeping) it out“. Getting a heart disease is like my worst fear health-wise lmao. Is there anything you can do about it??. Like seriously man, fuck them. 😞☹️😕😞Tired of those I want real human connection, I want warmth and compassion and affection Fuck this shit, don’t wanna anymore. Nope I’m outta here. I feel depressed. I feel sad. I wanna cry and I have this weird fucking feeling stuck up my throat I‘m tired of all this mental health bullshit. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why on God‘s fucking earth was I blessed with so many shitty fucking things? Idk I wanna hug my inner child and I have no fucking idea how to deal with them. Fuck. They’re scared all the time and always have these „nightmares“ which are flashbacks, and they’re constantly stuck in there. Idfk how to deal with them and I wanna tell them that everything is okay Idk why I have so much chaos and drama in my life. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why the fuck can’t I be stable? Why the fuck can‘t I have any more goddamn fucking order in here than anybody else? Idk I don’t understand Why do I have to let myself get beat up and run after weird psychopath men and fuck up my goddamn Uni career and constantly be a fucking. Goddamn. hindrance in my own fucking way?? I don’t want this anymore. And even tho the Flair says „Venting - No Advice Request“ (I rlly don’t like how caged this dumb flair tag makes me feel - what do you mean I can’t vent anymore without having some advice? What happened to the good ol wild r/NPD territory?🤬🤬 Is this lawful country now? Is this „stick up your ass“ land now or what?) if anybody can look thru my bullshit by all means - do it! But only if I respect you lmao But yeah idk everybody whom I even get remotely close to just keeps telling me how very fucking ✨✨special✨✨ I am Maybe I am! I mean who the fuck knows! Maybe I am indeed very fucking special and everyone who says otherwise can go fuck themselves with a pizza up their ass bro.

And it’s the most narcy apology I’ve ever read lmaoo “I’m sorry for having overwhelmed you with my expectations that we’re too high, and it overwhelmed *especially* you”, like wtf lmaooo I don’t even feel that mad tho. Just kinda a mix of disappointed, betrayed, a bit angry, and also grandiose weirdly enough, sickly sweet taste of “he’s thinking abt me, he desires me, he wanted to apologize”And also I want someone to help me make sense of all of this and I wanna shit talk hun to everyone and at the same time not Ugh I’ll have to wait and ponder a few days before I answer him.

Fuck you. Fuck you all. I’m cold and angry and bitter and envious and frustrated. And fed up.Just because this dumb fucking ego is standing in my goddamn way all the time. I screw shit up constantly.

Ready for facing all the crap and bullshit and dumbfuck garbage that’s stuck up my butt and my head like a fucking buttplug reaching to the goddamn moon.And you’ll have to deal with this crap. I’m good, I’m better than everyone in this entire fucking world, and I suck and I’m shit and a dumb mean nasty sadistic narcissistic bitch.I’m also warm and kind and giving and hopeful sometimes. I’m hot and cold like an alternating hot-cold-shower and I’m green and violet and black and red and blue and full of frustration and bitterness and anger.Hurting people and loving them is the same side of the coin, whatever dude. Fuck Reddit, fuck everything, fuck the entire world so you’ve at least done something *useful*. So you’ve at least been useful. The least fucking shit you can do, for me.Of course it’s all for me and I fucking hate you and I put myself above you because *clearly* I’m fucking better than you, and *clearly* I know better and you’re a fucking piece of shit. But really, I’m angry about myself and frustrated and bitter and envious because I can’t fucking deal with shit and fuck things up. But I’m not gonna succumb into this trashhole of a garbage dumpster fire self pity again. I’m fed up and fucked up. Screw you, fuck you, do something, just do *something*. Don’t care what it is, just do *something*.And then I’ll make a deal with God and sell my soul so I can burn in the entire hell pit of fiery hot soul-bonding sound-fucking ass-bending eternity, and burn this fucking place down and take it all with me.Until I wake up in the morning and see it’s all been the fucking same again, and always has been. Fuck you.Idfk what it is but I’m full of rage and contempt and envy ugh Just make these dumbass feelings stop omg.

Why the fuck do those fuckers always want ME to give a shit about THEM? Like, wtf? Nope, not me, I’m not gonna care about them bitches, screw them Why do *I* always have to fix everybody and everything?? Fuck you, not gonna do that anymore, it’s exhausting and tiring and feels fake af and I don’t wanna do it, screw yooouuu 😤😤🙅❌. I’m a people-collector. I collect people like others collect stamps or lighters (I actually collect lighters too). I went to a jazz bar yesterday evening and had like two drinks and I was tired as fuck and lowkey felt weird and strange and tense and I listened to the concert those people played and this made me happy and then afterwards I talked to one of the musicians, the bartender, a random girl my age and a random gay dude I met there and who seemed similar to me (they all did) and with whom I exchanged numbers in the end.I barely fucking remember this evening and I felt like another person was at that bar entertaining people listening to music and just generally being there and… existing.I told these people I’m very fucking good at getting to know new people and very fucking bad at keeping contact. This makes me run around irritable as fuck all the time and collect new people constantly. I always want more more more and the new shiny thing I just got two weeks ago isn’t new and shiny anymore and I don’t wanna play with it anymore. The glow has faded and it’s stale and boring now. Kinda. Mostly. After getting to know someone just a little bit better or after having broken their shell.All I want and care about is these people and new shiny toys liking me. I care about you as long as I haven’t gotten thru your shell and as long as you don’t like me but I’m interested in you and I wanna make you like me. If I succeed at that, you’re boring and I wanna go look out for new people and new shiny toys.It’s like. I feel like I’m at a funfair doing a carnival game, in one of those stands where you can shoot those little porcelain stars and depending on how many you’ll get, you’ll get a price. All I care about is shooting as many as possible and getting better at that game and then if I aim and shoot a star and it’s broken, that’s my supply and my praise and validation. The more, the better. The less, the more I wanna get better and be able to hit all of those exact 20 shots next time. The price is you and the price isn’t really interesting to me. The activity is much more fun and the activity is getting to know more people and charming them and making them like me. *Especially* if they’re a challenge and don’t like me at first or they don’t admit they like me. That’s the most fun thing. That’s shooting even tinier porcelain stars which makes it a lot harder but also more fun. (Those fucking dismissive-avoidants 😒😗🙄) I like that. Finally, if I’ve succeeded, I just move on. People are exciting and fascinating and they give me highs and lows and some of them do it *so well* I can’t fucking stop anymore. It’s like an addiction.Idk where I was going with this anymore so I’ll just keep it at this. And I didn’t wanna do it at all in the first place but then I kinda succumbed to it and decided fuck it, why the fuck not. Writing it down so I’ll remember So we had like this piece of rope laid out on the ground and I imagined myself as now and I started crying and then I walked towards the end of the rope with my therapist and imagined myself in 5 years from now. I felt very fucking embarrassed about it and felt blocked doing this shit but somehow still did it Imagined future where I’m living in apartment with cat and maybe partner surrounded by plants working full-time-job in IT and I’m just… calm. I’m comfortable with myself. It was nice and interesting. Because I know I have it in me. This calmness and the ability to heal But the 5 years in between were a tumultuous and chaotic trouble but it’s just.. nice knowing I have this in me man. Ugh idk. It’s just so fucking frustrating. Like, I study maths and a lot of my peers are shy introverted dorks with low self esteem that never really have opinion on shit and just do whatever the fuck you tell them to do. It’s so frustrating and infuriating. I’m someone who has strong opinions on things and who’s loud about them and tells them to people if they ask. For example we’re in a group of 5 people and wanna go grab lunch. Which canteen do we wanna go to? I say: Well, canteen X cuz I think they have Y and I like this and it’s tasty. *Literally nobody fucking else has an opinion* so we just do whatever the fuck I told them to do. It’s so fucking weird because isn’t this what I always want?? Leading people and them doing whatever tf I want them to do?? But it just gives me this weird icky suspicious as hell shame feeling inside. „Like, am I really the only one who has an opinion on this? Why the fuck do they do as I say? I feel ashamed of myself, I don’t wanna run all over them. Am I too dominant? Too loud?“ etc Like, here’s the thing. I still wanna be friends with some of them cuz I like them and some are quite interesting and I just. Don’t wanna end up abusing everybody all the time and being toxic as fuck and running all over them cuz I genuinely wanna get better. But like. HOW THE FUCK DO I DO THIS IF THEY JUST LITERALLY *PROVOKE* ME TO BE THIS WAY AND RUN ALL OVER THEM CUZ THEY DON‘T HAVE AN OPINION ON ANYTHING AND JUST DO AS I SAY ALL THE FUCKING TIME?? 😭😭😭How do you *behave* around ppl like this???It’s like, what the fuck do you want me to SAY, should I just *also* not have an opinion on shit?? So nobody’s taking the leash here?? Or should I just be fine with this?? I’m not fine with it! Just… say SOMETHING MAN!I kinda wanna tickle out their personalities and their opinions on shit but ahhhh idk how to handle stuff like this.Dad, I wish you could read this. I miss you. I’ve figured out a lot since your death and I’ve worked thru even more of fucked up things. (Actually making myself this vulnerable makes me feel sick and I lowkey feel disgusted with myself but whatever.) I’ve loved, hated, been heartbroken, fucked up, betrayed, succeeded, did some things that probably would’ve made you proud and some things you probably would despise and hate and harshly judge me for. I’m listening to my songs from the 70s/80s/90s playlist rn and fuck I think I might start crying. You would’ve loved those. You couldn’t show me how proud you are, Mom is probably right with this. Or you showed it in your own way, idk. I used to have a fuck ton of anger and hatred and contempt for you but actually… I understand you now. A bit better. A lot maybe idk. I miss you. I want you back. But you’re gone. (Rn “One Night in Bangkok” by Murray Head is up. I know you liked this song.)I’m not your little daughter/son/kid anymore that wants to make you proud and is driven by spite and hatred for you and an obsession I didn’t recognize up until lately. I’ve grown up and I’ve seen things and I’ve lived thru a ton of crap in my short life so far. I know you probably still live on in my head somewhere as an Introject, idk maybe (thanks Mud?). And I get you now more than ever before I think. I wish we could’ve made up before you died. Remember that one phone call we had? Where I made you sob? I felt fucking terrified and angry as fuck and powerful as fuck afterwards. I had hope and I thought it was completely pointless to talk to you about all this. I thought “Man, we’re never gonna talk about all this crap that happened”, but I also thought “God, holy shit. That was something new. That was good. Fuck. I feel hopeful. I know we have to talk this thru somewhen. I wanna pity you but I’m not gonna do that cuz FUCK YOU!” and I had my fists up again. I thought you were the end boss and I thought if I could beat you, I could beat anything and everything in the fucking entire goddamn world. I really believed that, like goddamn man. Now I know much more. You live on in myself and my memories and in other people and in lovers and therapists and friends and inanimate objects and events to come. Man I wish I could hug you. I miss you a lot. I love you. I think. Idk man. I don’t know. You’re not the end boss. Well not anymore. Maybe somewhere still, inside, idk. I’ve faced you before, thru myself and thru others.You’re just, like, my Dad. A confused and traumatized old man (thanks u/PoosPapa) who’s lived thru a lot of bullshit (just like me) and wanted to make things better than your father did, I know you wanted to. I know you fucking hated him and despised the shit out of him and he fucked you up real good. Fuck man. It runs in the family huh?Hell I never could’ve said this shit if you were still alive. God knows where the fuck we would be now if you still lived. Man. Fuck you Dad. But also I love you. What the fuck is it always with this fucking narcy thing about admitting love only ever after you don’t have anymore what you love? 🥲 If you hold it in your hands you fucking hate it and throw it away like a hot hard boiled egg you just grabbed straight outta the pot, and if it’s gone you might finally acknowledge shit and miss what you just had. Anyways, Dad. I love you. And I fucking hate you. And screw you man, you stupid bitchass dumbfuck cockroach eating trashcan motherfucker. But also I miss you.And well uh…I’m just like you.We had a flashback or more like, our little had it. Damn I feel so sorry for them and I sat down and told them what u/Emotional-Climate777 told us they do with their littles which is: we told them it’s all just a movie playing and we can make it move faster or slower or make the voices all high pitched and sound funny or turn everybody into colorful plushies and make it all funny and ridiculous.Flashback was something very heavy, probably vaulting box like you have in gym class during high school (?) being pressed into out rib cage and felt like dying. Couldn’t breathe. Though we’ll die. Cried and called for help but nobody came Up until later someone rescued us. Thought we’re dying Have trauma around having sudden heavy “sharp” “pressing against chest” feeling which we sometimes got and thought we were dying and getting a heart attack. Dying Could never get behind this feeling until now Comforted little, tried to ground them and then Gabriel came around and calmed themHe told them they can always call out for him if they’re in trouble and we told them we love them and we’ll always be there for them and we won’t, WON’T let it happen that someone hurts them. If someone should ever hurt them we’re so gonna kick their fucking bitchy ass 😡🤬😤Now sitting in the care being itchy and antsy uncomfortable af irritable and idk what to do abt it. Maybe too much coffee maybe someone not doing well idk can’t get thru to them.you’re the spoiled golden child, the little chick getting everything and everybody she’s ever wanted Having more money really suits me I can buy whatever pretty outfits and dresses and all that shit I ever wanted. Fuck yeah it’s amazing Like others hold me back from spending too much money cuz we shouldn’t use it all up and ppl b getting mad at me for spending hundreds of euros but idc some of it allow it But being the spoiled little baby girl golden child is really nice 😌I wanna be the prettiest, the sexiest, the hottest. We just bought some new outfit and got complimented as “outfit of the day” by an employee and damn it just made us feel so fucking amazing.Spoiled little baby girl that gets spoiled with everything she ever wants and deserves All I need and want and deserve cuz I simply just fucking deserve it Spoiled little bitch baby girl getting her needs met Golden child, golden girl getting satisfied and all her wishes fulfilled Having more money really suits us/me, damn Can get and buy whatever the fuck I wanted and always wished for Nice 😌 love it love it I want more of it and I never want it to stop I wanna wear ALL the pretty outfits and dresses and be a spoiled little golden baby girl chick and hot and amazing and justYeah 😌☺️. I feel like I’m losing it and someday I’m just gonna fucking snap and explode and tear down everything I’ve ever known and loved and take it with me onto an endless spiral of doom. Why always patronizing Why always demonizing Why always belittling others and why always being on top of everything It’s tiring it’s tiring why the fuck should I always do those things it’s so pointless to me so fucking pointless Why not just simply stop doing this bullshit Why always arguing and having conflicts and doing whatever IdkWhy always that and this and that. What the fuck man. Get the goddamn stick outta your ass you fucking bitches. Why in the FUCK and why on heaven’s earth do these fuckers think I’m larping? Yeah I’m having sooo much fun having NPD and DID and I think it’s fucking amazing woohoo!! 🥳 🥳 If someone could present me with a viable reason as to why I should be “larping” having mental disorder then fine, go ahead and tell me! Give me logical reasons as to why I think I’m fucking doing that shit. Bugger off you dumbass fucking bitches If you can’t deal with the way I literally am then that’s not my goddamn fault So I’m larping and playing a role, so what? Nothing is real anyway, have fun with your fucking projection you fucking bitches 😂🤣. Right now i feel like im me and myself like im normal and just me. I feel like ive always been that way and always will be. But when were switching we feel so unstable and mostly when we havent fully switched we're a mould and a mix of several different people at once. Idk whats goibg on its confueing im confused. Yeah I need to bring back order into this system. Like wtf man. Everyone’s having beef with each other like some sour grapes. That’s complete bullshit cuz I KNOW y’all can do better. Just posting here for the others to see. I think us spending so much time on Reddit and the internet is bullshit cuz we really gotta get our goddamn shit together lol. Don’t need supply from this pathetic ass platform, we gotta focus on ourselves. Working on bringing everyone together again.I realized I had FUN with my death anxiety and actually LOVED IT like oh my GOD dude Reminder to self to make post abt it later. If I die right here and right now then so be it. (Except I don’t wanna die lmao fuck lol) I just accept things as they are I’ll have a heck of a bad time if I resist against the experience, even if the experience is… dying Fuck you death, I’m ready for you. Here it comes 💀.
    Sometimes I say I am a irredimible monster with no good qualities and this makes me sad, I don't know if this is narcissism, but the constant negativity makes me unhappy. I think this might be self-love actual self-love not narcissistic grandiose arrogancy. What do you guys think?Edit: to explain further, it is like my brain is saying, "calm down, you are not that bad, you made mistakes, you are not a monster, stop beating yourself". I quite literally see my therapist as an object that's only purpose is to make my self-steem better, there is no transference there.How do I stop seeing others as objects that just judge me?. People always talk about how narcissistic people can complete understanding others inner thoughts as though they were mind readers and use this to their advantage to manipulate others.I in other hand have a very hard time even understanding personality, to me people are unpredictable, I don't know how they would behave in certain situations and sometimes I can't even see they are being contradictory in the way they behave. Personality is magic to me, something I never truly understood.I'll use myself as an example I can't think of anything they like or dislike, I have no opinions, I have no opinion on politics, no hobbies, not even morals. Zero personality whatsoever, personality seems like something magical to me.So my question is, can someone actually be completely empty, without even a reason to get up in the morning?. 10 years later have been in full blown depression for 9 years for not understanding why life seems so steril and everyone doesn't seem alive, they feel just extension of myself, not truly human beings. Also the lack of true-self, having no self-image, not knowing if you even like a movie or not, if you have any interests or not. This life is a leaving hell, not only the world seems dead I also seem dead and I just discovered I have NPD which actually explain all of this really well. Maybe NPD is the worst and most lonely existence a human can have. You can always have your narcissistic suplies but you don't have a meaningfull connection with them, they are all just extensions of yourself, not truly other people.I am starting to believe I am in a fucking simulation, what meaning has this life where nobody exists besides yourself and even the concept of yourself is something confusing and not easy to understand.I am the dumbest user on this board, but even I have somethings that I am good at.I can easily identify which ingredients were use in each plate that I eat, Iam pretty good at this for some reason. I also have some minor talent with math, nothing really big, I prefer to not expand on that.Now what I am really, really terrible at understanding how computers work, I read the definition of API and communication protocols so many times I still cannot understand it at all, like at all. I also suck at economy, for example, no matter how many times someone explain to me how and why inflation occurs I simply cannot understand. I know it means that price on basically everything raises, but why inflation occurs? I will never understand. The other topic that is way too complicate for me is politics and philosophy, specially ethics philosophy. I understand the basics of capitalism and socialism but that's it, with my basic knowledge I cannot decide which is one more logical or better for society so I generally abstain from voting because I am incapable of understanding what each party is saying.Now, about Gardners 9 intelligence theory. I would say spatial and logical/mathematical are the ones I am best at, still below average but not as bad as linguistic which I am way bellow a mild intellectual disabled person and definitely not as bad as intrapersonal, interpersonal and spiritual intelligence which are alien to me.For the longest time I lived in denial about being dumb. I thought my problems were either something everyone else faced or was because of some learning disabilities like dyslexia (which I actually do have even though it is mild) or ADHD. But as the times passed the amount of evidence to the contrary started to stack up. Being just low iq wouldn't be so bad, there are millions upon millions of other people with low iq in this world and many are happy and live fulfilling lives, but it was becoming more clear each day that I was not just dumb, but super dumb.I basically can't watch a tv show, movie, or anime without getting confused, without questioning why did that character did such a thing or what the simple sentence they said even meant. Books are out of reach to me, completely impossible, even simple children's books. Human interactions are also too complicated to me, I can never understand some of the actions of my peers, why would they behave the way they do, what are they truly feeling and what they truly mean when talking, it always seems like there is some subtext to the conversations, there is always some hidden meaning that I am incapable of figuring out. And when people start talking about emotions or psychologist concepts such as projecting I am 100% incapable of even begining to comprehend wtf is being said. Why would someone project their emotional state in others, I don't get it. Why when people feel a certain way they behave like that, it is all so confusing and impossible to me.There are also many other evidences that point to not only a low iq, but to an incredible low iq. I've read across reddit and 4chan people that say they have intellectual disabilities and they all post about things I am unable to even begin to comprehend. Some post poetris that go way over my head, many have arguing abilities way above mine. I basically never argue because I would just get destroyed and I can never think in a good argument to enrich a discussion. Games are also another pile of evidences showing my low reasoning abilities. I always suck at them, I never learn and just go by using the most basic knowledge and never using any deep and intricate gameplay.I have so many more examples that I could reach character limit if I wanted, but I think that's enough, I just want to keep this text short and simple so people can at least kinda comprehend what is to live with very, very low iq and by that I mean below 50. It is a nightmare, nothing brings joy, because everything is hard, confusing and frustrating. My dream is not even to be a person with average intelligence, but someone smart enough to not be confused by basic logic and to be able to watch a tv show and enjoy it without getting frustrated.Since I know my text sucks and may be hard to understand what I am saying, you can ask me what I meant in a specific sentence and I'll do my best to explain, but don't expect much from me.As the title says what type of games are your favorites? Contrary to most people here, I think, I really, really enjoy puzzle games, because they are challenging and always make me think and sometimes when I get the answer write it makes me feel good, it makes me feel smart and having an average intelligence is probably the biggest wish I have in life. Baba is you, stephen's sausage roll, Return of the Obra Din, Talos Principle, all very ingenious and fun games. Some other games that I also enjoy that are not really puzzle-like but still kinda cerebral are the phoenix wrigth games and Danganronpa games, they have lots and lots of text and I get confused easily but I still have fun trying to solve the mysteries even if I get it wrong many times.But my favorite games have nothing to with puzzles. Pokemon, Monster Hunter, Dark Souls, Shin Megami Tensei, Katamari Damaci, Megaman, Super Mario and many other platformers with almost no story elements are my favorites, they are simple that even a small child can play it but still require some skill which is fun.
    Yesterday I had a consult with my psychiatrist to review the results of my post treatment block EEG. This is done after each 10 day treatment of [MeRT which is based on TMS.](https://braintreatmentcenter.com/treatment/mert) I expect 3, 10 day treatment blocks.My first EEG, taken prior to any treatment, showed a brain in conflict, where feelings come at me much faster than speech, memory and judgement. Like an orchestra without a conductor, some instruments are out of time with the others.No wonder I can't dance. ;)Yesterday's consult of the second EEG shows the three sections of my brain, anterior, mid and posterior, more in synch.I can feel it.It is not pleasant nor happy and I am very tired. All of this is anticipated. But the new Dr did not trust my NPD diagnosis and so, today, I was evaluated by his partner who specializes in DID.He corrected me. He interrupted me and took control of the conversation much better than my therapist. In short, I can't verbally "roll" him. He pushes my buttons. At last. A worthy adversary!The idea is that once I am in synch, all these old repressed emotions and thoughts are coming through. I am remembering and able to judge my feelings more accurately and my anxiety is skyrocketing.I have been doing a lot of gardening, running and venting to my therapist. It's coming at me pretty hard these days.I haven't felt this bad since I lived with my abusers and I guess that's what progress feels like.It's raw and the walls of this pit are black and slimy with fear. But there is a glimmer in the distance and that feels like hope.For me, it's 5:30 AM when the alarm goes off. I can snooze and roll over and ignore my family and my responsibilities to them or get up and start my daily routine.On cold and snowy work days, it's harder than warm days off for sure.That is the moment when I make one of the biggest decisions of my day. Will I take the opportunity to work on self discipline and be a better man?If I roll over, I will eventually be forced out of bed because the dogs NEED to go outside unless I ignore them and let my wife pick up the slack. When I do get up, I have missed several opportunities to lead and I am probably out of time for exercise and a good breakfast.If I get up and start my morning routine, I set myself up for success. My wife and our dogs have better mornings, I do better at work and I feel better about myself all day.I see that minute... 5:30AM as my moment of truth.Anyone else have a moment of truth during your day and what does that look like?. MeRT therapy, 5 days per week for two weeks.[https://braintreatmentcenter.com/treatment/mert](https://braintreatmentcenter.com/treatment/mert)EEG shows I process emotions and physical sensations much faster than I can pass them through my center brain. So then I try to make up the difference in my frontal lobe.It's like a highway where there is a bottle neck between where the shipping trucks start and the destination. So the guys at the destination work like mad to make up the time but can't ever get caught up so they drop shit.Lots of shit and it gets dropped before I get to decide what to drop.I live in the fight or flight reflex and always have.MeRT uses magnetic resonance to create a sort of electric pulse that targets some of the problems the scan shows.In two weeks, we remeasure. Changes may be accounted for with hard numbers.I start tomorrow afternoon.They gonna zap my brain....So if the lights dim tomorrow afternoon.. BZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzztttt.. You'll know why. ;). I call mom every week on Monday mornings.It's hard. She's 90, can't hear, interrupts constantly and no matter what I say or do the answer is Jesus Christ.She asks, "How is your morning going?". I say, "It's a beautiful morning and while I was out picking a tomato and basil for breakfast, " and she interrupts. "That's nice". Then she goes on to tell me all about her week. Most of what she tells me, she told me last week, and the week before.Sigh. Ok. She never heard nor cared about anything I said. She's a narcissist, just like me.It's been like this since as long as I can remember. It's just how she is.But damn this past week was rough so when she started droning on and on about Jesus and the guilt tripping..When she **has** to take a breath I interrupt, "Mom, please. I didn't call you to talk about religion." to which she replies "Now settle down." in that patronizing tone she has. You know the one.Only the people here in this forum can truly appreciate the level of rage that invokes in me. It is instant and VERY hot. The next words out of my mouth will ruin her whole month.I hung up on her.Then I spent the next two days stewing and steaming, wanting to tell her to take her bible and...Now I need to apologize to her for hanging up.Mom is not capable of understanding her role in the dust up. She has never been able. She cannot apologize because she cannot be wrong.If I suggest that she's wrong, I'm attacking Jesus Christ..Carrying all this baggage has cost me two mornings. Last night I let it go and forgave her. The I forgave myself for hanging up.But to win and to fulfill the promise I made so long ago, tomorrow I call and apologize.Gonna need some time in the garden with the butterflies, basil and bees tomorrow.Going to meet the new Dr today, an actual psychiatrist not a therapist.My therapist referred me as I am beyond her skillset.The new Dr. runs a TMS Center and Ketamine clinic in town. She called in bigger guns.Shit fixin' to get real and I have been dissociating HARD for the past two weeks feeling like I dosed two or three hits of LSD, all floaty and out-of-body.People have been asking me if I am OK. They can see it in my face as the mask slips. This hasn't happened to me in decades.I go all in today, and as I'm writing this I feel a sense of calm I have not felt in weeks.Time to run, shower and eat, focus on the day and the task ahead.The barrage begins in 90.EDIT: New Dr is on. I have an EEG scheduled for tomorrow morning as a precursor to EMDR and TMS as well as a referral for TFP if we can get it or CBT if not. I'm not a candidate for psilocybin as I have used it in the past.I have been on defense for 45 years.It feels good to be on the attack.Thank you all of you who have read and talked to me this past year. I couldn't be here without you.I feel the urge to let go, to drift again back into the fantasy world and to daydream my day away.The pull is strong this week. Every waking moment is a struggle to stay on course in the shifting current. Every time I slip, my head spins around and I have to concentrate hard to remember where I am and what I am doing.I keep forgetting things. Names are the worst but passwords, technical steps. Details like unsetting the parking brake or locking the door get lost in the chaos of the struggle for direction.It's cold today. Autumn has reached 7,000 ft in the Rocky Mountains and there is a bite in the morning air. Maybe a run in the cool air to pull me back followed by a hot breakfast and a bit of applesauce spice cake. Still, gotta wait for sunrise.Some days are better than others. I don't know if it a cycle of the moon or if sleep deprivation from dealing with the new puppy is taking it's toll, but today feels like I'm starting off down in a hole.Is it Friday yet?. Hard cardio has always worked to get me out of fantasy land and back into the real world. It's my number one go-to fixall for NPD related depression."I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard." -Alan TuringI feel like I am in good company.54MOur forum numbers are growing. New people join daily and I can't imagine how many lurkers we have here due to the stigma.So what do people who come here, want?I'd like to list 5 things in order of the things people who come here want.1. Supply2. Validation3. New Diagnosis Aid4. Community5. VentSupply is me saying I made a bitchen' cake and overcame oceans of stress to do so.Validation is me saying I feel like shit because I was an ass and does this happen to you too.New diagnosis is basically, holy cow I feel like shit what do I do now and is almost always written as a stream of consciousness.Community is how do you deal with this and that.Venting is a rant about how fucked all this is and damn it all, I'm going to be BAD.So what say, what do we want/think people want when they come here?. NPD stole my ego. I don't do. I react. My will to power is extremely weak because I am not invested in life without an ego.I wonder how this impacts me in subtle ways I might not notice.The term "lunatic" was created when people noticed that the mentally infirm would spaz out during a full moon. The trend was so noticeable it became part of the language.Beats are rhythms caused by synchronous movement. There is a gap in the rings of Saturn caused by the syzygy of heavenly bodies tugging gravitationally on the ring and the moon that controls that ring. A similar beat is likely what caused Jupiter and Saturn to swap places and fling Uranus into it's odd orbit.Does this happen to me on some level because some external element is able to so easily overcome my weak ego?Do I respond to posts on this forum in the same way? Do we as a group?There was a flood of kms posts in the spring this year. Are we all reacting at the same time to a combination of external stimuli and the post trend on our forums?I'm starting to note my attitude before I come to this forum to see if it changes, to determine which comes first, the attitude or me reading the posts I relate to on my very toughest days.In other words, are the trends I think I notice here on our forums caused by interactions on the forum or are we collectively reacting to external, macro situations such as a full moon, then coming here, posting a trend and creating a beat?. Pink Floyd 1979 The Wall - Outside the WallAll alone, or in twosThe ones who really love youWalk up and down, outside the wallSome hand in handAnd some gathered together in bandsThe bleeding hearts and the artists make their standAnd when they've given you their allSome stagger and fall, after all it's not easyBanging your heart against some mad bugger's wall[Pink Floyd The Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIzqkCNkSHg)&#x200B;. Thank you all for your perspective.Speaking with my therapist, she is shocked that we have this place.I talk to her for an outside perspective but she only understands me intellectually. In her office, I am an outsider trying to explain to someone who is fundamentally different.Her advice is very useful but she hasn't lived like this, like we all have and do.Being able to vent here and to read other people's similar problems shows me myself from outside myself. We are more alike here than we are different.Unlike my therapist, here, we have the same problems and face the same dilemma and existential questions.Here and only here, I am not alone.For the first time in 54 years... I am not alone.You give me hope.Thank you.Four attempts and four flattened cakes.All I know about this whole altitude thing is, don't bake while high!Still it has been a fun trip and I have learned a lot and shared a lot of cake with neighbors.My latest attempt was done over the 1st and 3rd. I baked the cakes on the 1st and froze them until the 3rd when I assembled the three layer tower and frosted it. This is a trick I learned because my second attempt leaned pretty hard during assembly. Chill the cakes after baking and before frosting.Anyway, all three cakes failed to fully rise in the center, so during assembly I had a gap that I had to fill with frosting to keep the cake level. I didn't want to overwhelm the cake with frosting so it still had an ANNOYING AS HELL dip in the center of the top, but nobody minded.It had a white layer at the bottom, a red layer in the middle and a blue top with white frosting stars and we ate it at a big block party with food from multiple cultures and while drinking home made moonshine and lighting fireworks.We do it every year in my long and wide driveway and the party went until late. We don't socialize much, but we don't hide. Drives my poor wife nuts.I am man. I refuse to quit. My cakes will be a wonder that all will behold some day with great appreciation and admiration. Today, I got some heat diffusers. I am going to try baking that cake yet again."Behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes." -Jim CarreyReady for some more chocolate, babe?. Guys who bring drama to their girl are bathing in girl repellant.FWIW, I will be forever washing this shit off of myself.Talking to girls about NPD and depressing shit or excusing my behavior with NPD, turns them off.What I have learned has cost me, so I ask the r/NPD forum from any perspective, guy, girl, trans, whatever and whoever is willing to offer perspective.Does a guy talking to a girl about this stuff ever work or does it just ruin everything?. I failed at baking a cake and it was a blast.The end goal is a three layer, chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting, all from scratch. But for today I just wanted to see if I could bake three chocolate cake layers and have edible chocolate.I learned a ton. Had some fails and some spills. Had to put the batter back in the bowl after I had filled two cake pans because I forgot to grease the cake pans...There was a time when things weren't going well and I could see my wife stepping back. I checked the tone of my voice and took a quick trip to the can to realign my emotions with my goal.I won that fight today with help from her nudge and as a result, she had a good time with me.The cakes baked up well but when I opened the oven door, all three fell (collapsed in the center) probably due to altitude (about 7,000 ft here). That made them super challenging to get out of the pans and the cakes are now basically brownie bits...Not even gonna make frosting. But it just doesn't really matter.Because today, I ruined three cakes, and had a fine afternoon with my wife doing so. The cakes are in bits but they taste great and I have ideas on how to make adjustments for next time.And there will be a next time.And a next, as many as it takes until I can display a scratch made, three layer, chocolate cake with butter, cream cheese frosting.Because it's not really about the cake.
    Usually it’s just mild depression and extreme high grandiosity but currently I’m feeling something a bit more sinister? Like an uneasy urge to cause great amounts of harm to other people or things around me. It’s not anger it just feels like something needs to be fed. Is it attention seeking? I’m unsure but this is the 2nd time I felt this way. My usual copes are not helping either but I’m controlling myself at least.Think I’ll go to the gym, get a pump and watch people stare and glance at me, then head back home and take a fuck load of pics maybe in a fit maybe just selfies. Best part is posting them on my ig story before the inevitable crash comes down 4-5hrs later and I think I look like the lamest fucking person ever 😂.We were going around saying what we felt like doing with our lives. Gets to my turn and I say my dream job is running a huge company close to Fortune 500 level. They all get silent and say that’s something only psychopaths would want to be and I just sat and said wow that’s crazy haha. Man that was awkward bruh. I just see it all as pointless arguing. I can acknowledge the events and understand what’s going on but I don’t feel the need to take to the internet and start chanting and spreading awareness about either side. It’s not like by yelling #freepalestine somehow the bombs are gonna stop dropping it just seems so useless. Maybe it’s just the lack of empathy? I talked with friends about it and they all blew up in frustration and anger when I tried explaining this to them. To me it seems completely logical.
    Very edgy title but things feel like shit recently. I just feel like constantly sleeping. My stomach tenses up so much. I have to stop myself from just going off on people. Nothing ever talks about the suffering a narc goes through, only ever about how to fucking make our lives worse or whatever. God this life sucks.I had invited him over and things went well. But just now I went through his phone. I know I shouldn’t have but my curiosity really got the better of me. I saw all the texts of him and his friends talking shit, and I’m really trying not to plan anything. A lot of the things they pointed out as bad honestly were true. Selfish, obsessed, always thinking I’m right. But sometimes it truly feels like I’m better than everyone. Idk maybe I am, maybe I’m not, I still don’t know what to do with this information. He swore up and down on his life he didn’t talk about me. Is it like a narc stereotype to go through someone’s phone?. Im really worried for him. I think he said shrooms maybe acid. I’m wondering how this could affect him? Could it make his schizophrenia worse? And what should I tell him? I can’t really stop him because if he really wants to do them he’s gonna, but what can I do. Ive had two dreams two nights in a row that freaked me out.The first one was with my German teacher. I remember everyone leaving the class and it got kinda dark. I suddenly was on my knees in front of him and he made me touch his dick. After, I told a friend in the dream of it and got like teleported to some counselors. They laughed with him and I remember feeling betrayed, and didn’t beleive me.The second one disturbed me more. I was in the shower and my dad forced himself in. I was screaming at him to leave and covered myself with a blanket (still in the shower?) but my screams weren’t becoming loud. Then I remember all he was wearing suddenly was like a blanket and I could see an erection. He was lunging towards me. I started repeatedly kicking him in the stomach as hard as I could.What could these dreams mean? Why do they keep happening?. Weird title but whatever. Does anyone else feel like they masturbate non conventionally?for me I can’t get off unless I’m pretending to be someone else. I heard from someone that everyone with npd has some form of asexuality but idk.I always thought love as „filling a quota“, until I saw a post on here talking about the same thing and apparently it’s not based on the comments. How do I not see love as that? What is love?. I have this humongous one in the chambers. I can literally feel it trying it get out. But everytime I try, no matter for how long or how hard I push, he just wants to stay in his cave. What the FUCK do I do, it’s urgent because I have a road trip for a funeral tomorrow.I want to reach out to a no contact so bad and beg him to lend me a second chance. I know I just crave his supply, but I almost can’t stop myself. My whole body tingles bruh, how do I deal with this. Remus (the person I blocked) is literally so pathetic. I checked up on his account and god he’s so pathetic. I feel so much rage right now with nowhere to put it. I tried writing in a journal, like literally everyone suggests, but nothings good enough. I just want to beat the shit out of him til he realized how pathetic he is. And fuck he’s so ugly, how could I stoop so low?Random rant I guess. I know I should try and calm myself and see this rationally but it’s so hard. Any other narcs feel this way about their exs?. They don’t, but I feel I can see progress. I’ve been way more self aware and shit, but at the same time I’m majorly deppressed. I’m trying so hard not to stalk the person I cut contacts with, or send them some paragraph of every mean thought I’ve had of them. I know it won’t help at all, and will set my progress back. God I hate progress. I want to be ignorant again. Anyone else have like endless alt accounts? I get very paranoid people start seeing me a certain way so I abandon accounts right when there’s a hint of conflict. This is one of the first accounts I’ve been posting about my personal struggles, and ISNT a throwaway. Why should I even live. Theres no point. No matter my hobbies or friends, I’m still going to have to work for most, and sleep for half. More than half sleeping for me, I take naps all the time.Each day will repeat and repeat, why should I even try and be happy or make others happy. I just wish I could go out and live in the forest or some shit. Anything would be better than this.Idk if this is even npd related, but I feel like some of you might relate. Like why even try getting better? At the end of the day we’re going to die.It’s inevitable. It scares the shit out of me.This feels embarrassing to write. But it might be helpful so I’m gonnaI met someone I actually think is funny, and enjoy talking to. I’ve decided to become closer with them. I am actively trying not to fantasize about how they’re like, as to not make them just a supply. I think this could be the first step in actually healing.I won’t start stuff, I’ll admit when I’m wrong, or at least try. Wish me luck with trying not to be an asshole!!!!. Something about him Is different. I don’t like insult him in my mind like I do with other people. He never seems to like REALLY anger me (he used to but we were kids). He’s just better than other people for meSorry if this seems like low quality posting. I want to be able to get better. Do you think if I continued to only show empathy to make myself feel better, it would work? Like the only way I can ever really show kindness, I think about how nice I look. Would it be redundant to continue to do this, and start taking accountability when I end up in the wrong? In the end people really can’t tell the difference.Will I eventually get enough therapy I’m able to love someone and not make them my supply? Will I eventually be able to take criticism and communicate with someone?. I hate it so much. He completely is moved on from me and is ok without me. Idk it makes me so angry. And then as I go through his videos and reposts, whenever I see a video he obviously reposted about me, I get so pissed. I don’t know why. I just want to text him saying how hard he was to be with. I know I’m acting like a fucking child and I should be reflecting on these emotions. I’m just not sure what to do. I think this has to do with me being self aware but really suddenly I have gone from eating a normal amount to not eating shit. Like all I had to eat today was a handful of grapes. Maybe it has to do with the mega shame I’m experiencing, but idk. Has anyone else experienced this?. Im a narcissist who has become aware. I hate everything. Everything suddenly is full of shame and it’s like I just want to give up. I’ll never be able to change. There is no cure for narcissism. I’ll always, deep down, be like this. The shame is consuming me. I can barely eat. The hunger feels so much better. I know I was abusive, but for some reason when it happened I had so many excuses for why I was right. I can never fully change. Why should I live the rest of my life knowing people will never see me as fully human.I am so filled with shame. I hate it so much. It’s been like this for awhile. I used to be able to distract myself but no matter what I do it won’t go away. I almost wish I never became self aware, I wish I could’ve gone on with my life ignorant.It feels like there’s a huge concave in my chest. I can barely handle it. I just want to end it. I want to be at peace. Vent postI was only with my boyfriend (now ex) to feel better about myself. He was nice to me and constantly told me he loved me. But I can’t stop looking at him with disgust and just can’t feel bad about anything I’ve done to him or other people have done to him.He would talk a lot about his trauma, and I would just get annoyed and try to change the subject. He felt broken to me and I would constantly twist his words to start fights.Recently though we had a huge argument after he tried committing suicide. I told him that it was selfish to come to me and he was only trying to guilt trip me. We decided to talk more the day after.I thought he was going to break up with me, so I made a plan to break up with him first. He immediately switched from talking about what I did to what he could do. At the time I didn’t even think I was wrong, but as I’m looking at the texts after reading about npd, it’s very clear I was wrong and need to get mental help.I’ve decided to not get back together with him or get into any relationship for my mental health. I know I have hurt people and myself and to get better I need to be by myself. I had never intentionally hurt anyone, I really thought I was in the right.Anyways I just needed a place to talk. You can ignore this post or comment idc.
    There's this one guy who just won't give in to me, keeps pushing me away and has even tried to break off our contact. I didn't let him do that and so he's still kind of there, but also kind of not. I just don't have him, he just doesn't want it. I actually don't even know what my damn problem is. It's not that I'm in love, I've never tried to actually get into a relationship, nor have I been loyal in any way. I only met him every few months (maybe a few times more) and although our encounters were more or less intense each time, it always lacked emotional depth.There are actually a whole bunch of other men who want to meet me, who want to be in a relationship with me, etc. etc., but I don't want them. I want that one guy, I want him to be obsessed and devoted to me. And the worst part is that once I achieve that, I would probably discard him because then he would be uninteresting. (I could force myself not to do so in order to get into a relationship, but at this point none of that has any value to me anymore.)Even though I'm aware of all this shit, I can't put it out of my mind. It fcking hurts, which is just ridiculous. I have no feelings for him as a person and yet it fcking hurts my feelings - and that's because? Because I'm not successful and that hurts my ego? Because I have to repeat it over and over again because it's the same feeling I had as a child?I mean, I'm even aware that I'm probably just doing this to confirm my belief that no one really cares about me, that there's nothing like compassion or love, or whatsoever.And of course the result of all this is anger, hatred, violent thoughts, etc. etc. It's like a never-ending cycle that I just can't escape. I've tried to work on it, tried to numb it, tried to run away, tried to distract myself, tried to substitute, tried to do anything that could quiet my head - but no, I keep repeating the same patterns over and over again.Instead of just focusing on something or even someone else, my mind keeps switching back. I can't fucking stand it! I hate it. Why can't I just be a little more normal, just a little. I'm not even asking for much, I just want a little peace.^(Fcking pathetic. I hope something dies.)______________________________________Ok, the rant is over. I would really appreciate it if you can share any advice or any similar stuff.Edit: And why am I attracted to him? - I like his body, I like his car, I like his lifestyle and somehow his carefree attitude. Usually it always helped to find someone who is at the same or better level. The only problem is that I can't find anyone who has all of these things the same way, or better. (I know, I know, that's a very superficial/shallow attitude on my part, but I mean, that's just how it is for me and besides, I want to get rid of all of this shit anyway.)Edit2: What really gets me hooked is their vulnerability and the knowledge that they had a difficult childhood, making me wonder if they are like me or if they still have their soft core. I don't know why, but it's almost addictive to me to see tiny bits of a person's vulnerable side while they're somehow afraid of commitment and trying to run away. I want that vulnerability, I want them to open up to me, I want to break through their shell and see their core. Even though I try to tell myself that it's about material things, in reality that's not the case. It's about what I can't have, what I'm missing, and what I'm trying to get by making them mine. It's also about knowing that they don't have too high expectations, won't put me under pressure or force me to do anything. It's the kindness, softness and vulnerability beneath the hard shell that attracts me.This post is especially aimed at all covert narcissists or borderliners with narcissistic traits, but also at codependents/lurkers and everyone who has an opinion.- What attracts you and then keeps you at the side of an antisocial narcissist? - Why do you like them even though they may have told you or even shown you parts of their “depraved core”? - Why do you like them even though they are empty inside, and why would you say that you will always accept them no matter what, even though they just kind of told you about some of their sadistic traits?I do not get it. Is it just your inner masochistic streak, or do you see something inside of them that you want, or what is it?. I've been procrastinating like no other for the last few days, indulging in my own self-pity. Like: “Why was everyone so *mean* to me”, “Why was I the one who had to go through all this”, “Why didn’t anyone help me”, blah blah blah.For whatever reason, I keep slacking. I really don't have time to indulge in this bs right now. I really need to get myself together as quickly as possible, but every time I get to that point I keep falling back.So this is your chance, give me everything you can - advice, tough love, humiliation, hatred, anything - no matter what.Edit: my self pity is about my childhood, I kinda forgot to mention that.
    Especially when it's more covert, because I've come across many videos of therapists saying how female narcissists usually differ from male narcissists. So I do wonder how it looks like with ASPD and which differences you see.Growing up, I wanted to be anything but like my parents, who are very narcissistic and on top of that were abusive too. And don't get me wrong, there is still a lot we don't have in common, which I am happy about. However, with time I adapted and despite me trying to be genuine, kind and just a person that most people would consider to be good, I struggle. I struggle to care about others, to not put them down, to listen to them, to respect them, to not manipulate them. Everything. All of it. And even though I actually feel pride about being highly narcissistic, part of me also despises that I am like this. Because if I don't put in a tiring amount of effort, I behave very similar to my parents.Part of me tries to be nice and have genuine friendships. However, I notice HOW stuck I'm with some patterns. For instance, I can't take any inconvenience for myself, even if it's to a normal degree of what friends to for each other. Or, what I also struggle with, is being genuinely interested in other people. Showing empathy. Giving them my attention. Not making fun of them. Not using them like tools. I'm literally trying to best at times to not do any of the latter. Sometimes I am successful, but what I still notice, is how my friends are sort of detached to me, still. And I am pretty certain that these underlying behaviors of mine at least play a relevant role in it. So that brings me back to the question: What are ya'll doing with this? Have you just lost 'hope' in true connection? Do you define connection differently? Or do you manage to have genuine friendships?. Don't know if you guys can relate, but we can find out. I've heard of public narcissists (thenamelessnarcissist, spriritnarc etc) that they also approve of this. Whenever people call me a narcissist, I feel flattered by it. I know that rationally, it's no compliment. I know that technically, it 'shouldn't' be something to be proud of. But I don't mind taking it as a compliment, since it makes me feel great and I am really proud of my narcissism. Of course there are destructive aspects to being narcissistic and I am actively working on some of them. However, I tend to view the positive sides a lot as well, because I do believe there are quite some. It's a matter of balance. Do you guys relate? Or what is your first impulse, your first reaction to being called a narcisisst?. Scrolling through this sub I've noticed once again how many people feel ashamed of their sadistic thoughts. I do find it unfortunate, considering that many sadists suffer from it despite not harming other people, due to a moral compass. I personally lack that, but I still haven't acted out, so I believe that you can learn to CHOOSE. However, so many people who actively choose not to engage in their sadistic thoughts that they haven't chosen to have are still portrayed as the devils, especially in the media. I genuinely find that unjustified, because nobody chooses to become a sadist. If seeing other people in pain arouses you, that's no choice. It's simply a choice what you create out of it. I have left all of the guilt behind, since I am quite far on my journey. So in case anyone here feels as if they're awful people due to their sadism, I am offering you to text me privately.With the rising amount of awareness regarding narcissism nowadays with partially accurate, but also inaccurate information, I am afraid. I am really afraid to be exposed, especially since some people that you'd call my friends now are useful & I'd like to continue having them in my life. Some of my friends know each other too & have contact, so if I fuck up with 1-2, the chances that my reputation will be hurt is high. It is incredibly frustrating honestly. Because I'm already putting up so much effort to be friendly, empathic & even swallow down my grandiosity often, especially when being with new people. But it still doesn't seem to be enough, because I can sense that some people already notice a bit of my 'toxic' traits. I am already trying so hard to be better, but it's a disorder for a reason & I just don't want to lose yet another chance to 1) have friends and 2) get far in life once again.Because I know some will suggest it: I know I need therapy. I know that it's inevitable. But where I live, you have to wait a year at least to start with therapy. So right now, there's not much help. So I wanted to write this here in the hope to read that some of you maybe know this and can relate to it.Obviously, you need to have some traits in your youth as well. Becoming a full blown narcissist in your adulthood is very unlikely to happen if you haven't had some tendencies before. The reason I ask this is because of my own case: I've had some narcissistic traits as a child, some more developed in my youth, but in the end of my adolescence, so practically in the beginning of my adulthood, I literally turnt into a full-blown narcissist. And it's been like that for quite some years now, impacting me in all areas of my life and in all phases of my life too. I'm just a bit surprised, because normally you'd expect these traits to unfold once you're in your (early) youth. My bpd traits definitely did back then. Narcissistic traits though followed up later, when I distanced myself from my abusive environments and became more independant. It's as if this has been me the whole time, but I just haven't had the chance to be me before.I'm asking this question because in this moment, I am going through a tough time and hearing from other similar experiences would really help.So basically, due to my past trauma and my anxiety, I couldn't stand up for myself today. Somebody disrespected me in front of a lot of people and even though a few of these people later on have told me that it truly wasn't my fault that it happened and that there's nothing wrong with me, my ego feels attacked so intensely. Because everyone saw how much it upset me and I feel humiliated and ashamed to the bones. So much, that I feel the urge to harm myself, which I am not going to do though. Have you ever due to trauma or mental conditions not performed the way you wanted, especially stood up for yourself? If so, how did you deal with it? I know, I know so well that actually, I am only a human being and I can't always behave perfectly, especially when considering my past. And yet, I can't be understanding towards myself and EXPECT me to perform. I just can't shake it off, these standards I have for myself.As people with NPD most of us - if not all - feel the need to permanently keep up a mask to the outside. I don't mean the obvious masking of empathy & that kind. More so the version of ourselves always seeming somewhat perfect, flawless and superior, that kind. Now I wonder, have any of you ever had phases in which that version/mask broke, for instance due to other mental disorders such as anxiety disorder or depression? They make me incapable of portraying that flawless version of myself to the outside at times, because I for instance lack the energy. Ever experienced that and if so, how did you solve it? It tears me apart from the inside to be honest. The way I present myself is directed towards being respected, sometimes feared. However, this shit makes it almost impossible to do so.I feel chronically empty and bored to the degree that there's barely anything that can fill it. I miss the old days where everything I did make me feel great and excited, even proud. Like there are certain moments or even days when I can take great pleasure from feeling grandiose, all that kind of stuff. But other times I just accept it & feel empty otherwise. I've quite little supply at the moment & also feel depressed. Anyone ever felt similiar and if so, what did you do to get better?. I've had the issue that I've craved admiration - which I still do obviously - but due to my bpd traits, I destroyed the possibility of receiving said admiration. Traits such as being overly sceptical of others, splitting on them, paranoia & being too clingy at times, even if parts of me scream that it makes me validate myself less. Have any of you made similar or even the same experiences?. This is a classical BPD+NPD combination for me. On the one hand I lack a stable sense of self, understanding who I am and wanting to express that stable identity to the outside (looks, behavior etc). On the other hand NPD makes me feel very aggressive when I can't do that, because I want to be expressive, as that makes me proud and feeds my narcissism more. Not being able to do that makes me frustrated and angry honestly. Do any of you relate?. Finding a good start is actually really tough on this one. This is about NPD, but also BPD, as I expect this to be a mixture of both. I've for a large part of my life been quite distant to others. I've not met up a lot until I was an adult (which seemed a bit too late imo) and I've also for a long part of my life been relatively difficult to deal with, at least for many people (as they said). I'm selfish, cold, manipulative, arrogant, (passive) aggressive and generally lack stability in the way I interact with people. I split a lot on other people, especially when they don't behave good enough for me or behave differently towards me. Then I want to throw everyone out of my life basically, because I don't trust them a tiny bit anymore and believe they're mal intended. This is not only unpractical, as I have it way harder reaching my goals (being successful and popular), but also makes you empty inside and even lonely at times. I hate it. But I don't know how to change it, as it's deeply rooted in my personality, this unhealthy social behavior. Maybe it's also due to being depressed that I am like this atm, especially since not having any supply right now. What do you do in order to get out of a hole like this and to not make it happen in the first place - ESPECIALLY if you have BPD as well?. This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately. How big of a role shame plays in my life and how little I want to accept it. However, wanting to constantly improve myself to become the person I desire to be, I also want to face that. I noticed that I expect other people I deal with on a daily basis to treat me with the highest respect and view me as a popular, yet superior person. That regardless of how I have treated them before. If people do not treat me like that, which happens relatively frequently due to the reason of me, treating people in an exploitive manner, I feel ashamed. And on top of that, it also feels unfair, because even though I know this is not an accurate way of thinking in our society, I believe that I deserve to be treated highly regardless of how I behave towards others. So to come back to my question, how do you deal with these feelings of shame?.
    My fiancé told me tonight that she’s subconsciously distancing herself from me. She’s known this for a week and is just now telling me…it’s got me feeling pretty down. I feel like I’m not a good enough man for her and I’ve never been. I’ve put her through so much bullshit and I still do. She knows I have this thing and yet I don’t know what I am doing wrong at this point. I’ve been trying to be a better fiancé and a better man. I guess I’m just not enough and never will be.I’ve made my way out of the collapse and honestly, I feel better than I have in a long time. I’ve matured and grown from the experience. Sometimes we need a reality check to hit us so that we realize things and come out of our own delusions. It’s time for me to better myself and recognize that I need to gain some real insight in order to improve. I’m starting to understand that people are people, not objects. And sometimes people do actually care about you and there isn’t a motive behind that. There is a such thing as people truly caring for you and loving you.Edit: Scrap the title. Instead, I have to learn that I am in control now. No more delusions. I need to recognize that it is my responsibility to manage this.. I don’t know who to talk to about this, I don’t see my therapist until next week. So I’m kinda just fending for myself right now. I can’t even focus on my classes.This entire week I have been all over the place. I’m ready to give up and submit. This thing is winning, and I’m just along for the ride. I’ve never felt this out of control of everything and my life. I just want to curl up somewhere and escape from the world.I’m not happy with the way my sessions are going so far. I’m not too sure how to speed this up. I understand that rushing the process can alter it negatively and pose the risk of an inaccurate diagnosis. However, I need some answers. I cannot know where to start unless I get a diagnosis. What would you guys suggest if I want to make some real headway?. This is the fucking the worst. I don’t know why my therapist keeps playing games with me. Doesn’t she know I’m a narcissist? Yet she’s here asking me questions trying to get me to figure it out myself. I already know who the fuck I am! Tell me something I don’t know already know. I just want to figure out how to gain some control over this, I don’t need you telling me what I am. I’ve been in a collapse for the last couple of days and it’s eating me away.My best friend since 3rd grade came to check on me tonight. I built up the courage to tell him about my NPD for the very first time. And he accepted me and told me that we’re closer now more than ever. He stated that he’s always known there was something going on with me. The way I talked and the way I acted often stood out to him, and he was worried about me. He had this feeling that I might be a bit narcissistic but he never told me assuming that I would deny it and get angry. He’s not wrong haha. But he told me that he’s glad I was finally honest and that he’ll always love me as a brother. I’m so proud of myself and he’s helped me gain some faith in humanity.It’s all that has been on my mind. That I let someone manipulate me. How could I have been so naive? I should have seen the signs and known better. It feels as if it’s taken a major blow to my ego. I don’t know what to feel anymore, I was in a rage yesterday and today I’m just annoyed with myself and feeling vulnerable.I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past but recently in my sessions with a new therapist, I’ve been told I exhibit narcissistic traits. We’ve also discovered that I struggle with empathy, not having much at all.I am suspecting I have NPD and I’m tired of dragging this out. I want to figure out what’s going on with me so I can go from there.I hate people who waste my time. I hate people who think they’re better than me. I hate people who are irresponsible. I hate people that look at me funny. I hate people who are taller than me. I hate people who love themselves. I can go on and on about what I hate. It seems every day I build up more and more hatred. When will I get what I fucking deserve? I deserve the best of everything. I’m a great person who deserves the world and more.I cannot believe I was such a fucking idiot. Why can I not just be happy with the life I have now and keep looking for more? I let someone play me when I’m the one who pulls the strings! Let find a motherfucker to beat the shit out of. I feel like unleashing my wrath onto the world! The minute I try to be a good person, I get played like a fiddle! This is why I don’t just open up to anyone! Fuck this! Fuck everything! Fuck anyone who ever experienced happiness! Fuck anyone who ever experienced true love! Who’s day can I go fuck up? I hate everything!. I developed feelings for someone who was just like me, and I shouldn’t be surprised with the outcome. I know how we operate, I know how we obtain supply from others and how we use people for our own selfish reasons. Why did I even bother with this? And I have a fiancé who actually loves me and is trying to understand me yet she’s a NT. She’s trying to look past what is “wrong” with me and love me for who I am. And instead, I was falling for someone who I thought truly understood me yet I failed to recognize that it was risky and naive of me. I never want to be vulnerable like this again with anyone UNLESS it’s on this sub or I’m speaking to my therapist. What the actual fuck is wrong with me?! I wasted my time. I just want take this frustration and rage out on everyone and anything around me.Last night, I got drunk again. This time with a couple of new people that I think are actually going to be great friends. I honestly thought they would just be sources of supply but I let down the mask for a bit and they were accepting and understanding. What the fuck is happening? This is the second time I’ve done this and it was successful. Apparently I just need a lot of alcohol in me to start opening up.So I am a 23m, 5’10. I feel like I’m a good height yet I’ve been told by some women and even some of my homies that I’m “short”. What’s wrong with my height exactly? I’m not too tall, and not too short. I believe the average American male is 5’9-5’10 anyway, so I’m right around average. It could just be that I live in the upper Midwest where it seems many men here are over 6ft easily.I’m starting to wonder if I should start embracing this thing I have. Because it’s not my fault that I was dealt this, it’s not my fault I responded to trauma this way. It’s what has protected me ever since. It’s as if people want me to repent for my sins like I’m some evil demon. No, I’m just a person who learned who to protect himself. Like what do people want me to do? Conform to their norms and expectations? That’s their fault for believing that this society is built from sunshine and rainbows. They want to ignore the darker parts of society and believe they’re better because they have a “moral compass”. No, this world is every man for themselves and it always has been. After all, I’ll learn who the people are that I can count on. Because they’ll accept me for who I am and not just some mask I wear to appear “human”. Fuck them.I’ve never felt more alone in my life. Me realizing I will never truly connect with anyone outside of this disturbs me. Not even that, it leaves me in despair. I know all of these people and they know me (they think they do) and yet I feel so alone. Like I am just existing but there isn’t any substance to it. I am just a shadow walking among other people. I just follow others because there isn’t a real me. They will never know my true identity because there isn’t one. They will only ever see what I want them to see. And here my partner is trying to connect with me though she never truly will. And that pains me the most.I am a man of no residence A man of no place in this world A man with no connectionAs I have never learned this connection For it is something foreign which I fear As it requires my mask to fall But my mask is my shieldMy mask is my skin And I cannot simply peel it off For it would reveal myself to the world And a real connection requires this peeling This peeling of the layers that cover our exterior selvesBut even if you do try to peel back these layersHow do we know if there is anything there? Anything beyond that makes that I have constructed Because maybe all you will find is a void As I never learned who I was in the first place. I used to listen to some EDM back then and I’m trying to get back into it. However, I could use a refresh.I’m a Native American male living in the 21st century. AMA. I’m not sure what’s happening at the moment. I don’t feel any emotions. I just feel empty. Like there’s nothing. Was there ever anything? I don’t like this. It’s weird.So I am a malignant narcissist, which some might say is the “worst kind” however that is a bit of a vague statement. So AMA and I’ll happily answer to the best of my abilities.Why do I hate that I care about someone? It makes me feel pathetic and weak. Like why I should care so much about someone else where I am concerned for them? I’ve got better things to worry about. People who tend to care too much for others, I view them as weak. I am not one of those and I never wish to be. It sounds like a complete waste of energy and time. And why should I trust them? People will fuck you over any chance they get. Most if not everyone has ulterior motives behind the things they do. It’s never out of pure kindness, they want something that you have. I often believe they envy me or they are up to something. And now I feel as if I have started to care for some people again and it’s really bothering me. Angering me actually, because it’s not my responsibility. And my therapist…she’s putting me through hell. I never look forward to it because she challenges my ego. How dare she? What is she trying to prove? Something I already know? She needs to back off. I’m a intelligent, handsome, interesting and bold man and everyone knows it! I apologize for this rambling by the way, I just had so much on my mind this past week. Thoughts are starting to become clearer and I’m having a difficult time facing my reality for the first time.I’ve been switching between grandiosity and vulnerability more often lately. I’ve also been getting depressed again which hasn’t happened in at least a couple of years now. I hate this. What’s happening to me? I just want to be unaware again so I don’t overthink my life and question my entire existence.So for some reason my last one didn’t get posted. Anyway, what do you guys think of someone who threatens to use their fists rather than being logical about conflict? I tend to look down on those individuals as I question their intelligence. Threatening someone with physical violence doesn’t get anywhere. Plus I am a narcissist, you can try to push me down but I’ll get right back up and I’m still better than you.I am a human, just like youI live and breathe the same air you doBut the difference is that you will never know me For I am made of layers upon layersAnd underneath these layers, there is nothing but a void Unlike you, I am barely human at all As I am merely a maskAnd this mask is all you shall see,For the one you see is whoever you want me to be. I’m starting to wonder why I was ever placed on this planet. All I do is destroy people’s lives and cause pain and suffering. I have nothing beneficial to offer to this world and the people on it. Sometimes I feel I was better off never born or dead. As Olivia Rodrigo says in her new song “I’m playing the victim so well in my head” yet I am the perpetrator. I am the villain. What the hell is my purpose and why should I even be alive? Could use some support right now..So I’ve started to notice there are definitely a few on this sub that are non-NPD. And I have no issue with that as long as you are here for good reason, like trying to understand us. However, I am curious. Any of you that are non-NPD, what brings you here? Why did you decided to join this little community we have here and what have you learned from it?. So I’m surprised I’m still getting upvotes and comments on my post about being vulnerable to my ex best friend. However, I want to address a discussion I had with a specific commenter. I understand how narcissists can be abusive and cause mental and emotional damage to many people. And yes, it is very difficult to control and the victims deserve validation themselves. However, if you’re not NPD, you’re not going to understand the pain and suffering that we experience ourselves. It’s not like satan birthed us onto this world and we are out to destroy peoples’ lives. We are a result of trauma itself. And despite it being toxic, we are dealing with that trauma by taking it out on others. And the case is, it’s not as simple as shutting it off like a light switch. It can take years to learn to control, and that’s if you’re self aware and you accept it. We’re not monsters, we’re people who do bad things sometimes. Also….I’m not sure why anyone would would believe that separating us from the general population and making us be alone forever is somehow going to work? We can’t be alone. Most humans need some sort of companionship, we’re social animals. Just because we’re narcissists doesn’t mean we don’t want human connection. To separate us from the rest of the world would be the same as white people discriminating against minorities because they don’t look like them. Or straight people discriminating against gays by saying they spread AIDS. And clearly, separating humans into categories has never worked for the betterment of humanity. If you want us to get help, if you want us to be better, we need to learn to empathize with each other her. If we cannot do that, then the general population is no better than us in that regard. It’s an absurd idea and it totally invalidates the point.I just want to thank you all on here for supporting me as much as you do. I lost a best friend yesterday because I informed him of my narcissism and he didn’t react well to it. But I’m glad to have people like you guys on here that I can relate to and discuss topics with that I wouldn’t be able to in public spaces. I appreciate you all more than you know. Many of you are better than most people I’ve met in real life. Thank you, I love you guys.What is the point of engaging in relationships with people who are not cluster B like us? They will never know who I truly am. They will never understand our perspective on life. They will never understand our behaviors and mannerisms and coping mechanisms. So why bother with relationships with NTs? They’ll never be honest and true anyway. It’s as if we are a different species of human. I apologize if this post seems very depressing, this is just how I feel.Do any of you guys have songs that make you feel more grandiose? That help you escape into those fantasies? I need to add more music anyway and I wouldn’t mind some songs that would kind of pick me up when I’m feeling down. The past couple of days have been rough..I have the urge at the moment to fuck up somebody’s day. I want to be a fucking villain right now. They should fear me. I am their worst nightmare. I’m a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Because why be one of the herd when you can be the one who watches from the shadows, waiting for the attack…I don’t know what the hell is going on right now. I don’t believe I’ve ever felt like this haha. I had my third therapy appointment today and my therapist has been trying to show me what empathy is. She’s recognized that I lack in that area so she’s trying to place me in hypothetical situations. It annoys me because I don’t like dealing with hypotheticals. She was challenging my thought processes as well and showed me that they are inherently narcissistic. This method she was using was pissing me off. However, I tried my best to hold my tongue so I wouldn’t come across as out of control. Why can’t I seem to understand that she is trying to help me? I feel intimidated every time I walk in there and I almost never look forward to our meetings. Maybe it’s because she’s challenging me and I’m not used to people challenging me in this way.Everything seems so bad at the moment. Struggling with school now, struggling with finances, and my relationship is in a really bad spot at the moment. Not to mention my father and I don’t talk anymore really. And my grandmother is on her deathbed. Feels as if my whole world is in shambles at the moment. Just want it to slow down for a second…a few weeks ago I felt like I was on top of the world. I was in a grandiose state.Don’t you just love it when someone on the outside is doing whatever they can to ruin your relationship? A female I used to be friends with(we’ll call her B) tried to message my gf telling her that I was on a dating app when I wasn’t. And then B goes out of her way to “wow” react my Facebook post that’s about our 3 year anniversary. This morning some dude messaged my gf saying I was talking to his ex. What’s funny is that the dude knows B as well. Is there some kind of conspiracy? What’s her issue? She really needs to mind her own business and focus on her life.Little rant here. I hate the fact that my entire life is a facade and it always has been. Even in my own family. I feel as if they don’t really even know me. I cannot tell my mother who I really am, as she will not believe it because I am her son and I can do no wrong. I don’t talk to my father anymore as he is a narcissist who will just gaslight me and get into a rage if I tell him how I actually feel about him. And my siblings, they will gaslight me and tell me that my father is a great man who loves us unconditionally. Well they don’t know how he treated me. They don’t know how he stopped caring about me because I didn’t become him. It was either my mother giving me excessive praise and admiration or my father ignoring me and not taking me seriously. Never a balance. Times like these are where I hate my life and wish it wasn’t the way it was. My brothers don’t actually know me, and I feel I don’t actually know them. My sisters I barely know. Instead of telling each-other our problems we just bottle them up and put on a fake smile and a fake act. And watching them turn out like my father did is a real shame.So last night I was very buzzed at a party with a couple of friends and my fiancé. When I am in an intoxicated state, I tend to be more open with my thoughts and feelings. I have a friend I’ve known for 3 years now, he’s a great dude. We’ll call him W for privacy reasons. Anyway, after the party we went back to my friends’ house for the night. My fiancé and W’s partner went to bed. W and I decided to stay up and have a couple of beers and talk. We went outside to a picnic table and talked for hours. During that time, for the first time ever, I told him about my narcissism. Obviously he didn’t believe me at first but I explained to him everything. And the shame I felt and the fear that I was experiencing was intense. I couldn’t look him in the eye, one of my best friends. But he didn’t reject me like I thought he would. He told me it doesn’t define me. He told me I was still his best friend no matter what and he felt closer as a friend, as a brother now. And after having this conversation, I felt an immense weight off of my shoulders. It took alcohol in my system to do it but I am proud of myself anyway. But yet at the same time, I still have some doubts on whether it was a good idea or not. Because I had to be vulnerable and tell the truth. I had to drop my mask and discard the facade. What do you guys think?. So my fiancé has noticed that I’ve been more grandiose ever since I became self aware…why is that? She hates it which I guess makes sense. It’s like my narcissism took a step higher and now I feel as if I’m on top of the world. It’s great but I fear when the vulnerable narcissism will come back. Looking back I feel like I was pathetic and now I feel powerful. It’s weird…. Don’t you just love it when somebody is talking to you about their problems when in all reality you could not care less about what’s happening in their every day life? If you’re not my partner or one of my family members, I really don’t care. I always find myself tuning out people when they’re talking. For example, somebody at work might be telling me about their financial troubles but what does that have to do with me? How exactly does that affect my life? Hehe, if only others knew this I’m sure they wouldn’t talk to me about their problems. A little rant here. I hate that my friend gets to have a career he loves. I hate that he has genuine real love with his partner. I hate that he’s happy. Why don’t I get to have real love? Why does my relationship have to be fucked up? Why do I have to be the one that’s not as successful as I should have been? I’m sorry, I know this sounds selfish but I feel I deserve real love and happiness and everything the world has to offer.So today I stopped at a gas station with my fiancé and we went in to get a couple of fountain drinks. I realized mine was flat after I had her try mine to see if I knew it was for sure flat. It was so I poured it out. Some entitled motherfucker makes a comment saying “this isn’t the taste testing station” or something along the lines of that. I snapped my neck to look at him and see if he was joking and I guess he thought it would be funny to be a sarcastic asshole. He was dead serious. I tried my best to brush it off but I had this intense feeling of rage because I felt humiliated. How dare he talk to me that way like I’m some worthless little bitch. My fiancé kept telling me to let it go but I just kept saying “I’m going to say something”. Once I seen him outside the gas station I told him to go suck a dick. All I could think about was how humiliated I felt and how I wanted to get the last word in. Obviously my fiancé was upset that I tried to welcome conflict and said I should have let it go. But all I could think about was who the hell does he think he is talking to me like that. What a pathetic little weasel. Okay that’s my rant. By the way, I know what I did is wrong now. Just hurt my ego a lot for some reason.I started noticing things I do on a daily basis and I was wondering if anyone here relates to this. I tune people out when they’re talking to me because I don’t care what they’re saying, I only care about what I have to say. I fear rejection from others. When I am criticized, it makes me angry. I gaslight people a lot. When someone asks me to do something, I come up with excuses or I ask them why I should do it. Hell, my fiancé can’t even ask me to do simple things without me making a comment. I feel a constant need for control. I blame others for my problems and can’t actually apologize. I’m always jealous or envious of others. I’m never actually happy for other people when something good happens or them. I feel a need for attention and admiration and validation. If nobody does that, I feel inadequate and it upsets me. The other day…I looked into myself for a sec and there was nothing…just emptiness where there should be a sense of who I am. I started to feel myself getting upset so I shut it off. I tend to struggle with empathy, especially when my fiancé is upset. I sit there and either zone out or I’m just angry and don’t care. I don’t remember the last time I cried for anyone other than my dog that passed away a couple of years ago….
    Do you ever just have to much drama going on because way too many people are into you? How do you deal with that?. Hello, I’m looking for a copy of Lord Huron’s comic Strange Trails comicbook. Hello, I need one of you to buy an overpriced set of both omnibus so Marvel finally gives this books a reprint.Thank you for your sacrifice to our community 🙏. As if almost every interaction I have is meaningless, every single thing they’ll get to see, my reaction, my emotions , every bit of me is just fake, a lie I made up to fit in.And there are the few that seem to be real, I honestly don’t know if they are, still no matter what I say or how I explain it, it just seems like they cant understand me, like every sentence I say is another piece in a puzzle it doesn’t belong.
    I made my tenth suicide attempt last night. Nobody knows yet because it (obviously) didn’t work and I cleaned up all of the blood. I feel disheartened that doing it is so hard for me, whether it’s the method or being able to overcome my fear of heights or my fear of hurting my family. I feel so lame for having failed ten times (3 of which were aborted). I don’t know what to do now.. I guess I just continue waiting for the next treatment plan my parents come up with.Personally, it makes me feel sick to my stomach and there’s this voice in my head that keeps repeating the word and tormenting me with it. One of my biggest fears is to be wrong about my worth, to think I’m good in anyway when I’m not. Like how dare I like anything at all about myself.I have an alter who is quite intelligent. She got us on the dean’s list with ease. But I haven’t been able to access her for the most part of the last year. She was the only reason for any self-esteem. I’ve been trying to pursue her hobbies to trigger her talent but it just makes me feel dumb because I’m failing at things that were so easy for her. Anybody have any idea of how I could get her back to the front?.
    I'm a 20 yr old white woman and I've thought about it as well as trying to join a Muslim community.I could never conjure a belief in God but part of me dislikes the aimlessness of life and wants to be part of a culture that makes sense to me.Might be romanticizing it a bit and find out later that it's kind of hell, especially since I don't tend to jive well with authority or communities. I like traditional gender rolesHumans walk through life and we accumulate wounds. Nature is bristly and entropy destroys, It's inevitable.We have to clean our wounds. And when we don't, the flesh rots and the rot spreads.Only a mild solvent can be used. At a certain point when you've kept scrubbing you realise that you've just been a corrosive force.The state of the world now, especially in the west, is that we are zombies. The rot has spread nearly to the bone. We stood still in time for too long, we didn't adapt to change, we hurled down the river too quickly, the rocks cut deep, we didn't learn to clean our wounds in time. The solution proposed by some people, nihilists, atheists, leftists, skeptics, and deconstructionists is to put us in acid baths. This requires an unnatural trust in the strength of reality. The corruption doesn't exist on the surface. The bone is arbitrary and the flesh is arbitrary and once you've gone through the last bit there's nothing left.Scientists stand on eachothers shoulders, building a staircase of flesh up to heaven, and the hunter climbs it and shoots down God who falls with far too much ease. They climb down and engorge themselves, eating everything.I'm a zombie. My flesh is rotten. I try to appreciate the sweet smell in the very little time I have. I move through life in a hurry, I infect others without caring, and I entrance myself with the vibrance of an autumn leaf that's animated by the wind before a very inevitable decay.I'm not remorseful, critical, or resentful, I just wish it didn't have to end so soon. And I feel immense sadness for every person who has to face this. Especially the young people.I've decided I want to focus on other thingsI remember being genuinely happy when I was working on myself and not thinking about narcissismI broke up with the two people who made me question all of thisIt's not that the disorder is invalid but I would rather focus on how to fix traits and find beauty in the worldI hope I will wake up some day able to feel my emotions. I hope I won't have those spells of emptiness. I don't hope this pain goes away because I know it's what I need to feel but I wish I did. I hope that I will wake up at some point and realise that those white chocolate cliff protein bars are what I lived for, and the perfume, and a YouTube video that's recently become unavailable called "POV you just want to feel something - a playlist" with a girl's head turned away from the camera on a blurry beach, and a person I just left because I could not be in a relationship with them, and these fleeting moments of physical beauty I have in my 20s before it's all torn away by war and age, and I wish I could have lived longer, but I can't.I will continue walking above this earth, buried above ground. I will continue walking and I won't be alive. When you make peace with things you aren't alive. When you are perfect you are an archetype, like a ghost that has finally let go, no longer vengeful, no longer torn, and it floats into the afterlife. I will join every human being who is going through the motions. I have the emotional stability. The self. I know you don't believe me but you don't need to for it to be true.I am dying. I want to let go. Goodbye. I just let him ask for hugs even though he's married. He crossed a new boundary by calling me hot and attractive today. He tries to play the role of a father figure. I'm 20. I just don't say anything because I dislike everyone and I always put on a mask of calmness and charisma.But I realised it made me angry. And the reason I realized it made me angry is because I have homicidal ideation. I want to stab someone in the chest repeatedly. I don't feel that I can get out this feeling if I don't. It's unwise to post this on the internet so to be clear I have no specific plan and this is just ventingI want to locate the man who sexually abused me and my sister during childhood and drug him, pull his body where there's no witnesses, cut him open, and dismember his organs. I want to know if the inside of his body smells bad. Maybe like duck meat. I want to hold his organs in my hands. I feel as though doing this would give me some catharsis. Writing this online means there's a chance that the police will see this if I commit an identical crime which will prevent me from committing this crime. It's sabotage.What this is is a cry for help.I feel as though I want to join the military so that I can freely kill people. I don't want innocent people to die but I don't know how else to get out all of this rage that I cannot feel, because it just feels like emptiness.I don't feel it but mentally I feel it and my mind goes to stabbing, shooting, and murdering people, or killing myselfSo I want to figure out ways to process anger and feel it in the bodyI could just join the military and kill people but I don't want to kill innocent Palestinians. Almost nothing phases me. However when I read mentions of child sexual abuse I get irritated, distracted, and I sometimes cry harder than I thought possible. Today I wondered why I didn't have a libido and the article mentioned childhood sexual assault and I had a panic attack which I haven't had for a couple years. During it I imagined myself throwing things and destroying them.I have one memory of when I was 3 and a man who later turned out to have sexually assaulted 2 of my sisters said "lie" and I didn't know whether or not he meant "tell a lie" or "lie down". But I kind of awkwardly laid down on a stool and I remember nothing from there. I think he was babysitting me at the time whilst my parents were gone. I have 0 memory of any sexual assault whatsoever but I remember remembering that situation when I was 6, 8, and many times since, and always wondering what he meant by "lie".I have absolutely no memory of being sexually assaulted, but I act like someone who has been.I think very persistently that it didn't happen to me because I don't remember it, and I'm just creating things that aren't there. I have felt sexually undesirable and unbeatiful throughout my childhood and adult life despite receiving a lot of attention for my appearance. I wonder if this is a defense mechanism to deny that I could be sexually desireable enough for that to happen to me. I feel extremely different from other people. I border sociopathy but can feel profoundly vulnerable.I kind of wonder if I'm actually sadisticI kind of wonder if i like to be a psychological serial killerI wonder why I like to instill fear into othersI wonder why I would prefer a criminal occupationI like to get into people's skin and destroy them from the inside out when I think that I love themAs if I'm nullifying a threatI only realised this when I saw someone I respected and identified doing this, when I didn't think they ever wouldI hardly feel anger towards anyone, maybe there's repressed aggressionI look down upon shaming and hurting others overtly. I am kind and generous to others and I perceive myself as a very outgoing and straightforward person with genuine intentions and low emotions, never fearing others.But then why do I feel and act like a snake, never genuine, never able to be, always scared, always trying to crawl under people's skin and destroy them? What does this make me? A sadist? A malignant narcissist? What does this mean?. I'm very new to all of this and see a lot of conflicting opinions so I'm curious. My ex is a psychopath. I knew this going in and have never had a problem with it so this isn't about me.In our last argument before breaking up he seemed like he was losing it a little bit. Just something seemed off. 3 weeks later he told someone he was so depressed he wanted to kill himself. He is not the type of person to say or do thatI contacted him about it and he said he was, he didn't respond for a few days and then this morning I woke up to a text from him that he was targeting women and doing things to psychologically destroy them and that the principals he's abided by in the last 2 decades are gone, that he no longer cares about being respectful, comforting, or honest with womenHe's highly attractive and successful financially which means he has a lot of sex with women with easeI care about this person probably more than I care about anyone else. I honestly don't really care what he does to other people but I care about him intensely. I am prepared to leave all of this behind but I am curious about whether or not people have seen similar behavior and what the outcomes are.. just anh information about this specifically relating to primary psychopathyTo emphasize, he has a profile much more in line with primary psychopathy than secondary, this is the first time he's ever "acted out" in a serious way throughout his life. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.I hoped it would help me make sense of things. Idkkkkkkk.She said essentially "you'll feel the emotions you need to feel when the moment arises, and that you want to feel" and yeah. I don't know why I've been obsessing so much over the identify. It's not that I want to be a psychopath exactly, despite maybe appreciating the invulnerability, it's that I wonder if I am or if I'm some sort of impostor.My feelings about this are sooooo confusing. I score around 28 on the checklist which would put me in the moderate range. But I still feel anxiety in some ways and I wonder if what I'm experiencing is just emotional numbness. I feel so strung out and chaotic and confused about things. I'm working a very people oriented job and it's fine but it's boring, I feel strangely drawn to working a graveyard shift from 11pm-7am which will consist of stacking boxes in a storeI feel so bored at work that I kind of want it to feel extreme and liminal, I want to be a little bit mentally handicapped by the sleeplessness and be without people to make the time go faster and sink into my own thoughts, it just feels more comfortable to be in a slightly distorted state that asynchronous with the rest of society, I enjoy it, it's just interesting to me. Otherwise I feel like doing drugs at work cause the boredom is really unbearableI have traits of psychopathy as wellIdk if it would be healthy for me to follow what interests me or if I should stick with conventionality so I can work on getting in tune with the rest of the world, mainly if that's necessary to be healthy or if I can be individualistic and still get better mentally. Sometimes when I'm sick, haven't eaten, am extremely tired, etc, I prefer itIdk whyIt's either because the illusions are more easily maintained or because they more easily fall down, I don't know which is which. My mom told me some of this.Age 2 i wanted to keep walking in one direction and she didn't so she started walking in the opposite direction to try and get me to come but I just kept walking and didn't care about her leaving me so she had to go get meAge 4 me and my little sister were in Hawaii, we ate a highly poisonous fruit together while unattended and they rushed to the hospital to get her stomach pumped, they asked me if I had eaten it but I said no even though I had and I didn't die but I never told themAge 4 my half sister was leaving to see her dad and I remember feeling extremely intense emotions, crying, staring at this tomato tree in Hawaii and being really hurt and angryAge 6 I was rly mean and would always make fun of people and bully them and I didn't really try to make friendsAge 6 I remember wishing I was dead so that my parents would notice me and feel bad for the way they treated meAge 6 I thought a lot about killing my sister, I wasn't mad at her or anything but I often wondered what I was capable of, if I'd be able to lure her into a field and cut her body into piecesAge 8 I would go to sleepovers, I was always asked if I missed my parents and I never considered itAge 8 I developed a lot of religious OCD and magical thinking, I had a porcelain angel I liked to have with me because I had some sort of connection to it, I began to control the environment in irrational ways to try and cope with the control I lacked, I developed severe depressionAge 10 I was pretty ruthless to my siblings, we'd get into fights a lot and I started a lot of what could only be described as "cults" that demanded strict obedience, I'd always be in charge of everything, I never told anyone else about my emotions if I had them and didn't until I was 15. I lied and stole a lot starting from age 6 and would create a lot of scams to get things I wanted from people around meAge 11-13 my friends were crying because I was moving but I didn't cry at all, they told me they'd never seen me cry, I wasn't sad even though I'd known them my whole life. I was called a sociopath by my sister, something about not caring that she was suicidal or saying something apatheticAge 11-13 I was seen as a bully by a lot of people but I didn't always understand whyAge 13 I had an argument with my sisters 20 yr old friend about how manipulation isn't that bad and it just depends on doing bad or good things with it, she told me about this time a boy manipulated her into being sexually exploited and I didn't care, I was just annoyed that she was trying to manipulate me into agreeing with her by telling me that storyAge 14 we moved and I began to isolate myself and fell into a deep depression, went a year without really leaving my room, remember crying on the floor and physically not being able to stop all dayAge 15 the abuse from my dad got worse and I was almost always isolated in what could only be described as hell, I was suicidal a lot but more prosocial and empathetic and weak than I had been but I was aware that I was masking for the approval of others and deep inside I was really really hurting. Because of my weakness I was bullied by a lot of girls my age online.Age 16 my dad got mad at me because he said my public persona and private persona were completely different, and my parents friends who visited my house when I was in my private persona started gossipping about how split I wasAge 17 the mask began to slip, at age 18 I figured I was some sort of sensitive genius, age 19 I realized it was bullshit, age 19-20 and the grandiosity has come out again and I suspect antisocial traits.I've thought of changing my name to Angel or Angelica or AngelinaI intuit that it's connected to the way I process myself with NPDI find it aesthetic and emotionally soothing. Statues like the angel of grief or drawings, even anime, or charms with angel wings, etc.IdkThe movies and stuff I connect to as well has that theme. A diety-type entity that is wholly perfect but comes to earth and is kind of experiencing it wash through her like an Ocean. The Princes Kaguya and Barbie were two examples, the first of which I've related to since I was 15. Both films caused me to cry. In both films they lived in a perfect world with no negative emotions, no pain, and they came to earth and learned to experience that full hearted experience, but there's always this alienness. And deep appreciation for humanity. But a feeling that they are removed.It just seems like next level grandiosity on one hand but on a day to day basis I feel like I do experience the world like this. I don't take responsibility for my actions except in front of others to appease them because it's like I can't be responsible for anything, I'm not even here. I'm just a baby.I'm going to turkey and then moving and she's going to SeattleI'm 20 she's 18I have a few days to spend with her. I realised a while that I care about her more than most and so I'm paying for everything.How do I spend this time with her? How do I absorb it? I don't know if I've lived in a while, I don't know if it was ever so important to be in the moment, but now it is, so how do I do it?. I will think all the time about how to manipulate but when people actually pick up on this I'm shocked, and especially before I knew what I was doingIt's funny it's like I think no one should see me and.. idkIt just doesn't feel that wrongIt just feels like a regular thingSee what I can say to get the outcomes I wantSo?. My 39 yr old overweight no-gf uncle who I'd just met and was staying with was talking about how he'd been suicidal for a lot of his lifeSaid the reason he hasn't done it is because family would be sadI was trying to motivate him and told him that no one would really care if he died, they'd be sad and then eventually over time they'd care more about the latest season of their TV show on a daily basis and that he should find personal reasons to live insteadThis didn't really stick with him I could tellI left for a walk and realized I could go back and find him deadI didn't care and just thought about how I'd steal his assets before reporting it to the policeI've thought before that my empathy is too high to be a narcissist because I do feel something or another when people are hurt, for instance, I felt this desire to motivate himBut.. yeah. I looked in the mirror and felt I was really ugly and now I feel like everyone is thinking negative things about meAt work, on this sub, my friends, etcI wonder what happens with that. From becoming more aware of my behavior and motives and giving more honest answersBefore: 18Then 24Then 30. I feel grandiose over most people because they're too weak so I have picked partners who are psychopaths or NPD but I still crave for them to be weak and try to orchestrate itI love when people like that show emotion or are vulnerable and when they're not I feel very unsafeI don't know if this is too much out of the range of normal, you want someone who is strong but who shows enough emotion to be trustworthy, but because I keep going back to these partners who are really bad for me because I've convinced myself they're just vulnerable inside and need a little push, I end up putting myself in toxic relationships and being emotionally manipulative in attempts to get to people's weak sides. I never felt jealousy, loneliness, the feeling of missing something, aggression, fear of abandonment, feeling sad about the abuse and lack of love I experienced from my parents, fear, and rarely do I feel loveI can't consciously perceive those so I always thought I just didn't feel themI think they reflect in my behavior as wellI believe they may be the strongest feelings and the strongest motivators for my actionsWhy are they on mute? It's so contradictory, is this normal in the literature?.. When describing a situation with a friend I care about a lot someone said it's fake. They said "where is the aggression". I told him I don't feel aggression. He said that if I did, I didn't know it, and I was pushing my friend away. I realized then that he was right. I went on a shroom trip and felt so abandoned, like I was a baby. I don't normally feel that I care.Loving people wrongly and suffocatingly and wondering if it's actually love at the end of the dayThe things I do are manipulative to the furtherest extent I can see and usually I don't noticeSo many layers of manipulationI think I love certain people and I deeply want connection but I love all wrong and other people hate me. They tell me I'm too much. I think they are definitely rightIf I say it's because I'm loving all wrong because I'm hurting so much inside is it just manipulation and evading responsibility?How do I stop doing this, someone please help me. I remembered I'd make fun of people for being short, fat, I was pretty aggressive and competitive starting at age 6 or so and until I was 14Learned empathy, maybe too much of whatever that was, felt guilty for hurting a fly, and now I'm back to my old ways of being hyper critical and having to stop myself from being blunt or insulting people, I'm 20 now. I don't really understand why people get offended over racist thingsI was talking with my friend who is Indian about my friend who is Arab and she said as a joke that she doesn't like brown people and I called him a "sand-n word" keep in mind the friend I talked about I feel 0 racist feelings towards whatsoever, I always had a crush on him and I respect him as a person which is rare for me, this will sound like a lie but it's genuine (he also uses the n word regularly and would give 0 shits if I called him that but he also has NPD)There was absolutely no reason to assume I was being hurtful or derogatory towards anyone except for the fact that I used a racist wordAnyway she acted like I killed her cat and we blocked each otherI'm not saying I was "in the right", I just don't think it's a matter of moralitySo what, it's just a word, I'm sure there are other ways to end racial oppression, why aren't people who get mad at this stuff doing any of thatI think theres something about people's so called "pointless" emotions that I don't quite get. If it's just a social ritual I'll follow it I guess but I do wish I understood the underlying logic.I used to care about people saying the n-word but I see my past actions as sanctimoniousness. But then again, those were *my* past actions, a person with npd, so ofc they were just from a desire to play victim and morally dominate. I don't think everyone else is. I lost most of my sense of smell for several yearsI'd smell "phantom smells" like hallucinations which communicated emotional and mental states and memories in place of real onesI don't take walks and notice my surroundings and in general I don't feel present or "there" or like I actually have a self that's experiencing consciousness. If I'm alive it's because I thought something that made me aliveI don't appreciate food but I eat it compulsively I found myself chronically distracting myself online but intentionally avoiding anything that would evoke strenuationI don't feel much sexually and masturbating feels like something I do fast to get a dopamine release. Sometimes when I don't understand my own thoughts and emotions I'll have a metaphor inside of my head that I am almost unaware ofAnd usually that metaphor when interpreted contains my actual feelings and the actual truthHair strands enough for a braid trying to be wound together with a piece of thin paper tape as if to make a brush, someone stabbing a needle and thread into the tape, puncturing it yet threading some of the hairs to the tape, attaching them while others fall throughIf I notice a thought like this I may realize that my true emotion is a fear that I am losing control and that I will be partially attached to broken ideas that are trying to put me back together and failing while the rest of me fallsConsciously, I might be thinking something totally different about a situation. Like if I want to relate to other people I manipulate prosocially, with genuine altruism, and with no personal benefit, but just like I'm the janitor or a god, some transient entity who serves but is not apartI like this roleIt's funIt's funny to think I think of myself this wayHow a human being could have been so messed upIt's betterI relate to people through fashion as well, wearing an ugly dress with flowers from 2008 that someone loved and I think is beautiful. Through learning about history, like the Roman empire, or the war that Chechnya had to face in the late 90s. Cultures, tapestries of human meaning. I go to an Orthodox Church even though I'm an atheist. I denounce modernism and individualism even though I know no authority and would rebel if one were imposed.I connect by trying to help people in ways that were uninvited and intrusive.I feel like something inferior? a spider on the wall? I love humanity, but people, I can't relate to them.I've noticed this odd behaviour over time. He's pretty impersonal and spiky most of the time, but sometimes we talk for consistent enough periods of time that we develop some sort of platonic or sexual intimacy, and then he blocks me or becomes distant with no verbal explanation.Last night he told me that I'm one of the real ones and that he appreciates me because I'm genuine. It was uncharacteristic. We kind of flirted a little bit as well. He had opened up about his emotions a bit previously and was being soft in his tone, unlike usual. I said I had to go to sleep and he said "are you sure? Goodnight then" and when I messaged him today I realized he'd blocked meHe said that once before, "are you sure you want to leave" before blocking me a few months agoBut there were other times where he just kind of became distant after any level of emotional closenessI get it I guess, but it's weird. I don't entirely understand himIt used to really hurt me but now I didn't notice any feeling when I couldn't send that message other than maybe a sigh stuck in my chestI guess he's someone I've loved in a sense, in a truer way, because I'm not emotionally dependent on him as much, I just appreciate his existence.I trust only this subs analytical minds. Self state #1: Nothing hurts me, I am not fragile or reliant, I can bend as I need to. People having authority doesn't bother me because I can just use the situation to achieve goals which are more important than short-term admiration. I love flirting with customers at my job, I don't care how old, to manipulate them into giving me tips. I believe I am responsible for the increase in tips because I'm attractive. I will do anything for my goals and don't care much about rules. I am lighthearted and thick skinned and can seem very stoic, socially intelligent, kind, and patient to others because I rarely let my emotions, which there are few of, affect how I act. I feel hope and commitment towards getting better, healing myself, having a family one day, and part of me loves humanity no matter how silly they can be. I respect deep cultures and the tapestry of human meaning, blending into it but not being subjugated.When I'm aloneSelf state #2: I'm extremely depressed and empty. I dislike myself, not even because I know myself, but like a stranger. I feel overwhelmingly lost. I find comfort in the image of myself as an empty sky, vacuous, vacant, without having to fake anything or hold content that will hurt me. I dread the image of myself as having content, but being inferior. I feel intense grief about a person I left a relationship with. I feel some very vague sense of loneliness and ponder why I have absolutely no one close to me and why I've done this and how I could bridge the gap, but others seem inferior and scary.It's not all bad. I scroll for hours on social media and feel some happiness listening to music. It's a normal day. It's not all bad. But I'm just not really a coherent self. I don't trust myself. I fantasize about success and power, I check myself in the mirror and put makeup for no one but myself to fix perceived flaws, I take pictures and delete most of them, edit one if I post it.I am absolutely certain that once I get plastic surgery I'll have immense privilege and I'll get able to be at the top in the eyes of others. I will fix my problems and do everything I need to succeed.If I don't, I'm wasting my life. There's nothing after this, I can't waste it feeling like this. I feel unsafe and time is passing.It feels much easier to write about the 1st as opposed to the 2nd self state.I show a lot of the traits of a narc but similarly to quiet BPD, the effects are usually ambiguous to others and mostly impact me internally.I'm not at all shy and I'm actually pretty high in extroversion but I'm quite asocial and tend to really only interact with people who offer supply.I think my apathy towards most people and the world and myself possibly contributes to dampened effects of NPD. I rarely feel jealous, maybe because I just don't ever feel that anyone is superior to me.I rarely start fights because often times when people insult me I literally just don't care.When people try to take authority over me I often just laugh to myself and can appreciate the game of being a "good little worker" and only get angry if they play with me.Part of me enjoys manipulating to get ahead in the world and is very ambitious, part of me does feel some guilt and general disgust with myself and a desire to have genuine and vulnerable relationships with others and feels incapable and inhibited. Very contradictory self states I guess.But oftentimes I almost view myself and others as natural disasters when we do harm to each other and rarely take things personally anymore. This can seem to others like I have super high emotional intelligence, patience, and virtue. Maybe I do, and I'm not NPD or sociopathic, I'm just normal and healthy.But I can be impulsive and aggressive in a way that I can mask to others. I can also be attached and desperate for approval from very specific people. Internally I am extremely depressed, I feel empty, I often don't have self awareness, I feel dissociative, and I'm just not at all happy. I'm really quite miserable. And of course I come from a background of severe trauma which wasn't likely to leave me unscathed.I am grandiose and I don't relate to other people. Clearly there's something wrong but idk about the correct terminology. I don't consciously tend to feel fear. I can hold spiders and stuff. I used to have a fear of spiders as well as trypophobia but I kind of just stopped being scared.I've been in life threatening situations a few times and hardly felt any reaction. For example: almost getting into a car accident and being like 15 feet away from a bear with no bearspray.It can be a bit dangerous because I sometimes engage in reckless behaviour like walking on dangerous roads or driving a bit recklessly, although I do try to control this through conscious regulation, I don't have a death wish.But I do feel anxiety, shame, and certain types of mental fear. I am concerned that if I were convicted of a crime, the diagnosis would be used as evidence of my guilt. I've heard of that happening with ASPD.I don't see any marked benefits except more clarity and the ability to speak with a professional about my symptoms as well as maybe narc-specific therapy in the future.Otherwise I would try to go into therapy for depression and anxiety, but I am concerned that I couldn't be totally honest in a way that'd help me heal.I intuit that people can't really understand me out of the context of NPD. I've run into this problem where when I tried to be honest, others assumed that my actual thoughts were just "intrusive thoughts about bad things" or they didn't really understand the scope of the core emptiness/complex dissociation. Others haven't understood my goals for development.They haven't understood the existential nature of my mental health problems since it's a personality disorder rather than an already-formed-person experiencing a disorder.I totally get it. They're just trying to empathise under the assumption that I am like them. But it would help if someone could be aware that I'm not and could try to meet me where I'm at.I could also continue what I'm doing and work on myself without a therapist which has been pretty successful so far.Thoughts?. For explaining my thought process to someone asking how to identify narcissists, literally telling her how to identify someone like me.This shows the real intentions of the mods in those subreddits.They just want a group they can channel all of their hatred onto and feel like victims. They don't care actual people get the help they need to move on in the world.
    Zu dem Kind in mir, das kleine 5-jährige verwirrte Mädchen was aus all dem scheiss Streit und dem rumschreien und den Drogen und allem anderen keinen Sinn tun kann: Es tut mir Leid. Du denkst dass das ganze scheiss streiten total sinnlos ist und wünschst es wäre anders. Tut mir Leid man. Tut mir Leid dass ich so bin, und dass die anderen so sind, und dass wir ständig Streit und Stress und Konflikte und Drama verursachen was du alles total sinnlos findest und was dir Angst macht. Tut mir Leid. Ich wünschte es wäre anders. Wir schaffen das. Wir kommen dadurch. Fuck. Tut mir Leid man. 🫂. I feel like something’s not right with my body I need to get to a doctor ASAP ugh :((( I can only go in 2 days tho >.< fuuuuuckkkI don’t wanna die. I rlly fucking don’t My lymph nodes in my throat are swollen for weeks now with on-and-off feelings of sickness or as if I’m catching a cold, and my legs randomly hurt as if I have varicose veins or some shit I don’t wanna have a stroke fuck 😭😭 and I feel kinda sick today without knowing why and just now had a dizzy spell 😭😭😭😭 pls someone help me I don’t wanna die Idk if it’s psychosomatic either, or if I’m in danger man fuck,,,,. Had an okay-ish day, rn I’m in dissociation land but someone in our head just had the idea “hey why not just randomly take some acid and fucking staying up all night so we won’t study tomorrow wooh!! 🥳🥳” guess we won’t do it tho. And also to have an ECG done and to get checked out to make sure my health is ok My primary care doctor sucks I rlly gotta fucking switch himPanic attack (??) again Feeling as if I can’t breathe , fear about my heart being wrong somehowFuuuck 😭. God it’s so fucking obvious. God how the fuck did I not notice this earlier?!I run around all the time and I never stop and I’m never calm because I wanna feel alive. I’m in the city every single day going to some restaurant (or not) being shallow as fuck or fucking up my sleeping rhythm 3 times a week by deliberately leaving the house again at 11 pm so I can randomly drive somewhere with the tram or take a 3 hour long walk or go to a strip club or bar or visit a friend in the middle of the night and do drugs with him and fuck up my academic life and success cuz I’ll come out of it with eye bags of death and unwashed hair and sweaty shirts because I wanna feel *fucking alive*. I’m depressed and that’s why I wanna feel alive because I fucking hate depression and this state of being in a foggy swamp not being able to see or do shit like almost nothing else. Because I can’t fucking stand or tolerate in myself and others this soggy foggy swampy nothingness itch like of being a depressed slouch and not doing shit all day. That’s why I *need* to run around all the fucking time and never stop and never take a break and never process. Just take in take in take in.But it’s all fucking shallow anyway. It’s all just depression in reverse, it doesn’t give me anything, it doesn’t give me any deep feelings or deep talks or deep realizations, I’m just as fucking depressed as I would be if I’d just lay in bed all day doing nothing. Nothing real gets thru to me until……until I take it to an extreme. Until I go to my local BDSM munch and let them beat the shit out of me. Until I go see a play in the theatre that really touches me and makes me sob in the middle of the theatre. Until I do new or more drugs that finally make me fucking *feel* something and that finally make me feel *alive*. Just to finally have this moment again where this fucking pressure drops off of me and I can breathe freely again. Just for a few moments, a minute, an hour, a few seconds.It’s pretty ironic isn’t it? Doing all this shit just to feel something whilst I would feel *the most* if I were to just fucking sit down with my feelings and finally take a break and finally start to process all this shit I’ve done in the past few, idk, weeks, months, years? If I were to just stop running and taking in and numbing myself. Hahah but that’s what I want isn’t it?No it’s not really. Ugh. I’m ashamed and I’m scared. I’m scared of all this shit that will come crashing down on me if I finally sit down and breathe. Im ashamed of myself for never sitting down and breathing and fucking *listening* to whatever my brain is trying to tell me. I’m fucking terrified of my own feelings and my own parts and everything that will eventually break down and crush (crash down on?) me. Even though that would be the safest bet to finally feel alive.. Didn’t think I’d come to this point ever again cuz clearly we are the most recovered and most healed fuck out there 😎 but I think our eating disorder is srsly flairing up again. For real this time lol. We keep saying this every half a year or so but yeah idk. We’re eating less on semi-purpose and we’re using food as a sort of reward thing - if we don’t eat that’s great, that means we can deprave ourselves of food and energy AND get thin and “reward” us later on with nice food after a while. That’s the addicting factor I think Plus the ego boost we used to get from it. Rlly it was a great fucking source of supply and honestly I think the ED was also partially “symptom” of our “outlet” for our narcissism Did any of y’all have EDs? I think it goes very fucking well with NPD just like beer and beer glass or wine and meat or coke and alcohol or tea and hot water go together lol. Everything is so far away even my/our anger 🤬🤬😡😡I fucking hate this shit omgomgomg ahhhhh dlflekekAll just cuz we suppressed our fucking feelings for too long omg I hate thisvstatebughhhh This motherfucking BITCH this PIECE OF SHIT I fucking hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him 😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🙅🙅❌❌❌I can feel several ppl being close to front but also like. Ugh fuuuuck over everything is just this dumbass stupid fucking blank canvas layer 🤬🤬😡😡. Empty rage. This fucking empty rage It feels so empty itchy and antsy and I’m so scratchy and tense and just never calm, never quiet, just wanna run around bc I’m never calm or quiet I rage and I get mad and everything is shit and everyone wants to harm me or do me bad and I rage and rage but it’s never enough !! It’s never enough rage. It’s just so empty. Like a bloody red black void with blood dripping from the walls like tar And the others in my head told me “Kal, look into it, there’s something behind this rage. The void is full and filled to the brim with emotions and yourself. What do you feel behind it, what is it?” And I’m like “fuck you don’t tell me what to do” but also like fuck man, shit they’re right.The empty rage is never full bc it’s itchy antsy shame behind, and feelings of betrayal abandonment and fear and sadness and grief How do I get to those feelings, how tf do I feel themI keep running around never being satisfied and just filled to the brim with this fucking empty rage. I never feel anything else unless after days of struggle where I desperately wanna have other feelings and nothing works until some trigger hits me and I can finally cry and it feels almost orgasmic, so much relief. Fuck you all and your fucking momma you dumb ass cunt bitchy shitty fucking motherfuckers pieces of absolute utter trash and garbage!! 🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻Omfg I hate ppl so fucking much. If those bunches of whiny ass babies can’t fucking take what I’m saying then THATS NOT NY FUCKING FAULT!!! Wtf is WRONG with those dumb cunt suckers!!?????? I fucking hate them dude wtf. DISCLAIMER: No literal asses got kicked. It’s just metaphorical. I have my people for kicking my ass ;) bitch-boy is not one of em There is some weird ass dude in our classes that everyone knows cuz he’s just the strangest fucking weirdo you could’ve seen in a while. Paranoid as hell, vulnerable narcissistic, bitter and envious and passive aggressive as fuck and diagnosed autistic as disability. Oh and unaware as fuck. He recently joined our study WhatsApp group. I texted with him for two fucking days and he just fascinated me cuz he was a paranoid, mentally sick fucked in the head fuck that reminded me so much of my younger self that I started liking him even though I looked down on him and thought he was pathetic as all fucking _hell_. I opened up to him more than I had probably with all others I know in my current Uni lectures, told him I have DID and shit. We talked about mental health shit and at first he thanked me for talking to him so he “wouldn’t have to cry in his pillow at night anymore” and then he fucking blocked me because I let out some alters that were patronizing and belittling but also directly telling him to the face what’s going on with his mental health bullshit. He didn’t fucking like that, cuz the shit I’m telling people stings, even tho its true. And THEN, a day later, he covertly shit-talks me behind my fucking back in some lecture as I just found out and I was fucking INFURIATED AND BURNING WITH HATRED. Oh my god it makes me so mad. And sad. It reminds me of my fucking school days were I got bullied and constantly shit talked about. I feel fucking betrayed and if I see this little bitch irl tomorrow I’m gonna tell him to his fucking face that he should directly face and talk to me, instead of blocking me, excusing all of it with some covert “ohhh I’m too sensitive and I’m sorryyyy, I can’t keep talking to you anymoreeew 🥺🥺🥺” and then FUCKING SHIT TALKING ME BEHIND MY BACK TO MY FRIENDS. I hate this fucking little bitch oh my god Is this rlly what I’ll fucking get for opening up to someone?? Holy fuck I feel so betrayed man Edit: also I should specify that this little bitch is looked down upon by most ppl due to how weird he is. So my image shouldn’t be too broken but srsly man, fuck this dumbass piece of shit motherfucker. It’s a breath of fresh air. We’re nasty disgusting bastard dickheads that stab each other in the back at every opportunity but like… we also get each other. Like no one else probably. And like. I feel at home here. I feel accepted and understood and it’s just nice I just had an argument with my mom where I first raged and was mad as hell and then eventually ended up crying and I kinda partially got thru her defenses and at some point I told her all I want is just a mom or well… *someone* who gets me. Who listens to me and who accepts me and understands meAnd we (me and the headmates) feel better now cuz we at least got some of that shit off our chest And yeah I just wanted to say thanks. We love this community for what it is, fuck man You can be yourself around here and be heard and seen and understood and I wish for us to keep being the backstabbing cheating lying and painfully empathic bastards we are ~~(and maybe heal a bit more on the way)~~Edit: and it feels soooo wrong to tag this shit as “upbeat talk” lmaooo I wish I would’ve tagged it as “venting” just to fucking mess around. Ugh idk I’ve been scared of shit being wrong w my heart all day now Ever since this stupid dumbass K event at the party on Saturday I feel like there’s smth wrong w my heart and I’m terrified terrified terrified ugghhhAlso my blood pressure been too low all day I’m. Scared. Waking up in the middle of the night thinking you’re gonna die is just fucking awesome. Mhhh yeah love that,. Nothing better than this shit Forgot how fun this is cuz we haven’t had it in a while 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥. And they can go fuck off 🤬🤬 everybody !! Dumb fucks 😡😡🤬🤬 pieces of fucking shit garbage dumb trash can fucker. I’ve done like 2 lines of K at a party yesterday night, and after the second line I‘ve started having arrhythmia/an irregular heartbeat (blood measuring thing confirmed that) which lasted for like, hours, and only went away after I slept. :/Can K cause arrhythmia? It was scary as fuck and I didn’t know what to do about it except „sitting (sleeping) it out“. Getting a heart disease is like my worst fear health-wise lmao. Is there anything you can do about it??. Like seriously man, fuck them. 😞☹️😕😞Tired of those I want real human connection, I want warmth and compassion and affection Fuck this shit, don’t wanna anymore. Nope I’m outta here. I feel depressed. I feel sad. I wanna cry and I have this weird fucking feeling stuck up my throat I‘m tired of all this mental health bullshit. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why on God‘s fucking earth was I blessed with so many shitty fucking things? Idk I wanna hug my inner child and I have no fucking idea how to deal with them. Fuck. They’re scared all the time and always have these „nightmares“ which are flashbacks, and they’re constantly stuck in there. Idfk how to deal with them and I wanna tell them that everything is okay Idk why I have so much chaos and drama in my life. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why the fuck can’t I be stable? Why the fuck can‘t I have any more goddamn fucking order in here than anybody else? Idk I don’t understand Why do I have to let myself get beat up and run after weird psychopath men and fuck up my goddamn Uni career and constantly be a fucking. Goddamn. hindrance in my own fucking way?? I don’t want this anymore. And even tho the Flair says „Venting - No Advice Request“ (I rlly don’t like how caged this dumb flair tag makes me feel - what do you mean I can’t vent anymore without having some advice? What happened to the good ol wild r/NPD territory?🤬🤬 Is this lawful country now? Is this „stick up your ass“ land now or what?) if anybody can look thru my bullshit by all means - do it! But only if I respect you lmao But yeah idk everybody whom I even get remotely close to just keeps telling me how very fucking ✨✨special✨✨ I am Maybe I am! I mean who the fuck knows! Maybe I am indeed very fucking special and everyone who says otherwise can go fuck themselves with a pizza up their ass bro.

And it’s the most narcy apology I’ve ever read lmaoo “I’m sorry for having overwhelmed you with my expectations that we’re too high, and it overwhelmed *especially* you”, like wtf lmaooo I don’t even feel that mad tho. Just kinda a mix of disappointed, betrayed, a bit angry, and also grandiose weirdly enough, sickly sweet taste of “he’s thinking abt me, he desires me, he wanted to apologize”And also I want someone to help me make sense of all of this and I wanna shit talk hun to everyone and at the same time not Ugh I’ll have to wait and ponder a few days before I answer him.

Fuck you. Fuck you all. I’m cold and angry and bitter and envious and frustrated. And fed up.Just because this dumb fucking ego is standing in my goddamn way all the time. I screw shit up constantly.

Fuck Reddit, fuck everything, fuck the entire world so you’ve at least done something *useful*. So you’ve at least been useful. The least fucking shit you can do, for me.Of course it’s all for me and I fucking hate you and I put myself above you because *clearly* I’m fucking better than you, and *clearly* I know better and you’re a fucking piece of shit. But really, I’m angry about myself and frustrated and bitter and envious because I can’t fucking deal with shit and fuck things up. But I’m not gonna succumb into this trashhole of a garbage dumpster fire self pity again. I’m fed up and fucked up. Screw you, fuck you, do something, just do *something*. Don’t care what it is, just do *something*.And then I’ll make a deal with God and sell my soul so I can burn in the entire hell pit of fiery hot soul-bonding sound-fucking ass-bending eternity, and burn this fucking place down and take it all with me.Until I wake up in the morning and see it’s all been the fucking same again, and always has been. Fuck you.Idfk what it is but I’m full of rage and contempt and envy ugh Just make these dumbass feelings stop omg.

I know your angry at yourself Kal, maybe we should just ease up”. why tf does SOMEONE ELSE always get me into this mess where i like have to pretend to give a shit about others. cuz i fucking don't. like just leave me alone with this bullshit lmao. motherfucker. bitch. piece of shit (ok Kal)and also why the fuck is everybody always SO FUCKING UPTIGHT?? like, everyone's just got a fucking STICK up their ass that reaches to the fucking MOON baybeee. Why the fuck do those fuckers always want ME to give a shit about THEM? Like, wtf? Nope, not me, I’m not gonna care about them bitches, screw them Why do *I* always have to fix everybody and everything?? Fuck you, not gonna do that anymore, it’s exhausting and tiring and feels fake af and I don’t wanna do it, screw yooouuu 😤😤🙅❌. I’m a people-collector. I collect people like others collect stamps or lighters (I actually collect lighters too). I went to a jazz bar yesterday evening and had like two drinks and I was tired as fuck and lowkey felt weird and strange and tense and I listened to the concert those people played and this made me happy and then afterwards I talked to one of the musicians, the bartender, a random girl my age and a random gay dude I met there and who seemed similar to me (they all did) and with whom I exchanged numbers in the end.I barely fucking remember this evening and I felt like another person was at that bar entertaining people listening to music and just generally being there and… existing.I told these people I’m very fucking good at getting to know new people and very fucking bad at keeping contact. This makes me run around irritable as fuck all the time and collect new people constantly. I always want more more more and the new shiny thing I just got two weeks ago isn’t new and shiny anymore and I don’t wanna play with it anymore. The glow has faded and it’s stale and boring now. Kinda. Mostly. After getting to know someone just a little bit better or after having broken their shell.All I want and care about is these people and new shiny toys liking me. I care about you as long as I haven’t gotten thru your shell and as long as you don’t like me but I’m interested in you and I wanna make you like me. If I succeed at that, you’re boring and I wanna go look out for new people and new shiny toys.It’s like. I feel like I’m at a funfair doing a carnival game, in one of those stands where you can shoot those little porcelain stars and depending on how many you’ll get, you’ll get a price. All I care about is shooting as many as possible and getting better at that game and then if I aim and shoot a star and it’s broken, that’s my supply and my praise and validation. The more, the better. The less, the more I wanna get better and be able to hit all of those exact 20 shots next time. The price is you and the price isn’t really interesting to me. The activity is much more fun and the activity is getting to know more people and charming them and making them like me. *Especially* if they’re a challenge and don’t like me at first or they don’t admit they like me. That’s the most fun thing. That’s shooting even tinier porcelain stars which makes it a lot harder but also more fun. (Those fucking dismissive-avoidants 😒😗🙄) I like that. Finally, if I’ve succeeded, I just move on. People are exciting and fascinating and they give me highs and lows and some of them do it *so well* I can’t fucking stop anymore. It’s like an addiction.Idk where I was going with this anymore so I’ll just keep it at this. And I didn’t wanna do it at all in the first place but then I kinda succumbed to it and decided fuck it, why the fuck not. Writing it down so I’ll remember So we had like this piece of rope laid out on the ground and I imagined myself as now and I started crying and then I walked towards the end of the rope with my therapist and imagined myself in 5 years from now. I felt very fucking embarrassed about it and felt blocked doing this shit but somehow still did it Imagined future where I’m living in apartment with cat and maybe partner surrounded by plants working full-time-job in IT and I’m just… calm. I’m comfortable with myself. It was nice and interesting. Because I know I have it in me. This calmness and the ability to heal But the 5 years in between were a tumultuous and chaotic trouble but it’s just.. nice knowing I have this in me man. Ugh idk. It’s just so fucking frustrating. Like, I study maths and a lot of my peers are shy introverted dorks with low self esteem that never really have opinion on shit and just do whatever the fuck you tell them to do. It’s so frustrating and infuriating. I’m someone who has strong opinions on things and who’s loud about them and tells them to people if they ask. For example we’re in a group of 5 people and wanna go grab lunch. Which canteen do we wanna go to? I say: Well, canteen X cuz I think they have Y and I like this and it’s tasty. *Literally nobody fucking else has an opinion* so we just do whatever the fuck I told them to do. It’s so fucking weird because isn’t this what I always want?? Leading people and them doing whatever tf I want them to do?? But it just gives me this weird icky suspicious as hell shame feeling inside. „Like, am I really the only one who has an opinion on this? Why the fuck do they do as I say? I feel ashamed of myself, I don’t wanna run all over them. Am I too dominant? Too loud?“ etc Like, here’s the thing. I still wanna be friends with some of them cuz I like them and some are quite interesting and I just. Don’t wanna end up abusing everybody all the time and being toxic as fuck and running all over them cuz I genuinely wanna get better. But like. HOW THE FUCK DO I DO THIS IF THEY JUST LITERALLY *PROVOKE* ME TO BE THIS WAY AND RUN ALL OVER THEM CUZ THEY DON‘T HAVE AN OPINION ON ANYTHING AND JUST DO AS I SAY ALL THE FUCKING TIME?? 😭😭😭How do you *behave* around ppl like this???It’s like, what the fuck do you want me to SAY, should I just *also* not have an opinion on shit?? So nobody’s taking the leash here?? Or should I just be fine with this?? I’m not fine with it! Just… say SOMETHING MAN!I kinda wanna tickle out their personalities and their opinions on shit but ahhhh idk how to handle stuff like this.Dad, I wish you could read this. I miss you. I’ve figured out a lot since your death and I’ve worked thru even more of fucked up things. (Actually making myself this vulnerable makes me feel sick and I lowkey feel disgusted with myself but whatever.) I’ve loved, hated, been heartbroken, fucked up, betrayed, succeeded, did some things that probably would’ve made you proud and some things you probably would despise and hate and harshly judge me for. I’m listening to my songs from the 70s/80s/90s playlist rn and fuck I think I might start crying. You would’ve loved those. You couldn’t show me how proud you are, Mom is probably right with this. Or you showed it in your own way, idk. I used to have a fuck ton of anger and hatred and contempt for you but actually… I understand you now. A bit better. A lot maybe idk. I miss you. I want you back. But you’re gone. (Rn “One Night in Bangkok” by Murray Head is up. I know you liked this song.)I’m not your little daughter/son/kid anymore that wants to make you proud and is driven by spite and hatred for you and an obsession I didn’t recognize up until lately. I’ve grown up and I’ve seen things and I’ve lived thru a ton of crap in my short life so far. I know you probably still live on in my head somewhere as an Introject, idk maybe (thanks Mud?). And I get you now more than ever before I think. I wish we could’ve made up before you died. Remember that one phone call we had? Where I made you sob? I felt fucking terrified and angry as fuck and powerful as fuck afterwards. I had hope and I thought it was completely pointless to talk to you about all this. I thought “Man, we’re never gonna talk about all this crap that happened”, but I also thought “God, holy shit. That was something new. That was good. Fuck. I feel hopeful. I know we have to talk this thru somewhen. I wanna pity you but I’m not gonna do that cuz FUCK YOU!” and I had my fists up again. I thought you were the end boss and I thought if I could beat you, I could beat anything and everything in the fucking entire goddamn world. I really believed that, like goddamn man. Now I know much more. You live on in myself and my memories and in other people and in lovers and therapists and friends and inanimate objects and events to come. Man I wish I could hug you. I miss you a lot. I love you. I think. Idk man. I don’t know. You’re not the end boss. Well not anymore. Maybe somewhere still, inside, idk. I’ve faced you before, thru myself and thru others.You’re just, like, my Dad. A confused and traumatized old man (thanks u/PoosPapa) who’s lived thru a lot of bullshit (just like me) and wanted to make things better than your father did, I know you wanted to. I know you fucking hated him and despised the shit out of him and he fucked you up real good. Fuck man. It runs in the family huh?Hell I never could’ve said this shit if you were still alive. God knows where the fuck we would be now if you still lived. Man. Fuck you Dad. But also I love you. What the fuck is it always with this fucking narcy thing about admitting love only ever after you don’t have anymore what you love? 🥲 If you hold it in your hands you fucking hate it and throw it away like a hot hard boiled egg you just grabbed straight outta the pot, and if it’s gone you might finally acknowledge shit and miss what you just had. Anyways, Dad. I love you. And I fucking hate you. And screw you man, you stupid bitchass dumbfuck cockroach eating trashcan motherfucker. But also I miss you.And well uh…I’m just like you.We had a flashback or more like, our little had it. Damn I feel so sorry for them and I sat down and told them what u/Emotional-Climate777 told us they do with their littles which is: we told them it’s all just a movie playing and we can make it move faster or slower or make the voices all high pitched and sound funny or turn everybody into colorful plushies and make it all funny and ridiculous.Flashback was something very heavy, probably vaulting box like you have in gym class during high school (?) being pressed into out rib cage and felt like dying. Couldn’t breathe. Though we’ll die. Cried and called for help but nobody came Up until later someone rescued us. Thought we’re dying Have trauma around having sudden heavy “sharp” “pressing against chest” feeling which we sometimes got and thought we were dying and getting a heart attack. Dying Could never get behind this feeling until now Comforted little, tried to ground them and then Gabriel came around and calmed themHe told them they can always call out for him if they’re in trouble and we told them we love them and we’ll always be there for them and we won’t, WON’T let it happen that someone hurts them. If someone should ever hurt them we’re so gonna kick their fucking bitchy ass 😡🤬😤Now sitting in the care being itchy and antsy uncomfortable af irritable and idk what to do abt it. Maybe too much coffee maybe someone not doing well idk can’t get thru to them.you’re the spoiled golden child, the little chick getting everything and everybody she’s ever wanted Having more money really suits me I can buy whatever pretty outfits and dresses and all that shit I ever wanted. Fuck yeah it’s amazing Like others hold me back from spending too much money cuz we shouldn’t use it all up and ppl b getting mad at me for spending hundreds of euros but idc some of it allow it But being the spoiled little baby girl golden child is really nice 😌I wanna be the prettiest, the sexiest, the hottest. We just bought some new outfit and got complimented as “outfit of the day” by an employee and damn it just made us feel so fucking amazing.Spoiled little baby girl that gets spoiled with everything she ever wants and deserves All I need and want and deserve cuz I simply just fucking deserve it Spoiled little bitch baby girl getting her needs met Golden child, golden girl getting satisfied and all her wishes fulfilled Having more money really suits us/me, damn Can get and buy whatever the fuck I wanted and always wished for Nice 😌 love it love it I want more of it and I never want it to stop I wanna wear ALL the pretty outfits and dresses and be a spoiled little golden baby girl chick and hot and amazing and justYeah 😌☺️. I feel like I’m losing it and someday I’m just gonna fucking snap and explode and tear down everything I’ve ever known and loved and take it with me onto an endless spiral of doom. Why always patronizing Why always demonizing Why always belittling others and why always being on top of everything It’s tiring it’s tiring why the fuck should I always do those things it’s so pointless to me so fucking pointless Why not just simply stop doing this bullshit Why always arguing and having conflicts and doing whatever IdkWhy always that and this and that. What the fuck man. Get the goddamn stick outta your ass you fucking bitches. Why in the FUCK and why on heaven’s earth do these fuckers think I’m larping? Yeah I’m having sooo much fun having NPD and DID and I think it’s fucking amazing woohoo!! 🥳 🥳 If someone could present me with a viable reason as to why I should be “larping” having mental disorder then fine, go ahead and tell me! Give me logical reasons as to why I think I’m fucking doing that shit. Bugger off you dumbass fucking bitches If you can’t deal with the way I literally am then that’s not my goddamn fault So I’m larping and playing a role, so what? Nothing is real anyway, have fun with your fucking projection you fucking bitches 😂🤣. Right now i feel like im me and myself like im normal and just me. I feel like ive always been that way and always will be. But when were switching we feel so unstable and mostly when we havent fully switched we're a mould and a mix of several different people at once. Idk whats goibg on its confueing im confused. Yeah I need to bring back order into this system. Like wtf man. Everyone’s having beef with each other like some sour grapes. That’s complete bullshit cuz I KNOW y’all can do better. Just posting here for the others to see. I think us spending so much time on Reddit and the internet is bullshit cuz we really gotta get our goddamn shit together lol. Don’t need supply from this pathetic ass platform, we gotta focus on ourselves. Working on bringing everyone together again.I realized I had FUN with my death anxiety and actually LOVED IT like oh my GOD dude Reminder to self to make post abt it later. If I die right here and right now then so be it. (Except I don’t wanna die lmao fuck lol) I just accept things as they are I’ll have a heck of a bad time if I resist against the experience, even if the experience is… dying Fuck you death, I’m ready for you. Here it comes 💀.
    Sometimes I say I am a irredimible monster with no good qualities and this makes me sad, I don't know if this is narcissism, but the constant negativity makes me unhappy. I think this might be self-love actual self-love not narcissistic grandiose arrogancy. What do you guys think?Edit: to explain further, it is like my brain is saying, "calm down, you are not that bad, you made mistakes, you are not a monster, stop beating yourself". I quite literally see my therapist as an object that's only purpose is to make my self-steem better, there is no transference there.How do I stop seeing others as objects that just judge me?. People always talk about how narcissistic people can complete understanding others inner thoughts as though they were mind readers and use this to their advantage to manipulate others.I in other hand have a very hard time even understanding personality, to me people are unpredictable, I don't know how they would behave in certain situations and sometimes I can't even see they are being contradictory in the way they behave. Personality is magic to me, something I never truly understood.I'll use myself as an example I can't think of anything they like or dislike, I have no opinions, I have no opinion on politics, no hobbies, not even morals. Zero personality whatsoever, personality seems like something magical to me.So my question is, can someone actually be completely empty, without even a reason to get up in the morning?. 10 years later have been in full blown depression for 9 years for not understanding why life seems so steril and everyone doesn't seem alive, they feel just extension of myself, not truly human beings. Also the lack of true-self, having no self-image, not knowing if you even like a movie or not, if you have any interests or not. This life is a leaving hell, not only the world seems dead I also seem dead and I just discovered I have NPD which actually explain all of this really well. Maybe NPD is the worst and most lonely existence a human can have. You can always have your narcissistic suplies but you don't have a meaningfull connection with them, they are all just extensions of yourself, not truly other people.I am starting to believe I am in a fucking simulation, what meaning has this life where nobody exists besides yourself and even the concept of yourself is something confusing and not easy to understand.I am the dumbest user on this board, but even I have somethings that I am good at.I can easily identify which ingredients were use in each plate that I eat, Iam pretty good at this for some reason. I also have some minor talent with math, nothing really big, I prefer to not expand on that.Now what I am really, really terrible at understanding how computers work, I read the definition of API and communication protocols so many times I still cannot understand it at all, like at all. I also suck at economy, for example, no matter how many times someone explain to me how and why inflation occurs I simply cannot understand. I know it means that price on basically everything raises, but why inflation occurs? I will never understand. The other topic that is way too complicate for me is politics and philosophy, specially ethics philosophy. I understand the basics of capitalism and socialism but that's it, with my basic knowledge I cannot decide which is one more logical or better for society so I generally abstain from voting because I am incapable of understanding what each party is saying.Now, about Gardners 9 intelligence theory. I would say spatial and logical/mathematical are the ones I am best at, still below average but not as bad as linguistic which I am way bellow a mild intellectual disabled person and definitely not as bad as intrapersonal, interpersonal and spiritual intelligence which are alien to me.For the longest time I lived in denial about being dumb. I thought my problems were either something everyone else faced or was because of some learning disabilities like dyslexia (which I actually do have even though it is mild) or ADHD. But as the times passed the amount of evidence to the contrary started to stack up. Being just low iq wouldn't be so bad, there are millions upon millions of other people with low iq in this world and many are happy and live fulfilling lives, but it was becoming more clear each day that I was not just dumb, but super dumb.I basically can't watch a tv show, movie, or anime without getting confused, without questioning why did that character did such a thing or what the simple sentence they said even meant. Books are out of reach to me, completely impossible, even simple children's books. Human interactions are also too complicated to me, I can never understand some of the actions of my peers, why would they behave the way they do, what are they truly feeling and what they truly mean when talking, it always seems like there is some subtext to the conversations, there is always some hidden meaning that I am incapable of figuring out. And when people start talking about emotions or psychologist concepts such as projecting I am 100% incapable of even begining to comprehend wtf is being said. Why would someone project their emotional state in others, I don't get it. Why when people feel a certain way they behave like that, it is all so confusing and impossible to me.There are also many other evidences that point to not only a low iq, but to an incredible low iq. I've read across reddit and 4chan people that say they have intellectual disabilities and they all post about things I am unable to even begin to comprehend. Some post poetris that go way over my head, many have arguing abilities way above mine. I basically never argue because I would just get destroyed and I can never think in a good argument to enrich a discussion. Games are also another pile of evidences showing my low reasoning abilities. I always suck at them, I never learn and just go by using the most basic knowledge and never using any deep and intricate gameplay.I have so many more examples that I could reach character limit if I wanted, but I think that's enough, I just want to keep this text short and simple so people can at least kinda comprehend what is to live with very, very low iq and by that I mean below 50. It is a nightmare, nothing brings joy, because everything is hard, confusing and frustrating. My dream is not even to be a person with average intelligence, but someone smart enough to not be confused by basic logic and to be able to watch a tv show and enjoy it without getting frustrated.Since I know my text sucks and may be hard to understand what I am saying, you can ask me what I meant in a specific sentence and I'll do my best to explain, but don't expect much from me.As the title says what type of games are your favorites? Contrary to most people here, I think, I really, really enjoy puzzle games, because they are challenging and always make me think and sometimes when I get the answer write it makes me feel good, it makes me feel smart and having an average intelligence is probably the biggest wish I have in life. Baba is you, stephen's sausage roll, Return of the Obra Din, Talos Principle, all very ingenious and fun games. Some other games that I also enjoy that are not really puzzle-like but still kinda cerebral are the phoenix wrigth games and Danganronpa games, they have lots and lots of text and I get confused easily but I still have fun trying to solve the mysteries even if I get it wrong many times.But my favorite games have nothing to with puzzles. Pokemon, Monster Hunter, Dark Souls, Shin Megami Tensei, Katamari Damaci, Megaman, Super Mario and many other platformers with almost no story elements are my favorites, they are simple that even a small child can play it but still require some skill which is fun.
    Ok so I’ve never been diagnosed with ocd but I do have health anxiety which has symptoms similar to ocd and I do tend to have obsessive thoughts that I can’t seem to get out of my head.The most recent one of these is constantly imagining myself from the third person. And not voluntarily, like the image will just pop into my head. It’s really starting to annoy me bc it makes me feel like I’m outside my body looking in on myself which makes me feel depersonalised, and it gives me the same kinda feeling you get when you’re being watched, it’s really uncomfortable and unnerving. Has anyone else ever gotten this and how have you coped with it?. Ok so I’m doing a degree in commerce and I’ve never really been doing as well as I want to be, I’ve been in a constant state of “once I get my shit together”. Had some bad anxiety earlier this year that impacted my study and made me feel even worse abt my lack of success. Anyway so this friend is doing a degree in a field unrelated to business and she gets into the most prestigious consulting group in my uni. I actually felt sick when she told me bc how tf is it fair that someone doing a completely different degree is doing better than I am IN MY OWN FIELD! She has mentioned multiple times in a haha funny way that she just kinda makes shit up when they start talking abt super business stuff. And don’t get me wrong she’s smart but it’s unfair bc 1 her major is a lot easier than mine, I did a class in it and got a distinction without watching a single lecture and 2 she literally doesn’t have a job so of course it’s easier for her to do all these extra internships and get great marks. This literally makes me sound like the worst friend in the world but whenever she brings it up I’m just like 😀 greattttt so cooolAnyway I started going to a therapist for some unrelated issues but how do I bring this up without just like completely changing the subject out of no where. Obviously I’m not the first person here to criticise her but I can’t get over how narrow her vid on low grade npd is. She basically just describes someone immature and annoying. All the traits are the most surface level “they love social media”, “they don’t clean up after themselves”, “they care too much about there looks” “they’re obsessed with celebrities”. It’s actually cartoonish.Low grade npd can range from like she said a slack parent who only partakes in the fun parts of parenting to a overbearing parent who will go above and beyond to make sure their kid is perfect bc they are a reflection of themselves. It can be constantly needing a romantic partner for validation or avoiding romantic relationships out of a crippling fear of rejection. It can be slacking on “adult tasks” or micromanaging your household to prove your competency.I just watched healNPD’s video on how ppl with npd often get health/illness anxiety and I was wondering if any of you get this?Personally I’ve had a lot of health anxiety for a while, and I have always thought that it had something to do with my need for perfection, need for control, need to be be successful and incredibly high standards I hold myself to, bc obviously having a horrible disease or condition would hold me back from all those things. It makes a lot of sense bc I don’t have much medical trauma or anything else I could think of that would cause this obsession with my health.I often find myself hating teen dramas, especially set in highschool that are supposed to be “relatable” bc I get so jealous and insecure abt the characters having a more interesting highschool experience than I did. It’s actually an issue, I stopped watching stranger things when they all got into relationships bc how the fuck is eleven in a relationship yet I’m not, stopped watching sex education for the same reason, and there’s countless tv shows I won’t even try bc I know I’ll hate them for that reason. Also often when watching tv shows or movies I come to despise the “main character” or the person who is supposed to be the “good guy”. Some examples:- Aria from pll - Scott and Allison from teen wolf- Serena and Dan from gossip girl- Daenerys from got- rhaenyra from hotd- Spider-Man- Every single character in riverdale- Nancy and Jonathan stranger things- Rachael from friends- Jane from Jane the virgin (couldn’t get past ep1)-Rory from Gilmore girls (again couldn’t get past ep 1)- Haven’t even bothered watching vampire diaries bc I know I’m gonna hate Elena - Luke skywalker- Gabriella from hsm - Literally every single main character from any Disney or Nickelodeon show (especially the female ones for some reason)Sometimes I worry I have internalised misogyny but then I do have an unhealthy obsession with female “villains” or women with issues like Blair Waldorf, Cersei Lannister, Alicent Hightower, spencer Hastings, Jade from victorious, fallon carrington from dynasty and sharpay evensAnyway just rambling bc I need to get my hatred for these characters out somehow. If anyone has any show recommendations lmk lol. The way I become incredibly anxious, intimidated and basically just seize up around anyone who has a higher social status than me, or is in a position of power above me or who I view as higher up the hierarchy of whatever situation I’m in is so pathetic it’s embarrassing. Its as tho I switch from grandiose to vulnerable depending on how I view/the status of the ppl around me. It’s gotten better after highschool bc there’s less social hierarchy but it still sucks at work bc I can never be the confident outgoing version of myself, or have a decent relationship with my bosses bc of this. And I can never actually impress the ppl I care to impress, only looser I don’t particularly want to associate myself with 😂. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship so obviously I don’t have personal experience with heartbreak or relationships issues (apart from my best friend of 3 yrs ghosting me), and I dunno if it’s lack of empathy or something but I genuinely don’t understand a lot of ppls relationships issues. Like whenever someone get really upset abt their relationship I can’t help but think either it isn’t that bad and you should get over it or it is that bad and break up. Like currently my sister is heartbroken over some guy she never even dated and I just don’t get it? I know it’s wrong and I should never blame the victim but whenever someone starts talking abt the way they were treated in a past relationship I can’t help but judge them for staying in the first place. Like I saw someone on another sub post abt how their abusive ex straight up told them a month into the relationship that they abused every person they were with, and it makes it hard to even feel sympathy for them bc why tf would you even stay after that?. So it seems as tho ppl with npd often didn’t suspect they had it or self diagnose themselves with it, and that they can be in denial when they do get diagnosed with it. And ppl seem to blame this entirely on the narcissism but I can’t help feel as tho the way the media talks abt npd must be a slight contributing factor. Like if you search up npd on YouTube or tiktok or any other social media 90% of the results focus on spotting and diagnosing npd in others. Stuff like “how to tell if your ex is a narc”, etc. Contrast this to how bpd or adhd or bipolar is talked abt where it’s focused on whether you have it with stuff like “what it’s like living with __”. Like are we really surprised that no one is self aware when the way npd is talked abt doesn’t promote self reflection and instead just encourages ppl to point the accusatory finger at others?. Curious to see if there’s anything certain things that actually make you feel empathy?Like seeing other ppl emotionally suffering doesn’t make me emotionally suffer. (Although it does make me uncomfortable bc now I have to comfort them and I’m not very good at that) However there are some things that make me feel:1) physical pain, I hate seeing ppl get physical hurt, I hate watching “funny” fail vids where ppl get hurt, it just grosses me out.2) wholesome videos, like the ones that are supposed to restore your faith in humanity, they makes me happy3) movies, sad movies make me sad The more I think abt empathy the more it confuses me, why does a video of a child I don’t even know beating cancer make me feel but my friend crying in front of me doesn’t?. Ok so I have a very high opinion of myself. I basically think I’m better than the large majority of ppl overall. I definitely think I’m self righteous, and I do curse a lot (not sure how that relates).I’ve always been a chronic daydreamer, and the daydreams always involve an alternate universe where I’m super rich, famous and/or powerful, with a great partner and great friends. I often get a kick out of feeling powerful, like when I can tell someone is intimidated by me, or I’m put in a position of authority.The thought of living an average life where I never amount to much terrifies me. I recently turned 21 and I feel like I’m spiraling bc I haven’t achieved the level of success I dreamed of. I do feel entitled to opportunities I don’t have the grades for, but I understand why they can’t break the rules for me.I find myself getting incredibly jealous of ppl when they achieve something or get complimented, I don’t feel happy for them. I don’t resent them for their achievements but sometimes I do have to remind myself of their flaws just to reassure myself.I’ve also started questioning whether I actually feel emotional empathy, I definitely feel cognitive empathy, but I don’t actually feel sad when someone else feels sad. I have also always thought I was slightly emotionally stunted, like when I get bad news abt someone else I always feel like I’m more focused on how I’m acting than actually feeling.That being said none of this has ever caused me any issues externally. I’ve always been good at keeping friends, and my friends never have issues with me. I also hate loosing friends and see having a lot of friends as a flex so. I’m also genuinely interested in their lives. I guess I’m very conscious of how I’m perceived so I make sure not to boast, or put others down to bring myself up, not to show I’m envious of their accomplishments, not to show I think they’re just not as good as me. I’m also not very quick to anger, I’m not vengeful and tend to be relatively resilient. I can brush off criticism relatively easily although I’ve never had anyone say anything genuinely insulting abt who I am as a person so I don’t know how I would respond if they did. Anyway am I a narcissist or am I just going through a quarter life crisis lolNPI -28, codependency- 1, ocd-4. Basically the title. Is anyone here good at hiding their narcissism feelings or tendencies around their friends bc they know loosing friends would be too much of a blow to the ego. Does anyone keep a decent amount friends for a long time without getting bored of them? Does anyone have some interest in their friends lives even if they don’t majorly care?. Ok so what Kim said on that phone call was just wrong, period. But I can’t pretend that I wouldn’t be fed up if I was Kim.For one the whole issue abt d&g made no sense, and the way kourtney kept trying to turn it on Kim and psychoanalyse her to say that she was wrong for being ambitious and wanting to challenge herself was really weird and annoying. Especially when she wanted to have that useless conversation she wrote notes for, only for the notes to not include a single thing abt how she feels and to be basically be trying to give Kim a therapy session and once again imply there’s something inherently wrong with her bc she’s ambitious.Then with the phone call, kourtney brings up the looks and aesthetics only to argue that it’s got nothing to do with that two seconds later? Then go straight into calling her egotistical, selfish and attention seeking when the conversation up until that point had been relatively civil, and accuse her of not being happy for her at her wedding. I’m mot surprised Kim snapped when kourtney has been implying for ages that Kim is fundamentally flawed and unfulfilled for wanting to challenge herself.As an older sister I understand it can build resentment watching a younger sister become more “successful” than you, but I’d never demonise my younger sister for wanting to be successful. And the therapy doesn’t seem to be helping bc that’s the kinda thing they should be working on. If kourtney is as fulfilled and focused more on what truly matter than money as she claims, why did the d&g thing even matter? And why does it matter that Kim wants to challenge herself?. Just took my first dose of propranolol and now I’m freaking out thinking it’s going to kill me. Which is literally so stupid bc I have previously been on this medication for months and I never died. Like I can think logically but for some reason never believe it.If anyone is struggling with health anxiety I highly recommend Cherellethinks on YouTube. Her entire channel is dedicated to health anxiety talking abt her experience with it, physical symptoms from it, specific fears, tips on how to overcome it. She has loads of videos explaining basically every symptom you can think of and how anxiety can cause it. Her videos have actually helped me so much bc the more you understand health anxiety the easier it is to overcome.Ok so for the past month or so I’ve just had this semi constant dizzy/vertigo feeling, like I’m on a boat, or walking on a mattress, or like the ground underneath me in generally unstable. From what I’ve seen on here it’s not uncommon with anxiety but does anyone have any suggestions on how to get rid of it? I’ve seen ppl say that just trying to ignore it is the only way but its like trying to ignore a mosquito buzzing in my ear.I find myself frequently forgetting to do things I’m supposed to do often like ask the name of the person I’m speaking to on the phone, mention booking fees in emails etc. I tried putting post it notes on my computer to remind me but they kinda just blend into the background of my desk so I don’t notice them (if that makes sense).Ok the title probably doesn’t make much sense. Basically since March I’ve developed really bad health anxiety. I’ve always been a generally anxious person but this health anxiety especially the physical effects it has on me, isn’t like anything I’ve experienced before. In the past month I’ve gone from thinking I had a heart problem, to thinking I had Ms, to thinking I was going to have a psychotic break I’d never recover from, to some weird existential crisis, to thinking some medication has permanently damaged my brain. Anyway today I was worried that I wasn’t going to find a group for this uni group project. And it’s weirdly relieving that I even have the energy to worry abt uni. Given my anxiety at its worse causes me to completely disregard uni bc “what’s the point if I’m going to die”, the fact im worried abt is a pretty good sign. Hoping I get back to a point in my life where my anxiety is just over first world problems.Anyone else kinda worried abt when they’ll eventually have to move out of home? I’m 21 still living with my parents and they basically do everything for me (thank the lord). They do my washing, cook me dinner, do groceries, my dad even drives me to work. I actually don’t know what I’d do without them. How would I ever manage to do my own washing if I can’t even put my clothes away after my mum washes them? How am I going to feed myself every day if I struggle to make myself lunch? How am I supposed to get to work on time if I’m 15mins late every day my dad can’t drive me? How am I supposed to do the dishes if I can’t even remember to put my dishes in the sink? How am I supposed to keep a house clean if I can’t even keep my room clean? Not to mention paying bills, grocery shopping, house maintenance etc. And honestly I don’t know how much longer my parents will put up with me 😂. F21So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days? Is it safe to quit?I would ask my doctor but I can’t see her for another couple of days and I want to quit asap bc the longer I wait the more withdrawal symptoms I’ll get.So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days?. Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better. However now I’m scared of what happens when I eventually go off the meds. I’ve spent the entire day scrolling through “survivingantidepressants.org” and now I’m scared that the meds are going to permanently alter my brain and that if I ever try to go off I’ll have to endure months to years of withdrawal symptoms. Is this just my health anxiety talking or is this an actual valid concern? I’m tempted to stop now before I develop a physical dependency.Some extra context I only have very mild anxiety until March this year when I started spiraling thinking I had some terminal disease. Doctor said I had health anxiety. The anxiety subsided a bit over July but came back mid august. The main reason I wanted anxiety meds is bc I found it so hard to deal with the physical symptoms that came with the anxiety.Anyway if anyone has any advice, or can share their experience going through withdrawal that would be greatly appreciated.Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better.

The main reason I wanted anxiety meds is bc I found it so hard to deal with the physical symptoms that came with the anxiety.Anyway if anyone has any advice, or can share their experience going through withdrawal that would be greatly appreciated.Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better. However now I’m scared of what happens when I eventually go off the meds. I’ve spent the entire day scrolling through “survivingantidepressants.org” and now I’m scared that the meds are going to permanently alter my brain and that if I ever try to go off I’ll have to endure months to years of withdrawal symptoms. Is this just my health anxiety talking or is this an actual valid concern? I’m tempted to stop now before I develop a physical dependency.Some extra context I only have very mild anxiety until March this year when I started spiraling thinking I had some terminal disease. Doctor said I had health anxiety. The anxiety subsided a bit over July but came back mid august. The main reason I wanted anxiety meds is bc I found it so hard to deal with the physical symptoms that came with the anxiety.Anyway if anyone has any advice, or can share their experience going through withdrawal that would be greatly appreciated.So I was prescribed sertraline for anxiety and my doctor told me to take 25mg for a week then go up to 50mg. It’s my 7th day on 25mg and I still have pretty bad brain fog, dpdr and just feel tired. Should I go up to 50mg or stay on 25mg until the side effects pass? Ideally I’d just go up to 50mg and get the side effects over and done with but I have to go to work and uni and if going up to 50mg makes the brain fog worse then I don’t know how I’ll manage.TLDR: my health anxiety keeps trying to tell me that these are brand new symptoms that I’ve never felt before when I know that I felt the same way last time I went into an anxious spiral.So I suffer from health anxiety, which got really bad abt 5 months ago where I basically spent an entire month thinking I had brain cancer. During that time I physically felt the worst: headaches, dizzy, fatigue, really bad derealisation which also made me feel like there was something wrong with my vision (there wasn’t I went to the optometrist), I kept feeling like I was seeing flashes of light or that my vision would black out for a millisecond (it was probably me just blinking 🙄), numbness down one side of my body, tingling, muscle twitches and jerks, a weird pressure at the back of my head and for some reason and ache in my leg. These all disappeared gradually after I got a clear mri back.Recently I’ve gone into another anxious spiral, started with vertigo which I thought was caused by the propranolol I take for my headaches, so I stopped taking it, which caused me to think I’d given myself heart problems, then I thought I had ms. Went to the doctor and she prescribed me sertraline. I know it’s supposed to make anxiety worse before it makes it better but I’m spiraling thinking I’ve permanently altered my brain, or that I’m going crazy. The derealisation is back in a big way, so is the numbness, pressure in the back of my head, tingling, muscle twitching and jerks. Anyway it’s like my brain can’t seem to wrap it’s head around the fact that I’ve been through all this before, that it was just anxiety, and that it passed when the anxiety got better. I feel like this is some brand new experience that I’ll never recover from even though I’ve been through this before and did get through it. I keep thinking “this is the worst I’ve ever felt” when I know for a fact it isn’t.Best way I can describe it is that I feel like I’m high. I’ve heard that sertraline works for depression before it works for anxiety and that anxiety gets worse before it gets better and I think that’s exactly what’s happening to me. I simultaneously feel happier and more anxious, basically how I feel after smoking. The same kind of emotional roller coaster of “I feel fine this is great” to “what if I never feel sober again” to questioning my own existence and the meaning of life. The kind of feeling where you’re mostly ok but constantly worried that you’re teetering on the edge of loosing your mind. Also feeling like I’m in a dream/ seeing everything through virtual reality glasses, dpdr feeling. Anyway I’m trying to stay positive and look at it as just a free high but I hate feeling like this 24/7, especially considering I have to study and go to work. Anyone else felt the same? And when does it go away bc I have uni tests soon and im finding it hard to concentrate while I feel like this😭Note I’m on this for health anxiety and some mild derealisation which is likely just a side effect of the anxiety.Ok so I started 25mg of sertraline 3 days ago for anxiety and the past two days have been alright, but today my anxiety has been way worse. I’m also getting pretty bad derealisation. I’ve had mild derealisation often from anxiety, but this time it seems to come with depersonalisation? Like I’ll look at my hand and I feels like I’m looking at someone else’s hand, as tho there’s some disconnect between me feeling what my hand is doing and me seeing what my hand is doing. It’s also making my anxiety wayyyy worse and sometimes I worry I’m going crazy or will never be the same again (catastrophising I know😂). Anyway did any of you have a similar experience and how long did it take to get better?. So obviously not everything has to have a point but is there any reason Daenerys is called Daenerys stormborn/ was born during a storm other than it being a fun fact and cool sounding name? As far as I know there isn’t any recurring motif of storms during her story, it isn’t related to any prophecy, it doesn’t have any symbolism etc. It is also more symbolic of house Baratheon in the same way fire is symbolic of house targeryen, winter symbolic of stark and gold symbolic of Lannister, so it seems weird that her nickname sounds more like a Baratheon nickname than a targ one. Does anyone have any theories on why it was included? Do you think it will be relevant later in the story?. Basically I have had pretty bad health anxiety for the past 6 months. When I get into an anxious spiral of thinking I have something I always get physical symptoms too. At the moment I’m getting pretty bad vertigo/dizziness. Like I feel as tho I’m on a boat and everything is moving slightly, and just a generally unsteady feeling as tho the ground I’m on could fall away at any moment. I went to my doctor and my blood test is fine, had an mri a few months ago which was fine, and she said there was nothing wrong with my ears. She prescribed me sertraline and I took it for a few days then started getting really bad side effects so I went off it. Has anyone else experienced this? Did medication help? Should I just push through the side effects?. Ok so I starting Sertraline 4 days ago for health anxiety. It was fine for the first 4 days, some anxiety, clenched jaw and sore eyes (could be unrelated) as a side effect but nothing major. But last night I randomly remembered that suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self harm were also a possible side effect and I just had this thought of “what if that happens to me and I hurt myself ”, and then my next thought was “you just thought abt it so it is happening to you”. Anyway ever since last night I keep having these recurring thoughts of self harm and it’s scaring the shit out of me bc never in my life have I ever thought abt it and really don’t want to hurt myself. I didn’t take the medication this morning bc I was scared it was going to make me loose my mind or something. Im booked into see my doctor in 2 days.Anyway has this happened to anyone else? Did these intrusive thoughts go away? It might just be one of those things where I’m scared of thinking abt something so i can’t stop thinking abt it so was I overreacting to stop taking the meds? Is it just my health anxiety convincing me I have mental health problems this time the same way it convinces me I have physical health problems? Is it even thinking abt self harm or is it just like intrusive anxious thoughts considering I don’t actually want to self harm at all and even the thought of it gave me a panic attack.Edit: if this is just a short term side effect I’d be fine to wait it out but, and this is probably just my delusional anxiety brain speaking again, I’m scared these intrusive thoughts will never go away.Some ppl believe that Rhaegars actions were misunderstood and that once we find out the real story and the real intentions behind his actions he’s going to be a way more sympathetic character and we’re all going to view him as some tragic hero. But I genuinely can not think of any big reveal that would make me like rhaegar as a person. If it follows the same “they were actually in love” story the show does it just makes him look stupid, reckless and irresponsible. If they pull some “he heard a prophecy and he thought he had to have a child with Lyanna to save the world” it just makes him look stupid and slightly delusional. How he treated Elia was shitty in literally any context. Unless it’s revealed that the whole time he was possessed by the three eyed raven I don’t see myself liking him. But is there any situation you could see yourself liking rhaegar?. So the great council that favoured viserys over rhaenys setting the precedent that any male relative would be favoured over a daughter. However was this precedent broken when all the lords swore fealty to rhaenyra over daemon? Obviously many would’ve preferred a son over rhaenyra but aegon wasn’t alive at that point so it’s kinda irrelevant.The other question is would targeryen precedent even matter? For every single other house in Westeros (as far as I know) a daughter would come before an uncle, eg. Cersei inheriting over kevan. Would the Baratheons stick to their rules of inheritance or would they follow the targ inheritance rules bc it’s the iron throne?Edit: another question? Say Robert dies without naming either as his heir would stannis ever swear fealty to the daughter? I know he considered rhaenyra a usurper so does this mean he would see his own claim as stronger?. Ok so watching hotd made me think abt how differently we view rhaenyra, her bastards and Alicent vs how we view Cersei, her kids and Ned. The difference probably just comes down to joffery being horrible but my question is what if he wasn’t. What if he was the picture perfect child, someone who would likely become one of the best kings in history. Would we still view Ned as this paradigm of honour, truth and righteousness? Also what if Joffrey didn’t exist and it was tommen who took the throne after Robert died? How would that change how we view things?. Ok I’m confused abt what the point of the hairnet was. Wouldn’t it have been easier and less risky for whoever poisoned joffery to just keep the poison crystal in their pocket or something? I assume they didn’t search everyone at the door, and if it was ollena who got the crystal when she fixed Sansa’s hairnet she would have had to keep it in her pocket for a while anyway. Also if anyone saw her breaking a crystal off Sansa’s hairnet it could look a little suspicious, so why take the risk and go through the hassle? Am I missing something?. I cannot stand when I hear ppl (mainly dany and sometimes Jon Stan’s particularly the ones on tiktok and tumblr ) try to argue about who the main character is or who is the titular character. I swear these ppl actually read a different series. Why would grrm create 24 povs, and a ridiculous amount of plotlines if the story was about one person saving the world. Why are they trying to reduce every other character to a side character and every other plot to a subplot. Also when they try and say the title is about a character, the ice and/or fire isn’t a person, it’s a broad plotline, a theme, an opposing force, a recurring motif.Ok rant over 😂. I hear ppl saying “she was homeless she was starving” etc. but was there ever a point where her and viserys were actually living on the streets?Ps: I haven’t read adwd yet so don’t get mad at me for not knowing. So GRRM said in an interview somewhere that there was 3 general plot lines: the “ice” plot line which is the wall, the others, the nights watch, bran etc., the “fire” plot line which is essos, slavers bay, dany and the dragons, then the kingslanding politics and war of the 5 kings plot line. Which out of the three is your favourite?Personally I prefer the kingslanding wot5k plot, and the essos and wall ones kinda bore me sometimes. Is that just me or is that a popular opinion?. I’ve seen a lot of posts recently comparing Daenerys to other characters recently and I think a lot of the arguments are pretty stupid.Basically most of the arguments go something like “when **insert evil character** does evil thing it’s not mad but when dany does it it is. “To me it’s not abt the actual action that make dany mad, it’s that her actions don’t match her words and the person she sees herself as. She constantly refers to herself as a liberator, a breaker of chains. She claims she wants to “break the wheel” and stop the cycle of powerful families fighting over the throne at the expense of ordinary ppl (which was a little dumb in itself bc she was just another powerful family fighting for the throne but anyway). Her entire thing was that she was different, that she was nothing like the ruthless tyrants who came before her, and that she was going to build a new and better world. However she then started doing things that went against this. Yes forcing ppl to kneel or die isn’t unusual at all, joffery did it after the battle of the Blackwater, stannis did it to mance etc. But she was supposed to be different, and there’s nothing liberating abt being told to submit or die. Now that in itself doesn’t make her mad, not being a liberator isn’t a sign of madness. The issue was that she didn’t change her view of herself to match her actions. She was still convinced she was a liberator and that she was nothing like the previous rulers despite doing the same thing. The madness was the disconnect between her actions and how she viewed herself not the actions by themselves.Ppl don’t consider Tywin or Arya or whoever else she gets compared to mad, bc their view of themselves is accurate. Tywin is not deluding himself into thinking he’s some messiah who’s come to liberate ppl. If he was he would 100% be considered an absolute basket case.Personally I wasn’t a huge fan of her going “mad”, I think it would’ve been better to see her make a conscious rational decision to be more ruthless and ditch the whole “break the wheel” thing.Also rant: I find it so stupid when ppl say stuff like “no one hated Cersei when she blew up the sept” “no one hated Tywin when he wiped out the reynes” bc those are literally some of the most hated ppl in the entire series, anyone who does like them likes them as a character not as a person.Ok so this guy decides he wants to get rid of Cersei and marry his middle aged fat abusive brother to a 16yr old. He decides the best way to do this is to convince his brother that the 16yr old looks like his ex crush who died almost 2 decades ago. He then goes up to the brother of the dead girl and straight up asks “hey does this girl look like your dead sister?” And he’s doing all of this bc he wants to suck off the 16yr olds brother.Then his brother dies and he decided he wants to make himself king seemingly just for the lols bc he has absolutely no claim.I mean obviously I’m simplifying it a lot and probably got some parts wrong but damn that’s absolutely deranged behaviour.Does anyone have any theories on how jaqen h’ghar ended up a prisoner? How does a faceless man get captured, they’re supposed to be the best assassins in the world it would be almost impossible to catch one. Was it part of some greater plan?. Ned bringing him back to winterfell would’ve been a huge risk if he looked like a textbook targeryen so would he have taken the risk and made up some story abt the mother being from Lys or something or would he have found somewhere else for Jon to live?. Obviously bran became the most useless and boring character when he came back from beyond the wall but the most annoying part was that his storyline and character development could have been super interesting. The idea of a young boy who all of a sudden has access to literally all information in the entire world has so much potential. I would’ve loved to see him struggle to figure out what to do with all the info, what to tell and what to keep secret, what is useful and what is useless, what is possibly an abuse of his powers and where should he draw the line on what he can and can’t do, struggle to actually convince ppl that he isn’t just making this all up, and realising that knowledge is unless you know what to do with it. Showing him as a young boy who’s is completely overwhelmed by all this info would have been so much more interesting than whatever tf they turned him into. It also didn’t make sense because knowing things doesn’t necessarily make you wise, so why did he all of sudden become a genius.Obviously it was an incredibly messed up “relationship” as dany was basically sold to him as a minor and assaulted, and she seemed to have some sort of Stockholm syndrome from it as she mostly looked back on him in a positive light and cared for him. What I hated was that they never showed her looking back and realising how messed up it was, and what a shitty, abusive person he was. They do have her speak abt the experience negatively in s7 when she first meets Jon, but then go back on that by having her talk to Sansa abt how he was one of the 2 men she’s ever loved. Which was just weird and contradictory. Showing her looking back positively on the relationship undermines how traumatising and horrible it was, and going through something like that would still be negatively impacting her. It gave a similar vibe as sansa’s “I’m grateful for my trauma” shit which was gross.To Tywin, his golden child as king would be the dream, and he could be hand. So he’d probably consider Jaime getting off the throne as the missed opportunity of a lifetime.
    In the model underpinning schema therapy, there is a mode called the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode. I've read about it a few times, and I just noticed it come up today in myself, I think. I wanted to document it here, so maybe I can become more quickly alert to it in future - because like other maladaptive modes, I feel it really inhibits me, or can do at least.From my recollection the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode is a coping mode in the model. That means there is some underlying vulnerability or distress or unmet need, and this mode is a state of mind and body that we can flip into as a way of reacting or managing what's underneath.I think when I'm in my Paranoid Overcontroller Mode, I become overly fixated and suspicious of other people, maybe particularly one person or two for whatever reason. I suppose there's something about them that I'm fearful of underneath, or something about them that reminds me of someone or some situation in the past the caused me harm. My thoughts turn to and obsess over all the things dry don't like about this person. There is a sense of mistrust. I don't like to look them in the eye, I want to keep away from them, there is a feeling that they are keeping something from me, that they are somehow corrupt, wrong, dangerous, hiding something, manipulative, not truthful, not honest, in authentic. I can even imagine them turning other people against me, thinking negatively about me and talking negatively about me, criticising me with others. That's paranoia. I watch their movements and behaviours, and listen to what they have to say, and my mind is heavily skewed to picking up the evidence to support this from whatever they're saying or doing. It's a form of rumination....The problem is that when I'm in this mode, I don't see the whole person - just the negative aspects that maybe I want to see. I kind of don't want to see the positives. I'm devaluing them. I'm not being empathic, understanding or compassionate. I lose connection to that person. But more than that. I disconnected from the world and other people. I am lost in my own thoughts - just spinning around. I'm cut off from reality, viewing the world through a distorted lens where people are either for me or against me, and I'm collecting the evidence.Gosh! Now I'm reflecting on it, I can see that this mode is somewhat present quite a lot of the time. It's just that today I noticed that was particularly strong, and directed towards one person who I've been with over the last few days. Another man. I guess from the outside looking in at me, people might sense that I am cut off, self absorbed, and that my thoughts are negative and suspicious even. And I wonder if it's on my face. I'm pretty sure it must be, to a degree. Obviously I can't tell that for sure. But there is a chance at least that they pick up on my negative mood, and so might not want to interact or connect with me. I kind of feel that.So I'm really losing out when this mode is strong. I'm not a happy person that I want to be, and people might be more distant from me. It's actually sad. Suddenly I have some compassion for myself coming up. I feel sad for the situation....Where did this come from?A memory of my father immediately pops up in my mind. He's scowling, frowning. His face is distorted. I can tell that he is suspicious of others, he's really paranoid in that moment.Gosh! I guess I picked that up from him! He was suspicious have lots of people when I was a child, and even today he is quite mistrustful of people, although he has mellowed in his older age. But back then he was paranoid about my Mum, her friends, people he worked with, even me and my sister. ...There is a memory, a very strong one, when I was a teenager. It was bedtime. My dad was already upstairs in the spare room. Him and Mum weren't sleeping in the same room by then. Mistrust. Hatred. Fear. Between them. I was in my room. My mum came upstairs. Before she went into the main bedroom, she went to the spare room when my dad was "sleeping" - because he wasn't, as it turned out - and locked the door from the outside. I think I asked her not to do it, but there was something like revenge going on for something he had done earlier in the day. She was less than 3m away from the lock door when my dad jumped up and started banging ferociously on it. He was banging so hard that he started to punch a hole. My mum ran downstairs and told me to come with her. I was on the landing by now. The hole appeared in the door. Splinters of wood were flying over the landing. I could see his fist. His hand was bloody. I could see has distorted face. He asked me to unlock the door. He said I should call the police. I was something like 13 or 14. I didn't want to do that. I was scared of him. But I did unlock the door with the key that was maybe on the floor or something. As soon as it opened I stood back. He ran out and I pretended to faint. I just didn't want to interact with him. So I pretended. He ran downstairs saying that he was going to call the police. I then snapped out of my "faint", and ran behind him shouting "No! Don't!" I remember stopping him when he was at the phone. My mum was outside, she called to me to say come next door - to the neighbours. And I did. I ran out.Later on, in our neighbours' living room, late at night, totally embarrassed, scared, lonely - I was on the sofa, my mum and the wife of the couple next door were with me. My dad was allowed into the house by the husband. Dad came into the room, telling all of us that my mum had locked the door and was planning to burn down the house and kill him.That really wasn't true. But he was totally paranoid. Our neighbours tried to calm him down. Eventually he left and went back to our home. My mum and I slept at our neighbours house that night. I was in my school uniform.I can feel my younger self, shocked, scared, distressed, frustrated, lonely, worried, angry, sad, deflated, embarrassed, guilty, numb.I'm sad for him now. Right now.I feel for him....What I like about the schema approach is that it's not just about countering or challenging the negative or inhibiting thoughts and actions in the here and now. It's not saying simply, "Don't do that! Stop thinking like that! Think positively!" It's about understanding where coping styles come from, trying to swim down to the bottom of the ocean, and connect with the lost, wounded child underneath - the child who was neglected and traumatised. It's about having an understanding the how the wounds of the past relate to the present, and showing - or learning to show - care for those wounds and vulnerabilities.So, to myself today I say, I know I didn't like my dad as a child or teenager. I was often very scared of him. I wanted to be nothing like him. But somehow, and I inherited his negative thinking patterns and behaviours. There is shame around that.But it's not my fault that I have this tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. On one level I inherited it from my dad. Not purely. My mum also has a tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. But for the moment I'm thinking about that memory with my dad, I'm thinking about how his paranoia Took over and lead to violent reaction that stayed strong in my memory for many decades. When I feel that paranoia, when I recognise that suspicious mode, it doesn't make me a bad person. There is a good reason why this habit of mind has come about. Patterns of mind that I inherited from my parents.I really forgive myself. I do.I genuinely feel lighter in my body. I feel lighter in my mind, I feel like I can let go of the paranoid thoughts about the man I'm with at the moment in our group. ...But ... It's interesting because I can now see how my mind is associating the person I am paranoid about with my father. My mind is relating this man today with my dad and how he treated me and my mum in the past. Ah! I see. I see.Fear of my father. Paranoia about his behaviours. Scared of his threats.Spotting similar signals in people today, and feeling threatened. Paranoia.It's understandable. Feeling on edge around certain people because of how my mind associate them with people who threatened me in the past. Again, it's not my fault. But I feel able to let this go. So it's not just about inheritance of certain patterns. It's to do with how I related to my parents as well. I think those two factors are behind my own paranoid thinking today....I want to connect. I want more lightness and freedom in my body and mind. I don't want to be trapped in this paranoid mode that keeps me separate from everyone else.I hope I remember about how things in the past that I had no control over brought about these inhibiting patterns of mind. I hope that I can keep that memory so I can forgive myself again and again, and in so doing let go, and find more freedom and happiness and connection....I think its best to finish this by taking a moment to remember that small, frightened child, and the frightened teenager, too - and just show a lot of understanding to them - to me. In my mind my self as I am now - my big self - is hugging my child self and my teen self. I am showing sorrow, sadness, care, Love, I am kissing them on the forehead as they cuddle up next to me. I say to them,"I'm so sorry that you were frightened and fearful for your own safety. I'm so sorry."I say to myself, looking in an imaginary mirror opposite where we are sitting,"I'm here now. I'm big and I'm strong, and I'm a good bloke - despite everything - I can be a good bloke very often, and I really do try. People are not against me. They want to connect. And although I'm fearful of how people will treat me, 99% of the time people treat me very well."It's true.I've had a few noticeable moments of shame in the past couple of days.As part of pulling myself out of negative states, I've been reflecting on the different components of my experience of shame. I thought I'd document and share them here, rather than the issues of what happened and when. It's because similar patterns keep appearing, and I find it useful to analyse the experience - literally, pick apart - to help me manage and respond more effectively. It's like being able to see all the different parts of the experience, so that I can attend to them separately, and therefore more productively, rather than rolling around in a quagmire of distress.It would be interesting if other people wanted to comment or add their own experience....Anatomy of Shame.Shame for me seems to involve:A strong Inner Critic: I notice this in sentences I say to myself such as, "God! I'm such an idiot." ... or "I'm so stupid." ... or "That was so embarrassing! Ugh!" Or, it could manifest as a projection onto other people, imagining them to be thinking or talking negatively about me, criticising me behind my back or while I'm with them etc. Or I notice it in the images of other people's crumpled, disapproving faces, or fleeting scenes in my mind in which I am shunned from other people or some group.A felt sense of anxiety and distress: I notice uncomfortable or distressing sensations run through my whole body. In particular, I notice an urge to cover up or hide myself. My hands and arms want to move into my body and over my face as if to protect or hide away - from imagined scorn of others.An urge to run away: I see this as a kind of behavioural avoidance. I want to be away from people, run and hide myself. My body is twitching to "get out of there".Rumination: I notice that I obsessively think over the thing that "I did" that caused me to feel ashamed. Over and over, my mind rehearsing the scene of the incident, trying to work out "how bad" the supposedly shameful act was.Worry: I notice worry thoughts, which are similar to rumination but are about the future. "What will people think?" ... "Will people treat me differently?" ... The worry includes an obsessive look for evidence in the past. That is, the rumination of "What happened" ties in with the worry about "the consequences". One feeds the other.Externalised Anger: If I am experiencing shame by proxy of another person's behaviour, particularly someone who is close to me, then I notice Anger directed toward them. For example, if a family member - or someone associated with me - behaves in a way that I think is "shameful" to me, then I notice how i get enraged with their behaviour. It's like my inner critic is turned outwards to other people, as if I were still connected to the shameful act as if Ihad committed it.Controlling behaviour: This can come in many forms. It could be about stopping or controlling or correcting other people's so called "shameful" behaviour. I think the externalising anger can be underneath this, particular if I go into a scolding or lecturing mode. Controlling could also be about trying to rectify how people perceive me by trying to manage my behaviour to be more preferable to them, as I see it. It could be about trying to "work on myself more" so that I don't repeat the shameful act again in an overt way. Attacking Others: This stems from that externalising anger as well. Perhaps if I feel slighted by others, I might verbally or even sometimes - thankfully rarely - physically move to attack them. I see this as a defence against the feelings of shame, using blame and attack to regain a sense of power and strength. I also do this attack vovertly, internally devaluing other people while perhaps acting charming on the surface to control how they perceive me.Compulsive self-soothing: I notice the urge to use self-soothing behavioirs to find relief from the feelings of shame and distress in my body. This might involve something like comfort eating or the likes. Or, it includes a kind of grandiosity. Mirror-gazing after a shame attack, for example, provides an ego-boost through the form of self-admiration (about my appearance or me as aperson) or coinciding thoughts of my own superiority. Or it could be writing a post to get some upvotes and congratulation from people here. ;)So... There are some elements of shame that I notice. What about yours?. When I'm around other people, I have often had that feeling that I should be likeable to the other person I'm with."Should"It's a feeling that anything other than coming across as perfectly buoyant and upbeat is wrong, that people won't like it, that they'll judge me and think badly of me; that I will be ostracised, shamed. I was just sitting with someone I know and feeling that feeling that I need to be on my best behaviour with him. For him. I think it's heightened because the person I'm with is so bloody positive and energised himself. That feeling of needing to perform as the good person is more prominent with certain people like this.A memory pops up from childhood: of me being the smiling child for the guests we had at home.That's what we did as a family when people came round. I guess not always. But it was often enough to leave a relatively strong imprint. My Mum did it in particular, and I followed suit. A presentation mode. False. And I'm not just saying that because the "false self" is a buzz term for us here. She was all smiley and upbeat. I think at the time I did see that it wasn't her usual behaviour, but l also think I thought that's just what we did with guests.I continued that into adulthood, that presentation mode of politeness. Affable. Accommodating. Showing that I was conscientious of other people's feelings. Showing I'm listening by overly nodding, mirroring expressions in the other person, being all smiley and positive glow. The problem was, of course, that I often hid how I was really feeling, which meant that - I think - I couldn't connect with people. The energy required to maintain that "attentive face" was also difficult to uphold. I would frequently leave social situations to be on my own - in the bathroom, mainly - just to not smile for a little bit.I was just programmed to be like that with people.I also got an ego boost out of it, though - at least for a little while at these social events. I would show up to as "The Happy Person" ... "The Charming Listener." Yes, i'd get high on that and look down on people who were not looking happy and cheerful, but instead "miserable" to my mind. Or worse. I really did devalue people consistently in my social groups. Although I turned up all smiles to events, afterwards I would very often criticise pretty much everyone in our social circle who wa there. There wasn't really anyone who wasn't a target of my critique at some point or other. I would moan to my partner that I didn't like these people and that I didn't want to see them. At a couple of points, he made comments about us having fewer and fewer friends because of my judgements....The thing is, these patterns were still active relatively recently. I think I did try to get better around this issue since 2020, but it's really in the last year or so - since self-awareness - that things have changed for the better.I do feel increasingly like I can turn up to social situations and show how I feel - or at least enough to feel real inside. I feel like I have managed to uncover a real self with me, more or less, which I based on how I feel and how I want to come across.But ... Old habits die hard, and sitting with our friend just now, I felt that pull to be the polite, attentive, jolly listener... But - yay! - I noticed this, and made an effort to not yield to those patterns. I presented more how I was (am) feeling. A bit non-descript. A bit not bothered all in all.And then it came to me: it doesn't matter if he doesn't like me. Because look, my emotions, my feelings, don't make a bad or unlikeable person. My feelings are ok, and I don't gave to hide them.I looked across at him and saw him all bubbly and happy. He's a healthy fellow, and generally positive. And I had an image of myself at the same time as different, separate. Two different guys with different feelings, doing OK sitting next to each other, with neither one particularly accommodating the other. I think this is nice to notice. I am - god dammit - gradually becoming my own self, and showing people who I am and how I feel....There are some obstacles to this process external to my own habits, namely people who overtly say to me that I should look of act differently, smile more etc. It's my partner in particular. He also has narc tendencies, and seems to get over-anxious as to how I show up. I have to fairly often say that I'm fine as I am when I'm not "smiling with teeth" as he says. It's a bit of a joke in some ways, but it's also annoying because it's so frequent. And I just want to have my face not in a smiling position in certain situations. I notice that it's when we're around other people. And I'm really not being a dick or anything. And I know, of course, that it is right to show up civil and polite to a degree. Just not so much.Anyway, I don't want to be too defensive or irritable about it. But it is a thing to deal with. Just again, though: I'm not going back in that happy-faced box. I know that a real me exists, I'm cultivating him, and I'm putting him out there.So something really shifted today. Large crack in the ground stylee. I'm sure it'll close again. Probably. But this is to document the \*massive gaping hole\* that has just vomitted everywhere.Sorry for the post splurge. But some cool things came out. I felt rage and distress and loneliness and panic ... Nothing new. But somehow I managed to let it be there more than before. YES!I wanted to run, punch, scream, ... I felt like everything was falling down, whipping up. I didn't know who I was. This is not anything new. It happens fairly frequently. But I somehow had more room to be ok with it today.I felt, and still feel, slightly more buzzy than usual. It'll pass, but ... I said to a friend: *I am bundle of criss-crossed and flailing live wires. With a beard. And some not too bad pecs now. And the delicious glimmer of abs. And a nice smile.*I do feel that this criss-crossedness is a part of me - a big part - that I do hide from myself and others.I am a bit bonkers. My thoughts are totally wild. I don't have psychosis, but my imagination is insane and I get also sorts of violent and scary thoughts popping in a lot. Not all the time. But it can happen.My moods flit around like ping pong balls in a tiny metal room. I try to cover it up by looking \*cool\* and \*hot\* and \*sharp\* and \*nice\* and \*calm\* ... and I can be all those things, but I'm also ... underneath ... this bundle of live wires sparking off.I feel more ok with that.This is me, bitches!!But you already knew ... It was me who had to catch up....bla bla blaHere's the thing:I suddenly realised that everyone else is a bundle of nerves with a cover.AND ... I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO BE NICE TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE MEEEE. Or could be one day, so it's good to be nice.AND ...I got chatting with one person who I previously was really irritated by, and FELT CONNECTION and was more my bonkers self, and just said what was on my mind, and SHE LAUGHED!!! And we had a connection, and it was cooooooooooooooool.Maybe if I show my anger and dance fun and sadness and terror and style and spunkiness and cockiness and my fragility and mood and terror and delight and mania and tiny-ness and wish to doninate ... somehow I'll find myself and it'll help.This is why I look in mirrors.Title.It's so awful.When I reveal the depths of whatever this is .... out comes the lava ..... Panic.Right now.Flashing images of the guy on the train platform coming towards me with his terrifyingly distorted face, attacking me.Flashing images of me attacking everyone on this train.Me going mad.Distress like a tornado in my body.The feeling of MUST GET OUT OF HERE.NOW....Shift.To sadness. I can cope. ...I can't afford it. Few can.This group is basically all there is for working things out.It really fucking annoys me how fucking expensive therapy is.I paid £180 an hour from November to February. Specialist in Npd. All my savings.OK. But ...That's ... four and a half hour long piano lessons.At least the therapist is happy. Woop! Woop! Bringing in the cash.OK. More pockets of unknown shite still there.Watching videos of therapists talk about narcissism.I sense my reactivity towards what they are saying.Why do therapists trigger me so much? Fuck sake.I just want to jump on them and beat them to a pulp. Sometimes I have imagined slitting their throats. Or jumping on their faces and punching and punching. They bring up this rage that I quickly stifle. But I know that the stifling is not helping me.iI stifle. All the time. I shut down my rage because it feels totally unacceptable.Well... that monster is still there inside, but rather than feeling scared, I think he's sexy as hell. Nope. That's yet more grandiosity.It's that deep rage and that come with tears. It's that feeling of being judged so deeply by another person. A distress that immediately makes me want to flip out and attack and blame.Oh fuck.It's like, everything I do is about making myself look good to others, including the progress I've made with my disorder. Posts. Comments. Everything. Style. Politeness. Being nice. Acting. Trying. Working on myself.I can't get out of it.I can't make exact sense of this.I'm really, really fucking horny.I'm getting much better at tolerating not getting upvoted.Yay! Fuck you, social belonging anxiety. Woof!It's rather silly for a 40-something to be concerned about these things, but I know you know how it feels. We all want it. *Gimme that upvote high!!!*And:*Where's my upvote, BITCH!!!?*And:*No one loves me. I'm basically invisible / about to die.*And:*Terrible!!! I did something that people didn't like!!!*You know, don't get me wrong, I still have these thoughts and feelings. But they aren't nearly as intense. Nearly. ;)When I first joined the sub and for a fair while after, I would more frequently delete posts that didn't receive many upvotes. Out of shame, having been slumped at home in sadness and despair.I still do occasionally delete posts. But the last time was because I felt I wasn't being myself - maybe not even a good reason to delete. But anyways. I'm generally getting better at staying with what I've put out - you know, if I feel it's real, I guess - whether or not it flies so well.To me, this is progress. Ding ding! I am standing up for myself more, being less wavering and tossed around by what people think, and caring less about every opinion I receive or don't, or getting caught up if I do something that is "successful" or not.Yay. Growth in confidence. Woop! Woop!I've also noticed I feel more capable being honest about my thoughts, rather than hiding them in case they are criticised....Biff! Another angle would be:Fuck it. I'm invincible, mate!!🤘(P.S. I'm not. Don't hate me. 😁)...Edit: Blimey! This is a test! 😁. Today I have been grandiose in the morning, depressed variously throughout the afternoon, and calm and steady in the evening. But right now, I am really grateful for this journey of discovery. Right now, I don't care about the downs. I know that they'll come again, and I'll absolutely hate it. There will be suicidal ideation and depression and shame. But there is also something about all those things that provides an opportunity.I really love those moments when the downs turn into opportunities for discovery and learning. It's like finding little pieces of the puzzle and putting them together. I love building that picture and working it out over time. I love how I've gone from a really flimsy smiling face of a person, hiding all the anger and doubt and anxiety and shame and torment, to someone with more of a sense of who I am, and able to express much more of what's going on inside, and feel like a real person with an actual self. That is really cool! I still have some weird experiences in terms of feeling fake, feeling empty, suddenly feeling very close to people and loving, before then feeling totally separate and isolated and full of hate and disdain. But I try to be mindful of what is going on, challenge my thoughts and feelings as best I can, and try to find some middle ground.I feel sorry for my young self before self-awareness I was trapped and very troubled. I raged a lot and had terrible panic everyday. Body dysmorphia. Eating disorders. OCD. Hypochondria. The works. All based around this very narcissistic personality structure that I had no clue about at the time, really. But I did the best that I could. I didn't know any better. It's nice to overcome a lot of that, even though the remnants are still there. I can still be pulled down by various things, but not nearly as strongly.My mind may never be completely stable. But in a way, I would kind of hate if that happened. I enjoy this journey where the weirdness of my brain and my reactions to things puzzles me, and drives me to find a solution. ...Late this afternoon, I was tired from - quite frankly - overworking. Again. I had a bit of a low point. Someone I'm working with was not getting their work done and it felt like it was really holding me back. I felt the anger and frustration and blame. I felt, too, the sadness underneath, and I started crying to myself, just walking down the street. It happens. Just gentle, quiet tears of frustration. It was part sadness and part kicking-and-screaming and blaming.I imagined my various 'inner good parents' step in with their messages that would calm me down. The message that really hit home was "I know you are so tired and frustrated. Now, this is what we're going to do... We're going to take it one step at a time. We're going to remember all the good things you've been able to do today..." etc etc. It really helped soothe me and shifted me into a more calm and steady state where I felt capable and strong.That was a cool experience. It's little things like that that drive me on. Every day. Every day I work on myself. Every interaction with people is hard in some way. But ... I am just trying to balance so much and make this life work as best as it can. It involves a lot of self-confrontation, moderating, taming, refining, tempering, nudging forward, holding back ... But I love this journey, as rocky as it may be.I'm sure I'll be desperately low tomorrow over some thing. But I'm also sure I'll find a way out. I know that by now.It is also seriously great to meet and hang out with some of the most deep, caring (lol) and inspiring people I've ever known, and feel that connection between us.Yay!. Which one do I choose for my story of growth and recovery? *Trigger Warning.*Which one do I go for for my suicidal ideation? *Upbeat Talk.*...Ah ha ... That pattern of childish rebellion ... That feeling of being caged in, and the explosion out ... That [Rhombicosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicosidodecahedron) being forced through a square hole ...That core need for autonomy childhood, chronically unmet ... ...*Well done, Peanut. Feel the feelings. Attend to your inner child.* Nope!I want to have a party and do wild mock interpretative dancing a la Kate Bush in the 1980s in front of everyone without drinking a drop of alcohol because I'm that special that I can do that. I hope everyone is jealous.*Don't tell me what to do!*Thanks. Venting - advice requested....*Chooses Flair. Cries.*. No I did not.I spent a considerable amount of time, picking, putting on, checking, enjoying my reflection, imagining what people will think, imagining people admire my looks, semi-consciously rehearsing my modest replies.Started with that tiny t-shirt that no one wears on a Tuesday work day. Tucked in. Ugh! Yes. But too much. Too obvious, complete with my sparkly glasses and over-quaffed hair. Such a narc. But actually: who cares!! Fuck 'em! Actually, shit! I do care. Too much. Try on that shirt over the top for the more casual look. Hm. Terrible shoulder projection. Tucked in. Yes!!! So sexy!!! But no, obvious porn star wannabe again. Untuck shirt and t-shirt. The sad compromise. Phew. I look good not too good. Totally casual. But you can still see my workout progress.Check mirror just one more time, or three, and... stare for a second, and... breakfast! "I'm coming!"*he glows into the kitchen*THE LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT.Hang on a mo...Other people are not two dimensional caricatures. Ooooooooo....They may look a certain way in their demeanour, but underneath is this mysterious Pandora's box of possibilities.They may look miserable right now. But they might suddenly burst into jokes and giggles.They may appear calm and sensible to me on first impression, but they may turn out to be rather lazy or slightly bonkers today.It's difficult to know what to expect. People surprise.Oh yeah! 😁...Does anyone else have this where they very easily and quickly box people into two dimensional "You are this or that"? Is this particular an NPD or PD thing? I kind of think it might be. I've noticed that I very easily seem to do this compared with others around me. When I cast my silly judgements or assessments of people, for example, my partner or friends suggest that things are more complex, and that I'm being too inflexible in my view.So, sitting on this train home, looking at people around me, it feels cool and nice and open in my body to shift this more fixed perspective of people towards something more complex and dynamic and surprising.Oh!. I have found this hard in life, accepting and appreciating other people's talents and abilities and skills and achievements and successes. Even close friends. Even my partner.But ... it's something I've worked on quite a bit over many years. It's gotten easier. And more often I can find myself actually enjoying other people's talents, rather than feeling that tug of envy in my chest.Tonight we went to a birthday party. Cheesy music on the dance floor. I work in music and have spent a lifetime listening to music as a kind of "work". What can I learn from this musician? How can I be as good or better than them? Why aren't I successful? Fantasising about my own potential. etc etc You know the drill.Tonight, I noticed that I just enjoyed the music and the musicians without comparing myself or getting twitchy about my own abilities or status (or lack of status) as a musician.I thought, "Oh, this is what normal people must feel like listening to music."It was ... very nice.To reduce stigma, some refer to BPD as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.Would you re-name NPD for a similar purpose? If so, what?I'm going with SERD for now: Self-Esteem Regulation Disorder, which I think I picked up from elsewhere. I think it would help me explain the symptoms and behaviour to people. I wonder if I would feel less isolated and less concerned talking about it.Also, SERD just rolls off the tongue. Clearly.SERD! 🌈. It's such a bad and swift turnaround, it's also funny.I should really know better by now. But I contine to fool myself, it seems.Us self-aware narcs are not always so different from (supposedly) healthy people.Everyone has narcissistic defences. Ours are just more pronounced and much more dysfunctional.But everyone has that armour, or can do.But here's our advantage as the self-aware crowd. We (hopefully, but not always) \*recognise\* at least some of our defences. And because we have a tendency towards hypersensitivity, hypervigilance, and over-analysis, we may (I think) see more of the layers of our defences, the subtleties and nuances, and talk openly about them (here at least). On average, I'd say most people don't....Defences come in all guises. Grandiosity, yes. Going on the attack. Antagonism. Angry rumination. Martyrdom. Complaining. But also just simple detachment from emotions.Everyone does this.Last night I was with a few friends at dinner. One friend brought up how she was worried about her Mum and Dad, the latter in particular because he was experiencing pain I his side, had previously had cancer, but had been ignoring the pain and the doctor or telling anyone until just recently. She shared her news and revealed a glimpse of her fears. I felt like she was human and I was human. I felt connection to her where previously I was struggling.Within surely less than a minute, another friend chipped in to say something like, "It's probably nothing", and turned the conversation towards something else. The friend with the unwell Dad followed along. The window of vulnerability opened and was quickly closed. I felt the moment where we could connect fall away from me.There it was in the group. Detachment. Cutting off from emotions that might be "too much", "awkward" or "intolerable".I felt lonely again, me with my feelings I sensed there was less room for. I closed up....When I teach my piano students, I try to notice my own state or mode as much as possible, and how the student is responding. I notice that when I've been in a more grandiose state, it feels fun and I feel awesome, and students may tag along with the energy for a while. Perhaps there is some comfort in being with a teacher who distracts them from their own feelings, through becoming the centre of attention in my jokes or quirkiness or through playing in a show-off or extravagant manner. But the sense of comfort and ease in the room doesn't last long. Quite quickly I notice that I become disconnected from the student. They are "over there" and I am "over here". We aren't vibing off each other.I think this is problematic for the student and the teaching, particularly in a one to one teaching context. The disconnection feels quite isolating for both of us. Quite lonely and even a bit scary for the student. In order for the learning to be "good", they need a sense of secure connection with the teacher. And it's true. When I'm in a more balanced, emotionally in-touch state, in tune with what's going on within me, sensing what is happening potentially in the student, verbally checking in with them and listening to their responses, and yet having that overall sense of stability and level-headedness, then the teaching can work better. I notice that students relax more and open up. They share their feelings about playing and we work to resolve problems that I could only know about if they are shared. Or it could be about them sharing their interests or preferences for the direction of travel in the lessons. That opening up allows them their autonomy, which is another key ingredient to success when we work together: I'm doing some guiding, but they are also participating and speaking up about what feels right for them in that moment. If I'm grandiose or detached - not checking in, not open about my own experience - then they don't have so much room to express themselves, and the lessons are about me more than them. And that's not good.I'm not saying that the good teaching is absolutely and totally dependent on my behaviour. But how I show up has at least some impact. And it is my responsibility, I believe, as the adult and professional, to think about these things and try to do my best for the client. Grandiosity is not totally awful and can create some kind of spark in the room. It can even lift people for a while, which is no bad thing. But if it is too strong or too prolonged, disconnection entails, and the learning process - and the joy of music - falls a bit flat....A core part of me, however much I deny it when I'm grandiose or emotionally detached, yearns for connection. I think we all do. It's a fundamental human need.I s'pose this post is aiming at a few things. A reminder for myself to notice that grandiosity or detachment within myself, and to try to find ways of softening the armour, to be more open, even vulnerable, to foster connection with others.I can't deny that there's also a bit of "come on, guys" to this post. I like you for you. Sometimes I feel that our defences get in the way of connecting here, in this special place - where we have that opportunity to connect. ...I say: let's go for it.If you are anything like me, you are sensitive, you have a sensitive temperament. People have told you that you are reading into things that aren't there. You are told that you are too much, too intense, think too much, are full of woe, or have too much energy, too happy, even.It can be lonely being an emotional and sensitive person. It can become easier to put forward what we think is an acceptable presentation of ourselves for others, hiding the fluid and intense feelings underneath. At the same time, it can feel like very few people seem to understand our emotional landscape inside, so we retreat inwards, becoming hyperautonomous and over-introspective, lost in our own thoughts, analysing our feelings, maybe seeing them as superior to that of others.These are perhaps some of the ways that narcissism has manifested in me, which leads to other self-interested behaviours that add to the suffering of feeling lonely and not understood, alien....But the intense feelings are also a gift. This is a tricky line to tread, because it can be easy - certainly for me - to over-treasure and over-personalise these gifts as "ours", making us special, better. So we have to be on guard for this kind of thinking that further separates us from other people, when what we really need is connection and understanding.At the same time, I think we can enjoy our emotions and find solace within them. Intense emotions allow me to experience life with greater passion. I find fulfilment through sorrow and grief, not just resting on everyday, superficial emotions. I have many emotional peaks throughout my days. They can be tough, but I am also grateful for them. It has been a difficult life sometimes. But rich. Very rich. Just being in my body every day.Maybe a view that accounts for both sides of the coin can help keep us level-headed. We are both unlucky and lucky. Recognising the pluses and minuses gives me a sense of balance, and both limits my tendency towards self-aggrandisement and keeps me from a sense of unhelpful self-pity....One of the things I like about this forum is that it is filled with intense people, quite willing to go to the depths. Very fulfilling. I am glad.We can get better. ...Another low effort post.Oh! ...Low effort post. Sorry. But that's it.I had a post earlier about what being kind to ourselves means to different people here.It occurred to me that - of course - for many of us, we struggle to even know what it is to be kind or self-compassionate, because we didn't experience it, or it wasn't modelled to us in childhood.When I started my own journey of recovery about 13 years ago, I also really had very little clue about compassion in some respects. My attempts at compassion for others were more like grandiose manipulations of their emotions, positioning myself as "the person to lean on", being "the wise advisor" and so on. Yes, it wasn't all bad. People may have got things from the interaction. But for me, it was probably more about feeling good about myself, and seeing myself as the bigger, better, wiser person, rather than actually connecting with the person in need. I didn't really have a feeling of connection with them, I don't think. It was more: what can I get out of this interaction? If they feel good at the end, then I will feel good, and that was probably more of the main goal.Attempts at self-compassion ... ? I mean, I didn't know. I remember during therapy in 2020, my therapist "introduced" the idea of compassion to me. It was kind of new to me. I didn't really have a feeling about it. I said I would try to be compassionate to myself, but it wasn't really something I felt. It was more of a logical, cognitive exercise.One time in therapy again last year, I was doing a particular exercise in self-compassion. My therapist asked me to think about what my "healthy adult / role model" might do in a particular imagined situation. I pulled from a list of ideas I had made in the previous year, which I'd jotted down on a piece of paper. Having said out loud what I'd do, I quickly burst into tears, realising that while I knew the answer now, it was something that took me so many years to work out. I was sad for my younger self who didn't experience the compassion a child should receive, and so had to strive to learn it as an adult in a very haphazard way,Now, I do have a better understanding of being nice to myself and others, but it didn't come from me. It took effort, and I had to look for it from other people: by observing friends, characters in films and TV, and podcasters like Tara Brach - who really taught me a lot in particular.So it was a bit presumptuous of me earlier to ask people how they could be kind to themselves today, when it took me a very long time to work it out. I didn't think clearly about it.I had to outsource it. It doesn't come from us. But I do believe it's possible for us to internalise and make our own the behaviours - and eventually feelings - of other people.As I said, one personal go-to in my journey was Tara Brach. She also teachers meditation, and while I found her meditations really nice, it was really the podcast talks that were helpful. I learnt so many things through her talks. I imagined her as my new inner parent. I would speak to her in my mind's eye: "I'm stuck. What should I do?" ... And I would, because I'd listened to her so much, more and more easily imagine what she might say back to me in various situations: "I see you're hurting. I see you're angry. I'm so sorry you're struggling." Just that - that empathy delivered to myself through my imagination - was enough sometimes to help me calm down. I remember that when I couldn't sleep at nice because I was so enraged, imagining Tara Brach come to my bedside like a mother figure, sit down on the bed, rest her hand on my body and say, "I'm so sorry you're hurting right now" ... that would allow me to relax and drift off to sleep.I still struggle with real empathy sometimes, but it's better. When I can't connect properly, I can still say the words that I learnt from Tara Brach, and feel that they might have a positive impact on people like they had on me. It's like: passing on what I learnt through her. It's also far less grandiose than it used to be. I've learnt to let the other person work it out for themselves more, with just little nudges, rather than dictating how I think they "should" think or feel or reflect. Yes, there is still some grandiosity involved on my side, but it's less and less.So there you go. I just wanted to say that.No jokes or cynicism. 😁For me, it's lowering - even by just a knotch - the demands and expectations I put on myself to be productive and perfect in all spheres of life all the time.For once, not doing, but just being. Not pushing forward fast. Allowing life to unfold on its own a but more. Strolling rather than sprinting. Whoops. I dropped the juggling balls. Oh well. I'll pick them up some other time. It's be OK.That is the kind of kindness I need today. What about you? It could be completely different.I'd say these are two core features of my personality, as I currently see it. I wondered if other pwNPD relate in their own way.A comment by u/KickLongjumping4433 got me thinking about these aspects of me.In Schema, they sometimes talk of a 'Defiant Child' mode, which is an "angry response to having one’s autonomy curtailed and being told what to do."Then there is the Rebel Mode in Schema. A Schema theorist I like, David Edwards, quoted some key statements linked to this mode of behaviour: “I dislike rules and can get satisfaction from breaking them,” “I think of myself as a rebel; I often go against the established authority,” and “I enjoy being unconventional, even if it’s unpopular or I don’t fit in.” He goes onto say: "This mode externalises a backstage Defiant Child, and incorporates a narrative that portrays it as a valuable identity. Expression may range from being more passive-aggressive to being actively, even militantly rebellious."...I definitely have these elements in me. And I think it's important to keep in mind that they arise in response to a sense that autonomy is being taken away or denied. Or was in the past, as a child. We have a core need to individuate / differentiate from other people, and ... this is an undeveloped part of me. I didn't properly go through the individuation process because of my over-bearing, enmeshing mother and terrifying father. No space for 'me'.I really see where this lack of autonomy comes from in myself, and why it's such a big trigger for the defiant part of me. When I feel like my independence and sense of personal choice as an adult is undermined or unfairly questioned, like it was in childhood, I get angry really quickly. RAGE! There is a teen-like "Fuck you!" flavour to the anger. Two fingers up. Slammed doors. Vent post.I guess the rebel mode in me, if it's linked to this sense of angry defiance underneath, is the lighter and more playful version of this rage. It's the mischief in me, as I've identified many times before. Disgusting jokes. Pranks. Banter. Giggling about my misdemeanours. Revelling in the naughtiness.I've mentioned, for instance, that I see myself as quite emotionally immature in some respects, or at least that this can come forth in me fairly often. I feel an almost mischievous glee about this aspect of my personality. Again, I think it connects to that sense of rebellion: "I'll behave like a teenager, and it'll make me different, annoying, unconventional etc." But I think it also reveals that underlying angry defiance. It has a kind of: "Fuck you, social conventions!" flavour in there too. I'm not great with rules....I'm sitting on the bed - like a teenager - typing this. Ahead of me is a large mirror. Occasionally, I'm looking up and channelling that rebel / defiant mode through my face, to see what comes up.Gosh. I actually do this often throughout my day! Lol. This is the mode that pops out in the bathroom mirror, for example, when I run there to escape the adult dinner party conversations that I detest. I pull this face to myself. What is it saying? ... "Don't fuck with me!" ... "I don't give a fuck." ... "You're all a bunch of wankers." ... "Fuck this boring shit." ... Maybe I'm thinking these and similar things to myself in the mirror because I feel I can't say them to the people I'm with. Maybe I use the mirror to express or display parts of myself generally that I feel not able to say out loud. I kind of put those parts of me into the mirror, where they are safe. The mirror is a safe space to express myself. Oohhhhhhhh!...The thing is, if I follow the Schema model, then underneath all of that is the vulnerable childlike part of me. A part of me LOVES being this rebel, and wants to deny that there is anything else going on. But to do that would not do myself any favours. It would be to keep me stuck in a way of coping with life - through feeling and being rebellious (passive and active) - rather than actually attending to any wounds underneath that are driving those parts of me ... to, quite honestly, behave in ways that I can regret or bring me a sense of shame in the aftermath.So as I continue to gaze into the mirror, I also find a safe moment to express other things to myself. The mirror is my display cabinet for my deeper emotions I feel unable to share anywhere else.A sadness quickly reveals itself. Loneliness. Fatigue. Bleakness. Depression. Feeling ugly. Feeling unwanted. Feeling unloved. Totally.I spend a moment staring at my face, which shows all these emotions and more that I can't describe properly. It feels good to acknowledge that these feelings are there. I suddenly realise how tired I am.Life is tiring for many reasons. Just tapping into one particular aspect, though, it's tiring not being able to express my emotions in public, or at least *feeling* like I can't. It's tiring feeling like I have to wrap up my emotions in some publicly acceptable presentation that doesn't feel natural to me. It's tiring and frustrating. My sadness shifts to a childlike anger: "Why can't I just say what I want, how I want?! Why do I have to follow these rules of self-expression when they are so stifling and unnatural?" I feel sad again. ...And then I feel that playful rebel part of me come through. It's like a way of distracting myself from he sadness and frustration. There he is in the mirror once more, and I feel my thoughts turn to mischievous things I might think or do later in the day, just to "get my own back". Hm. Defiance. Feeling controlled again, and so engaging in thoughts and behaviours that give me a sense of taking back control, or defying the authority that I don't agree with....I do like this rebellious and defiant part of me, though. Yes, it's immature, and I can do or say some things in that mode that later induce shame, but there are also many upsides. People laugh at my stupid jokes and silly, childlike behaviour. ATTENTION! But the mood of the room lightens.It actually also works well in my work as a piano teacher, where, depending on the appropriateness of the moment, I can be playful and cheeky and poke fun at social norms (especially around music performance and assessment, for example), and it's all part of the package: the slightly quirky piano teacher, helping people escape - for 30 minutes at least - the trappings of school or adult life. I play a bit of the fool if it feels right to do that, and the intention is to lighten the mood sometimes, and give space for people to undo their social conformity, get a bit more childlike themselves and connect with and lose themselves in the music - which is what we're aiming for....I don't want to get rid of the rebel in me. He's funny and cute and energising. But I do think it would be good to recognise where he comes from as well, and tend to that sadness underneath a bit more....Now, where's my rocket. 🚀. I have gotten a lot of helpful comments to posts since I started writing here.Recently, a few people have pointed out my potential black and white thinking on various situations. On reflection, I do see that I still struggle with this style of split-off thinking and perception of myself, other people and the world around me.My understanding is that this is a feature of NPD. I just re-watched a HealNPD YouTube video on integration and splitting, and related to it a lot.I generally see myself as split into 'parts' that feel radically different from one another. Some I instinctively feel are 'all good' while others I perceive as 'all bad'. Well, that is my tendency anyhow. I am trying to enjoy and appreciate that sides that I previously felt terrified to acknowledge. And I am also experimenting right now in seeing the downsides of my "pure hearted" parts. But my mental reflex is still to see these parts as cut off from one another and either dastardly or wholesome. It feels hard right now to perceive a middle ground. Grey areas in my thinking are appearing, I guess. But it takes conscious effort to think like this.I also have the habit of associating my "real self" with these different parts at any given time. When I'm in a low mood, I can easily think, "Oh. That's the real me." But when I'm grandiose or otherwise, I think just the same and ignore the low mood from before. In either state, it feels difficult to imagine that the "real me" is both or the opposite of where I am currently at. I am also obsessed with trying to figure out who "I really am". It's another mental reflex that I have to consciously pull myself away from often.Historically, I have tended to see people as "all bad" or "all good". In the past, I would easily want to discard people in my life who I thought were "evil" or against me or not worth the effort because they were "boring" or "stupid" or "aggressive". I would also idealise some other people as being "good-natured" or "great".These days, I still have that tendency. But I do more readily see people as more than one thing.But I now find it confusing that some other people are much more "blended" than I am. I see there "good" and "bad" qualities, but I don't see those parts as split off from one another. Some people don't shift in and out of different "modes" of behaviour and mood like I do. They are more "one thing with subtle flavours."I see that other people do have quite different sides to them that appear in different contexts. But I somehow don't perceive that as problematic in them, whereas it feels totally problematic that this could be the case with me. The idea that I am not constant confuses me and feels "wrong".I am a kaleidoscope of moving parts that come to the surface, and I don't really know anything different. It feels very disorientating to live in a kaleidoscope, with parts that I cannot hold onto for long, or comprehend as ok or me or real. I am constantly questioning my sense of identity. How can I be both terribly kind and a complete cunt at different times? To others, that might not seem like an issue or something worth worrying about. But to me, my sense of identity plays on my mind every day. Who the fuck am I? The cunt or the cute kind one? It really bothers me. How can I be both?When I am with people, I feel these different parts rise and fall in my persona. They can be very intense and radically different. Rage then anxiety then cockiness then tearfulness then joy. I think I try my best to appear as one person, trying to present a stable image to the world, or as I imagine the people I'm with would want me to be. That has always been my tendency. But it is quite an anxious state, where I'm simultaneously managing what's going on underneath, which is a lot. My therapist said she could see waves of emotions pass quickly through me in session. That is me without the mask on. A montage reel of contrasting parts, flipping very quickly from one to the other. A multipart chorus of voices singing in different tonalities. I feel I am getting better. So that's good. It feels very hard to do this sometimes, but I am trying to present to people more how I want to be or feel in the moment, rather than how I instinctively and subconsciously imagine they want me to appear. It still feels anxiety inducing and challenging. I guess this comes down to feeling like I "had" to be one thing but not another as a child. I had to appear to get along with my parents, for example, even though they terrified or mistreated me. I had to pretend to the world that everything was fine a home, even though it was a scary place to live. I felt I had to please my parents by presenting in particular ways but hiding others. Then being a musical child gave me a place to really escape all of that. I would get attention and shine on the little stage. I would enjoy living inside that bubble of peace and excitement.Writing this makes me feel sad that the trauma or neglect I experienced as a child had such an impact on my brain.I know a little about what's going on here, but would appreciate any more input. What I am really hoping for is some understanding and guidance.Rip off the mask and underneath there is a really nasty side of me. It is not all of me, but it is a real part. I've written about it elsewhere a few times, but I guess I'm coming back to it to try to consolidate my thoughts a bit further.You see, I'm on this journey of mine. I want some kind of reconciliation of my various parts, however contrasting. I want some kind of integration, rather than this splitting of my psyche. I don't want to present in one way to people but feel completely different underneath, or try to push that other side away from my being. Or at least I want to do that less and less, or when it's only necessary. I don't want to split into different and distinct modes so much. I want to have access to more of my whole self, and use those different sides more wisely.I just ... want to be whole. It's not like I'm starting from scratch at this point, but ... that's my journey, which I don't mind repeating and repeating. I want it. I want it....So this nasty side... Once again, like many of my 'tricky parts' it seems, I have hidden it from others, and denied it to myself. Shut it down. Tried to quieten it or change it. Step away from it. Let it shrivel.But it keeps coming back. It won't change. It's just 'there'. An aspect of my personality.It actually pops out when I look in the mirror. It's there in my eyebrows. Lol. :)This nastiness has many flavours:It is rebellious to authority. Antagonistic. Highly irritable. Fractious. Wanting to scold, belittle, shame, lecture, control others close to me. It is sneering at people. It is reducing them to an object that I can mentally demean and ridicule. It is taking some pleasure in shocking people, intimidating them, making them uncomfortable. It is wanting to start arguments only to gain the upper hand. Doing things that most people would find somewhat shocking. It is petty and vengeful. It sometimes imagines doing harm to others. It is pure, wicked mischief.In another post recently, I wrote about a power-hungry side of me. In some ways, this feels a bit different. But these two sides, I guess, could potentially combine. I'm not sure right now.That would be quite something if they did combine and were let loose....This nasty side of me has, in particular, caused me great anxiety in the past. Like: panic for it even being there. *Where did it come from? Is this the real me? Help! I thought I was a good person. I want to be that good person!* But, thankfully, that anxiety has been diminishing through some self-work I've been doing.This past year, I have actively tried to recognise it when it appears and allow it in through my mind and body. In time, I have grown to appreciate but also enjoy it. It has a wild and electrifying energy that really excites me.Apologies for being graphic, but it's become a real turn-on when I'm having a wank. It just really does it for me, and I'd say is part of what I'd call my autosexuality. It's like I'm turned on by this really cuntish side of my being.I can also now look in the mirror at myself and, rather than see it and deny it, change my face to obscure it - I can instead think, "I really like this wicked side of me" and not flinch neatly so much. In fact, I feel the thrill of it....And yet: do I actually want to be a cunt to people? Er ... *No ? ? ?*No. I don't want to hurt people. I don't like that.But it's not a 100% no, either. The nastiness is still there. And I quite like the mischievous aspect of it. It's entertaining, both in the moment and talking about it with similarly-minded or accepting others. There are also ways I have recently discovered to enact this nasty mischief that don't actually cause people harm, but do cause considerable pleasure and thrill.Naughty Peanut....There are definitely aspects of it that I don't want. I don't want to be a dick to my partner, my family, friends or people at large. I don't like scolding or ridiculing my partner or other people. I don't want to lash out at people. I don't want to overtly demean people. I want connection. I want to see people as whole in themselves. I don't want to be controlling of others. I want to let them to exist as they choose. I want to help people more. I want to try to get along with more people. I want to be more generous (though it's quite an effort sometimes!).But again: I want connection....And yet, I do want the energy of that nasty side. I guess just without the behavioural nastiness.I'm hoping that, now I've acknowledged it and enjoyed its presence, I can keep it in mind, draw from its energy, but without the mental or behavioural degrading of others.That covert mischievous aspect seems like it could be an answer. Revelling in little non-harmful misdemeanours in private. And having a good ol' wank about it.I could be kidding myself again, but I'm hoping that can help with the reconciliation and integration.I'm nervous posting this.Not so much about the title, but about whether I've been able to explain my experience effectively....I've been on this path of trying to be more honest with myself, allowing parts of my psyche to be acknowledged and felt, so I can be authentic to myself at the very least.It's not a new thing. It's been going on for a while, this trying to peel back the layers.When I access some hidden or shunned part of me, there is a burst of energy that feels amazing. A real high. It's also psychologically wonderful to acknowledge and accept and even celebrate parts of me that I previously felt ashamed of. Then it settles and becomes a part of me that I accept and recognise as an element of 'me'. It's something I've been doing this year more and more....Today, with a new zeal for this process, I felt a part come forward that I've been scared of, and written about elsewhere. I've always tried to shut it down. But today I was ready to allow it in.It was interesting to feel it come forward when I was out in public. It came through in how I felt in my body and on my face. I noticed it in my thinking and feelings about myself and others.At first it was just a feeling, but I allowed it to come forward more and take centre stage. If it were a character, they would be ... dastardly, cunning, manipulative.And then I realised what was at the core of this part: a real lust for power.It reads a little inconsequential when I read that back now. But that lust, craving, yearning for power, dominance, recognition, status is an important and not small part of me.I allowed it in, allowed my thoughts to be focused on gaining and having power. The energy release that came over me was massive, like a huge sexual energy.I was walking in the street. I tilted my head back and looked to the sky like I was having an orgasm. That energy coursing right through me. It felt fucking fantastic, thinking about power....There I was in the street, and I acknowledged it to myself. I have a huge lust for power, and all the above I've described.Status. Ugh.Reputation. Drool.It's been there since I can remember. It drives my actions, even though I've tried to deny it, shut it down.But today, I said to myself that this is not just a part of me. I said: *I AM power hungry*. For someone who has been trying or pretending (to others and myself) to be the 'good guy' my whole life, this is a huge step. It felt massive.I dived back into that part of me. I had thoughts of manipulating people to gain status, a good reputation, recognition etc ... Wow! What a turn on!I thought of how people in my life give me compliments for my work. Something so small. But again: that quite sexually charged rush as I realise what I'm in it for. That feeling of being on top.Admired.Revered.Ugh. Drool. DROOL!!!!!Literally cum in my pants....Whenever I felt this part of me before, I was scared what I would do with this drive for power at the helm. Would I hurt people?Would I want to hurt people to gain power?Maybe this sounds ridiculous to you reading this. I guess I'm condensing quite a lot of work and experience into short paragraphs. But ... I did a test. I walked passed a few people and noticed how my body reacted. I usually feel small physical urges pretty well. I was curious to see if an urge to hurt people would come through with this part of me being more dominant.But ... no. Nothing.Maybe it'll be there another time and surprise me. But ... no. No urge to hurt people to gain power.Oh! Didn't see that coming.I mean, no judgement if you do actually want to hurt people. I get that others here might have that. But ... I don't.Neutral....I went to a shop. A homeless man sat outside the door. I asked him if I could buy any food for him. As we had our exchange, I observed what was happening in my mind and body. Interesting how that lust for power died down. I bought the food, gave it to him, didn't really feel that much for it. Then went back to my thoughts of power lust and having an orgasm in the street....And another thing. I thought about other people having power as well. And, oh yes: that's why I get envious. But, wait... it also just turned me on more. To be around people with that same lust as I have.WOOF!Hello r/NPD!...I also realised that this lust secretly drives my behaviours: in my work, in my relationships. Oh ... I'll be nice, if I get the power out of it.And oh, I'll work hard and do well for others, for the recognition.But also true is that in the moment of working with others, I don't actually feel that power drive, that yearning for grandiosity. I work one-to-one to help people feel good and be creative. My focus is on them in the room for the most part.But I tell where that lust for power comes out: between sessions. That's when I self-aggrandise about how brilliant I am and have been. Or when, as I said, I get compliments....The do-gooding part feeds the power-hungry part.The power-hungry part drives the actual do-gooding....But also ... I realised and felt inside that when it comes to it, when the chips are down ... I'll ignore or dismiss my power craving and do the right thing for people.Interesting.The fear of this part of me dissipates. Just something to enjoy....It doesn't even make me feel that relieved. It's just how it is. Neutral....PEANUT (wants all the) POWER.So obvious.At least now I know.BUT ...What?Both power-hungry AND ok to share with others.WHAT?...I deny some of my thoughts and feelings to even myself. I'm trying not to. That's a big task for me. Here I am, trying.I'm trying to be whole.I want to go further along this path, to see all the different parts of me and accept them. But I'm scared....Sometimes I feel I present to myself and the world that I am this pure-hearted, clean-thinking guy.And I do feel love. Not for everyone. Maybe ultimately only really for my partner. I'm scared that he'll die and then I'll have no one who I actually love.I have thought that I would probably kill myself if he died.DRAMAS!But true: I have thought about it....I am happy-go-lucky and bouncy in my presentation in public.But that's not all that's going on.I'm incredibly self-obsessed and selfish, and can be quite vicious underneath. That's what I hide from people. I hide from myself as well.Is it that I aim to get along with people in my life, but that's about it?The feeling of power is intoxicating for me. Any kind of power.I write my chirpy emails to my clients, thank my colleagues for their help. I maintain that connection. Appearing all cheerful and like I care.But I also sense this other, exciting part of me that wants them to like me so I can dominate and be on top. Shine. Be brilliant. Own the room. Just dominate. Ooof. It's definitely there. And it's not a nice part of me.It's actually quite a nasty side. Sneering. Judgemental. Using people. Manipulative. I've been scared of this part of me all my life. Is this the real me, after all?FUCK!!!!!It is a real part of me, for sure. I feel it.I worry about what would happen if this part of me took over.I worry about what I could or would do, without a care.The darkest part of my humanity....Is it possible to be so cheerful and nice and enjoy connections, and yet on the other side be so damn ... black hearted?FUCK!....Do I actually like people at all? Anyone?Thinking about it ... Yes. I actually do. I do. Thank God. Thinking about people I know. I do. I feel it. Thank fuck. It feels like a relief to feel those nice feelings about people.Phew ... Sigh ... But it's like I'm clinging onto the edge of a cliff here. Holding onto the good.Desperate not to fall. In case......That nasty side of me. The side that gives me a great feeling of energy and power.Dare I say it, but it's actually an evil side to me....A colleague just came into the room as I typed this.I chatted with her. Her presence felt warm and kind. I enjoyed being with her. I felt equal. I felt connected. Oh thank God. There it is again: that nice feeling. I AM OKAY!!!...Am I deceiving myself for even thinking that I have this 'dark side'? No. It's there. He's there. That flavour of Peanut.Charged with energy. Evil glint in the eye....I have had this idea that my contrasting sides could somehow integrate, blend.I say, sometimes, that some mid-point between dark and light is this cheeky wanker middle man: a cunt with a heart. 🌈...I dunno. Another colleague just came up.I liked being with him. We chatted. It felt natural. Easy.No cheeky wanker....Or maybe I was just mirroring him. ... Ugh.My mind.Who the fuck am I?...Why do I have these thoughts? Is this NPD or another issue?What? Just generally: what? How? Who? ...Who's deceiving who?Am I deceiving you all here? Sometimes. I'm trying not to....Does anyone have a clue about any of this?. Are your narcissistic traits constant or do they glitch on and off?In my work as a piano teacher, I find my narcissism is often out of the picture. In that moment with students, I do devote most of my energies to the person, or to managing my own emotions and wellbeing so I can show up and be present for them in a healthy way.Outside of that context, I can be a right narcissistic silly cunty twat. Mostly covert. Mostly. But again, not always. It's interesting how different situations ignite my narcissism, while others don't.Enough about me. When are you narcissistic and when are you not?What is it that brings out your narcissistic defences? What triggers you?Or ... Are you narcissistic all the time?. I'm knackered as I write this.I'm so tired. Work. Over work. I do that. Physically shattered. Mentally barely here right now.I read some bit of Schema Therapy research that connected proneness to fatigue and burnout with the Unrelenting Standards schema. I have this schema. It's common for people with NPD, apparently.I have sort of burned out a few times in adulthood for sure. Anyone else?Very high standards. Rigid expectations. Perfectionism. Of course. Of course.The drive to be on top. The best. Harder. Faster. Better.Drive. Drive. Drive.Do you relate?///I had a really hard day, work-wise. Physically demanding. I felt dizzy from the stress. But I also thought: "Hey, at least I'll be burning loads of calories and will therefore look good whilst fainting."I hated today, but also found solace and joy in pushing myself.Feeling that I'm on top of everything and pushing hard gives me a bit of a thrill.Feeling that I look good whilst doing the work gives me a boost of energy.Do you get that?///Of course, I'm also working to tame this side of me. A calm breath. A stroll instead of a walk. A break instead of doing anything. But that underlying push to the top of my game is always there and needs managing. ///I have a thing called 'wellbeing Thursday' in order to give myself a break in the week. Thursday mornings ARE MINE! Everyone else can just fuck off (unless you're one of my narc pals). Just : No work. No non-narc friends in cafes because I happen to be free. Nope. I do as I please. On my own, in my narcissistic pleasure dome for one. Thank you Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday, and Good Night.Oh my god.I realised a key difference in the way I treat the people I've met and made friends with here, compared to how I treat people in real life, especially my partner: Unconditional love.Unconditional love, unconditional positive regard or whatever you want to call it. I understand it to be a core emotional need that we often - in this group - didn't have met in our childhoods. Instead we were loved conditionally. And we were taught to love others conditionally. That if we do "X", we get love, or a substitute for love: praise or attention. Something like that.Is it total, 100% unconditional love and positive regard I have for my sub friends? No. It's not perfect. But ... the tendency is there. The habit. The inclination to turn that on rather than block it out and judge. A part of me does judge. But I can shift to overcome that. See passed that.I wonder if it is this that in part lays the foundation for the strong connection I have for people from here. That I had with Nick.I notice I very much try to be much more accepting, seeing potential dissonances, flaws or faults as collective or shared, and which have a context: the wounds we have from the past. I notice my tendency to forgive aspects of behaviour that don't gel with me, letting them go, seeing even antisocial behaviours as the manifestation of coping mechanisms built up from early-on to manage those wounds. Survival tools. I also notice that I listen to them, that I take their advice or even their criticisms on the chin and reflect on them. Not 100% perfectly, but much, much more easily than with people I know in my every day world and definitely with my partner....I had a disagreement with him just now going to the train station. We were on the verge of shifting into an argument. Well I was.I noticed that I was judging him. Of course. I do that. And I placed so many conditions on showing him love, feeling love for him. I do that too.He needs to lose weight. He needs to not drink so much. He needs to do as I would, essentially. Something Few said in an earlier comment about treating people as extensions of myself. It resonated and I related it to how I treat my partner. I am controlling. I am irritated by his actions that don't fit with me.We had our disagreement and I did my usual thing of calmly yet precisely cutting him down. Well done me. He's not perfect. He cuts me down too. But that doesn't stop me from wanting and trying to change for the better, for our relationship as a whole. I saw that he was hurt, though he didn't want to admit it.Then I managed to wonder, "What would I feel and how would I act if this was Nick, or someone else I am close with on the sub?" The motley crew / cast of the NPD version of Friends.I would show them that unconditional love. I would see passed the difficult or antagonistic behaviour, the controlling tendencies or the outbursts. I would see the wounds from before we met. I would tune into them and try to understand things from their perspective. And I would get there much more easily. For the first time, really, I saw my partner as a raw, wounded individual - I'd now say he's very likely NPD but far from self awareness. I saw his his difficult behaviours as the only way to survive that he knew.I turned to him and said, "You might not believe this, but over time, I've grown to love you more. And I just now saw you and loved you in a very new way."I stood there on the platform, looking at him and felt that zing of comnection in my chest, which is so easily blocked out. It surprised me. I noticed that I hadn't felt it like this before. Not really that much.(Then our train pulled in and I caught my reflection in the reflection and thought, "Oo. And... I'm also hot right now." Yay!)...I realised that I really could do with treating my partner - and other people in my life like someone from our little community: with empathy and compassion. Unconditionally. Or more so.Because he is wounded like the rest of us. ...I'm honestly proud of myself for this insight, and yes I'm sharing it here because of my pride. It's also to document for myself for future reference. A reminder of what matters.Nick would have said, "I'm proud of you, man." I would cringe when he said it. I would block myself from feeling his affection and care. I should have let that care in back then. I want to let it in now.I have received a great deal of very helpful support since Nick's death. I'm not the only one who needs it, but I was probably closest to him out of everyone I know here. So I greatly appreciate it. I have been with friends in real life, and we have had our laughs and good times. They have also given me hugs and space to be as I need. But on my own I have been blanking out, crying, distraught, very lonely, lost, depressed and shattered - confused. I'm glad I reached out for help in my lowest moment. As I wrote to Emotional_Climate, it's interesting how receiving a few kind words can have a big positive impact. You all really helped me. Thank you.💛...I don't know that Nick always felt truly supported by me. He said he did, but ... towards the end I had pulled away for such stupid and selfish reasons. I also don't know that he felt understood by me or other people. I'm not saying he suicide is all my fault in some self-centred way. But the very painful thing I've had to face is that my behaviour - my absence and lack of attunement - were at least one factor in his demise. There were many people who let him down, and I was one of them. I think that's the hard truth, no matter how small my impact was. At one point, we were so connected. It was quite unreal. We both said how special the friendship was, so ... I have to consider and understand that I failed him, and that this, in part, established the environment in which he decided the only option was to take his own life.My options going forward feel to be: kill myself, crush myself with self-flagelation as I live on, or live and try to do better. I'm choosing the latter. But I believe I need to feel the pain of the situation to do that. Some self-flagelation feels needed. I believe I need to understand where and how I let Nick down in my own way, feel the pain of that and use that to change in future. Maybe that's me trying to be heroic on some level. But I also can't just go forward and leave the pain aside, or try to. That would be to forget Nick, and I don't want to do that. It would also be to deny that I did anything wrong, and I believe that I did.The future has to be: better attunement with others, better listening, more compassion. People say that I do that, but ... I think there are others who have developed this skill much better than me. I can be so self-absorbed, I don't listen, even though I may appear to. I want to do better. I have been trying to do that in the last few days.The act of listening more and responding with compassion feels very possible. I know how to do that, I just don't always do it enough or when it really counts. It can turn off. But turning it on with sincerity feels like something I can do. But it feels somewhat complicated. I also don't want to cut out the parts of me that I think are "bad" and replace them with what is "good". Sometimess my self-centred parts are strong but I override them. But in doing so, it also feels like I'm shutting part of me off. I did that time and time again already throughout my life, and it only created a false self of "the good guy" - denying that I have these parts of me that are self-centred and even obnoxious. To deny those parts will lead to another collapse, just as I has in the past, when that false self disintegrates. Somehow I can't deny that I am, on some level, very selfish, and yet on another level, I am not.How the fuck do I reconcile that and be authentic, and still be better? Because i want that change in myself in honour of Nick. I really don't know. These parts of me feel so different, they feel hard to reconcile.Since I found out he killed himself. I don't know what else to say. A part of me feels I shouldn't being asking for help. I'm scared to, but I really need it.u/Arise23 has passed.He was my good friend from afar. We met here and had an instant connection.I quickly saw what a remarkable person he was. I saw his incredible capacity for love. He was passionate. He was articulate. He was very giving. He was a great listener and a great laugh. He was a fantastic advisor. He was brilliantly talented. I admired him a great deal. He taught me about male friendship. He helped me grow as a person - as a man. He helped me heal wounds from the past. He guided me.In the short time we knew each other, I came to love him as a brother. He told me he loved me, and I told him I loved him back. He called me 'King', and I called him 'King' in return.. It was a little joke, but it had a truth behind it. He deserved the title.We would talk for hours over the phone. I've never had that with another man before, ever. What a special person. I am shocked and devastated by his tragically early death. I wish that he had had the strength to continue living, but he wasn't able to pull through. I'm so sad.We would sometimes say to one another that it was quite remarkable that we had ever met - two people on different sides of the planet, with some real commonalities. Wow. Who would have known it, bro?I feel utterly blessed to have ever known him. I'm so glad that we met. I'm so glad he connected with me on line. What a joy to know him. What an absolute joy. That connection. Connection. Connection.It's all that matters. We had that. It was really strong.I bought a necklace with a King's Crown on it. Shining. Silver. A shield. I am already wearing it and I do so in his honour. Every time I look in the mirror - which I do often, and he totally did the same! - I will see that King's Crown.Goodbye, Nick. I will miss you very much. Irreplaceable....This sub. This sub introduced me and others to Nick, and other people like him. I'm so grateful."Goodnight King 💛" was the last thing he wrote to me...."Goodnight King 💛," I say in return.I just got a bit of abuse about being a narcissist. It included:*"in the case of you, you don’t even exist, you are a mirror, with no identity of itself, just a walking mirror, mirroring everyone to win them over, always in competition, always in the need to conquer…."*It motivated me to write about mirroring, which for me can be problematic, anxiety-inducing and distressing.Any insights are very welcome....I feel like the mirroring my brain does can be utterly automatic and all-encompassing. I wanna call it 'Deep Mirroring' because of the degree that - I think - it can affect my thinking and behaviour. An example would be:In any kind of writing - posts, comments, emails, texts - I very typically (and automatically) hear the other person's imagined voice in my head as I write, rather than my own. In fact, I struggle to hear my own voice in my head, and instead imagine 'their voice' or some voice they'd assume I have (or would like to have).To my mind, this affects how I write on a very fundamental level - word to word. Every aspect about my written communication can easily be 'what the other would say' or 'what I should sound like in order to be acceptable / cool / interesting' to them'. These are the key problematic aspects of this issue for me. It feels like I'm very, very good at mimicking other people's style of language and I do it to a very deep level. I can have email exchanges with other professionals, for example, where I can automatically mirror back their language style. I think I can sense that I'm using this to 'make myself appear more likeable or acceptable' to them, or to 'get what I want' or 'make a good impression.' A similar pattern can occur in person-to-person exchanges. Again, I can be with a string of people one-on-one, and very easily - if I don't keep it in check - be a very different person, mirroring the other in all sorts of ways in order to come across as *'the person wants me to be'.*I would go so far as to wonder if it's a form of Depersonalisation. It's like I partially dissociate and enter a kind of fantasy world where I'm just imagining 'what would they say?' / 'how would they put it?'I see this as totally connected to my childhood, by the way, where I learnt to mirror as a survival mechanism.Ironically, I'm trying to consider my words carefully here, because this topic is a key issue for me, and I want to make sure my description matches my experience....People have said to me that "this is normal" - and maybe it is, so hearing that again wouldn't be a bad thing. I understand that we adapt our language and behaviour with different people. I also know that idea that human beings are relational creatures - and so we become ourselves *between* one another. Again, it's about adapting in the moment to the context and the people we are with.However, what I find distressing is that, left unguarded, it feels like that my mirroring just takes over, and I completely lose my sense of self. So I can get to the end of a string of emails to different people, where I feel like I've just copied their tone and use of language - with a background hum of 'wanting to get ahead' or 'please people'. But not actually expressing myself as I would - only as I imagine they would from what I've heard or read from them....I've also had a therapist say that this shows that I have good empathy (and I actually can do). I also see it as functional and healthy to a degree. It's just he degree to which I do this that feels dysfunctional. It causes me distress because I want to have a sense of what I sound like, or how I would behave...,Some Good News:Things have improved over the years. I feel I am much more myself than I used to be. But it's still something I work on every day.One way I do this is to force myself to imagine myself speaking as I type. It takes effort for me to do this, but I find the results to be more authentic. I look back and read my writing and think, "Yeah, that's how I would say it." It feels comforting and even relaxing to feel that I've written in my 'own voice' rather than someone else's.\[ I added the bit on the end of the title to demo and practice how I speak, by the by. \]Also, in real life, I have worked a lot on not mirroring people in order to just fit in and get their approval. Instead, I am trying to speak more from how I feel or what I'm thinking. Being the vain twat that I am, this can be problematic in some situations. But even if it's inappropriate (i.e. self-sabotaging) to speak out loud what I'm thinking or feeling, I am trying to at least note what's going on inside to myself, so I can feel I'm being authentic to me even if it's not possible to do so with others in that moment.So, it's got a lot better. Thank fuck! But it's still something I struggle with....I'm all ears if anyone feels this is total crap, and I'm obsessing about nothing. Having said that, it does feel like an issue for me, and it causes me distress. Again, it's like I can almost Depersonalise and obliterate my sense of self through my communication and how I interact.All thoughts welcome. Thank you.I really can devalue my partner in my mind. I don't want that. It can also come across in my demeanour and tone of voice.It's sad. I'm trying to fight it.To other people, I can be super charming and good to be around. Friendly.I like me when I'm in those more public situations.Why aren't I like that at home?I want my partner to see that person I am to others. But he sees much more of the moody, controlling, scolding, patronising sides of me. Classic.Overall, he's a good guy and deserves much better from me. I love him. Actually, I can really adore him when I grt out of my own way. He has his big issues ... but ... he still has many more plus sides. Incredibly generous. Very entertaining and playful. Very cuddly. Argh. Narcs. Why do we always behave like twats to people closest to us? Life is short. I just want to be more happy.I am trying to confront my negative thoughts and actions. It's been an ongoing process for many years. I could still do better.I want my partner to know the friendly me more often.Or how do you regard that 'old you' before you realised / accepted your narcissism or NPD?Or maybe if you met that person today, how do you think you'd feel meeting them or being around them?What emotions come up for you when you think about that younger, unaware You?. How to you manage your anger or rage so you don't lash out at people when they are annoying or irritating to you?. How do you help yourself feel better, get into a better place?I just want to put addictive behaviour aside a moment, and any leap into grandiosity as a means of escaping. I mean ... what actually helps you get into a more calm, level-headed, steadier, non-reactive, connected mindset? That might even benefit you in the longer-term?What are the resources that support your wellbeing?. I am trying to keep my trauma in mind and body rather than push it away or forget it through all the distractions I do, all the ways I try to escape. The glossy image. The goals. The order.I woke up stressed and anxious today for no real reason. I started crying in bed. I just tried to stay with myself as the feelings were there. It was painful. Like flu, except I don't have flu. I thought it would be good to try to just stay with it and say, "It's ok to be here" rather than even try to soothe.I came downstairs and splurged in a DM to an NPD pal. The sadness was there and I cried as I wrote.I closed the laptop and did a workout. Lol.My partner woke up and call 'Hello!' from upstairs. He immediately detected the sadness in my response. "Are you down?" he said. Rather than just flipping into "Everything's fine!!!" mode, I said, "It's just my trauma stuff coming up."He called back down, offering to go and kill my Mum and Dad as a joke.He went to the bathroom and I noticed I started getting very anxious, fearful. My mind started tripping out. I realised that it was because I wanted to open up to him, but I was fearful of his response. I traced this back to what I received from my Mum when I opened up to her. Ridicule. Dismissal. Shut down. Rejection. Or my Father: well ... nothing because I could never consider talking to him about my feelings with him.That template of fear is there in my mind when I think about opening up. I will be "too much". I will be told to "get over it". I will be told to "stop myself from going too far". I will be told that I am "full of woe". I will be told that I "should be happy". My partner came downstairs and sat on the sofa with the coffee I made him. I told him I didn't want to be a burden, but that I wanted to be real about what was going on, rather than try to run away from it.He listened to me as I spoke about the issues I have with trauma, and he was very supportive in what he said. The relief was visceral. I thanked him. I was still tearful. To have that inner child meet the support that he never got in my childhood ... That's what that part of me needs.He asked me if I would feel better once my parents were dead. And I said, "Yes." He was very accepting of that.He did then say something like, "But I don't understand why you can't just say that your parents were idiots and move on." This brought up anger in me that made me feel unsteady. However, I contained it and said that it was like there were two levels to this. One was to think intellectually: Yes, my parents treated me badly. I am an adult now. I know different. I don't believe their messages. The other was the trauma itself: the disruption to my whole nervous system that is a total mind-body experience. The physical rush of fear. The intrusive and terrifying imagery that clouds my thinking. The urge to run out of the room, while at the same time being in lots of social situations where I feel that isn't an option, nor is actually telling people that this is going on. He was understanding and supportive again. I was a little bit like, "Yes. I didn't rage."I talked to him about narcissism as a coping mechanism for my trauma. I talked to him about finding solace and comfort and emotional regulation in the mirror as an example. Or in my appearance, or in my work. He was accepting and listened.Somehow we got onto my Mum's difficult behaviours, which are more the classic 'covert' type that I used to be. He criticised her behaviour, but I said that basically it was like what I was. "Remember when we went to the States with Jackie and Sharon? Do you remember in how much of a funk I was all the way through the trip?" ... "Yes. You were really hard to be with." ... "I was just very sullen a lot of the time." ... That's where my Mum can be. Pulling people down. That was me.My partner talked about there being a rock in the road, and at some point, you have to go around it and forget that it's there.I realised that I was diving a little bit into self-pity, self-obsession in the discussion, which I was actually enjoying. So I said, as a way of pulling myself out of it, "Yes. And I s'pose I can get stuck at that rock and stay there. But also ... running away and trying to forget it hasn't helped me either. ... There needs to be a middle ground where I keep it in mind but also go forward." You know, like: keep it in the rear view mirror.I said, "I think going forward, I just need to be able to say to you: 'My trauma issues are coming up. So if I act a little weird - especially in social settings - please know that I am trying my best. This is very hard to deal with, but I am trying my best." This is in regard to him often sensing that something is up with me, but trying to put it in a box when around other people. I guess because - in part - I had that tendency to pull everyone down. There are other reasons as well, but that's a fair guess in part as to why he does this. Anyway. He accepted this. In social situations, I often float off for a while to just sit on the toilet and re-centre myself for 5 minutes. Or try to. We had a friend round last night, and this happened again. The same cycle: she arrives. I feel really good to be in her warm-hearted company. After about 20 minutes, I start decaying. I can't keep up the facade. Or I try to, but underneath is a whirlwind. Total chaos. I cling to my seat.She knows about my NPD, and has been good with that. I mentioned to her a little bit that there was stuff going on last night, but it wasn't really the right situation to go further. So it was horrible. My mind shattered. I held onto the broken pieces.This morning she sent me the usual "Thank you" message. I wrote back and told her that I wasn't in a good place at all, that it wasn't her fault, but that it comes from 'nowhere'. I told her not to feel guilty, but that I just needed to now say that I struggle. I said I didn't want to hide from it anymore, as much as I can.Sorry, post-splurge. A lot has come up today. I put everything aside for once and lay in bed - not actually having a wank! - but actually dealing with my emotions....Since self-awareness, I have been actively searching for ways to integrate the narcissistic, king-wannabe side of me into my character. I had previously tried shutting or cutting him out. Or obliterating him from view. Over and over. But he remained. And would poke through in clumsy ways despite my attempts to appear "normal". Stable. But as I got to know this part inside, it turns out ... I quite like him. He's funny. So gradually, I've wanted to let him in and out to other people in appropriate ways. Not that I'm being openly superior. Actually, that part has really dwindled in my conscious mind (still there subconsciously). But it's more of the attention-seeking, competitive, self-interested, show-off side. Finding ways to reveal all that to people around me rather than the "Look! I'm The Healthiest Person Ever Promise!" face that I had been wearing. Humour has helped, by the way. I don't want to forget that wannabe-king in me. I can't. So last week, I bought a necklace online with a king's crown pendant. A silver disc with a little roughly-drawn crown in the middle. It's cartoonistic and childlike in design. Medallion-like. Small but perfect. Kind of Warrior-Viking in style. A tiny shield. I like symbols as reminders of things. I wanted to have something round my neck that reminded me of that side of me, rather than be ashamed of it, or forget it.It arrived today, a short while after that terrible distress came up in me.I looked at it and thought, "How can I wear this now? I feel the opposite. This is silly."...As the terrorised part of me relaxed, I was able to talk with another NPD friend. I related that I'd realised that while I was making headway in integrating my more narcissistic side, perhaps I wasn't doing so well with that traumatised part of me. The broken part. Sometimes after a PTSD moment, it's like I'm a broken soldier. Do you ever feel like that? Shattered? I look in the mirror and I look shattered. Tired. Raw.He too has kept on poking through the veneer despite my attempts to block him out - which include those King of the Castle behaviours.I had this feeling that I needed to be in touch with that traumatised, broken part of me, much more than I have been. That there needed to be integration of both the narc and the trauma. And maybe - if I can keep in touch with them and bring them on board to inform my day to day life - they wouldn't erupt in the ways they have been.But how to integrate these parts? They are so different. The king just LOVES to be in his castle. And the pain of that trauma is so intense....A little voice called out to me saying, 'Don't forget me! You keep forgetting me.' ... I will add that I did some psychodrama exercises in workshops and we had done a thing that was intended to get in touch with that forgotten child in us. That was earlier this year I did that.Laying in bed, I looked at that necklace pendant again. Childlike. Rough. Simple. Shiny. Mirror-Like.I had this idea that I could wear it after all, and that it could be helpful. I put it around my neck and it fell on my chest. I looked in the mirror and saw myself: that broken boy who wanted to be king.Actually, I needed it. Because of the trauma. No, it wasn't the best way to cope. But it was the way I coped as a child, and it spilled over into adulthood.It's like that little child imagined a crown to distract from the torment of a very early and unhealable trauma, which he (I) cannot remember because it happened too early. There were many other traumas that are remembered easily. But that early distress. ... Only terrifying feelings and flashes in the mind. It was too much to bear. Absolute shame. So the child sought out anything he could to confirm to him that he was in fact good, able and whole. Stable. Strong. On his journey to his imagined destiny as king he was Prince Charming, he was the Solider, he was the Wizard (at the piano), he was the Tyrant, he was the Grandiose Lover ... He had his whole castle built around him, including a dungeon where he sometimes could hear screams but shut them out. He had his minstrels to entertain him. He had his Joker. He had his Merlin. (Thank God for Merlin. The ultimate Healthy Adult). And he had his demons, who haunted him, tortured him at night.That's me. I'm looking in the mirror right now, and that's who I see: the broken boy who wanted to be king.And this is me in the aftermath. When the castle crumbled.It's raining heavily outside....Broken. Charming. Competitive. Embarrassed. Witty. Terrified. Haunted. Attention-Seeking. Easily Enraged. Insightful (thanks, [Merlin](https://www.reddit.com/user/Elongated_Mayonnaise/)). Stupid. Warrior-like. Fragile. ... I could go on.I think - I hope - this pendant could do a good job in helping me remind myself of all those parts. I want to remember it all.&#x200B;. I feel he saw me as weak, feeble, effeminate, less than he wanted from a son. Not what he'd hoped for.True or not, that is what I felt as a child and teen. And adult.As a child, I saw my body in the mirror and I wanted it to change. Be better. I wanted the "effeminate parts" to be sliced off and trimmed down. Tucked away. Strapped down. I wanted to be more masculine in my appearance. As an adult, I've gone to great lengths to give the impression to my father that I'm in control and strong. Able. Fine. A man....I see myself through his eyes. I'm constantly propping up the appearance that everything is ok.Lying on the bed now, I see myself in the mirror opposite. Feelings of disgust and ridicule. Aversion. And real weakness. Unloved. A frightened and lonely child.Too much of this. Too little of that.There is an urge to shift position and look more appealing to that part of me. But I stay.There have been little tears. I wonder if this is the right thing to do. Cry. Is that enough?..Sigh ... The thing is ... I actually also like some of those behaviours I do to appear more like my father wanted me to look, and I don't really want to give them up. Like. working out and having a masculine figure. I like it. I know that it's caught up in misperception, but I don't want to stop it.It's confusing. I don't quite know how to reconcile the misperception and the enjoyable behaviour.. Because underneath the glossy veneer, and looking like I've got everything sorted, is a feeling of distress in my body that feels so intense and all-encompassing, has overwhelmed me many times before, and I'm terrified of feeling it again. It feels like everything is going to fall apart.*Checks mirror.*Edit: The distress appeared again. It is like my whole world falling apart. Images of my mother shouting at me, chaotically. Right up in my face. In my ears. Screaming at me. Or running wild int he house. Or in distress herself. Fighting my father. He laughs. She screams. It feels like everything is going to shatter. The imagery is intense and for a split second I feel that it could be real. I see my Mum dead on the bed or on the floor. Again and again I have this. This is the distress.. I was talking with a friend of mine about vulnerability and NPD. I noticed a thing I do in writing posts here where I craft them- semi-subconsciously - so I can't let people in. It's like: quasi-vulnerability. It's there, but behind a shiny glass wall that I also put up as a distraction. To counteract that, I thought I'd just post the message I sent them and see what comes up - or not.&#x200B;Oh God... Exposure!&#x200B;"Hey... I'm thinking just now about what you said about not liking being vulnerable. Well ... I have my own expression of this. I noticed that when I post, I tell myself that I'm 'being vulnerable'. And in part, I do think I share vulnerabilities. But ... I present it in a way that is quite closed off. It's like I introduce the vulnerability I notice in myself, and then use the post to work through it and find some resolution. This has a few functions. I sort myself out BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE AND SAYS SOMETHING ANNOYING THAT I ALREADY KNOW! It's also got that function of 'being impressive' and 'heroic' and a 'leader'. Lol.The idea that I might write a post that is totally vulnerable and leaves it open for question and confrontation - even discussion apart from 'Well done, Peanut! I love you!' feels ... like something I don't want to do! Lol. But ... I notice, too, that in the posts I make where I don't close it off so much, there is much more interaction with people I don't usually hear from, and the discussions are helpful and interesting, and there's more connection - which I also want.So ... something to think about and work on.". My partner and I went to the theatre last night to see La Cage Aux Folles.It's basically a show about gays and drag queens. Lol. That's my summary. I've seen it about 4 million times.The audience was noticeably a load of ol' gay men - including us. (It happens at these kinds of shows. All the gays come out for our catwalk.)...**INTERVAL**The men had to queue for the loo. Usually that's something the ladies roll their eyes over while we toddle by with a smug little dance.But with all the lads out for the show, it was like queuing for the Gents at a gay bar. 😁Standing in that queue (we Brits love a queue), half-eyeing-up the oversized beards, muscles and flowery shirts around me, I felt really comfortable. Like being held. Safe. A feeling of belonging.I like being part of this group....Gay men are funny creatures. It's interesting from an NPD angle.There's a kind of narcissism that's normalised, okay and even celebrated as part of 'gay culture'. You can call is body fascism etc. But it doesn't have to be taken so seriously. There's a playful vanity, grandiosity, a cheeky bitchiness, hierarchical thinking, and a constant hum of flirtation and potential for sex. A lot of it can be wrapped up in a naughty humour and glint in the eye. Last weekend we went to a housewarming of a female friend. She has loads of gay male friends, and at one point in the garden, it was just us lot chatting like gay men do. It's different. It's fun. It's flirty. I like it.And the same thing happened. I felt a sense of belonging and okayness. I relaxed. I felt I could be more myself. I discovered myself, in fact.I don't actually have many other gay friends in my life, so it felt refreshing....There's a layer of shame you grow up with as a homosexual lad. I'm 40, so it might be better now in the UK. But in 90s rural Essex, it wasn't what you needed to be to survive.Once when I was about six (?), I sprung into the kitchen wearing a purple beret tilted to the side. I was beaming with a smile, wanting to show my Mum and Dad my little dance.They were both sitting at the kitchen table. My Dad didn't say anything but looked stern. My Mum scolded at me: "Take that beret off! Other people will think you are queer!"I removed my hat and my little self from the kitchen....The shame sticks around.It forms the near-invisible template in your psyche, reminding you how to behave and what to expect from people if you are 'yourself'. You are so used to it, you don't even notice it's there.It affects relationships. My partner, now 49, is still uneasy about us touching each other at all in public, even in central London. It makes me sad, but I understand it and respect it. I still go to cuddle him. He pulls away saying, 'No! You don't know how people will behave here. We could be beaten up!" 💛Hidden shame is probably the reason why I don't have many gay friends, actually. My parents' voices very subtly steering me away from being associated with gay men.It's there in how you hold yourself, how you feel inside as you meet with others. It is the driver behind the reflection-checking as you walk down the street. Without it, you don't feel the urge to check so much.It's there in how I am around other men, whom I had a fear of when I was younger. It's because I experienced so much belittling and abuse from straight men in the past. So I expect them to recoil and look down on me. Expect me to do and be less-than. Or threaten me. Or actually beat me up.(Fuck you, Matthew Parkinson, you fat, lowlife cunt.)...Looking around the theatre audience last night and watching the show, I felt a kind of pride. It's really just a kind of 'okayness' and ease in my body and mind. Actually, it's also a kind of joy for being who I am.It was cool to be part of all the over-groomed beards, cheeky side-glances, unnecessarily large biceps, and over-thought shirt n' socks combos.Yeah. This is me....This morning, I did my workout in front of the mirror as usual. 😁 Headphones on. [The Best of Times](https://youtu.be/vUqiM4c1oWA). The most famous song from 'La Cage' is 'I Am What I Am'. It was performed so brilliantly last night. Lost of people cried. The lyrics fit really well here, in this sub.But The Best of Times is my favourite.Fuck it!&#x200B;*The best of times is now,**What's left of summer but a faded rose?**The best of times is now,**As for tomorrow well: Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?*&#x200B;*So hold this moment fast,**And live and love as long as you know how.**And make this moment last,**Because the best of times is now.*&#x200B;I lifted my weights (upped two 2kgs yesterday, woop-woop!). I lip-synced along to the song on repeat. I did some super jazz hands. I enjoyed my cheeky grin.I imagined my little self dancing with me with his little purple beret. I showed him how to move. I let him free in my mind. He was happy. I was the parent he didn't have. He needed. A bit of [imagery rescripting](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental-Health-Professionals/Sleep/Sleep---Information-Sheets/Sleep-Information-Sheet---06---Imagery-Rescripting.pdf) there. A few little tears came up as the song played again.I'm proud of that little boy with his special dance. No shame....I need more gay men in my life. We all do....I love this [comedy sketch](https://youtu.be/cOESpIz8Mjg), by the by. From Catherine Tate. She's not Irish, but does a great accent, and impression.Chuckle....I know I'm talking about being a gay man. But I hope some things can translate and find their own usefulness to anyone with NPD.It's that experience of being shamed for who we are, of hiding and pretending to survive. Or that inner critic that haunts us like a shimmering ghost, lurking in the corner of our eye.And the joy is re-discovering our selves and being comfortable in who we are, despite what we were taught, and whoever we may be.You know, the rainbow flag is an amazing thing: 🏳️‍🌈. People keep saying "collapse" and I'm like, "What?" ... "You simply mean depression. Sadness."But today: I get it.With NPD in charge, everything is done just to prop up the self away from what is painful - or void - underneath.Today that sugar-crystal dome completely collapsed and I am in the under....OK, Narc OverLord: I get it. Lesson learned. ⛈⚡🌩The distance between the shell and the core is too great. The balloon is too big. Its skin is too thin.Pop....Looking back, my house of cards has gotten too big many times. It has collapsed often. The worst was in my early-mid 30s. I told myself I would be incredibly successful after studying at a prestigious college. Guaranteed. Genius.I wasn't. I put my whole self in that basket. When the ship didn't come in, I wanted to jump off the pier....Today isn't like that. But I see again how I have been propping myself up recently with my twigs and spit, thinking they were cast iron and concrete.Well, the wind blew in and knocked my scaffold over.I also see how I so want to prop up that scaffold again rather than deal with the dodgy foundations and structure.Dear OverLord of the Narcs (aka u/MudVoidSpark), What is my next lesson? I am listening.🌩⚡⛈. It's coming up to about a year since I started finally accepting my narcissism (having been in denial for a couple of years before), leading to then getting an NPD diagnosis / confirmation from a specialist.Quite a journey. Luckily it's involved a lot of self-reflection, otherwise it would've been boring!It's like the ground underneath completely broke open (drama!) and I went through a kind of self-reconfiguration: a breakdown of the persona I had built up for so long, coupled with a poking-through and eruption of all these different aspects of myself that I'd hidden away.It was initially - and for a long while - disturbing. A lot to handle psychologically. "What is this in me? ... Is this real or fake? ... Who the fuck am I?" ... My mind felt like it was in pieces.But (more drama!) I ploughed on through the oncoming winds.Gradually, a more stable sense of self has emerged: certain sides of me keep popping up again and again, more spontaneously, it seems, without clear reference to others so much. I also notice that in conversations, I feel increasingly like a separate person from others, in the way I talk, write or present myself, interests and ideas, opinions. Other people have their moves. I have mine. Yes, there is some merging and blurring, but we are quite different. I'm not trying to br like them or the way think they want me to be. I don't feel so much of the urge to mirror as I did. I feel I have some kind of self to fall back on when I get disrupted. He keeps re-appearing. And I've found myself more assertive, looking people in the eye when I want to speak about something (usually involving some Powerpoint about Schema Therapy)....I'm about to go on a Skype call with my Dad, who lives in another country. I spent my whole life pretty much being a yes-sir, no-sir, three-bags-full-sir kind of son. I would present myself in the way I thought my Dad wanted me to look, talk and behave - even think. ... I did that habitually from a young age as a way of coping with my Dad's terrific temper that could turn on like a switch; his threats of violence - or actual violence.Today, just before the call, I thought: "What a good opportunity to show up as myself."It's not as sudden a shift as I'm making it: I've been showing up more and more, I think, as different from the son I've assumed he wanted me to be. But today: I feel confident to turn up and be as I am, disagree with him ... Just not turn into that smiling face hiding a whirlwind of difficult emotions underneath. I don't feel I have to do that any more.So we met up. I can say he is remarkably brave, emotionally intelligent and articulate in expressing his feelings.I think he's gonna be just fine. Especially if he listens to the incredible advice from old blokes like me. 😁But watch out. Not so fast! u/moldbellchains can smell the grandiosity from down the road, fellas! Fuck!!!Yep, that's not Dior whateveritis, that's me!But he took a pin and popped my self-inflated ego-bubble when it showed up, and in such a healthy and considered way. He stood up for his feelings when they were being pushed aside by my emotional bulldozer mode, and got me thinking anew how grandiosity can have a negative impact on people....There were actual tears, and it was super. Human. A wonderful moment.We had a real connection. And when the moment felt right, we sat on a bench and had a very long hug.A hug that extends to everyone.
    The flair is most definitely wrong but Idk which one I should choose. This is so funny I literally cannot believe this. Recently I’ve been trying to use AI to apologize to people, show empathy, etc. I send the message I received to AI & it gives me several ways of how I can respond. I copy paste whichever one I like most, edit it a little to make it sound “human” & send it. It works. It fucking works I’m dead on the floor. I get a good image because of a robot💀. “I’m glad you’ve understood your mistake” “I’m glad you could be mature for once” etcetc. Please how is this real. I have even tried memorizing some AI’s ways of “showing empathy” and applying them irl & it worked too. An acquaintance broke down in front of me, so I js followed the script & she said I was so considerate towards her. What are the downsides of this I wonder & for how long will I be able to deceive people this way. I’ve seen many fakers say that their “alters” have almost killed them & while I know it’s not possible to die in headspace but is it possible for an alter to actually try & put the body in a life threatening situation?. I fucking detest her. I will feel bad abt writing this later but I have never talked about this openly since I knew I’d hear smth among the lines of “Oh how could you!! She is your sister” wah wah wah. I’m allowed to hate her. She is a kid. She has never done anything to me & yet I still detest her. I don’t hug her. Get annoyed with her presence. Lash out at her & frankly speaking feel nothing towards her other than plain hate or just nothingness. I hate the fact that my parents “learned from their mistakes” and raise her slightly fucking differently than me. They gave her more attention, she receives more emotional presence (if that makes sense?) than I ever did. I keep getting “Oh share this! Share that w her!! She is your sister” well fuck that. I don’t give a single fuck about who she is to me relationship wise as that doesn’t change the way I feel about her. My father keeps feeding me this bullshit he was fed as a child called “Well, you two are siblings!! You should love each other!” which makes me hate her even more. These constant attempts to get me to love her make me sick to my stomach, they enrage me. How fucking dare you rob me off of everything I could have. How fucking dare anyone tell ME who to love or how I should feel about someone. Fuck you. Fuck all of you.I want to kms. I’m never doing any of ts again. I trusted the ppl here who told me it’d be all good if I was honest with someone and look at where that got me. I am now THE asshole, the second Judas and the world’s biggest enemy that should be publicly executed. I’m also “ignorant, the way you express your annoyance is childish, talk like an actual adult for once” and oh I also “don’t care about anything”. Did I mention that part where he ghosted me for a week, came back & said “I didn’t want another annoyance on my plate” while talking to everybody else around which lit means that every fucking body is better than me now apparently.Genuinely though this js made my boat sink even deeper. My week has been a load of shit and now I also have this slapped in my face. Feel like someone just poured a bucket full of dirt and shit on me. Basically, it’s easier for me to gift you something to show you that I care about you and love you rather than show any of that in other ways such as saying “I love you”, spending time w the other person, using physical contact of any sort, giving emotional intimacy & so on. I have a feeling I “inherited” this from my father who was absent almost my entire life bc of his work & would compensate for it with gifts. Even if he had free time he’d js buy me smth to dismiss me 💀💀 saying this feels so cringe & embarrassing how gross. I’ve been thinking about his for a few days and noticed this pattern a few days ago too. All the people I’ve dated or took interest in were either severely depressed, had attachment issues, have been abused previously, had bpd, suicidal tendencies and so on. I can’t recall a single time I’ve dated someone who wouldn’t have any of the listed above and the thing is I can’t even tell if I had any romantic interest in those people or just wanted to be seen as their “savior” and their only way out. So many of these people depended on me emotionally while some of them begged for me to stay, begged for my attention or uplifted me so much that it got me abnormally euphoric. I could do practically whatever I wanted to most of these people except for one. I could ghost & come back, gaslight & make them cut everyone I didn’t like off, have an impact on their opinions & change their opinions in a way that’d be convenient for me, etc. With that being said, I keep meeting people that are similar to the ones I’ve described above. I’m not purposely looking for them yet they always happen to be around me. Is this a common experience?? And does anyone else have a similar thing?. And I mean the ones that don’t glamorize or stigmatize NPD. I want to see a realistic portrayal of the disorder for once. It’s like these people feel better about themselves offering me a hand while looking down on me. Does it make them feel like a knight in shining armor? It feels humiliating to hear someone ask if I need help. It’s as if I looked that feeble that you thought i need *your* help n the way this help is always served to me in this infantilizing manner makes me want to either rip my hair out or yell. I can’t be the only one who feels this way about people offering you help.Frankly speaking I’m not sure if what I’m about to describe is “suicidal” but mb I’m wrong. I js think that if my shame, my guilt, if I get too much for myself to handle one day I can always just kill myself. If I ever get confronted or exposed I can kill myself. If life gets too inconvenient n there will be no longer ppl around me who admire me & validate my only existence I can always kill myself. If the “nothingness” gets too overwhelming to deal with I can always end this. This way of thinking gives me a sense of control over my life. Not only that but also a sense of freedom as I will always have a choice of either continuing or ending this now & here with no one being capable of stopping me.I got into a huge argument with a close friend who also happened to be my supply. The argument lasted for days with me ignoring her for a day or half a day to avoid taking any responsibility and confrontation. I’m unsure of whether or not the point of the argument matters here, however I’ll give a brief explanation of what happened. My (now ex i guess) friend has an anxiety disorder accompanied by depression. Her anxiety worsens in public or when her surroundings mention other people they keep contact with as she has a low self-esteem and gets paranoid over being replaced. With all of that being said, I was fully aware of everything mentioned above and yet I kept doing shit that would worsen her mental state consciously. It has gotten to a point where her therapy sessions started revolving around me as now I was her problem. Throughout the said argument I’ve tried to brush her feelings off + I lied several times to avoid getting her emotions pinned onto me and be the cause of the said conflict when objectively I knew I was. Our argument yesterday ended with her saying that she’s done with trying to appeal to my narcissistic ass n me blocking her which I think I regret doing. I have unblocked her and attempted to say smth but then deleted the msgs and blocked her again as it felt humiliating to unblock her and moreover try to apologize. I would like to apologize and have a normal conversation but she has already blocked me on every social media n I’m in another city on a vacation rn, so I can’t meet up with her. My problem is that to apologize I’d need to overcome my ego that gets butthurt over the fact that I’ll need to unblock someone, admit I was wrong, take responsibility and actually communicate for once and I don’t know how to do any of that without lashing out.
    I feel like there's something blocking me from expressing myself, like it's hard to feel comfortable when talking to people. Everytime I talk to people (with a few exceptions) I feel like no one afterwards, like I was sucked away. I always feel so tired. I always feel drained of life. I never feel fully into a conversation. I always imagine having these perfect conversations but in reality they aren't as good as the ones in my fantasies. I do want to talk to people (or maybe I just want a connection) but my anxiety/detachment kills it. What is wrong with me?. So a misunderstanding happened and it ended with me holding back tears. Everyone noticed and now I'm very embarrassed with myself for letting myself cry in front of them and also I'm worried about how they perceive me now. Right now I regret everything.Season 4 was a little off. The plot didn't really match the tone of the show as a whole. If you line up the plots of season one, two, and three with the plot of season four, then you notice how different they are and how they don't mix well at all. I get that they were going for a whodunnit type plot, but it really clashed. The seasons before were about joe stalking people and/or him going up against crazy people like Love. This didn't have any of that unless you count joe stalking Rhys which is something I will criticize later in this post. Season 4 was just missing the vibe that the other seasons had. Season 4 was also extremely unrealistic to the point that some of the enjoyability was lost. Sure, you can say that seasons 2 and 3 were pretty unrealistic, but they still weren't unrealistic to the extent that season 4 was. I also have to critique the love interest of this season. Kate and Joe just didn't have the same spark that Joe had with beck, love, and even Marianne. Kate just didn't seem to be Joe's type. And sure, you can say that Joe will fantasize about anyone regardless of who they are, but he is still looking for certain things in a person. He wants excitement, the chase, to feel understood, the "perfect relationship", someone to save. Alot of that I felt was missing in Kate and Joe's relationship. And him stalking Rhys felt a little fake. I know he's a stalker and he's obsessive, but I don't think he's the type of stalker to watch Rhys's every moves for hours a day, he's the type who goes to work, looks normal, and stalks on the side of all that, it's not his ENTIRE thing. The dissociation seemed unrealistic. I don't know how realistic it is, someone who knows more can tell me in the comments. The dissociation seemed dramatized, fake, and a little out of character. You'd think you would've seen more dissociation from Joe in the earlier seasons. My guess is that the writers ran out of ideas after love, one of their most exciting characters,was gone. The Marianne thing seemed a little out of character too. I mean, he would definitely stalk her like he always does, but maybe not the other things he did. Him creating a stalker for himself was stupid. If his hallucinations and delusions were anywhere near realistic, then it would probably cause problems with functioning, like him talking to "Rhys" at his job for example. The motives for the murders were also stupid. Joe's character also went down the drain. This season really lost its point. This show was supposed to be about stalking. It was supposed to scare you because this ordinary looking guy could stalk an average person, like you. This season was thrown together and it was clear that the writers ran out of ideas. Everything just felt weird. I give this season a 3/10.Ok so I want to make a vegan cheese out of cashew milk (any kind of plant milk works) and I want to try and make it without thickeners (no agar agar please) and without coconut oil (I have seen that in recipes way too much). Could someone educate me on any ways I could make this work? Maybe about the process of regular cheesemaking and any recipes that worked for them.These two terms are not interchangeable. Vulnerable narcissism is not defined by it being "sneaky" or "covert". It's a particular state of npd where there person's defences are not intact, making them vulnerable to threats to self esteem. Besides, there are overt and covert expressions of vulnerability and grandiosity, so the labeling is misguided. I think calling it covert narcissism adds to the stigma. It makes it look like it's just all the "dirtiness" that comes with narcissism, but hidden under a mask. It fuels the "signs your (insert person here) is a narcissist phenomenon. The label is also inaccurate. Please call it vulnerable narcissistism instead.Ok so I have these two roommates/friends and they have seen a "self" that I want to forget. I feel like they are living reminders of all of the things I want to forget and it's making me hate them. I am very, very ashamed about the things they saw and I am ashamed around them in general. I live with these people and because of my current situation, I don't think that I can move out soon. I feel like they have an image of me that's set in stone and I can't change it no matter what. They don't seem to make an effort to understand me and I feel like they are condescending to me in general. All of this is a problem because it's wreaking hell on my mental health. They have made some comments to me relating to my past and each time I have had a MAJOR collapse that lasts for a week or more. The last one was really, really bad. During that collapse, I was thinking about how defective I was, how I wasn't going to survive in this world, how everyone thinks and has always thought badly of me, and how I should just get rid of myself forever. One of the worst collapses I've had. Being around them can be very,very painful. Could anyone tell me what I can do besides telling them to move out. I don't know if I can take this anymore.Vegans of reddit, what's the stupidest excuse you've heard for not going vegan?. Fantasies are the only things which make living in this world even remotely tolerable. Sometimes I feel like I'm going insane, my life is empty, my relationships are unfulfilling, I'm around someone I resent a lot of the time, I don't like my coworkers, I hate the world I live in, I don't know who am because of my pd, I have to hide myself in my relationship, reality is limited, I am limited. I just hate reality so much. I don't even understand how someone could be happy. The world leaves us vulnerable. Everything can fall in a second and you have to watch yourself constantly. Don't cut the vegetables the wrong way, otherwise you might lose a finger. Don't turn the wrong way on the street otherwise you might get into a wreck. Have to do everything right just to live another day in this wonderful reality. Like, how do people not crack? How do people not descend into their fantasies? I'm losing my mind. I feel so powerless.1 cup of anger3 cups of shameMixMove to social setting (you can choose from a group, a romantic partner, friends; it doesn't matter because the recipe always turns out the same)9 tbsp perceived rejection12 tbsp after-event depressionMix these wet ingredients*Note: you may find some excess trauma in the mixes, do not touch it; you will regret it.Additional after-event ingredients: 3 tbsp humiliation1/4 cup regret1/2 cup questioning of one's existence3/4 cup suicidality 1/8 cup impulsivity8 cups of more shameMix all ingredients*Note the shame-rage mixture might become volatile and ruin relationships; allow to rest.Repeat.

Like if someone's sad in response to something you said you say to yourself that they're not that sad.Or is it more of not caring about other people's feelings?. Ok so I think I may have NPD or some traits of it. I will list some reasons why I think I may have NPD:1. I HEAVILY rely on fantisies ( I actually think about myself like this almost all the time) so I can idealize myself.2. I go from thinking I am better than everyone and comparing myself to other people to thinking I am worthless and deserve to die or something like that3. If there is one thing that I heavily base my self esteem off of (smarts, being able to make anyone like me ) that turns out not to be true, I have a breakdown. Like, I literally feel SOOO uncomfortable with myself and because of this, I can't go into my fantasy world which I need/use so much, making the breakdown all the more worse.4. I had an upbringing where my parents fought all the time (tried to kill each other, but for awhile I got used to it), I was in contact with the legal system all the time) I felt like my mom looked down on me ( in a pitying oh she's so pathetic, poor thing way) and my dad relied on me for emotional support like there was no tomorrow ages 6-11 ( also called parentification) and neglected me from the ages of 0-5. When ever I testified in court ( I was 11 when I testified, about the time my parents got the most violent towards each other) about who I would live with, my mom and dad ( in a much more covert way) CONSTANTLY guilt-tripped me into picking them ( I remember a conversation with my mom and I had after I went out with my dad, she basically said that I was a bad person for "choosing dad", I was 10 by the way.5. I had serious codependecy issues when I was 10, I "dated" someone who was abusive and said things like "go fuck yourself" toward the end ( he felt insulted) when my mom broke up with him for me (over text, so he thought it was me). And then he went off to his little friends and a called me a bitch and told his friends his version of the story to make them hate me, it worked. I was bullied, but in a different way than you expect ( spreading rumors, gossiping about me). All of this made me develop social anxiety and being paranoid and distrustful.6. When I was 11 I felt like a completely different person, like a switch had been flipped. I was VERY envious, angry, resentful, very easily offended, had a serious victim complex, wrathful, and hateful. I was angry because I felt like the world was against me, that someone like that could win and I would always lose, that everything I wanted depended on people who had all the power in the world against me, that people could do whatever they wanted to me and they would never be punished, not even by me.....7. When I was 11 1/2 the issues above continued but I had one more thing to deal with, on top of him and his friends, severe depression and suicidal thoughts. I had to deal with these because I was grieving over the loss of a childhood that I never had and never will, but I couldn't face that fact, I turned to delusions.8. When I was 12 I had assigned myself the mission of defeating him (socially). But it was different than from the time I had been 11 1/2, it was like another switch had been flipped, one of constant happiness seeking, and self- esteem ( more like grandiosity) seeking. I was not depressed, I was not hateful, I did not feel unloved, I felt no pain, I just felt high. High from everything I had been doing to feel good, high because in my mind, if could be just as bad as him (which made me feel good), I could be his equal ( because he taught me that was what an equal was), we could be bad together, I thought.9. My empathy works a little different: Whenever I see someone who is going through what I went through, I have empathy, but I have to be in their emotional state myself at the exact same time, otherwise I have no idea what they are feeling and cannot empathise. Or, I am going through a breakdown and disregard other people's emotions.10. I think of myself in the 3rd person often ("oh she's so amazing")11. I feel attacked and lash out at people who make feel socially stupid ( I am EXTREMELY insecure about this, and will literally think of killing myself if I feel like that).12. I self harm and have mood swings13. I have a lot of paranoia sometimes14. I like it when people feed my victim complex.15. I feel entitled to be mean and passive aggressive when I'm angry.16. I feel VERY uncomfortable with love and confessing any emotion to anyone.17. I don't percieve someone as the same person I normally would when I am angry with them.18. I go from idealizing other people and not thinking highly of them quickly19. I have a very unstable view of other people, if they do one thing that looks even a little suspicious, I question their entire character.20. Sometimes when I have breakdowns, I question my sanity, my view of reality and my character21. feelings of emptiness. Share the circumstances in which you have empathy and how much of it, then tell me if you think npds generally lack empathy or not.Please help me, I feel so humiliated. I just got rejected and I want to tear something up. Or start doing self destructive things like cutting myself.Ok so I think I may have NPD or some traits of it. I will list some reasons why I think I may have NPD:1. I HEAVILY rely on fantisies ( I actually think about myself like this almost all the time) so I can idealize myself.2.

    Hi. Ich W (33) möchte mich doch mal vorstellen. Vor allen würden mich aber Erfahrungen interessieren, denn ja irgendwie komme ich nicht mit den Dingen klar die geschehen sind. Irgendwie fühle ich mich alleine und sitzen gelassen und immer noch völlig inkompatibel in der "Welt" zu leben. Es belastet mich nach wie vor enorm. Ich hatte fest vor dieses Kapitel abzuschließen, mir zu sagen dass ich das Leben gewählt habe und es im Grunde auch nie etwas zu verlieren gab.Ich habe unter dieser Gemeinschaft meine ganze Kindheit verbracht, wurde von meinen Eltern immer überall mitgeschleppt und mir wurde stehts eine angeblich heile Welt vorgespielt. Immer waren wir alle Brüder und Schwestern, obwohl wir uns gegeneinander teils absolut nicht leiden konnten. Es war normal dass man nett und zuvorkommend zu wem war und später in deren Abwesenheit mit anderen über sie gelästert hat. Es war normal dass man Menschen dafür abgewertet hat dass sie vielleicht weniger im Dienst gingen oder von ihren Ehepartner verlassen wurden. Es war okay plötzlich die besten Freunde auszuschließen, für vermeintlich einfachste vergehen. Mir wurde beigebracht dass Homosexualität etwas ganz schlimmes wäre und wie man diese am besten verachtet. Es wurde geklatscht wenn es alle taten, egal ob es einen gefiel oder nicht. Jeden Freitag wurde etwas aus den Unterredungsbuch besprochen, quasi die Manipulationsanleitung für die Öffentlichkeit. Ständig wurde so getan als ob der Dienst für Jehovas das einzig Wahre wäre und der heilige Geist einen stets stärken würde wenn wir nur daran glauben. Es war schlecht zu masturbieren, denn Jehova möge sowas nicht. Wenn man in der Schule gemobbt geschlagen und ausgeschlossen wurde, dann lag es nie an mir selbst, nein es lag daran dass ich eine Zeugin Jehovas war. Alles was ich gemacht habe war negativ, nie gut genug. Im ernst, diese Gesellschaft hat mich geprägt und das stark im negativen.Im Gegensatz zu meinen Geschwistern hatte ich keine Freunde, sondern war stehts ein Anhängsel was mitgeschleppt wurde. Sehr negativ für mich war meine Berufsausbildung, wo mein Ausbilder ebenfalls ein Zeuge Jehovas war. Es war die schlimmste Zeit in meinen Leben, in der ich lernte was es bedeutet Menschen tief zu hassen. Ich war nie gut und es wurde so viel von einen gefordert und Druck aufgebaut der mich zu eine absolute Einzelgängerin machte die einfach nur um ihr Leben kämpfte. Mein Vater meint heute dass er mich ja so unterstützt hätte und es ja so mein Wunsch gewesen wäre dass ich das mache. Er verdreht es so sehr dass es mich aggressiv macht. Er, genau er war es der mir sagte dass er mit Schmach rechnet wenn ich es nicht schaffe und dass ich es durchziehen soll. Sein Spruch "mit Schmach kann er leben" bezog sich auf die Versammlung. Ständig bekam man die Verantwortung dass das eigene Verhalten alle beeinflusst. Ständig hab ich mich schlecht gefühlt, weil ich nie das sein konnte was von mir verlangt wurde.Eigentlich habe ich mit 22 gedacht dass wenn ich mich Löse, ich es lerne wirklich ich selbst zu sein und zu leben. Inzwischen habe ich alle Bibeln und Religiösen Bücher zerrissen und wollte sie nicht mehr sehen. Ich habe endlich angefangen zu schauen was ich an Kleidung, Hobbys mag ohne mich dafür zu schämen.Was soll ich sagen?Meine Eltern sind nach wie vor aktiv. Sie haben mir auch später noch mehrfach gezeigt wie unwichtig ich ihnen bin. Ich kann ihnen nicht mehr vertrauen und sehe sie vielleicht ein mal im Jahr. Eine Zeit lang habe ich noch mit meinen Vater über Whats App geredet, aber eigentlich nur auf die "wie gehts, wie ist das Wetter?" Basis. Immer wenn ich versuche mehr preiszugeben wertet er mich konsequent ab. Meine Geschwister sind beide ebenfalls aus der Gemeinschaft raus, aber keiner hält wirklich noch mit mir Kontakt. Meine Schwester ist verheiratet und hat Kinder. Von ihrer Hochzeit mit einen völlig unbekannten wusste ich erst 2 Wochen nach dem sie geschehen war, davor dachte ich dass sie und ich uns gemeinsam unterstützen und stehts in allen vertrauen würden. Sie zog weiter weg und der Kontakt wurde immer weniger. Mein Bruder und ich waren früher nach meinen Erinnerungen wirklich eng verbunden. Heute sind wir wie Tag und Nacht und er scheint es vergessen zu haben dass ich überhaupt existiere.Die Familie wäre ja eine Sache, aber die andere für mich viel deprimierende Seite ist dass ich mich nie wirklich irgendwo integrieren konnte. Ich habe nie Freundschaften pflegen, geschweige denn irgendwo eine Verbindung aufbauen können. Ich schaffe es kaum mir zu sagen dass es Menschen gibt die mich wirklich mögen. Ich kann nicht wirklich sehen wem ich vertrauen kann und wer mir böses will. Seit 3 Jahren Lebe ich mit meinen Freund zusammen, der meine erste Beziehung und auch meine einzige intime Erfahrung darstellt, weil ich es nie gelernt habe jemanden zu vertrauen, oder was es heißt einen Menschen zu lieben. Er liebt und unterstützt mich, aber wir haben definitiv Probleme wenn es um Nähe geht, da er diese aus welchen Grund auch immer nicht zulassen kann (anderes Laster). Ich bin extrem unzufrieden damit.Beruflich und sozial fühle ich mich wie eine Versagerin. Ich habe versucht mich weiterzubilden und scheitere an den eigenen Ansprüchen. Ich weiß bis heute nicht was meine Berufung früher gewesen wäre. Studieren durfte ich im Gegensatz zu meinen Bruder nicht. Ich vergleiche mich immer wieder, weil genau das früher ein wesentlicher Bestandteil war.Ich habe das Gefühl dass das Leben an mir vorbei zieht. Ich werde älter und bin am Ende kein Stück weiter. Seit einen Jahr bin ich in Psychotherapie und muss sagen dass ich auch jetzt noch kaum wirklich sehe wie ich aus dieser Spirale raus komm. Ich glaube inzwischen dass ich irgendwie lernen muss damit zu leben. Ich kann meine Verhaltensweisen nicht ablegen, ich kann einfach nicht der Mensch sein der ich sein sollte.Ich finde es wirklich schlimm wie wenig es der Gesellschaft interessiert wenn Kinder in totalitären Gemeinschaften aufwachsen müssen und keine Wahl haben. Die psychischen Folgen werden einfach herabgespielt. Es wird so getan als sei es einfach eine Religionsgemeinschaft wie jede andere auch. Es hat sich niemand in der Schule wirklich bemüht mir zu helfen, obwohl klar war dass es mir verdammt schlecht ging.Wie war der Ausstieg bei euch? Fühlt ihr euch wo zugehörig, Zuhause und angekommen?. I've randomly touched on this topic again and again in posts. I always think about the relationship with my partner. Yes, it's a chat story and I thought for a long time whether it belonged here, but I think it's the best place. The best place to understand my thoughts.In one of the recent discussions about relationships and cheating, a lot of things came up.I don't really know if I lack empathy or have other reasons for not understanding it, but it really concerns me.My boyfriend and I have been living together for over 3.5 years now. Somehow it was a damn long and wonderful time, even though I had so many ups and downs and there were several difficulties in our environment, starting with the Corona pandemic that immediately followed, some jealous neighbors and finally the quick death of both of his parents.He now takes over almost all of the household chores without it bothering him. He helps me with my car and all other technical problems. He lends me money when I need something and occasionally gives me gifts. We go on vacation together, sleep in the same bed, kiss and hold each other. Yes, I really benefit a lot from it.From the outside it seems like we're really perfect for each other, but inside me it's building up more and more because unfortunately we're completely missing one thing. Real intimacy and sex. We do it every few months, if at all, and even then I find it unsatisfactory. I overcome myself and talk to him again and again and he apologizes, says he wants to improve, but it hardly changes anything.Now I tell him to his face that I no longer believe that things will ever be different and what can I say, I'm just right so far. I keep wanting to put the gun to his chest, but then some new shit keeps happening. I'm also afraid that when I'm alone again I won't have any help anymore. I still feel completely unattractive and abandoned. I feel trapped in front of everyone. Because you can even be ashamed of masturbation, which in the past simply wasn't a problem if you were alone. I watch him and know that he doesn't masturbate, watch porn or write anywhere with other women. It's no joke that others would scream, I would be happy to finally find the reason. When I ask him, nothing comes up because I don't even know, or that he's so sorry, blah blah.For a while I compensated a lot with Onlyfans, where I always had the excuse of making money. Even if he was really reluctant at first, I at least managed to make him aware of it. Later he helped me take photos, even if only for a short time, and I was hoping that maybe something would change, but nothing happened.The joke is that I wouldn't even have a problem with it. Really not. I would just like to have an open relationship. When I tell him that, he feels bad and gathers the courage to tell me that he doesn't think that's good. I wonder why? Why does it bother him if he doesn't get shit himself?The more I think about it and talk to my therapist about it, I come to a point where I realize that it's different. Because I'll be honest, even with regular intimacy I would probably still desire something else. I am convinced that my dissatisfaction would remain. It wouldn't just be the case with him, it would be with every partner, no matter who I had.Whenever I said it to him, it circled around in my head, because actually I don't just want a higher sex drive from him. I want to be free in the matter and not have to worry about anything.A person who is nice to me and who I always write to in depth at very long intervals tells me that her wife is assexual and that it bothers her. Their alleged solution is a polygamous relationship where there would be a third person. She said that it was something so intimate for her and that she had to fall in love with this person. She could never imagine simple sex.I just can't understand that. What do people get from this loyalty, from these prisons? I would like to know how such motivations come about and why so much is associated with it.If I wrote something like that in r/Advice, they would probably tell me that I should just break up. I just don't understand that either. Why can't it work any other way? And if so, how can I get him to accept it and just trust me?As you can read, this is the first person with whom I have had such a relationship and also the first person with whom I have ever had sex. I don't have the feeling that I'll find someone like him again so quickly, nor that various opportunities will come along that quickly. Now I'm 33 years old and it's driving me crazy. I just feel so bad.The whole thing had always bothered me but I never thought it would trigger me so much. The word "abuse" sounds extremely wrong and dangerous, especially when I have to read and hear from some people that a pwNPD would always be fundamentally abusive. Do people actually understand what kind of word they are using?When I look back on my life, it is full of injuries that shape me to this day and have made me the person I am today. I have forgotten how to show emotions because it always had the worst consequences for me. I have learned to hide things in order to appear as strong as possible. I never got to know the real feeling of what it's like to love someone and be loved in front of everyone.The people around you don't see this pain, no, they deny it or downplay it. They call you a monster that you don't have to deal with.I have hurt people without realizing it. I have also rejected, insulted and put down everyone. I also viewed anyone who tried to help me as an enemy. But I have never, really never caused such serious harm to anyone, neither my life partner nor anyone else. The real damage was to myself.The bad thing is that it is precisely because of sentences like these that it is even more difficult to really look for help and then accept it, because I always think about how the other person can judge me, regardless of whether they are people around me or therapists.I mean this completely and seriously. Everyone who comes to this sub has either experienced it therapeutically or has found a way to reflect on themselves, if only through certain events of others. Otherwise there would be no reason to come here and talk about yourself.I admit that I want attention and validation from others. I own up to the fact that I manipulate people when I see fit. I have no problem saying that I am the most important thing to me. I am more aware and a more honest person. So honest that others despise me and want to destroy me.Anyone who writes that they are lost and forever ashamed should know that even with this step they are much further ahead than most other supposedly healthy people, who are usually no less pathetic.I don't have a regular circle of friends, so I'm always looking for specific people who I think might like me, be it online or in everyday life. It's probably very often the people with whom I initially think that I'm better or at least equal, with whom I think that I can just get involved. Maybe that's exactly what's causing this problem, because no, this isn't some stupid imagination. This is a real and really difficult situation for me. Especially because it keeps bringing me down emotionally.I always come across people who can't achieve anything and then have to try to show that they are so great to me. God, I want to spit in her face.They are usually notorious liars, or people who really convey that what I do is worthless. In retrospect, it's often so stupid that you could actually laugh about it. But I can't because it takes an emotional toll on me in every situation to actually be despised by the other person.Then a naivety is often applied towards me that is simply bottomless. Sometimes I don't understand how so many people have to get themselves into the worst shit and then think I'm going to pull them out of it.I don't know if I get people to do this or if it's really just the rubbish persons who put up with me.Somehow I always thought you needed more self-esteem and then you could develop, but no, it's an act of impossibility. At the moment I just sit at the computer almost every day, listen to music, look at Reddit and am frustrated because I know that I can actually do much more. My creativity seems to be decreasing day by day. It just pisses me off.I have a YouTube channel with a lot of actually active viewers and I know that if I just kept it going it could get a significant increase, but I can't. Just this feeling that everyone can do what I do, but they just can't get beyond it, makes me have a hard time. I don't come up with any really innovative ideas and when I do, I can never really use them anyway.Okay then look for distractions, maybe that will help. Let's move on...PC games, god it's frustrating to see how you can't move forward. “Everyone starts small” is the answer, fuck you all!Even simple games that I play with my boyfriend are no different. He wins, I quit because it's no use.I always had the idea of doing some kind of sport. You have to learn that too and then you will never be the best, let alone worth mentioning.The whole thing sounds ridiculous. Every person always comes up with the same standard, disabled answer that doesn't help anyone. I don't give a damn that no one can do everything well, it would be enough for me to find one damn thing.I limit myself more and more, I start to isolate myself and I fight against it every day. I hoped it would get better and yes I tried really hard to give a better perspective on the things I do. I want to appreciate it and just be proud, but no, it's getting worse.EDIT: I have to add how shitty it is when you actually tell therapists this and they just dismiss it, looking askance as if it's so abnormal, as if this feeling is just made up and not such a limiting problem.. I keep trying to express myself from the outside in such a way that I get what I want. I always want to stand up for myself, be safe and be understood. Every time I talk about my needs, I become embarrassed, dishonest or just talk in riddles, as if there is a wall in front of me saying the right thing. I always keep an eye on the supposed consequences that this entails. I'm always ashamed of it. God I hate it.I somehow thought that I would have just left it at the first thread, but to be honest, it really doesn't let me go. I see that the text is long and at the same time my English is so bad that I don't know if I really have the right wording everywhere. Unfortunately, I can no longer check this properly due to the volume of the text. I think he just belongs here. I think this is one of the most open things I have ever said here and I would be happy if someone reads it.It's really hard for me to summarize like that and somehow it's just embarrassing for me now. The last few days my head has been spinning more and more and I have doubts about everyone, about myself and about every place I go. I have the feeling that I often just start looking for an answer, even where there might not be one at all, let alone one is necessary, things that no normal person thinks about, that maybe just every person goes through. Still, I can't accept that, no, what I experience is always different and always worse than anyone else's. I consider myself to be competent and completely uninfluenceable, but then I keep noticing how I allow myself to be infected. Wow, it pisses me off to be so susceptible to all kinds of dirt, be it various scams or topics that I pick up. It hurts, it really just hurts to be so stupid and stupid, so dependent and childish. I really don't like admitting that. I can't admit it no matter where I am and at the same time I notice more and more how I'm driving myself into shit and at some point I no longer know what it's all about. I've done a lot of nonsense and I just can't get away from this crap. Sometimes I wish I was on a deserted island where all the impressions were gone, where I could just be “normal” inside.I don't know if you can see what I'm currently seeing doubts and serious problems about. I doubt my own story and it's really difficult for me to describe everything that happened to get to this point. Again and again this loneliness, again and again this rejection of other people and the reprimand of supposedly doing something wrong that I have never done wrong. Always knowing that I don't matter to everyone around me. Always my own failure no matter what I start, always a constant devaluation from others and of course from myself. That just hurts. I can't live with that, not without constantly thinking about it and constantly talking about it. Yes, being sick somewhere is becoming more and more my only purpose in life. A fucking vicious circle that no matter what I decide will never be different, as if I would never want it to be any other way.I've had to experience a lot in my past that I have a shitty character, or that I'm simply unstable and different because of my traumatic experiences. Hearing over and over again from your new acquaintances that you should seek help will eventually stay in your head, no matter how hard you try to ignore it. It's extremely difficult for me to see that I need help in certain situations, I'm really ashamed of it and I'm always afraid, afraid that people won't understand the situation or will internally devalue me because I actually want to achieve what I want to do I won't be able to shit alone again. At some point it hit me that I can't feel comfortable like this. At some point I just couldn't deny it anymore and I looked for answers and some of them were extremely strange. At first I thought that coming out as trans would change a lot, but hey, I feel like it's gotten even scarier because yes, I haven't escaped anyone and no, I haven't started a new life in that sense either. New name, new persona, operations, hormones and still the same unbearable personality. Funny. Of course, I distorted my CV in front of a therapist. I somehow wanted everything to fit and wow was I good. She recorded everything and at the end wrote an indication, which mainly consisted of the texts that I personally gave her. Yes, I feel good about what I did, but let's be honest, does what she did speak of competence? What if I were unhappy with that, would she have really differentiated that? As you can imagine, things continued of course, because no, the conflicts within me and with others didn't get any better. During that time, I disappointed more and more people, devalued them and put myself at the top, as if I had poor foresight. In the end everyone ignored me or pitied me. Now came physical worries and fears. I noticed that I was gaining weight slightly due to the hormone therapy. I never considered that it might just have been due to short-term stress. I started looking at other people, realized that I wasn't the thinnest and therefore I'm no different than anyone else. I couldn't accept that. I started losing weight, more and more. My inner focus shifted from one topic to a new one, that of having more and more discipline when eating and worrying more and more about food and my weight. I didn't make any sense of having an eating disorder. I even bragged about it. I went to Pro Ana forums and hoped that I was the thinnest of all and god it was good to see how others wrote about their problems, how they kept having binge eating that didn't work at all for me.Still, it left me less and less satisfied. I became more and more impulsive from the outside and my sister (my only real regular contact at the time) also got a lot of it. It wasn't enough for me, so I had to expand my personal worldview even further and started researching the supposed origins. I went to the family doctor and had myself examined and she introduced me to a gluten-free diet and yes, I was so vulnerable and stupid to just accept it. Of course, I also talked about it and couldn't resist looking into communities and posting how well I had myself under control now and was supposedly fighting my eating disorder. God I hate myself for this.Everyone who had contact with me had to go through this nonsense for a long time. Even my friend had to go through a lot in the first few years. Then suddenly the break. I didn't care about the eating disorder and I just dropped the gluten-free diet from one day on. Somehow my boyfriend helped me to stop being ashamed of doing something so stupid for so long.But of course it shouldn't stay that way. I've repeatedly made comments here about my relationship, but also that I'm still struggling with the same issue mentioned above. In the meantime, there were conflicts with some people who I actually saw as very warm and friendly towards me. One contact in particular at work caught my eye. Because yes, I told him all the crap that came to mind and suddenly we were arguing and I realized that I was losing out. She knew every nonsense about me, the stupidity had no limit and in return I knew nothing about her. If that were the only person I had such a relationship with, everything would be fine, but no, it's really every time, with every fucking person who starts to get closer to me.At the same time, I notice more and more how I provoke people and not just by trolling. I speak and write really disparagingly and always have new situations where I consciously look for supposedly weaker people in order to put them down completely, whenever I see that they supposedly get more attention than I do. Even if people are hated by others and come to me, at some point I push them away, after all they are idiots. I'm creating more and more people who hate me. I don't know if it's my personality or just my shitty instability and lack of acceptance of being happy with myself.And now we finally come to the current situation.I've been seeing a therapist since last year, mind you, behavioral therapy. I'm so annoyed that when I first started looking for it, I never thought about forms of therapy. To be honest, I didn't even know where this journey was supposed to go, let alone how I could even tell something like that without seeming completely stupid. At the same time, I was and still am so torn inside. I just can't take it anymore with all the things I'm doing and going through my head. What I liked about her was that she asked questions directly and I thought she would really think about me, maybe give me a way out, maybe even give me a completely different look at me. After several visits, however, the conversations became more and more one-sided, so that in the end it was only about my family and my brother-in-law, who I absolutely can't stand. We went around in circles. So I wrote like before to make it clear to her that I really wanted more than just small talk and yes I also wrote that I think I'm a narcissist. Well the conversations changed again and she went through the points with me. I was able to confirm a lot of things, but what does that mean? Of course everything applies to me when I think like that. As is usual in this form of therapy, it was hardly really about dealing with things in the past, but only about the current things that affect you in life. Then I thought about depth psychology again, but at the same time I realized how impossible it is to find a therapy place here. Many people reject it outright, saying that my health insurance will then cause problems. It's tiring and at the same time so embarrassing what I've gotten myself into.In the meantime, I've also been dealing with other limitations, such as not being able to get anything done, or being such a mess, and also having so many problems communicating with people. Then I came to the conclusion that I needed to be diagnosed with ADHD. I asked my therapist what her impression was and she said she didn't see anything about it. Nevertheless, I decided to do a diagnosis privately and lo and behold I clearly got the diagnosis.Since then I have been going to her as well as to group therapy. In group therapy I was able to learn a lot about myself and others, which was really good. On the other hand, I have never really been able to absorb the topics and advice. I have the feeling that people are thinking far too simply. At the same time, I also notice how I differ from others, or tell myself so. Topics like envy and mistrust also make themselves felt in me. It seems to be less likely to be recorded, where I think that no one is really interested in you.I think that there has to be more, or rather I am convinced of it and so I go to my therapist, annoyed that I didn't really know where I stood and what sense this therapy actually makes.Now I recently asked her for a statement because I just don't even know what we could work on anymore and I also asked myself whether she was even interested in me and yes, she actually did. I spoke in purely superficial terms and used some empty phrases, things to distract me from my thoughts. But things turned out differently. A session before, she discussed with me a lot about my past and my relationship with my parents, especially my father. Then in the next session she broke everything down, including a lot of what we discussed before and of course what I recorded for her twice. She sees two sides that influence me: instability and strong narcissism. We then went through points and came back to examples of current and former short friendships. I think I left a lasting impression on one in particular. The topic of death seems to affect people more than it does to me. I said how it annoyed me that this person was so bitter in front of me and that it then escalated. It wasn't the only example. I have no idea, but these situations still feel ridiculous to me and I seriously wonder if she's rhyming about it more than she should have. Have I perhaps dramatized the whole thing? As I was saying goodbye to the meeting, I realized that I had left something behind. I can't think of it anymore. Great, you now have the next diagnosis, congratulations.What remains is a negative aftertaste with massive doubts. Is my therapist competent enough? Is what she says true? Is it basically just something I invented again? Is she really not taking me seriously and is she just calling it that? Somehow it's too complex for that.How should things continue now? What should I do? I feel like I'm going deeper and deeper into my own destruction and I don't understand why.Thank you for everyone who read this long text. Thank you for being there.&#x200B;. Actually, I should be happier because I finally managed to get my therapist to analyze me and give me a defacto diagnosis. She sees strong narcissistic parts in me, including a lack of empathy. Added to this is low self-confidence. She had it set up well today, but somehow I can't believe that I'm such a genius who recognizes everything about myself. Before that, I went to a practice regarding my own suspicion of ADHD and here too I received a clear diagnosis. Is this really specialist knowledge, or is it just confirming me so that I can calm down somewhere? Am I so complicated, manipulative that you just take it for granted? I have the feeling that most doctors rely on some tests and of course their own statements. My therapist has known me for more than a year now, but I still don't think she will ever really be able to empathize with what I really experience and how I behave in everyday life. I somehow have the feeling that no matter where I am, there are rarely critical questions where I think someone has the competence to analyze you. I also have enormous doubts about the ADHD diagnosis, although I really tell myself that it was already well evaluated and that it was clearly done by experts. At least on a neurological and psychological basis there seems to be enormous leeway in how the patient is analyzed.Vor ein paar Monaten hatte mal einen Post gemacht wo ich über ein Bewerbungsgespräch geschrieben hab und ja Stolz bin ich noch immer. :)[Ich bin Stolz auf mich... : einfach\_posten (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/einfach_posten/comments/13red47/ich_bin_stolz_auf_mich/)Ich hab dann auch direkt am nächsten Tag für mich eigentlich undenkbar die Zusage bekommen. Umso mehr hab ich mich gefreut endlich eine andere berufliche Perspektive zu haben. Über 12 Jahre waren es nun her, in dem für mich doch irgendwie Stillstand herrschte. Ich bekam selten gute Aufgaben und hatte vor allen extrem viel Leerlauf. Die größeren Unternehmen wo für ich Extern zusammen mit meiner ehemaligen Chefin gearbeitet habe waren toll und man war auch einigermaßen integriert, aber im Detail merkte man dann doch schnell die Unterschiede. So war es 2020 mit der Corona Krise plötzlich voll okay dass mich ein Kunde einfach nicht mehr brauchte. In der Zeit war ich nie wirklich so produktiv, es gab immer wieder mal das ein oder andere aber ich hatte auch das Gefühl dass meine Chefin mich zwar wirklich sehr mochte, aber nicht wirklich was anvertrauen wollte. Den Kunden schien es egal zu sein ob ich wirklich produktiv war oder nicht. Zudem hab ich allerdings auch tatsächlich gerade am Anfang erheblich viele Flüchtigkeitsfehler gemacht und konnte nie wirklich irgendwelche Ratschläge annehmen. Seit diesen Jahr habe ich durch meine ADHS Diagnose auch endlich den Grund dafür gefunden, warum ich so Chaotisch bin, aber in der gesamten Zeit hatte ich nichts davon gewusst und es hat einen schon entsprechend auch stark frustriert. Wie dem auch sei die Zeit dort ist vorbei und ich blicke da schon auch nicht negativ zurück. Habe wirklich auch einige nette Menschen kennen gelernt egal wie Oberflächig und vergänglich doch alles war. Gestört hat mich allerdings auch am Ende auch die Bedingungen, das ich niemanden hatte der irgendwo mich vertreten hätte, außer meiner Chefin. Ich musste mir selbst das Gehalt erkämpfen und es ist klar dass dieses in so einer Konstellation lange nicht besonders gut war, bzw. immer den Tariflöhnen hinterher hängt. Nun war ich gespannt, denn ich habe für mich das unmögliche der Dinge geschafft. Ich hab nicht nur einen neuen Job gefunden, sondern ausgerechnet einen im Öffentlichen Dienst. Dort wo ich immer schwierige Einstellungstests hatte die ich nie bestanden habe. Dort wo ich immer dachte dass man mich wegen der schlechten Zeugnisse eh nicht nimmt. Endlich Gehalt nach Tarif, Home Office Möglichkeit und absolute Flexibilität was die Arbeitszeiten angeht. Ja es ist einfach ein toller Luxus den ich immer haben wollte und jeden beneidet hab der irgendwie es geschafft hat wo fest eingestellt zu sein. Auch das Aufgabengebiet ist endlich komplexer, mehr verschiedene Baustellen und es gibt auch endlich Möglichkeiten an der ein oder anderen Schulung teilzunehmen.Nun ist es da und was soll ich sagen. Die Kollegen sind toll. Wirklich, ich hab noch nie so nette freundliche Kollegen gehabt. Ich hatte noch nie einen so lockeren Vorgesetzten wo es schon fast Kumpelhaft wird. Ich kann mit vielen wirklich tolle Gespräche führen und auch das Alter passt deutlich besser. Früher waren wirklich alle um mich herum ü50. Es ist schon krass zu sehen dass es Kollegen gibt die wirklich mal jünger sind als ich selbst. Was allerdings sehr verwirrend und für mich echt schwierig ist, ist die Arbeit selbst. Besser gesagt die nicht vorhandene Arbeit. Ich sitze hier wirklich nur rum, es gibt nichts. Ich frage und bekomme zur Antwort "schauen sie mal da und da im Intranet" irgendwann hat man genug davon angesehen. Dann kann man sich mit der Datenbank beschäftigen. Zudem war am Anfang überall noch nicht mal ein Zugang vorhanden. Ein paar Miniaufgaben habe ich tatsächlich dann doch für eine andere Abteilung machen können, aber dann wieder das übliche. Immer wieder kommt mal ein Kollege und fragt ob ich kurz da und da mal schauen könnte, er bringt mir das im Laufe des Tages. Passieren tut dann allerdings nichts. Frage ich nach bekomme ich zu hören dass das entweder doch keine Eile hat oder es sich von selbst geklärt hat. Ich sitze den ganzen Tag am Schreibtisch, habe die Tür offen, begrüße jeden der an mir vorbei geht und bin hier auf Reddit unterwegs um Texte wie diesen hier zu verfassen. Anhand der Fülle des Textes sollte meine große Kapazität erkennbar sein. Früher bekam ich schon so wenig dass man wirklich von einer Unterforderung sprechen kann. Ich hatte aber trotzdem gerade bei langweiligen gleichbleibenden doch durchaus auch mal Motivation wenn ich wusste dass es etwas sichtbar Produziertes gab und sei es nur eine Überarbeitung einer Excelliste, oder Ablage von Dateien. Früher waren es 1-2h Arbeit am Tag, heute sind es gut wird 2h in der Woche. Habe nun mehr Geld, weniger Fahrerei, vielleicht bald auch mehr Sicherheit aber dieser Fluch ist geblieben. Zeitweise genieße ich ihn aber auch, einfach weil ich inzwischen auch echt Angst habe das genaue Gegenteil zu erleben. Fakt ist dass ich auch früher selbst angefangen habe mich ständig auf der Arbeit mit anderen Dingen zu beschäftigen, weil ich mich einfach nicht auf die Sache konzentrieren konnte. Das machte mir auch jetzt wieder Angst dass ich es so richtig verhauen könnte. Ich hab es echt mittlerweile verlernt wirklich zu Arbeiten. Vielleicht suche ich mir wirklich auch nur noch so etwas aus. Vielleicht will ich es gar nicht anders. Ist es vielleicht doch in unserer Gesellschaft mittlerweile die eigentliche Normalität und besteht unsere gesamte Wirtschaft tatsächlich großenteils aus Bullshit Jobs?. Ich habe im Mai mir eine Amex Payback geholt und seit etwas über 1 Monat nun auch eine BMW Card. Mir ging es vor allen dabei ums Cashback, aber auch um eine Karte zu haben die man z.B. für einen Leihwagen benutzen kann. Bin damit ansich auch zufrieden. Anfangs hatte ich auch einen echt erstaunlichen Kreditramen von über 10.000€, den ich natürlich nie hätte nutzen wollen, da ich sie wirklich nur für die alltäglichen Ausgaben nutze und auch streng drauf achte dass diese Summe immer auf dem Konto bereit liegt.Dann hatte ich jedoch plötzlich eine Mittleilung von AMEX das meine Karten vorzeitig zur Überprüfung gesperrt wären und ich Kontoauszüge nachreichen soll dass ein entsprechendes Gehalt vorliegt. Gesagt getan und nach ca. 7 Tagen (die haben sich wirklich mächtig Zeit gelassen) konnte ich die Karten auch endlich wieder nutzen. Interessant aber dass mein Kreditramen auf 4500€ heruntergesetzt wurde. Letzte Woche habe ich mir gedacht dass ich mir doch mal lieber eine Schufa Auskunft holen sollte und sie da die Amex hat dafür gesorgt das mein Score von 97,25% auf 93,16% gefallen ist. Was meint ihr ist dieser Verfall normal? Sollte ich dagegen vorgehen oder wird sich das im Laufe der Zeit wieder zum positiven ändern? Ich weiß dass man nun die Möglichkeit hat mehr Geld zu bekommen als man besitzt. Ich würde aber niemals diese Funktion so nutzen und es ging mir wirklich nur um die Zahlungsabwicklung und den Vorteilen die aus den Karten enstehen.. Vor kurzen habe ich überlegt ein Wasserbett zu kaufen und hier nach Erfahrungen gefragt. Die Reaktionen waren recht gemischt. [https://www.reddit.com/r/einfach\_posten/comments/15lbq1h/hat\_jemand\_von\_euch\_erfahrung\_mit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/einfach_posten/comments/15lbq1h/hat_jemand_von_euch_erfahrung_mit/)Wirklich abgeschreckt war ich dennoch nicht, also musste ich doch mal schauen was es so auf den Markt gibt. Erstes Problem so wie ich das dachte einfach nur die Matratze ändern ist schwierig, da in der Größe die wir bei unseren vorhandenen Bettgestell hatten lediglich eine Einzelmatratze möglich ist. Dann der Preis, die Dinger sind irgendwie viel zu teuer, dafür dass man sie am Ende nicht einmal mehr wirklich zurückgeben kann. Die Idee mit den Gebrauchtmarkt war allerdings nicht schlecht. Was ich ganz klar aber sagen muss, die Betten, die dort angeboten werden sind teilweise richtig alt und auch nicht so gut gepflegt wie sie sein sollten. So wie das manche behaupten, von wegen alle würden versuchen sie neu wieder los zu werden, ist es nicht. Das Erste was wir uns angeschaut haben war entsprechend grässlich und ich habe danach wirklich gedacht dass ich definitiv keins mehr holen möchte. Dann hab ich aber tatsächlich noch ein Boxspringbett gefunden was wirklich wie neu war und erst dieses Jahr gekauft wurde. Der Grund warum es verkauft wurde war eine Wohnungsauflösung.Das Abbauen und der Transport ging super, auch wenn ich jetzt etwas mehr aufpassen würde dass man die einzelnen Kerne weniger knickt und wirklich alles an Restwasser rausnimmt. Ganz wichtig auch vor dem Aufbau gut Putzen, vor allen schauen dass keine Sandkörner drauf sind. Dafür gab es auf Amazon aber ein gutes Reinigungsset mit Vinylreiniger Tüchern und Conditioner. Das Befüllen war mit dem Schlauch echt simpel. Das hab ich mir komischerweise viel komplizierter vorgestellt. Die Wassermengen sind aber schon irgendwie nicht ohne und es wirkt wirklich erstmal seltsam auf so ein auf dem ersten Blick windiges Ding "Vinylbeutel" mit derart großen Wassermassen aufzufüllen. Jetzt nach 2 Tagen steht es aber immer noch prima und irgendwie hab ich auch kein schlechtes Gefühl mehr damit. Geschlafen hab ich tatsächlich auch gut bisher. Was nun etwas schwieriger ist, ist sich zu drehen, aber man gewöhnt sich daran doch recht schnell.Die Luft hat man auch recht gut rausbekommen, sogar ohne dass man einen Entlüfter hat (soll noch nachgeschickt werden, mal schauen). Gluckern tut da wenig und wenn dann so minimal dass das eigentlich ein tolles Gefühl ist. Es ist irgendwie lustig wenn es doch etwas plätschert obwohl man völlig im trockenen ist. Zurzeit bereue ich es nicht. :). Ich und mein Freund wollen/müssen nun doch mal unsere schon sehr alte Federkernmatratze austauschen und irgendwie kamen wir auf die verrückte Idee statt eine Federkern-, eine Wasserbettmatratze zu kaufen.Ich weiß noch wie diese früher immer in den Läden und Ausstellungen vorgeführt wurden und als Kind hab ich mir irgendwie nichts mehr gewünscht als im Zimmer so ein Bett zu haben. :)Jetzt wo man die Mittel und auch die absolute Entscheidungsgewalt hat würde ich es doch mal gerne wagen so etwas auszuprobieren.Gibt es von euch jemanden der so etwas privat bei sich zuhause hat, bzw. hatte? Wie sind eure Erfahrungen damit? Worauf sollte man hier bei besonders achten?.

Heute bekam ich den Brief wo vor ich schon lange ein mulmiges Gefühl habe und ja es ist nun soweit auch ich wäre eine potentielle Erbin für meinen verstorbenen "Onkel". Ich hatte mit diesen Menschen nie auch nur im Ansatz etwas zu tun. Er kannte mich wahrscheinlich auch gar nicht so wie die ganzen anderen im Suff versinkenden A... die ich damals mit besuchen musste, aber nie sich näher mit mir beschäftigt haben. Der Typ war geisteskrank, hat sich mehrfach versucht umzubringen und ist dann später in einen betreuten Wohnen gekommen wo er nichts anderes als geraucht und sich zu Tode gesoffen hat. Natürlich schlagen alle das Erbe aus und nun kommt dieser Müll zu mir und allen anderen Nichten und Neffen, toll. Ich kann nun 30-70€ für eine Person bezahlen mit der ich nichts im Leben gemeinsam hatte, außer Stress und Scham. Ich denke in nächster Zeit werden noch weitere abkratzen und mich ebenfalls damit "beglücken". Andere haben immer eine große Verwandtschaft, tolle Großeltern, Tanten, Onkels, Nichten, Neffen und auch wenn sie sich vielleicht nicht immer mögen doch irgendwo einen gewissen Rückhalt. Sie erben Häuser, Vermögen. Manche brauchen eigentlich gar keine Sorgen haben, egal was ihnen im Leben passiert, egal wie sehr sie alles in den Ruin treiben. Ich dagegen hatte eine Oma die ich nie kennen gelernt hab, eine andere die uns gehasst hat. Ein Opa der erst völlig mittellos von meinen Eltern im Altersheim gebracht wurde und ich 1 Jahr lang sehen konnte. Ein anderer hat gesoffen und unserer Familie gedroht. Selbst mit seinen Tod versuchte er die ganze Familie zu enterben. Immerhin da hatten meine Eltern kapital bekommen. Mit den Tanten, Onkels habe ich keinen Kontakt mehr und früher auch nur in schlimmster Erinnerung. Die eine Seite hatte null Interesse an einen die andere wie der obere Fall. Ich scheiße auf diese Familie und habe auch nichts was ich in diesen Bezug vermissen würde. Was die Erbgeschichte angeht fühl ich mich allerdings in vielerlei Hinsicht wirklich verarscht. Wieso wird es einen so schwer gemacht ein Erbe einfach abzulehnen, besonders wenn es gar keinen echten Bezug zu mir gab? Wie kann es so kacken dreist erlaubt sein noch zu behaupten dass es für die Ausschlagung "keine Gründe" gebe, obwohl meine Mutter ganz klar eine mögliche Verschuldung angegeben hat. Der Staat kassiert sich von jeder Person Geld bis sie den Taugenichts irgendwie wieder bezahlt bekommt. Wieso muss ich für so einen Menschen bürgen?. Ich hab seit letzte Woche erst mit Medikamenten angefangen, also sind meine Erfahrungen noch sehr gering. Mein Arzt hat gemeint dass wir mit Atomoxetin (Beta Pharm) anfangen sollten und in 6 Wochen wieder nachschauen. Anfangen soll ich mit 10mg und dann Wöchentlich bis 40mg steigern. Soweit so gut. Ich gebe zu ich war und bin etwas skeptisch, sowohl was die Wirkung angeht und ob ich wirklich dauerhaft dieses Medikament nehmen möchte. An sich klang es für mich trotzdem vielversprechend und ich fände es auch schön wenn es wirklich irgendwann entsprechend wirken und mir helfen könnte. Ich weiß auch dass die Wirkung erst frühestens in 4 Wochen bemerkbar sein soll.Was mir seit dem aber radikal auffällt ist dass ich immer müder und noch hibbeliger bin als zuvor. Eigentlich spaziere ich immer gerne, Mittags aber auch gerne mitten in der Nacht. Seit letzter Woche aber muss ich mich stark zu prügeln. Auch die Treppen fallen mir immer schwerer. Es ist noch kein großes Drama, aber es nervt mich schon und fällt mir einfach auf. Früher kannte ich das immer bei einen starken Eisenmangel. Allerdings nehme ich seit Monaten nun Eisentabletten und fühlte mich damit eigentlich gut. ich weiß nicht ob ich mir das einbilde und die Ursache vielleicht ganz woanders liegt, aber momentan vermute ich immer mehr dass es vom Atomoxetin kommt. Wie sind eure Erfahrungen damit, habt ihr das auch so verspürt? Wenn ja, meint ihr dass das mit weiterer Einnahme wieder besser wird?. A really serious question. I've been busy all the time with the factors that ensure that people always seem to give me a huge berth. I think that many actually find me interesting and that there is a certain potential there. I actually always have the feeling that I'm well received at first and that I look nice. However, there seems to be something that I can't change. I've heard this from some people and I have to be honest that it frustrates me enormously. One recently wrote to me that he was in awe of me, partly afraid. I get not a more detailed explanation than that. My appearance is attractive and somehow I think so. Especially when I was shooting videos, I could really notice that for myself. People are first attracted and then scared by what I reflect and radiate. What can it really be and how can I fix it? Do you have similar experiences?. Hallo ihr lieben! Letzte Woche habe ich meine Diagnose erhalten und würde gerne Möglichkeiten finden mich medikamentös weiter behandeln zu lassen. Bei der Praxis wo ich war wäre es angeblich für mich möglich wenn ich die Einstellung wie auch die Diagnostik davor privat leiste. Die Medikamente würden dann mit der Kasse abgerechnet. Habe auf weiterer Anfrage bisher noch keine Antwort und auch so leider keinen blassen Schimmer wie viele Termine und vor allen Kosten auf mich zu kämen. Ich hätte gerne irgendwie die Möglichkeit eine Praxis zu finden die das ganze auch inkl. den Sitzungen auf Kassenleistung macht. Leider erscheint mir das hier im Rhein Main Gebiet nahezu unmöglich. Habt ihr eine Idee was ich machen könnte, oder habt ihr vielleicht sogar Adressen aus der Umgebung?. This post just kind of jumped out of my heart. I don't know if he belongs here and to what extent it's more part of my disorder. It's something that's been bothering me for a long time and at rare times like now I just really notice it. I feel uninteresting and somehow unimportant to the people around me, maybe repulsive? In any case, I notice that most of the conversations I have only arise when I complain, I'm a bit depressed, I see no more ways. People then seem to turn on their helper syndrome. I then suddenly have people who are interested in me, who encourage me or even attack me and are annoyed by me, but they react. I suddenly become interesting. I often talked to my therapist about my self-worth and somehow I started trying to see things in a more positive light, or to somehow give it some importance. In fact, more positive things than bad things have happened lately. A few months ago I was determined to jump off a tall building and end my misery. In the meantime I have found a small ray of hope and somehow realized that I can go further. I suddenly felt success in certain things. Something I had never really allowed myself. At the same time, however, I have felt lonelier than ever in the last few days and weeks and when I talk to the same contacts about it, they withdraw because I am fine. Somehow this is extremely frustrating for me. I have the feeling that I have to stay the way I am, with all the negative thoughts, hate and anger. If I don't then I'm completely irrelevant air.Das mag nun wie eine Bagatelle klingen aber ich hatte heute wohl das beste Vorstellungsgespräch was ich jemals geführt habe. Zum ersten mal habe ich mich nicht verhaspelt oder aus der Reserve locken lassen. Normalerweise war es immer so dass mich schon eine Personalerin völlig verunsichert hat und wenn ich dann mit 4 oder gar 5 Leuten an einen Tisch sitzen musste einfach verstummt bin. Ich fing an mich für alles zu schämen, alles was ich sagen will zu vergessen, an mir jeden vermeintlichen Fehler zu sehen und mich selbst nur noch um Kopf und Kragen zu reden. Die Begebenheiten waren dieses mal eigentlich überhaupt nicht anders. Es war wieder ein großer Besprechungsraum und alles hätte wieder genauso enden können. Habe es aber tatsächlich geschafft. Ich bin über meinen Schatten gesprungen und wirkte alles andere als verklemmt. Merke zum ersten mal bewusst wie offen und Selbstbewusst ich sein kann. Egal wie das nun ausgeht, ob ich wie immer eine Absage bekomme oder nicht ich freu mich gerade einfach das geschafft zu haben.EDIT: Unglaublich, ich habe eine Zusage bekommen.. Keine Ahnung ob das nun hier rein passt. Letztes Jahr, Ende Oktober habe ich die Therapie angefangen und war erst wirklich zuversichtlich und erleichtert dass ich doch noch recht zeitig wo einen Platz gefunden habe. Die "Euphorie" aber verflog nun schnell, weil die Gespräche gefühlt immer einseitiger wurden und ich langsam auch stark an der Kompetenz zweifle. Hatte zwei mal versucht es über lange E-Mails irgendwie offener zu gestalten, mir selbst gesagt dass ich vielleicht auch einfach nicht richtig kommunizieren kann, bzw. alles was mir irgendwie innerlich weh tut verberge. Es gab ein paar etwas konstruktivere Sitzungen danach, aber sehr schnell merke ich wie es am Ende wieder zum selben Muster abdriftet. Frage mich mittlerweile auch wohin sowas überhaupt führen soll. Meine Ängste nimmt es nicht, mehr Selbstwert kann ich bisher auch nicht bekommen, eine Perspektive kann ich mir auch nicht daraus erarbeiten, nur weil eine Person mich alle paar Wochen mal eine Stunde sieht. Mir geht es gefühlt nicht ansatzweise besser und ich habe nicht das Gefühl dass sich das damit jemals ändern kann. Ich bin fest entschlossen es ihr ins Gesicht zu sagen, dass ich keinen weiteren Sinn darin sehe, ich es ehrlich sogar bescheuert finde. Hat jemand schon mal ähnliche Erfahrungen? Wie seit ihr damit umgegangen?. I know there are a lot of undiagnosed people here and I'm no different here, although I would like to try to at least look at facts rather than personal feelings. To claim that someone only has an NPD with a diagnosis is somehow also pointless, to think that one does not become aware of this topic oneself, question oneself through certain scenarios and realize that there seems to be something to it, or how do you see this?What is your opinion on this, especially on the point that you can get bogged down with it yourself?I myself would actually like to have a truth, to somehow have exactly what is clearly there confirmed. If a therapist could explain to me that this is not the case for me and give me a concrete diagnosis (whatever there will be), I would actually try to consider it as possible and also accept it, as long as it is not completely far away from good and bad.Now comes the problem, it doesn't happen because no one is really willing to really delve deeply into me, or maybe they just can't.I think there are a handful of people who can do that, but reaching them is difficult and even then the question would be whether they can understand another subject at all, if they must to have than. Here in Germany we have a health insurance company that also pays for various sessions. Here, too, it is an extremely long and painful time before you even get a place. After the probationary period, you have to go through with the therapy or you get a lock, for some years. So there is no real choice. I think it's even harder for people in the US.How do you do this? I really tried to get help and somehow work on myself, no matter where the deficits come from. I wanted to be heard, to have a starting point somewhere to get out of the situation. But I notice that it doesn't work like that at all. At the end you get bogged down in senseless babble about one and the same topics that I don't really care about and don't care about. Often I even have the feeling that the therapist even forgets what I have said. So I kind of have no choice but to self-diagnose and even address it, ridiculous as that sounds. The less I believe that it is at all goal-oriented.I really don't know what to write right now. I've been here before but feel like I need more security.Feel free to call that paranoid, but I think this post may already be a mistake on my part. I find that kind of a shame. Maybe I'll write a short version about myself and then delete it again.I'am I am female 33. I've always had the feeling that my whole career was made up of failures. At school I was bullied until the end, even at my first job it was still the case that I didn't get along with anyone around me.I grew up in a well-known religious community that I would clearly call a sect. You will surely know them all. I never really connected with it, I actually just went along with it, but it still took me a really long time to find my way out of it and, above all, I isolated myself very much. During that time I always had a survival instinct. I had to learn to live alone and always felt like I was lagging behind. I imagined what I could not do in the future. I wanted an empire, I wanted to be famous, I wanted to be the center of attention even if I was an asshole to everyone out there. Of course, none of this worked, and while it's so weird and unworldly, I'm frustrated that it doesn't work.I have a constant expectation of perfectionism, both from myself and from other people. I'm quickly disappointed when something turns out differently than I imagined. Unfortunately, I just leave really good work lying around. I've tried several times to continue my education and can't do it. Again and again I put everything back in the middle. It's really enough little things that I'm paralyzed and leave everything behind. I ask myself how I can ever get away from this problem and, above all, even begin to get what I wish for when everything is an extreme struggle for me.The fact that I probably have an NPD I noticed first and foremost through testimonies from others, above all people like my work colleagues, but also my siblings and everyone around me. I get personal quickly and tend to have conflicts. I used to wonder when I read about narcissistic anger how disgusting you have to think to be like that. I now realize that I am in no way different. I only ever justified it because everyone around me was always hostile.I've always felt strongly isolated in my opinion. People find me interesting, but they quickly realize that I'm getting exhausting, that I'm flooding them with information about myself. Unfortunately often more than I would like.I've started to like myself anyway, but in such a way that I always have the urge to show myself. I do Youtube next to work, until recently I had active Onlyfans because I needed confirmation. I never got any money for it, it was time-consuming, damaged my partnership and in the end you really ask yourself why you're doing it. I realize it was purely because of that. I have always disliked my work. At that time I learned something that seemed most suitable to me. Every attempt to get away from it failed. I still think I have a pretty secure job and a good relationship. Nevertheless, lately I've been able to get into a fight with my superiors again and again and I realize how little I can control. They seem to notice it themselves and consciously give me little or no criticism, or to package it differently. I believe that my colleagues know that I quickly become impulsive.It kind of frustrates me to be nothing but a nobody at this point. I never made it to any position, I was never really important. When I see how many much younger people are having such success, it really makes me sick. I really wonder what I'm doing wrong.For a few years I have been living with my boyfriend who moved in with me. He's my first boyfriend ever and I really wondered if you could love me at all. I really didn't believe that for a very long time. Unfortunately I don't even know if I can give him the same love.He knows that I am currently dealing with the topic of narcissism. At first I was really scared of what he would put together underneath. Right now I think he just thinks I'm kidding myself.Lately I've been feeling more and more like an empty board. My entire creativity that I actually had is running out more and more. I seriously ask myself how long I can go on like this and even want to.&#x200B;Do you curse a lot?I never worry about it much, but I think my swearing is no more than other people's. I can get very personal when I'm angry though.Are you self righteous and vengeful?I think that's me I always have situations where others have to stop me from doing really bad things. Even after an extremely long time, I still feel enormous anger.Can you turn off your empathy?I don't think I turn it on and off consciously. I rather think that I generally can't feel these feelings for others. I notice and know if they're doing well or badly, but I end up having little to no interest in them.&#x200B;Age: 33NPI: 20+Codependeny Score: 3OCD: 0.
    It seems like it’s hard to distinguish between having bad boundaries/ anxiety and being a covert narcissist. I’m also having a hard time figuring out the difference between supply and wanting connection, which feels like a pretty basic human desire. How did you know you were one?. Girlfriend (27) and I (27) live together. Dating for almost two years. We’d planned on throwing a smallish party for a few weeks now but I ended up getting really sick the night before. Morning of, I’m still sick and want to cancel or reschedule. Gf refuses and says to wait it out to see if I feel better. I say do what you want, I’ll go to my family’s. And so I did. And they had a party with our friends without me. I’m kind of annoyed that this happened because if it were me, I wouldn’t have thought twice about rescheduling. How do I approach this with my partner? Should I? Or should I just suck it up?.
    What do you do in a situation where the thing which you intend to write about seems to be so obscure that there isn't much information about it. All I've managed to discover is that gyaruo are men who dress in gyaru. I've also found that the fashion has just as many substyles but I cannot find any of those substyles or what they are. I'm sure if I keep looking I'll find something but it still feels annoying.Not to say this is a bad thing. Because it's not. But I've realized that especially online, people are more willing to be sympathetic towards those with BPD. Which, of course. Is not a bad thing. But it seems that on online spaces like tiktok people with BPD diagnoses are allowed the comfort about being able to joke about their disorder. Even seems to be the case in some instances in real life. And I can't help but think about it because if I were to ever openly joke about my disorder people would usually get upset and think I'm being serious. Only time that isn't the case in my experience is when I'm in forums for pwnpd. And I've also seen people with BPD post videos saying things like; "If a person with BPD hurts you, just know that the person hurting you is in more pain." And I just know I could never even dream of getting away saying something like that. Not that I would want to of course. But I'd be (rightfully) accused of being gaslighty if I said something like that. And aside from that I've seen instances of pwbpd being treated with more sympathy and leniency for things that if an NPD person did, they'd be hung on a stake for. And I can't help but also find it a bit peeving. Perhaps because in the first place I've always (well more like recently) believed in things like accountability for ones own actions. But sometimes it feels like people with certain disorders aren't held to that same standard just because of that. And maybe it's also even more irritating to think about it when I consider the fact that as a person with NPD I have always felt obligated to. Even when I wished I hadn't or didn't want to. Well, it could also be I've been on tiktok for too long. But it feels frustrating to think that people with BPD just seem to be treated much better to literally any other cluster b. Like I've been slighted in some way. But of course, I'm sure I'm just being dramatic. And it's not like I'm not aware why a person with BPD would be treated much better than a person with NPD. Even though they are just as capable of being antagonistic, toxic and abusive as a person with NPD, their symptoms are a lot more self-victimizing, thus people are willing to be more sympathetic towards them. And they are willing to excuse condemnable actions in them the same way they would a person who has depression. Because it seems a lot more acceptable. And I understand why NPD would be seen as less acceptable. In fact, I'd even say it's deserved. But it also still feels unfair when I think about it. Because I mean, I basically feel like a monster sometimes. Who can never truly ever be redeemed. Whose intentions can never be trusted. It really makes me wish I had a diagnosis like BPD instead of NPD. Because even if I had to deal with all the complications that come with it, I could at least feel like less of a horrible person. After all, you're more likely to hear people recount horror stories of dealing with someone with NPD then you are someone with BPD. And I've seen a lot more people record and publish what is essentially a pwnpd's worst then I have a pwbpd. Perhaps because one is more worth posting then the other I guess. And I don't mean to invalidate the struggles pwbpd go through. I'm just jealous. Because the day I got diagnosed with NPD was the day my life turned into a shit show. I mean I was always a bit of a terrible person, but it was only after I got my diagnosis I began to realize how much of a terrible I was — even an currently. It's probably selfish to say I'd prefer to be a terrible person in ignorance then have to deal with the fact that I am, and will likely always be. Even if I improve as much as I can I will always be slightly terrible. I will always have terrible thoughts, feelings and emotions.And people, no matter how hard I seem to try will always only see me like that. And I'll also be honest, the only reason why I feel any sort of disheartened by the stigma pwnpd face is because I can't stand the thought of actually being hated, even if it is deserved. I hate the fact that there was even an instance where I was filmed at my most terrible and worst (which I unfortunately, was) and that it was posted, and that there are probably people out there who've seen it. But yeah, it feels like people who have BPD are just genuinely treated a lot better online than say any other cluster b. And it's a bit annoying to think about.And I specifically mean those who claim that empathy and logic can't co-exist, when they quite clearly can. I notice that this viewpoint mainly comes from neurotypicals who for whatever reason mistakenly believe they have no empathy when really they have selective empathy. Which would be when say, your guy friend got cheated on and you immediately feel as bad about as he does but when say a girl you don't know gets taken advantage of sexually you don't feel bad for her. That is selective empathy, which is what most neurotypicals who claim to have no empathy tend to have. They have as much empathy as the next person but invest it in situations they believe is deserved, regardless of whether or not it isn't. I personally, in both situations would not feel bad for either. That aside, empathy is of course a skill. But many neurotypicals struggle to see it this way because they naturally have emotional empathy. However, even then, it's a skill. For instance, I've found myself in situations before where I've upset someone, and so badly that I have actually been hit in the face by them. Of course in such a situation it is difficult to consider the other person's perspective and feelings when your cheek is stinging from the pain and blood is rushing to your head. But being able to do so is empathy. Being able to instead of focusing on your own emotions, focus on another's in any given situation is a skill. And even for those who have emotional empathy it should still be considered so. As I imagine for a person with emotional empathy, their feelings are still centered, even when being empathetic. the reason why they are empathetic after all is because they are relating to the emotions of another on the same wavelength. So in such a situation where they feel anger, it would be hard to decenter their emotions to be empathetic when their empathy is emotion based rather than logic based. Not that logic and emotions can't co-exist. But it's hard to go through the logic of why a person might feel the way they do and why it might be deserved when you feel like punting them back in their face. Which is why it feels frustrating to me that so many people seem to struggle to understand this. Growing up I never had empathy and I wasn't taught it either, I had to learn it on my own in order to properly fit into society. So it's just an unexplainable amount of irritating to see people claim it's not a skill when it in fact is simply because they think everyone just naturally has it and thus it's the type of thing you don't have to work to develop when you very much do, especially as someone with NPD.I don't believe it's a compatability issue since from what I see the game is supposed to be compatible with the Vita3k but both it and the app crashes when I press start.Does anyone have a fix to this?. I don't believe it's a compatability issue since from what I see the game i supposed to be compatible with the Vita3k but both it and the app crashes when I press start.Does anyone have a fix to this?. I tried to use yuzu and skyline but both require custom GPU drivers and I have a Samsung Tab A7 Lite that doesn't support it but I have some Switch games that I want to play DESPERATELY and I only have this and a Motorola.. Does anyone have a fix to this?. I've had days where I just feel nothing. Like it's just an all encompassing emptiness. I don't even see myself reacting the way I usually would. Like things that would usually make me mad don't bother me anymore. If I watch a movie I would have cried to before I don't feel sad at all. And this goes for anything too. And I don't even feel happy either. If I get a promotion at work I don't feel that same victorious joy. It's just like ehh. Whatever. And it's weird because usually I would feel these emotions for myself. But I don't. I just feel like a husk of a person. And at the same time I just feel unbearably bored. Its hard to say whether I like it or not because yes, it's nice not to feel myself not getting triggered or worked up over things but it's also just really boring. Because I just feel nothing. Nothing towards people, nothing towards myself. Like most days I'll feel motivated to do things like get up, take care of my hygiene and dress well but on days like this I just don't care at all, so I lay in my bed looking like a sack of potatoes. It's so weird in a way I can't even explain. Like I really just don't care. And whenever people talk to me it's like it goes through one ear out the other. And I've had times where I'll just be staring off into the distance but I'm not even really looking at anything. It's just like I'm zoning out.It's seriously demotivating to me. I only did it because my therapist suggested it but it's not a very good feeling to have people point out that the persona I built is much more preferable to the actual person I am. Because I mean of course I know that but it still hurts to actually hear. So yeah, I basically regret listening to my therapist now. Cause it genuinely feels like it's being pointed out that my real self is unworthy. I don't know how to word it properly but it sucks and I feel terrible now.Gameplay is smoother though. But it's super confusing because I can't tell where I am or supposed to be going when I'm literally suspended into the air. Fortunately in some areas there's no glitches but it sucks for quests.I've just started playing the prologue and it seems interesting. Didn't think I'd like the white haired guy with red eyes but he has a really nice voice.Like the characters will have times where they straight up turn black. Or they have like a black solid shadow but if I put FXAA on it doesn't happen. It's such a shame since I personally feel like the game doesn't look as good with FXAA on but some of the glitches are kinda distracting even if brief.No idea way. I've tried turning off background apps, disable HW overlay, using a game booster app but it's still glitchy.&#x200B;Right now I'm on low. I run fine on medium but whenever I'm on the express (and only the express) on medium it keeps glitching. So I put it on low instead.&#x200B;Is this happening to anyone else? Is there a way to fix it?. I have been trying to download some games off of itch.io using Linux but I've been failing miserably. I am completely new to Linux but I have set it up. I have a HP Chromebook if it helps. I tried to install wine but things just weren't working out for me in that regard either. So I kinda just gave up since I realized I really didn't have the time in my schedule to figure out how to use Linux for gaming but I don't have a Windows system and really want to be able to play itch.io games so I'd really like for some advice on how to!. Especially the way they generalize them too. It's gotten to the point that it's geniunely ableist and fake. One second they'll be talking about having compassion and understanding for people with depression yet will be on BPD people's asses for days. And no, your shitty ex doesn't have NPD or ASPD or BPD. Someone being unpleasant doesn't mean their mentally ill or have a disability, and to think that all of your shit exes must be because otherwise why would they be such an asshole geniunely feels ableist. Additionally you can have ASPD and still have emotions, you can even still bond with people and show compassion towards them, the difference is that they don't do it in the same way neurotypicals do. And of course, many of them may require it being taught to them. But if a person with ASPD is in therapy and has worked to make the active choice to be a better person, that should be appreciated instead of discredited because their intentions were "selfish". And the way people discredit people with BPD is geniunely gross. Like just because they can become as happy as quickly as they become upset doesn't mean their emotions aren't geniune, their emotions are just more intense. And I don't even want to get into NPD right now because the way people talk about them is inherently ableist. And yes, these people can cause harm in people's lives, yes. And you don't owe a person with any of these personality disorders your sympathy if they have. However it's not right to be ableist simply because of that. Which people whenever they talk about personality disorders end up being. If you wouldn't act this way towards someone with anxiety and depression, don't do it to personality disorders either. They never chose to be this way. And the same way a person with depression can be both toxic and harmful to a person, they can too. But that doesn't make everyone with the personality disorder evil. This shouldn't be the thing that defines them, their actions should be.When it comes to "white" dialects such as how a southerner would speak, or the accent of a new Yorker, people will talk about how it sounds so nice and unique, and how clever and humourous it is and how they shouldn't change how their speaking but when it comes to black dialects and accents all of a sudden people who speak this way are now "unintelligent" and sound uneducated and stupid which is why most black people end up code switching because anybody that's not black that hears you will downgrade your intelligence as a person because black dialects and accents all of a sudden make you sound stupid and dumb. It's so annoying because this is nowhere as frequent with southern accents. because I've heard people call them "comforting" but I don't think I could ever hear that for blaccents. and it's not even that I think people should like black dialect, it's just that I think it's highly unfair the way black people are mocked for them, especially when every other dialect from white or even european areas are praised or people won't mock them because it's just their accent and most people won't think anything of it.my back always hurts so bad all the time. I can never sleep comfortably because of them, if I sleep on my back it feels like I'm carrying the weight of my chest in a really uncomfortable way. if I sleep on my stomach my boobs end up hurting because the weight of my boobs pressed against my bed causes my nipples to end up feel crushed. my boobs are also always jiggling when I run or jump or try to exercise. it hurts a lot, like someone is pulling my boobs off of my chest. It's really paining. and I also feel self conscious about people looking at me when it happens. People always say I can just wear a bra but I always wear bras and it doesn't change much. sure it jiggles less but it still jiggles and it hurts. Clothing also feels uncomfortable. Whenever it rubs against me my boobs really hurt too which is why I always wear a bra even though I hate them. And my friends like to stay stuff that "at least I can get boys attention" but I don't want their attention at all. my boobs only ever attract creeps and I hate it. I hate it when their good for nothing selves look at me or try to put their slimy hands on me. and people are always making gross comments about my boobs, whether it's at school or on the way back home/to school. men are always catcalling me and making gross comments about my boobs. and both women and men have commented on my breasts and said disgusting things. my first boyfriend just a few days into the relationship started asking to touch my boobs even though we hadn't started dating long. this was actually even in highschool mind you. and now it makes me uncomfortable being in relationships because it feels like men only really care about my body. it also sucks because if I complain about it to a friend who doesn't have the same problems I do (they aren't cursed with big boobs) their so dismissive about it and say stuff like "well at least you get attention from boys" or "you can just do this and that" and it's so fucking annoying because firstly, not everyone wants the attention of boys. in fact, some people despise and dread it. I don't want a boy to pay attention to me just because of my boobs. It feels gross and I feel like vomiting. and everything they recommend i at this point have already tried. Like literally someone told me to just wear a bra like I don't wear one every single fucking day. Seriously it's so fucking annoying when they do that. Because they think just because boys pay attention to you that you must be so lucky when that's far from it. Because most boys barely even pay attention to me and when they do, it's for fucking gross ass reasons. I fucking hate having big boobs. I wish I had small ones. I just want to be ignored. I want to be invisible, more invisible then I already fucking am. I don't want to be in constant pain because puberty decided to curse me with two lumps of fat.Sorry but I had to say it. Don't get me wrong, love that anime.But it is not peak comedy. it also aged horribly. it's writing isn't too good. Some of it's humour is literally just middle school kids talking about sex and giggling.I also liked it more when it remained episodic and didn't pull any of the story driven bullshit it tried to. like they really had no idea what they were doing and the team weren't good enough writers to be able to successfully pull it off. especially when before it seemed they were going for episodic fun but they ended up biting off more then they knew how to chew.like don't get me wrong... some of the story driven episodes were good but no, it was better off as it was before. it's ending also isn't as clever as some people try to exaggerate. it just looked like they didn't know how to properly end the series. it also made me despise stocking. I already wasn't that big a fan of stocking because of how she treated her sister. like don't get me wrong, panty also didn't treat stocking great but at least it felt like she was, sometimes, at least ACTUALLY there for her. but stocking just wasn't. but the ending ruined whatever there was for her imo.I'm also pretty sure most people only like the anime for these three reasons; the art style, the characters and nostalgia.if they rewatched the anime again then they probably wouldn't be able to hype it as much as they do.there's also fucking Garterbelt. I just don't like him. His whole character let alone design is giving racism. no like it's literal racism and idc if the reason he's so trash is because japanese people are homogenous. yeah, and his character is still fucking racist garbage. first reason is his minstrel. you should never, EVER draw a black character with minstrel since in case you don't know... people literally used to mock, insult and degrade black people by depicting them with minstrel. his afro also is — well it's fucking goofy. not the good kind, the "get this stupid ass shit off my screen" kind. and then his whole backstory... it'd probably feel less racist to me if there was a non-black character with something as similarly atrocious but since there isn't... it's just no lol. it's also the reason I don't like Garterbelt. But in general I can't really care about him (as in I never liked him)And I don't think anything for me would change if they just removed him or smthing. reason I say this is whenever I remember the anime I don't remember Panty & Stocking With Garterbelt, I remember Panty & Stocking. Even though his name is literally in the anime name he's the least significant to me. I remember Bug, Brief, Scanty and Kneesocks. But not Garterbelt. I remember Panty and Stocking but not Garterbelt. Which is why I feel like I'd just have preferred him to not be there in the first place lol.Don't get me wrong, I love the anime. Like it's a pretty good raunchy series but it is not the peak comedy people try to say it is.I've literally seen gay teens just being harassed for just being by themselves, bothering no one but themselves and out of the floodgates comes a christian being all angry about how what their doing is ungodly and whatever. like who fucking cares. piss off.So lately I've been hearing this voice well its more of, I've always have. Her names Mary, she's been with me since I was young, I'd say after my sister ran away did I become conscious of her existence. At first it was all good and nothing was wrong. She was always there for me and even supported me. She to an extent influenced my decisions like to certain things she'd urge me to do this or advise me not to do that but I'm like in my teens now and she's still with me. I've realized things have changed. On multiple occasions she's convinced me that I hate myself and I deserve to die. An example would be the incident where I accidentally fell asleep while taking a bath and water spilled over, luckily I woke up and turned it off before things got too bad(sleep deprivation does things to ya) but my mom was very angry at me, screaming, shouting me. Even when I apologized she didn't accept and said that my apology both did and meant nothing and that it wouldn't do anything. She said stuff like "if we get evicted it'll be your fault" or something along those lines. And then afterwards I heard her and she was telling me I was a horrible person and that I should atone for my sins with death and all that and it was to the point I believed it to be true. I mean idk anymore It feels like I'm going crazy. She went from being like my friend to my antagonizer cause its starting to feel like the moments where she's there she's antagonizing me and even when she's not she's still mean just not as mean, sometimes she's just playfully mean and sometimes she's just downright there. I mean I guess she's always been a selfish and mean person but she was actually nice. Maybe its weird I'm humanizing a voice in my head but still. I feel like I'm going crazy or something, I'm thinking all of these thoughts that would usually be blocked out and it sucks.
    One of my biggest pet peeves. Literally. During love bombing oh yeah I’ll buy all kinds of shit. BUT…if I HAVE to buy the obligatory “Mother’s Day” or “valentines day” or “anniversary” or “birthday” gift then I feel like I’m being extorted. Also, half the time I’m actively discarding who I’m with so I just hate buying things for them in general. Now God forbid I actually DO buy a gift lol. They better appreciate it for a very long time. I’ll remind them after a fight “I just got this for you and this is how unappreciative you are.” Any time I got flowers for my ex wife, sex was a given. I never got the flowers for her, but for me to self glorify what a great husband I was. Anyone here feel the same way?Edit: I realise I can’t buy anyone what they want so I feel shame yey. Im literally angry 70 percent of the time. It’s a low level anger that burns like a slow fire. I look down on people most of the time. When I encounter someone I stare at their imperfections. I’ve noticed when I talk to people they cover their faces. Like I’m probing for their blemishes. Im also insecure about my own financial struggles. Oh how I wish to be great. But then that would require exceptional hard work which is asking for too much of my time. I need to spend time with my kids before they get older. I also need time for my hobbies as well. And the gym. I sit there thinking about ways people have not paid me the deference I deserve. I sulk and discard people for not extending an invitation even though I had no business being invited. I maintain enough relationships so I don’t end up completely alone. I’m glad I have the self control and awareness not to detonate all my relationships. Finally, my rages. Ah yes. They never truly go away. I’ll rage and threaten. But no violence thank God. Do I think about it, oh yes. Once again thank God for this self control.This will be controversial. Please don’t hammer away at me. The word “narcissist” gets thrown around very commonly nowadays. It’s the latest buzzword in the mental health frenzy. That being said, although I don’t have an official diagnosis for NPD or narcissistic personality disorder, I score high as fuck on the tests for it. My NPI score is 31. My therapist doesn’t know the full extent of my thinking but he’s said I’m “very narcissistic”. I never cheated on my wife. But I did verbally abuse her when she would piss me off. We both worked until a few years ago. I worked very hard for all of us. I always drove used cars to save money. I’m frugal and financially responsible. My STBXW has called me a narcissist and a sociopath. People at work have said the same. People at university said “I have intense angry eyes”. I have easily put hands on over 40 people in my life. I stopped with the violence after 25 years old. But I continue to threaten when I’m enraged. My rages are something to behold. I torched my STBXW in my court filing. My lawyers said “you aren’t picking a fight you are declaring a war”. I tried to settle for 50-50Pre filing she refused so I went in heavy. Now we are in a full blown evaluation for custody yey! I divorced her because she’s not healthy for me. But also to punish her for not obeying the rules. This punishment theme needs to go away because it will bite me in the ass with my kids. I split all the time. I’ll split and even discard my 5 year old son if he pisses me off. Lately I’ve been telling myself “he’s one of them”. I pull myself out of it. I love him dearly. The uneducated say “you can’t be self aware” lol oh yes you can. NPD is a spectrum. I spend lots of time staring in the mirror in love with my own reflection. But then I’mMad at myself for having greys in my early 40s and being divorced with kids in a broken home. I love my kids dearly. And want what’s best for them. I even want what’s best for my ex and that’s for her to get therapy and to stay away from romantically. Ask away We aren’t evil. Just broken. Some of us really are trying to be good people.That’s when the volcano explodes. Hurt me when I’m hurting? There is no bigger trigger for me. When you aren’t shown empathy as a child, when you are beaten, screamed at, bitten in the arms, had your hair pulled, told you were the devil, etc. When you are taught this is how you to deal with rage. You become rage. I try to be empathetic for the lords sake and for mine. I’m still here guys. I’m surviving but not thriving. I was super low last night. Mourning my life. My collapsing finances. My collapsing marriage. Things are in free fall. In my 40s. The judge ordered a custody evaluation so I’m stuck living with my soon to be ex wife until we have this evaluation past us. Last night I was so very low and depressed. But it felt better than the deadness of no supply. Can anyone understand this?. I’ve been self aware for a while now. I’ve been called a narcissist for many years. I don’t really care about anyone else. If I hurt anyone, I’m more concerned about how that makes me feel versus how they feel. My shame forces me to behave versus hurting them. Their feelings don’t matter and they never have. Slowly they are mattering more. I used to be more malignant with rages sometimes they were violent. Now I just seethe with the occasional outburst. So now I find myself in a divorce. My wife (my main source of supply) is no longer with me. She’s got loads of issues as well. But I still find myself trying to manipulate her so I can squeeze just enough supply out of her. Im trying to be a better person. I still use people but not as much as before. I’m single now and trying my best not to go full NPD dark lord slayer. Trying to keep the false self to a minimum. I have means to project a far wealthier version of myself due to my parents resources. I’m decently good looking enough to pull but at 40s age with 2 kids I realize my sexual market value is less than before. I really need to focus on rebuilding my life from the ground up versus obtaining new supply which will mask the pain. I need to feel the deadness in its entirety.
    In the model underpinning schema therapy, there is a mode called the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode. I've read about it a few times, and I just noticed it come up today in myself, I think. I wanted to document it here, so maybe I can become more quickly alert to it in future - because like other maladaptive modes, I feel it really inhibits me, or can do at least.From my recollection the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode is a coping mode in the model. That means there is some underlying vulnerability or distress or unmet need, and this mode is a state of mind and body that we can flip into as a way of reacting or managing what's underneath.I think when I'm in my Paranoid Overcontroller Mode, I become overly fixated and suspicious of other people, maybe particularly one person or two for whatever reason. I suppose there's something about them that I'm fearful of underneath, or something about them that reminds me of someone or some situation in the past the caused me harm. My thoughts turn to and obsess over all the things dry don't like about this person. There is a sense of mistrust. I don't like to look them in the eye, I want to keep away from them, there is a feeling that they are keeping something from me, that they are somehow corrupt, wrong, dangerous, hiding something, manipulative, not truthful, not honest, in authentic. I can even imagine them turning other people against me, thinking negatively about me and talking negatively about me, criticising me with others. That's paranoia. I watch their movements and behaviours, and listen to what they have to say, and my mind is heavily skewed to picking up the evidence to support this from whatever they're saying or doing. It's a form of rumination....The problem is that when I'm in this mode, I don't see the whole person - just the negative aspects that maybe I want to see. I kind of don't want to see the positives. I'm devaluing them. I'm not being empathic, understanding or compassionate. I lose connection to that person. But more than that. I disconnected from the world and other people. I am lost in my own thoughts - just spinning around. I'm cut off from reality, viewing the world through a distorted lens where people are either for me or against me, and I'm collecting the evidence.Gosh! Now I'm reflecting on it, I can see that this mode is somewhat present quite a lot of the time. It's just that today I noticed that was particularly strong, and directed towards one person who I've been with over the last few days. Another man. I guess from the outside looking in at me, people might sense that I am cut off, self absorbed, and that my thoughts are negative and suspicious even. And I wonder if it's on my face. I'm pretty sure it must be, to a degree. Obviously I can't tell that for sure. But there is a chance at least that they pick up on my negative mood, and so might not want to interact or connect with me. I kind of feel that.So I'm really losing out when this mode is strong. I'm not a happy person that I want to be, and people might be more distant from me. It's actually sad. Suddenly I have some compassion for myself coming up. I feel sad for the situation....Where did this come from?A memory of my father immediately pops up in my mind. He's scowling, frowning. His face is distorted. I can tell that he is suspicious of others, he's really paranoid in that moment.Gosh! I guess I picked that up from him! He was suspicious have lots of people when I was a child, and even today he is quite mistrustful of people, although he has mellowed in his older age. But back then he was paranoid about my Mum, her friends, people he worked with, even me and my sister. ...There is a memory, a very strong one, when I was a teenager. It was bedtime. My dad was already upstairs in the spare room. Him and Mum weren't sleeping in the same room by then. Mistrust. Hatred. Fear. Between them. I was in my room. My mum came upstairs. Before she went into the main bedroom, she went to the spare room when my dad was "sleeping" - because he wasn't, as it turned out - and locked the door from the outside. I think I asked her not to do it, but there was something like revenge going on for something he had done earlier in the day. She was less than 3m away from the lock door when my dad jumped up and started banging ferociously on it. He was banging so hard that he started to punch a hole. My mum ran downstairs and told me to come with her. I was on the landing by now. The hole appeared in the door. Splinters of wood were flying over the landing. I could see his fist. His hand was bloody. I could see has distorted face. He asked me to unlock the door. He said I should call the police. I was something like 13 or 14. I didn't want to do that. I was scared of him. But I did unlock the door with the key that was maybe on the floor or something. As soon as it opened I stood back. He ran out and I pretended to faint. I just didn't want to interact with him. So I pretended. He ran downstairs saying that he was going to call the police. I then snapped out of my "faint", and ran behind him shouting "No! Don't!" I remember stopping him when he was at the phone. My mum was outside, she called to me to say come next door - to the neighbours. And I did. I ran out.Later on, in our neighbours' living room, late at night, totally embarrassed, scared, lonely - I was on the sofa, my mum and the wife of the couple next door were with me. My dad was allowed into the house by the husband. Dad came into the room, telling all of us that my mum had locked the door and was planning to burn down the house and kill him.That really wasn't true. But he was totally paranoid. Our neighbours tried to calm him down. Eventually he left and went back to our home. My mum and I slept at our neighbours house that night. I was in my school uniform.I can feel my younger self, shocked, scared, distressed, frustrated, lonely, worried, angry, sad, deflated, embarrassed, guilty, numb.I'm sad for him now. Right now.I feel for him....What I like about the schema approach is that it's not just about countering or challenging the negative or inhibiting thoughts and actions in the here and now. It's not saying simply, "Don't do that! Stop thinking like that! Think positively!" It's about understanding where coping styles come from, trying to swim down to the bottom of the ocean, and connect with the lost, wounded child underneath - the child who was neglected and traumatised. It's about having an understanding the how the wounds of the past relate to the present, and showing - or learning to show - care for those wounds and vulnerabilities.So, to myself today I say, I know I didn't like my dad as a child or teenager. I was often very scared of him. I wanted to be nothing like him. But somehow, and I inherited his negative thinking patterns and behaviours. There is shame around that.But it's not my fault that I have this tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. On one level I inherited it from my dad. Not purely. My mum also has a tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. But for the moment I'm thinking about that memory with my dad, I'm thinking about how his paranoia Took over and lead to violent reaction that stayed strong in my memory for many decades. When I feel that paranoia, when I recognise that suspicious mode, it doesn't make me a bad person. There is a good reason why this habit of mind has come about. Patterns of mind that I inherited from my parents.I really forgive myself. I do.I genuinely feel lighter in my body. I feel lighter in my mind, I feel like I can let go of the paranoid thoughts about the man I'm with at the moment in our group. ...But ... It's interesting because I can now see how my mind is associating the person I am paranoid about with my father. My mind is relating this man today with my dad and how he treated me and my mum in the past. Ah! I see. I see.Fear of my father. Paranoia about his behaviours. Scared of his threats.Spotting similar signals in people today, and feeling threatened. Paranoia.It's understandable. Feeling on edge around certain people because of how my mind associate them with people who threatened me in the past. Again, it's not my fault. But I feel able to let this go. So it's not just about inheritance of certain patterns. It's to do with how I related to my parents as well. I think those two factors are behind my own paranoid thinking today....I want to connect. I want more lightness and freedom in my body and mind. I don't want to be trapped in this paranoid mode that keeps me separate from everyone else.I hope I remember about how things in the past that I had no control over brought about these inhibiting patterns of mind. I hope that I can keep that memory so I can forgive myself again and again, and in so doing let go, and find more freedom and happiness and connection....I think its best to finish this by taking a moment to remember that small, frightened child, and the frightened teenager, too - and just show a lot of understanding to them - to me. In my mind my self as I am now - my big self - is hugging my child self and my teen self. I am showing sorrow, sadness, care, Love, I am kissing them on the forehead as they cuddle up next to me. I say to them,"I'm so sorry that you were frightened and fearful for your own safety. I'm so sorry."I say to myself, looking in an imaginary mirror opposite where we are sitting,"I'm here now. I'm big and I'm strong, and I'm a good bloke - despite everything - I can be a good bloke very often, and I really do try. People are not against me. They want to connect. And although I'm fearful of how people will treat me, 99% of the time people treat me very well."It's true.I've had a few noticeable moments of shame in the past couple of days.As part of pulling myself out of negative states, I've been reflecting on the different components of my experience of shame. I thought I'd document and share them here, rather than the issues of what happened and when. It's because similar patterns keep appearing, and I find it useful to analyse the experience - literally, pick apart - to help me manage and respond more effectively. It's like being able to see all the different parts of the experience, so that I can attend to them separately, and therefore more productively, rather than rolling around in a quagmire of distress.It would be interesting if other people wanted to comment or add their own experience....Anatomy of Shame.Shame for me seems to involve:A strong Inner Critic: I notice this in sentences I say to myself such as, "God! I'm such an idiot." ... or "I'm so stupid." ... or "That was so embarrassing! Ugh!" Or, it could manifest as a projection onto other people, imagining them to be thinking or talking negatively about me, criticising me behind my back or while I'm with them etc. Or I notice it in the images of other people's crumpled, disapproving faces, or fleeting scenes in my mind in which I am shunned from other people or some group.A felt sense of anxiety and distress: I notice uncomfortable or distressing sensations run through my whole body. In particular, I notice an urge to cover up or hide myself. My hands and arms want to move into my body and over my face as if to protect or hide away - from imagined scorn of others.An urge to run away: I see this as a kind of behavioural avoidance. I want to be away from people, run and hide myself. My body is twitching to "get out of there".Rumination: I notice that I obsessively think over the thing that "I did" that caused me to feel ashamed. Over and over, my mind rehearsing the scene of the incident, trying to work out "how bad" the supposedly shameful act was.Worry: I notice worry thoughts, which are similar to rumination but are about the future. "What will people think?" ... "Will people treat me differently?" ... The worry includes an obsessive look for evidence in the past. That is, the rumination of "What happened" ties in with the worry about "the consequences". One feeds the other.Externalised Anger: If I am experiencing shame by proxy of another person's behaviour, particularly someone who is close to me, then I notice Anger directed toward them. For example, if a family member - or someone associated with me - behaves in a way that I think is "shameful" to me, then I notice how i get enraged with their behaviour. It's like my inner critic is turned outwards to other people, as if I were still connected to the shameful act as if Ihad committed it.Controlling behaviour: This can come in many forms. It could be about stopping or controlling or correcting other people's so called "shameful" behaviour. I think the externalising anger can be underneath this, particular if I go into a scolding or lecturing mode. Controlling could also be about trying to rectify how people perceive me by trying to manage my behaviour to be more preferable to them, as I see it. It could be about trying to "work on myself more" so that I don't repeat the shameful act again in an overt way. Attacking Others: This stems from that externalising anger as well. Perhaps if I feel slighted by others, I might verbally or even sometimes - thankfully rarely - physically move to attack them. I see this as a defence against the feelings of shame, using blame and attack to regain a sense of power and strength. I also do this attack vovertly, internally devaluing other people while perhaps acting charming on the surface to control how they perceive me.Compulsive self-soothing: I notice the urge to use self-soothing behavioirs to find relief from the feelings of shame and distress in my body. This might involve something like comfort eating or the likes. Or, it includes a kind of grandiosity. Mirror-gazing after a shame attack, for example, provides an ego-boost through the form of self-admiration (about my appearance or me as aperson) or coinciding thoughts of my own superiority. Or it could be writing a post to get some upvotes and congratulation from people here. ;)So... There are some elements of shame that I notice. What about yours?. When I'm around other people, I have often had that feeling that I should be likeable to the other person I'm with."Should"It's a feeling that anything other than coming across as perfectly buoyant and upbeat is wrong, that people won't like it, that they'll judge me and think badly of me; that I will be ostracised, shamed. I was just sitting with someone I know and feeling that feeling that I need to be on my best behaviour with him. For him. I think it's heightened because the person I'm with is so bloody positive and energised himself. That feeling of needing to perform as the good person is more prominent with certain people like this.A memory pops up from childhood: of me being the smiling child for the guests we had at home.That's what we did as a family when people came round. I guess not always. But it was often enough to leave a relatively strong imprint. My Mum did it in particular, and I followed suit. A presentation mode. False. And I'm not just saying that because the "false self" is a buzz term for us here. She was all smiley and upbeat. I think at the time I did see that it wasn't her usual behaviour, but l also think I thought that's just what we did with guests.I continued that into adulthood, that presentation mode of politeness. Affable. Accommodating. Showing that I was conscientious of other people's feelings. Showing I'm listening by overly nodding, mirroring expressions in the other person, being all smiley and positive glow. The problem was, of course, that I often hid how I was really feeling, which meant that - I think - I couldn't connect with people. The energy required to maintain that "attentive face" was also difficult to uphold. I would frequently leave social situations to be on my own - in the bathroom, mainly - just to not smile for a little bit.I was just programmed to be like that with people.I also got an ego boost out of it, though - at least for a little while at these social events. I would show up to as "The Happy Person" ... "The Charming Listener." Yes, i'd get high on that and look down on people who were not looking happy and cheerful, but instead "miserable" to my mind. Or worse. I really did devalue people consistently in my social groups. Although I turned up all smiles to events, afterwards I would very often criticise pretty much everyone in our social circle who wa there. There wasn't really anyone who wasn't a target of my critique at some point or other. I would moan to my partner that I didn't like these people and that I didn't want to see them. At a couple of points, he made comments about us having fewer and fewer friends because of my judgements....The thing is, these patterns were still active relatively recently. I think I did try to get better around this issue since 2020, but it's really in the last year or so - since self-awareness - that things have changed for the better.I do feel increasingly like I can turn up to social situations and show how I feel - or at least enough to feel real inside. I feel like I have managed to uncover a real self with me, more or less, which I based on how I feel and how I want to come across.But ... Old habits die hard, and sitting with our friend just now, I felt that pull to be the polite, attentive, jolly listener... But - yay! - I noticed this, and made an effort to not yield to those patterns. I presented more how I was (am) feeling. A bit non-descript. A bit not bothered all in all.And then it came to me: it doesn't matter if he doesn't like me. Because look, my emotions, my feelings, don't make a bad or unlikeable person. My feelings are ok, and I don't gave to hide them.I looked across at him and saw him all bubbly and happy. He's a healthy fellow, and generally positive. And I had an image of myself at the same time as different, separate. Two different guys with different feelings, doing OK sitting next to each other, with neither one particularly accommodating the other. I think this is nice to notice. I am - god dammit - gradually becoming my own self, and showing people who I am and how I feel....There are some obstacles to this process external to my own habits, namely people who overtly say to me that I should look of act differently, smile more etc. It's my partner in particular. He also has narc tendencies, and seems to get over-anxious as to how I show up. I have to fairly often say that I'm fine as I am when I'm not "smiling with teeth" as he says. It's a bit of a joke in some ways, but it's also annoying because it's so frequent. And I just want to have my face not in a smiling position in certain situations. I notice that it's when we're around other people. And I'm really not being a dick or anything. And I know, of course, that it is right to show up civil and polite to a degree. Just not so much.Anyway, I don't want to be too defensive or irritable about it. But it is a thing to deal with. Just again, though: I'm not going back in that happy-faced box. I know that a real me exists, I'm cultivating him, and I'm putting him out there.So something really shifted today. Large crack in the ground stylee. I'm sure it'll close again. Probably. But this is to document the \*massive gaping hole\* that has just vomitted everywhere.Sorry for the post splurge. But some cool things came out. I felt rage and distress and loneliness and panic ... Nothing new. But somehow I managed to let it be there more than before. YES!I wanted to run, punch, scream, ... I felt like everything was falling down, whipping up. I didn't know who I was. This is not anything new. It happens fairly frequently. But I somehow had more room to be ok with it today.I felt, and still feel, slightly more buzzy than usual. It'll pass, but ... I said to a friend: *I am bundle of criss-crossed and flailing live wires. With a beard. And some not too bad pecs now. And the delicious glimmer of abs. And a nice smile.*I do feel that this criss-crossedness is a part of me - a big part - that I do hide from myself and others.I am a bit bonkers. My thoughts are totally wild. I don't have psychosis, but my imagination is insane and I get also sorts of violent and scary thoughts popping in a lot. Not all the time. But it can happen.My moods flit around like ping pong balls in a tiny metal room. I try to cover it up by looking \*cool\* and \*hot\* and \*sharp\* and \*nice\* and \*calm\* ... and I can be all those things, but I'm also ... underneath ... this bundle of live wires sparking off.I feel more ok with that.This is me, bitches!!But you already knew ... It was me who had to catch up....bla bla blaHere's the thing:I suddenly realised that everyone else is a bundle of nerves with a cover.AND ... I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO BE NICE TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE MEEEE. Or could be one day, so it's good to be nice.AND ...I got chatting with one person who I previously was really irritated by, and FELT CONNECTION and was more my bonkers self, and just said what was on my mind, and SHE LAUGHED!!! And we had a connection, and it was cooooooooooooooool.Maybe if I show my anger and dance fun and sadness and terror and style and spunkiness and cockiness and my fragility and mood and terror and delight and mania and tiny-ness and wish to doninate ... somehow I'll find myself and it'll help.This is why I look in mirrors.Title.It's so awful.When I reveal the depths of whatever this is .... out comes the lava ..... Panic.Right now.Flashing images of the guy on the train platform coming towards me with his terrifyingly distorted face, attacking me.Flashing images of me attacking everyone on this train.Me going mad.Distress like a tornado in my body.The feeling of MUST GET OUT OF HERE.NOW....Shift.To sadness. I can cope. ...I can't afford it. Few can.This group is basically all there is for working things out.It really fucking annoys me how fucking expensive therapy is.I paid £180 an hour from November to February. Specialist in Npd. All my savings.OK. But ...That's ... four and a half hour long piano lessons.At least the therapist is happy. Woop! Woop! Bringing in the cash.OK. More pockets of unknown shite still there.Watching videos of therapists talk about narcissism.I sense my reactivity towards what they are saying.Why do therapists trigger me so much? Fuck sake.I just want to jump on them and beat them to a pulp. Sometimes I have imagined slitting their throats. Or jumping on their faces and punching and punching. They bring up this rage that I quickly stifle. But I know that the stifling is not helping me.iI stifle. All the time. I shut down my rage because it feels totally unacceptable.Well... that monster is still there inside, but rather than feeling scared, I think he's sexy as hell. Nope. That's yet more grandiosity.It's that deep rage and that come with tears. It's that feeling of being judged so deeply by another person. A distress that immediately makes me want to flip out and attack and blame.Oh fuck.It's like, everything I do is about making myself look good to others, including the progress I've made with my disorder. Posts. Comments. Everything. Style. Politeness. Being nice. Acting. Trying. Working on myself.I can't get out of it.I can't make exact sense of this.I'm really, really fucking horny.I'm getting much better at tolerating not getting upvoted.Yay! Fuck you, social belonging anxiety. Woof!It's rather silly for a 40-something to be concerned about these things, but I know you know how it feels. We all want it. *Gimme that upvote high!!!*And:*Where's my upvote, BITCH!!!?*And:*No one loves me. I'm basically invisible / about to die.*And:*Terrible!!! I did something that people didn't like!!!*You know, don't get me wrong, I still have these thoughts and feelings. But they aren't nearly as intense. Nearly. ;)When I first joined the sub and for a fair while after, I would more frequently delete posts that didn't receive many upvotes. Out of shame, having been slumped at home in sadness and despair.I still do occasionally delete posts. But the last time was because I felt I wasn't being myself - maybe not even a good reason to delete. But anyways. I'm generally getting better at staying with what I've put out - you know, if I feel it's real, I guess - whether or not it flies so well.To me, this is progress. Ding ding! I am standing up for myself more, being less wavering and tossed around by what people think, and caring less about every opinion I receive or don't, or getting caught up if I do something that is "successful" or not.Yay. Growth in confidence. Woop! Woop!I've also noticed I feel more capable being honest about my thoughts, rather than hiding them in case they are criticised....Biff! Another angle would be:Fuck it. I'm invincible, mate!!🤘(P.S. I'm not. Don't hate me. 😁)...Edit: Blimey! This is a test! 😁. Today I have been grandiose in the morning, depressed variously throughout the afternoon, and calm and steady in the evening. But right now, I am really grateful for this journey of discovery. Right now, I don't care about the downs. I know that they'll come again, and I'll absolutely hate it. There will be suicidal ideation and depression and shame. But there is also something about all those things that provides an opportunity.I really love those moments when the downs turn into opportunities for discovery and learning. It's like finding little pieces of the puzzle and putting them together. I love building that picture and working it out over time. I love how I've gone from a really flimsy smiling face of a person, hiding all the anger and doubt and anxiety and shame and torment, to someone with more of a sense of who I am, and able to express much more of what's going on inside, and feel like a real person with an actual self. That is really cool! I still have some weird experiences in terms of feeling fake, feeling empty, suddenly feeling very close to people and loving, before then feeling totally separate and isolated and full of hate and disdain. But I try to be mindful of what is going on, challenge my thoughts and feelings as best I can, and try to find some middle ground.I feel sorry for my young self before self-awareness I was trapped and very troubled. I raged a lot and had terrible panic everyday. Body dysmorphia. Eating disorders. OCD. Hypochondria. The works. All based around this very narcissistic personality structure that I had no clue about at the time, really. But I did the best that I could. I didn't know any better. It's nice to overcome a lot of that, even though the remnants are still there. I can still be pulled down by various things, but not nearly as strongly.My mind may never be completely stable. But in a way, I would kind of hate if that happened. I enjoy this journey where the weirdness of my brain and my reactions to things puzzles me, and drives me to find a solution. ...Late this afternoon, I was tired from - quite frankly - overworking. Again. I had a bit of a low point. Someone I'm working with was not getting their work done and it felt like it was really holding me back. I felt the anger and frustration and blame. I felt, too, the sadness underneath, and I started crying to myself, just walking down the street. It happens. Just gentle, quiet tears of frustration. It was part sadness and part kicking-and-screaming and blaming.I imagined my various 'inner good parents' step in with their messages that would calm me down. The message that really hit home was "I know you are so tired and frustrated. Now, this is what we're going to do... We're going to take it one step at a time. We're going to remember all the good things you've been able to do today..." etc etc. It really helped soothe me and shifted me into a more calm and steady state where I felt capable and strong.That was a cool experience. It's little things like that that drive me on. Every day. Every day I work on myself. Every interaction with people is hard in some way. But ... I am just trying to balance so much and make this life work as best as it can. It involves a lot of self-confrontation, moderating, taming, refining, tempering, nudging forward, holding back ... But I love this journey, as rocky as it may be.I'm sure I'll be desperately low tomorrow over some thing. But I'm also sure I'll find a way out. I know that by now.It is also seriously great to meet and hang out with some of the most deep, caring (lol) and inspiring people I've ever known, and feel that connection between us.Yay!. Which one do I choose for my story of growth and recovery? *Trigger Warning.*Which one do I go for for my suicidal ideation? *Upbeat Talk.*...Ah ha ... That pattern of childish rebellion ... That feeling of being caged in, and the explosion out ... That [Rhombicosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicosidodecahedron) being forced through a square hole ...That core need for autonomy childhood, chronically unmet ... ...*Well done, Peanut. Feel the feelings. Attend to your inner child.* Nope!I want to have a party and do wild mock interpretative dancing a la Kate Bush in the 1980s in front of everyone without drinking a drop of alcohol because I'm that special that I can do that. I hope everyone is jealous.*Don't tell me what to do!*Thanks. Venting - advice requested....*Chooses Flair. Cries.*. No I did not.I spent a considerable amount of time, picking, putting on, checking, enjoying my reflection, imagining what people will think, imagining people admire my looks, semi-consciously rehearsing my modest replies.Started with that tiny t-shirt that no one wears on a Tuesday work day. Tucked in. Ugh! Yes. But too much. Too obvious, complete with my sparkly glasses and over-quaffed hair. Such a narc. But actually: who cares!! Fuck 'em! Actually, shit! I do care. Too much. Try on that shirt over the top for the more casual look. Hm. Terrible shoulder projection. Tucked in. Yes!!! So sexy!!! But no, obvious porn star wannabe again. Untuck shirt and t-shirt. The sad compromise. Phew. I look good not too good. Totally casual. But you can still see my workout progress.Check mirror just one more time, or three, and... stare for a second, and... breakfast! "I'm coming!"*he glows into the kitchen*THE LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT.Hang on a mo...Other people are not two dimensional caricatures. Ooooooooo....They may look a certain way in their demeanour, but underneath is this mysterious Pandora's box of possibilities.They may look miserable right now. But they might suddenly burst into jokes and giggles.They may appear calm and sensible to me on first impression, but they may turn out to be rather lazy or slightly bonkers today.It's difficult to know what to expect. People surprise.Oh yeah! 😁...Does anyone else have this where they very easily and quickly box people into two dimensional "You are this or that"? Is this particular an NPD or PD thing? I kind of think it might be. I've noticed that I very easily seem to do this compared with others around me. When I cast my silly judgements or assessments of people, for example, my partner or friends suggest that things are more complex, and that I'm being too inflexible in my view.So, sitting on this train home, looking at people around me, it feels cool and nice and open in my body to shift this more fixed perspective of people towards something more complex and dynamic and surprising.Oh!. I have found this hard in life, accepting and appreciating other people's talents and abilities and skills and achievements and successes. Even close friends. Even my partner.But ... it's something I've worked on quite a bit over many years. It's gotten easier. And more often I can find myself actually enjoying other people's talents, rather than feeling that tug of envy in my chest.Tonight we went to a birthday party. Cheesy music on the dance floor. I work in music and have spent a lifetime listening to music as a kind of "work". What can I learn from this musician? How can I be as good or better than them? Why aren't I successful? Fantasising about my own potential. etc etc You know the drill.Tonight, I noticed that I just enjoyed the music and the musicians without comparing myself or getting twitchy about my own abilities or status (or lack of status) as a musician.I thought, "Oh, this is what normal people must feel like listening to music."It was ... very nice.To reduce stigma, some refer to BPD as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.Would you re-name NPD for a similar purpose? If so, what?I'm going with SERD for now: Self-Esteem Regulation Disorder, which I think I picked up from elsewhere. I think it would help me explain the symptoms and behaviour to people. I wonder if I would feel less isolated and less concerned talking about it.Also, SERD just rolls off the tongue. Clearly.SERD! 🌈. It's such a bad and swift turnaround, it's also funny.I should really know better by now. But I contine to fool myself, it seems.Us self-aware narcs are not always so different from (supposedly) healthy people.Everyone has narcissistic defences. Ours are just more pronounced and much more dysfunctional.But everyone has that armour, or can do.But here's our advantage as the self-aware crowd. We (hopefully, but not always) \*recognise\* at least some of our defences. And because we have a tendency towards hypersensitivity, hypervigilance, and over-analysis, we may (I think) see more of the layers of our defences, the subtleties and nuances, and talk openly about them (here at least). On average, I'd say most people don't....Defences come in all guises. Grandiosity, yes. Going on the attack. Antagonism. Angry rumination. Martyrdom. Complaining. But also just simple detachment from emotions.Everyone does this.Last night I was with a few friends at dinner. One friend brought up how she was worried about her Mum and Dad, the latter in particular because he was experiencing pain I his side, had previously had cancer, but had been ignoring the pain and the doctor or telling anyone until just recently. She shared her news and revealed a glimpse of her fears. I felt like she was human and I was human. I felt connection to her where previously I was struggling.Within surely less than a minute, another friend chipped in to say something like, "It's probably nothing", and turned the conversation towards something else. The friend with the unwell Dad followed along. The window of vulnerability opened and was quickly closed. I felt the moment where we could connect fall away from me.There it was in the group. Detachment. Cutting off from emotions that might be "too much", "awkward" or "intolerable".I felt lonely again, me with my feelings I sensed there was less room for. I closed up....When I teach my piano students, I try to notice my own state or mode as much as possible, and how the student is responding. I notice that when I've been in a more grandiose state, it feels fun and I feel awesome, and students may tag along with the energy for a while. Perhaps there is some comfort in being with a teacher who distracts them from their own feelings, through becoming the centre of attention in my jokes or quirkiness or through playing in a show-off or extravagant manner. But the sense of comfort and ease in the room doesn't last long. Quite quickly I notice that I become disconnected from the student. They are "over there" and I am "over here". We aren't vibing off each other.I think this is problematic for the student and the teaching, particularly in a one to one teaching context. The disconnection feels quite isolating for both of us. Quite lonely and even a bit scary for the student. In order for the learning to be "good", they need a sense of secure connection with the teacher. And it's true. When I'm in a more balanced, emotionally in-touch state, in tune with what's going on within me, sensing what is happening potentially in the student, verbally checking in with them and listening to their responses, and yet having that overall sense of stability and level-headedness, then the teaching can work better. I notice that students relax more and open up. They share their feelings about playing and we work to resolve problems that I could only know about if they are shared. Or it could be about them sharing their interests or preferences for the direction of travel in the lessons. That opening up allows them their autonomy, which is another key ingredient to success when we work together: I'm doing some guiding, but they are also participating and speaking up about what feels right for them in that moment. If I'm grandiose or detached - not checking in, not open about my own experience - then they don't have so much room to express themselves, and the lessons are about me more than them. And that's not good.I'm not saying that the good teaching is absolutely and totally dependent on my behaviour. But how I show up has at least some impact. And it is my responsibility, I believe, as the adult and professional, to think about these things and try to do my best for the client. Grandiosity is not totally awful and can create some kind of spark in the room. It can even lift people for a while, which is no bad thing. But if it is too strong or too prolonged, disconnection entails, and the learning process - and the joy of music - falls a bit flat....A core part of me, however much I deny it when I'm grandiose or emotionally detached, yearns for connection. I think we all do. It's a fundamental human need.I s'pose this post is aiming at a few things. A reminder for myself to notice that grandiosity or detachment within myself, and to try to find ways of softening the armour, to be more open, even vulnerable, to foster connection with others.I can't deny that there's also a bit of "come on, guys" to this post. I like you for you. Sometimes I feel that our defences get in the way of connecting here, in this special place - where we have that opportunity to connect. ...I say: let's go for it.If you are anything like me, you are sensitive, you have a sensitive temperament. People have told you that you are reading into things that aren't there. You are told that you are too much, too intense, think too much, are full of woe, or have too much energy, too happy, even.It can be lonely being an emotional and sensitive person. It can become easier to put forward what we think is an acceptable presentation of ourselves for others, hiding the fluid and intense feelings underneath. At the same time, it can feel like very few people seem to understand our emotional landscape inside, so we retreat inwards, becoming hyperautonomous and over-introspective, lost in our own thoughts, analysing our feelings, maybe seeing them as superior to that of others.These are perhaps some of the ways that narcissism has manifested in me, which leads to other self-interested behaviours that add to the suffering of feeling lonely and not understood, alien....But the intense feelings are also a gift. This is a tricky line to tread, because it can be easy - certainly for me - to over-treasure and over-personalise these gifts as "ours", making us special, better. So we have to be on guard for this kind of thinking that further separates us from other people, when what we really need is connection and understanding.At the same time, I think we can enjoy our emotions and find solace within them. Intense emotions allow me to experience life with greater passion. I find fulfilment through sorrow and grief, not just resting on everyday, superficial emotions. I have many emotional peaks throughout my days. They can be tough, but I am also grateful for them. It has been a difficult life sometimes. But rich. Very rich. Just being in my body every day.Maybe a view that accounts for both sides of the coin can help keep us level-headed. We are both unlucky and lucky. Recognising the pluses and minuses gives me a sense of balance, and both limits my tendency towards self-aggrandisement and keeps me from a sense of unhelpful self-pity....One of the things I like about this forum is that it is filled with intense people, quite willing to go to the depths. Very fulfilling. I am glad.We can get better. ...Another low effort post.Oh! ...Low effort post. Sorry. But that's it.I had a post earlier about what being kind to ourselves means to different people here.It occurred to me that - of course - for many of us, we struggle to even know what it is to be kind or self-compassionate, because we didn't experience it, or it wasn't modelled to us in childhood.When I started my own journey of recovery about 13 years ago, I also really had very little clue about compassion in some respects. My attempts at compassion for others were more like grandiose manipulations of their emotions, positioning myself as "the person to lean on", being "the wise advisor" and so on. Yes, it wasn't all bad. People may have got things from the interaction. But for me, it was probably more about feeling good about myself, and seeing myself as the bigger, better, wiser person, rather than actually connecting with the person in need. I didn't really have a feeling of connection with them, I don't think. It was more: what can I get out of this interaction? If they feel good at the end, then I will feel good, and that was probably more of the main goal.Attempts at self-compassion ... ? I mean, I didn't know. I remember during therapy in 2020, my therapist "introduced" the idea of compassion to me. It was kind of new to me. I didn't really have a feeling about it. I said I would try to be compassionate to myself, but it wasn't really something I felt. It was more of a logical, cognitive exercise.One time in therapy again last year, I was doing a particular exercise in self-compassion. My therapist asked me to think about what my "healthy adult / role model" might do in a particular imagined situation. I pulled from a list of ideas I had made in the previous year, which I'd jotted down on a piece of paper. Having said out loud what I'd do, I quickly burst into tears, realising that while I knew the answer now, it was something that took me so many years to work out. I was sad for my younger self who didn't experience the compassion a child should receive, and so had to strive to learn it as an adult in a very haphazard way,Now, I do have a better understanding of being nice to myself and others, but it didn't come from me. It took effort, and I had to look for it from other people: by observing friends, characters in films and TV, and podcasters like Tara Brach - who really taught me a lot in particular.So it was a bit presumptuous of me earlier to ask people how they could be kind to themselves today, when it took me a very long time to work it out. I didn't think clearly about it.I had to outsource it. It doesn't come from us. But I do believe it's possible for us to internalise and make our own the behaviours - and eventually feelings - of other people.As I said, one personal go-to in my journey was Tara Brach. She also teachers meditation, and while I found her meditations really nice, it was really the podcast talks that were helpful. I learnt so many things through her talks. I imagined her as my new inner parent. I would speak to her in my mind's eye: "I'm stuck. What should I do?" ... And I would, because I'd listened to her so much, more and more easily imagine what she might say back to me in various situations: "I see you're hurting. I see you're angry. I'm so sorry you're struggling." Just that - that empathy delivered to myself through my imagination - was enough sometimes to help me calm down. I remember that when I couldn't sleep at nice because I was so enraged, imagining Tara Brach come to my bedside like a mother figure, sit down on the bed, rest her hand on my body and say, "I'm so sorry you're hurting right now" ... that would allow me to relax and drift off to sleep.I still struggle with real empathy sometimes, but it's better. When I can't connect properly, I can still say the words that I learnt from Tara Brach, and feel that they might have a positive impact on people like they had on me. It's like: passing on what I learnt through her. It's also far less grandiose than it used to be. I've learnt to let the other person work it out for themselves more, with just little nudges, rather than dictating how I think they "should" think or feel or reflect. Yes, there is still some grandiosity involved on my side, but it's less and less.So there you go. I just wanted to say that.No jokes or cynicism. 😁For me, it's lowering - even by just a knotch - the demands and expectations I put on myself to be productive and perfect in all spheres of life all the time.For once, not doing, but just being. Not pushing forward fast. Allowing life to unfold on its own a but more. Strolling rather than sprinting. Whoops. I dropped the juggling balls. Oh well. I'll pick them up some other time. It's be OK.That is the kind of kindness I need today. What about you? It could be completely different.I'd say these are two core features of my personality, as I currently see it. I wondered if other pwNPD relate in their own way.A comment by u/KickLongjumping4433 got me thinking about these aspects of me.In Schema, they sometimes talk of a 'Defiant Child' mode, which is an "angry response to having one’s autonomy curtailed and being told what to do."Then there is the Rebel Mode in Schema. A Schema theorist I like, David Edwards, quoted some key statements linked to this mode of behaviour: “I dislike rules and can get satisfaction from breaking them,” “I think of myself as a rebel; I often go against the established authority,” and “I enjoy being unconventional, even if it’s unpopular or I don’t fit in.” He goes onto say: "This mode externalises a backstage Defiant Child, and incorporates a narrative that portrays it as a valuable identity. Expression may range from being more passive-aggressive to being actively, even militantly rebellious."...I definitely have these elements in me. And I think it's important to keep in mind that they arise in response to a sense that autonomy is being taken away or denied. Or was in the past, as a child. We have a core need to individuate / differentiate from other people, and ... this is an undeveloped part of me. I didn't properly go through the individuation process because of my over-bearing, enmeshing mother and terrifying father. No space for 'me'.I really see where this lack of autonomy comes from in myself, and why it's such a big trigger for the defiant part of me. When I feel like my independence and sense of personal choice as an adult is undermined or unfairly questioned, like it was in childhood, I get angry really quickly. RAGE! There is a teen-like "Fuck you!" flavour to the anger. Two fingers up. Slammed doors. Vent post.I guess the rebel mode in me, if it's linked to this sense of angry defiance underneath, is the lighter and more playful version of this rage. It's the mischief in me, as I've identified many times before. Disgusting jokes. Pranks. Banter. Giggling about my misdemeanours. Revelling in the naughtiness.I've mentioned, for instance, that I see myself as quite emotionally immature in some respects, or at least that this can come forth in me fairly often. I feel an almost mischievous glee about this aspect of my personality. Again, I think it connects to that sense of rebellion: "I'll behave like a teenager, and it'll make me different, annoying, unconventional etc." But I think it also reveals that underlying angry defiance. It has a kind of: "Fuck you, social conventions!" flavour in there too. I'm not great with rules....I'm sitting on the bed - like a teenager - typing this. Ahead of me is a large mirror. Occasionally, I'm looking up and channelling that rebel / defiant mode through my face, to see what comes up.Gosh. I actually do this often throughout my day! Lol. This is the mode that pops out in the bathroom mirror, for example, when I run there to escape the adult dinner party conversations that I detest. I pull this face to myself. What is it saying? ... "Don't fuck with me!" ... "I don't give a fuck." ... "You're all a bunch of wankers." ... "Fuck this boring shit." ... Maybe I'm thinking these and similar things to myself in the mirror because I feel I can't say them to the people I'm with. Maybe I use the mirror to express or display parts of myself generally that I feel not able to say out loud. I kind of put those parts of me into the mirror, where they are safe. The mirror is a safe space to express myself. Oohhhhhhhh!...The thing is, if I follow the Schema model, then underneath all of that is the vulnerable childlike part of me. A part of me LOVES being this rebel, and wants to deny that there is anything else going on. But to do that would not do myself any favours. It would be to keep me stuck in a way of coping with life - through feeling and being rebellious (passive and active) - rather than actually attending to any wounds underneath that are driving those parts of me ... to, quite honestly, behave in ways that I can regret or bring me a sense of shame in the aftermath.So as I continue to gaze into the mirror, I also find a safe moment to express other things to myself. The mirror is my display cabinet for my deeper emotions I feel unable to share anywhere else.A sadness quickly reveals itself. Loneliness. Fatigue. Bleakness. Depression. Feeling ugly. Feeling unwanted. Feeling unloved. Totally.I spend a moment staring at my face, which shows all these emotions and more that I can't describe properly. It feels good to acknowledge that these feelings are there. I suddenly realise how tired I am.Life is tiring for many reasons. Just tapping into one particular aspect, though, it's tiring not being able to express my emotions in public, or at least *feeling* like I can't. It's tiring feeling like I have to wrap up my emotions in some publicly acceptable presentation that doesn't feel natural to me. It's tiring and frustrating. My sadness shifts to a childlike anger: "Why can't I just say what I want, how I want?! Why do I have to follow these rules of self-expression when they are so stifling and unnatural?" I feel sad again. ...And then I feel that playful rebel part of me come through. It's like a way of distracting myself from he sadness and frustration. There he is in the mirror once more, and I feel my thoughts turn to mischievous things I might think or do later in the day, just to "get my own back". Hm. Defiance. Feeling controlled again, and so engaging in thoughts and behaviours that give me a sense of taking back control, or defying the authority that I don't agree with....I do like this rebellious and defiant part of me, though. Yes, it's immature, and I can do or say some things in that mode that later induce shame, but there are also many upsides. People laugh at my stupid jokes and silly, childlike behaviour. ATTENTION! But the mood of the room lightens.It actually also works well in my work as a piano teacher, where, depending on the appropriateness of the moment, I can be playful and cheeky and poke fun at social norms (especially around music performance and assessment, for example), and it's all part of the package: the slightly quirky piano teacher, helping people escape - for 30 minutes at least - the trappings of school or adult life. I play a bit of the fool if it feels right to do that, and the intention is to lighten the mood sometimes, and give space for people to undo their social conformity, get a bit more childlike themselves and connect with and lose themselves in the music - which is what we're aiming for....I don't want to get rid of the rebel in me. He's funny and cute and energising. But I do think it would be good to recognise where he comes from as well, and tend to that sadness underneath a bit more....Now, where's my rocket. 🚀. I have gotten a lot of helpful comments to posts since I started writing here.Recently, a few people have pointed out my potential black and white thinking on various situations. On reflection, I do see that I still struggle with this style of split-off thinking and perception of myself, other people and the world around me.My understanding is that this is a feature of NPD. I just re-watched a HealNPD YouTube video on integration and splitting, and related to it a lot.I generally see myself as split into 'parts' that feel radically different from one another. Some I instinctively feel are 'all good' while others I perceive as 'all bad'. Well, that is my tendency anyhow. I am trying to enjoy and appreciate that sides that I previously felt terrified to acknowledge. And I am also experimenting right now in seeing the downsides of my "pure hearted" parts. But my mental reflex is still to see these parts as cut off from one another and either dastardly or wholesome. It feels hard right now to perceive a middle ground. Grey areas in my thinking are appearing, I guess. But it takes conscious effort to think like this.I also have the habit of associating my "real self" with these different parts at any given time. When I'm in a low mood, I can easily think, "Oh. That's the real me." But when I'm grandiose or otherwise, I think just the same and ignore the low mood from before. In either state, it feels difficult to imagine that the "real me" is both or the opposite of where I am currently at. I am also obsessed with trying to figure out who "I really am". It's another mental reflex that I have to consciously pull myself away from often.Historically, I have tended to see people as "all bad" or "all good". In the past, I would easily want to discard people in my life who I thought were "evil" or against me or not worth the effort because they were "boring" or "stupid" or "aggressive". I would also idealise some other people as being "good-natured" or "great".These days, I still have that tendency. But I do more readily see people as more than one thing.But I now find it confusing that some other people are much more "blended" than I am. I see there "good" and "bad" qualities, but I don't see those parts as split off from one another. Some people don't shift in and out of different "modes" of behaviour and mood like I do. They are more "one thing with subtle flavours."I see that other people do have quite different sides to them that appear in different contexts. But I somehow don't perceive that as problematic in them, whereas it feels totally problematic that this could be the case with me. The idea that I am not constant confuses me and feels "wrong".I am a kaleidoscope of moving parts that come to the surface, and I don't really know anything different. It feels very disorientating to live in a kaleidoscope, with parts that I cannot hold onto for long, or comprehend as ok or me or real. I am constantly questioning my sense of identity. How can I be both terribly kind and a complete cunt at different times? To others, that might not seem like an issue or something worth worrying about. But to me, my sense of identity plays on my mind every day. Who the fuck am I? The cunt or the cute kind one? It really bothers me. How can I be both?When I am with people, I feel these different parts rise and fall in my persona. They can be very intense and radically different. Rage then anxiety then cockiness then tearfulness then joy. I think I try my best to appear as one person, trying to present a stable image to the world, or as I imagine the people I'm with would want me to be. That has always been my tendency. But it is quite an anxious state, where I'm simultaneously managing what's going on underneath, which is a lot. My therapist said she could see waves of emotions pass quickly through me in session. That is me without the mask on. A montage reel of contrasting parts, flipping very quickly from one to the other. A multipart chorus of voices singing in different tonalities. I feel I am getting better. So that's good. It feels very hard to do this sometimes, but I am trying to present to people more how I want to be or feel in the moment, rather than how I instinctively and subconsciously imagine they want me to appear. It still feels anxiety inducing and challenging. I guess this comes down to feeling like I "had" to be one thing but not another as a child. I had to appear to get along with my parents, for example, even though they terrified or mistreated me. I had to pretend to the world that everything was fine a home, even though it was a scary place to live. I felt I had to please my parents by presenting in particular ways but hiding others. Then being a musical child gave me a place to really escape all of that. I would get attention and shine on the little stage. I would enjoy living inside that bubble of peace and excitement.Writing this makes me feel sad that the trauma or neglect I experienced as a child had such an impact on my brain.I know a little about what's going on here, but would appreciate any more input. What I am really hoping for is some understanding and guidance.Rip off the mask and underneath there is a really nasty side of me. It is not all of me, but it is a real part. I've written about it elsewhere a few times, but I guess I'm coming back to it to try to consolidate my thoughts a bit further.You see, I'm on this journey of mine. I want some kind of reconciliation of my various parts, however contrasting. I want some kind of integration, rather than this splitting of my psyche. I don't want to present in one way to people but feel completely different underneath, or try to push that other side away from my being. Or at least I want to do that less and less, or when it's only necessary. I don't want to split into different and distinct modes so much. I want to have access to more of my whole self, and use those different sides more wisely.I just ... want to be whole. It's not like I'm starting from scratch at this point, but ... that's my journey, which I don't mind repeating and repeating. I want it. I want it....So this nasty side... Once again, like many of my 'tricky parts' it seems, I have hidden it from others, and denied it to myself. Shut it down. Tried to quieten it or change it. Step away from it. Let it shrivel.But it keeps coming back. It won't change. It's just 'there'. An aspect of my personality.It actually pops out when I look in the mirror. It's there in my eyebrows. Lol. :)This nastiness has many flavours:It is rebellious to authority. Antagonistic. Highly irritable. Fractious. Wanting to scold, belittle, shame, lecture, control others close to me. It is sneering at people. It is reducing them to an object that I can mentally demean and ridicule. It is taking some pleasure in shocking people, intimidating them, making them uncomfortable. It is wanting to start arguments only to gain the upper hand. Doing things that most people would find somewhat shocking. It is petty and vengeful. It sometimes imagines doing harm to others. It is pure, wicked mischief.In another post recently, I wrote about a power-hungry side of me. In some ways, this feels a bit different. But these two sides, I guess, could potentially combine. I'm not sure right now.That would be quite something if they did combine and were let loose....This nasty side of me has, in particular, caused me great anxiety in the past. Like: panic for it even being there. *Where did it come from? Is this the real me? Help! I thought I was a good person. I want to be that good person!* But, thankfully, that anxiety has been diminishing through some self-work I've been doing.This past year, I have actively tried to recognise it when it appears and allow it in through my mind and body. In time, I have grown to appreciate but also enjoy it. It has a wild and electrifying energy that really excites me.Apologies for being graphic, but it's become a real turn-on when I'm having a wank. It just really does it for me, and I'd say is part of what I'd call my autosexuality. It's like I'm turned on by this really cuntish side of my being.I can also now look in the mirror at myself and, rather than see it and deny it, change my face to obscure it - I can instead think, "I really like this wicked side of me" and not flinch neatly so much. In fact, I feel the thrill of it....And yet: do I actually want to be a cunt to people? Er ... *No ? ? ?*No. I don't want to hurt people. I don't like that.But it's not a 100% no, either. The nastiness is still there. And I quite like the mischievous aspect of it. It's entertaining, both in the moment and talking about it with similarly-minded or accepting others. There are also ways I have recently discovered to enact this nasty mischief that don't actually cause people harm, but do cause considerable pleasure and thrill.Naughty Peanut....There are definitely aspects of it that I don't want. I don't want to be a dick to my partner, my family, friends or people at large. I don't like scolding or ridiculing my partner or other people. I don't want to lash out at people. I don't want to overtly demean people. I want connection. I want to see people as whole in themselves. I don't want to be controlling of others. I want to let them to exist as they choose. I want to help people more. I want to try to get along with more people. I want to be more generous (though it's quite an effort sometimes!).But again: I want connection....And yet, I do want the energy of that nasty side. I guess just without the behavioural nastiness.I'm hoping that, now I've acknowledged it and enjoyed its presence, I can keep it in mind, draw from its energy, but without the mental or behavioural degrading of others.That covert mischievous aspect seems like it could be an answer. Revelling in little non-harmful misdemeanours in private. And having a good ol' wank about it.I could be kidding myself again, but I'm hoping that can help with the reconciliation and integration.I'm nervous posting this.Not so much about the title, but about whether I've been able to explain my experience effectively....I've been on this path of trying to be more honest with myself, allowing parts of my psyche to be acknowledged and felt, so I can be authentic to myself at the very least.It's not a new thing. It's been going on for a while, this trying to peel back the layers.When I access some hidden or shunned part of me, there is a burst of energy that feels amazing. A real high. It's also psychologically wonderful to acknowledge and accept and even celebrate parts of me that I previously felt ashamed of. Then it settles and becomes a part of me that I accept and recognise as an element of 'me'. It's something I've been doing this year more and more....Today, with a new zeal for this process, I felt a part come forward that I've been scared of, and written about elsewhere. I've always tried to shut it down. But today I was ready to allow it in.It was interesting to feel it come forward when I was out in public. It came through in how I felt in my body and on my face. I noticed it in my thinking and feelings about myself and others.At first it was just a feeling, but I allowed it to come forward more and take centre stage. If it were a character, they would be ... dastardly, cunning, manipulative.And then I realised what was at the core of this part: a real lust for power.It reads a little inconsequential when I read that back now. But that lust, craving, yearning for power, dominance, recognition, status is an important and not small part of me.I allowed it in, allowed my thoughts to be focused on gaining and having power. The energy release that came over me was massive, like a huge sexual energy.I was walking in the street. I tilted my head back and looked to the sky like I was having an orgasm. That energy coursing right through me. It felt fucking fantastic, thinking about power....There I was in the street, and I acknowledged it to myself. I have a huge lust for power, and all the above I've described.Status. Ugh.Reputation. Drool.It's been there since I can remember. It drives my actions, even though I've tried to deny it, shut it down.But today, I said to myself that this is not just a part of me. I said: *I AM power hungry*. For someone who has been trying or pretending (to others and myself) to be the 'good guy' my whole life, this is a huge step. It felt massive.I dived back into that part of me. I had thoughts of manipulating people to gain status, a good reputation, recognition etc ... Wow! What a turn on!I thought of how people in my life give me compliments for my work. Something so small. But again: that quite sexually charged rush as I realise what I'm in it for. That feeling of being on top.Admired.Revered.Ugh. Drool. DROOL!!!!!Literally cum in my pants....Whenever I felt this part of me before, I was scared what I would do with this drive for power at the helm. Would I hurt people?Would I want to hurt people to gain power?Maybe this sounds ridiculous to you reading this. I guess I'm condensing quite a lot of work and experience into short paragraphs. But ... I did a test. I walked passed a few people and noticed how my body reacted. I usually feel small physical urges pretty well. I was curious to see if an urge to hurt people would come through with this part of me being more dominant.But ... no. Nothing.Maybe it'll be there another time and surprise me. But ... no. No urge to hurt people to gain power.Oh! Didn't see that coming.I mean, no judgement if you do actually want to hurt people. I get that others here might have that. But ... I don't.Neutral....I went to a shop. A homeless man sat outside the door. I asked him if I could buy any food for him. As we had our exchange, I observed what was happening in my mind and body. Interesting how that lust for power died down. I bought the food, gave it to him, didn't really feel that much for it. Then went back to my thoughts of power lust and having an orgasm in the street....And another thing. I thought about other people having power as well. And, oh yes: that's why I get envious. But, wait... it also just turned me on more. To be around people with that same lust as I have.WOOF!Hello r/NPD!...I also realised that this lust secretly drives my behaviours: in my work, in my relationships. Oh ... I'll be nice, if I get the power out of it.And oh, I'll work hard and do well for others, for the recognition.But also true is that in the moment of working with others, I don't actually feel that power drive, that yearning for grandiosity. I work one-to-one to help people feel good and be creative. My focus is on them in the room for the most part.But I tell where that lust for power comes out: between sessions. That's when I self-aggrandise about how brilliant I am and have been. Or when, as I said, I get compliments....The do-gooding part feeds the power-hungry part.The power-hungry part drives the actual do-gooding....But also ... I realised and felt inside that when it comes to it, when the chips are down ... I'll ignore or dismiss my power craving and do the right thing for people.Interesting.The fear of this part of me dissipates. Just something to enjoy....It doesn't even make me feel that relieved. It's just how it is. Neutral....PEANUT (wants all the) POWER.So obvious.At least now I know.BUT ...What?Both power-hungry AND ok to share with others.WHAT?...I deny some of my thoughts and feelings to even myself. I'm trying not to. That's a big task for me. Here I am, trying.I'm trying to be whole.I want to go further along this path, to see all the different parts of me and accept them. But I'm scared....Sometimes I feel I present to myself and the world that I am this pure-hearted, clean-thinking guy.And I do feel love. Not for everyone. Maybe ultimately only really for my partner. I'm scared that he'll die and then I'll have no one who I actually love.I have thought that I would probably kill myself if he died.DRAMAS!But true: I have thought about it....I am happy-go-lucky and bouncy in my presentation in public.But that's not all that's going on.I'm incredibly self-obsessed and selfish, and can be quite vicious underneath. That's what I hide from people. I hide from myself as well.Is it that I aim to get along with people in my life, but that's about it?The feeling of power is intoxicating for me. Any kind of power.I write my chirpy emails to my clients, thank my colleagues for their help. I maintain that connection. Appearing all cheerful and like I care.But I also sense this other, exciting part of me that wants them to like me so I can dominate and be on top. Shine. Be brilliant. Own the room. Just dominate. Ooof. It's definitely there. And it's not a nice part of me.It's actually quite a nasty side. Sneering. Judgemental. Using people. Manipulative. I've been scared of this part of me all my life. Is this the real me, after all?FUCK!!!!!It is a real part of me, for sure. I feel it.I worry about what would happen if this part of me took over.I worry about what I could or would do, without a care.The darkest part of my humanity....Is it possible to be so cheerful and nice and enjoy connections, and yet on the other side be so damn ... black hearted?FUCK!....Do I actually like people at all? Anyone?Thinking about it ... Yes. I actually do. I do. Thank God. Thinking about people I know. I do. I feel it. Thank fuck. It feels like a relief to feel those nice feelings about people.Phew ... Sigh ... But it's like I'm clinging onto the edge of a cliff here. Holding onto the good.Desperate not to fall. In case......That nasty side of me. The side that gives me a great feeling of energy and power.Dare I say it, but it's actually an evil side to me....A colleague just came into the room as I typed this.I chatted with her. Her presence felt warm and kind. I enjoyed being with her. I felt equal. I felt connected. Oh thank God. There it is again: that nice feeling. I AM OKAY!!!...Am I deceiving myself for even thinking that I have this 'dark side'? No. It's there. He's there. That flavour of Peanut.Charged with energy. Evil glint in the eye....I have had this idea that my contrasting sides could somehow integrate, blend.I say, sometimes, that some mid-point between dark and light is this cheeky wanker middle man: a cunt with a heart. 🌈...I dunno. Another colleague just came up.I liked being with him. We chatted. It felt natural. Easy.No cheeky wanker....Or maybe I was just mirroring him. ... Ugh.My mind.Who the fuck am I?...Why do I have these thoughts? Is this NPD or another issue?What? Just generally: what? How? Who? ...Who's deceiving who?Am I deceiving you all here? Sometimes. I'm trying not to....Does anyone have a clue about any of this?. Are your narcissistic traits constant or do they glitch on and off?In my work as a piano teacher, I find my narcissism is often out of the picture. In that moment with students, I do devote most of my energies to the person, or to managing my own emotions and wellbeing so I can show up and be present for them in a healthy way.Outside of that context, I can be a right narcissistic silly cunty twat. Mostly covert. Mostly. But again, not always. It's interesting how different situations ignite my narcissism, while others don't.Enough about me. When are you narcissistic and when are you not?What is it that brings out your narcissistic defences? What triggers you?Or ... Are you narcissistic all the time?. I'm knackered as I write this.I'm so tired. Work. Over work. I do that. Physically shattered. Mentally barely here right now.I read some bit of Schema Therapy research that connected proneness to fatigue and burnout with the Unrelenting Standards schema. I have this schema. It's common for people with NPD, apparently.I have sort of burned out a few times in adulthood for sure. Anyone else?Very high standards. Rigid expectations. Perfectionism. Of course. Of course.The drive to be on top. The best. Harder. Faster. Better.Drive. Drive. Drive.Do you relate?///I had a really hard day, work-wise. Physically demanding. I felt dizzy from the stress. But I also thought: "Hey, at least I'll be burning loads of calories and will therefore look good whilst fainting."I hated today, but also found solace and joy in pushing myself.Feeling that I'm on top of everything and pushing hard gives me a bit of a thrill.Feeling that I look good whilst doing the work gives me a boost of energy.Do you get that?///Of course, I'm also working to tame this side of me. A calm breath. A stroll instead of a walk. A break instead of doing anything. But that underlying push to the top of my game is always there and needs managing. ///I have a thing called 'wellbeing Thursday' in order to give myself a break in the week. Thursday mornings ARE MINE! Everyone else can just fuck off (unless you're one of my narc pals). Just : No work. No non-narc friends in cafes because I happen to be free. Nope. I do as I please. On my own, in my narcissistic pleasure dome for one. Thank you Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday, and Good Night.Oh my god.I realised a key difference in the way I treat the people I've met and made friends with here, compared to how I treat people in real life, especially my partner: Unconditional love.Unconditional love, unconditional positive regard or whatever you want to call it. I understand it to be a core emotional need that we often - in this group - didn't have met in our childhoods. Instead we were loved conditionally. And we were taught to love others conditionally. That if we do "X", we get love, or a substitute for love: praise or attention. Something like that.Is it total, 100% unconditional love and positive regard I have for my sub friends? No. It's not perfect. But ... the tendency is there. The habit. The inclination to turn that on rather than block it out and judge. A part of me does judge. But I can shift to overcome that. See passed that.I wonder if it is this that in part lays the foundation for the strong connection I have for people from here. That I had with Nick.I notice I very much try to be much more accepting, seeing potential dissonances, flaws or faults as collective or shared, and which have a context: the wounds we have from the past. I notice my tendency to forgive aspects of behaviour that don't gel with me, letting them go, seeing even antisocial behaviours as the manifestation of coping mechanisms built up from early-on to manage those wounds. Survival tools. I also notice that I listen to them, that I take their advice or even their criticisms on the chin and reflect on them. Not 100% perfectly, but much, much more easily than with people I know in my every day world and definitely with my partner....I had a disagreement with him just now going to the train station. We were on the verge of shifting into an argument. Well I was.I noticed that I was judging him. Of course. I do that. And I placed so many conditions on showing him love, feeling love for him. I do that too.He needs to lose weight. He needs to not drink so much. He needs to do as I would, essentially. Something Few said in an earlier comment about treating people as extensions of myself. It resonated and I related it to how I treat my partner. I am controlling. I am irritated by his actions that don't fit with me.We had our disagreement and I did my usual thing of calmly yet precisely cutting him down. Well done me. He's not perfect. He cuts me down too. But that doesn't stop me from wanting and trying to change for the better, for our relationship as a whole. I saw that he was hurt, though he didn't want to admit it.Then I managed to wonder, "What would I feel and how would I act if this was Nick, or someone else I am close with on the sub?" The motley crew / cast of the NPD version of Friends.I would show them that unconditional love. I would see passed the difficult or antagonistic behaviour, the controlling tendencies or the outbursts. I would see the wounds from before we met. I would tune into them and try to understand things from their perspective. And I would get there much more easily. For the first time, really, I saw my partner as a raw, wounded individual - I'd now say he's very likely NPD but far from self awareness. I saw his his difficult behaviours as the only way to survive that he knew.I turned to him and said, "You might not believe this, but over time, I've grown to love you more. And I just now saw you and loved you in a very new way."I stood there on the platform, looking at him and felt that zing of comnection in my chest, which is so easily blocked out. It surprised me. I noticed that I hadn't felt it like this before. Not really that much.(Then our train pulled in and I caught my reflection in the reflection and thought, "Oo. And... I'm also hot right now." Yay!)...I realised that I really could do with treating my partner - and other people in my life like someone from our little community: with empathy and compassion. Unconditionally. Or more so.Because he is wounded like the rest of us. ...I'm honestly proud of myself for this insight, and yes I'm sharing it here because of my pride. It's also to document for myself for future reference. A reminder of what matters.Nick would have said, "I'm proud of you, man." I would cringe when he said it. I would block myself from feeling his affection and care. I should have let that care in back then. I want to let it in now.I have received a great deal of very helpful support since Nick's death. I'm not the only one who needs it, but I was probably closest to him out of everyone I know here. So I greatly appreciate it. I have been with friends in real life, and we have had our laughs and good times. They have also given me hugs and space to be as I need. But on my own I have been blanking out, crying, distraught, very lonely, lost, depressed and shattered - confused. I'm glad I reached out for help in my lowest moment. As I wrote to Emotional_Climate, it's interesting how receiving a few kind words can have a big positive impact. You all really helped me. Thank you.💛...I don't know that Nick always felt truly supported by me. He said he did, but ... towards the end I had pulled away for such stupid and selfish reasons. I also don't know that he felt understood by me or other people. I'm not saying he suicide is all my fault in some self-centred way. But the very painful thing I've had to face is that my behaviour - my absence and lack of attunement - were at least one factor in his demise. There were many people who let him down, and I was one of them. I think that's the hard truth, no matter how small my impact was. At one point, we were so connected. It was quite unreal. We both said how special the friendship was, so ... I have to consider and understand that I failed him, and that this, in part, established the environment in which he decided the only option was to take his own life.My options going forward feel to be: kill myself, crush myself with self-flagelation as I live on, or live and try to do better. I'm choosing the latter. But I believe I need to feel the pain of the situation to do that. Some self-flagelation feels needed. I believe I need to understand where and how I let Nick down in my own way, feel the pain of that and use that to change in future. Maybe that's me trying to be heroic on some level. But I also can't just go forward and leave the pain aside, or try to. That would be to forget Nick, and I don't want to do that. It would also be to deny that I did anything wrong, and I believe that I did.The future has to be: better attunement with others, better listening, more compassion. People say that I do that, but ... I think there are others who have developed this skill much better than me. I can be so self-absorbed, I don't listen, even though I may appear to. I want to do better. I have been trying to do that in the last few days.The act of listening more and responding with compassion feels very possible. I know how to do that, I just don't always do it enough or when it really counts. It can turn off. But turning it on with sincerity feels like something I can do. But it feels somewhat complicated. I also don't want to cut out the parts of me that I think are "bad" and replace them with what is "good". Sometimess my self-centred parts are strong but I override them. But in doing so, it also feels like I'm shutting part of me off. I did that time and time again already throughout my life, and it only created a false self of "the good guy" - denying that I have these parts of me that are self-centred and even obnoxious. To deny those parts will lead to another collapse, just as I has in the past, when that false self disintegrates. Somehow I can't deny that I am, on some level, very selfish, and yet on another level, I am not.How the fuck do I reconcile that and be authentic, and still be better? Because i want that change in myself in honour of Nick. I really don't know. These parts of me feel so different, they feel hard to reconcile.Since I found out he killed himself. I don't know what else to say. A part of me feels I shouldn't being asking for help. I'm scared to, but I really need it.u/Arise23 has passed.He was my good friend from afar. We met here and had an instant connection.I quickly saw what a remarkable person he was. I saw his incredible capacity for love. He was passionate. He was articulate. He was very giving. He was a great listener and a great laugh. He was a fantastic advisor. He was brilliantly talented. I admired him a great deal. He taught me about male friendship. He helped me grow as a person - as a man. He helped me heal wounds from the past. He guided me.In the short time we knew each other, I came to love him as a brother. He told me he loved me, and I told him I loved him back. He called me 'King', and I called him 'King' in return.. It was a little joke, but it had a truth behind it. He deserved the title.We would talk for hours over the phone. I've never had that with another man before, ever. What a special person. I am shocked and devastated by his tragically early death. I wish that he had had the strength to continue living, but he wasn't able to pull through. I'm so sad.We would sometimes say to one another that it was quite remarkable that we had ever met - two people on different sides of the planet, with some real commonalities. Wow. Who would have known it, bro?I feel utterly blessed to have ever known him. I'm so glad that we met. I'm so glad he connected with me on line. What a joy to know him. What an absolute joy. That connection. Connection. Connection.It's all that matters. We had that. It was really strong.I bought a necklace with a King's Crown on it. Shining. Silver. A shield. I am already wearing it and I do so in his honour. Every time I look in the mirror - which I do often, and he totally did the same! - I will see that King's Crown.Goodbye, Nick. I will miss you very much. Irreplaceable....This sub. This sub introduced me and others to Nick, and other people like him. I'm so grateful."Goodnight King 💛" was the last thing he wrote to me...."Goodnight King 💛," I say in return.I just got a bit of abuse about being a narcissist. It included:*"in the case of you, you don’t even exist, you are a mirror, with no identity of itself, just a walking mirror, mirroring everyone to win them over, always in competition, always in the need to conquer…."*It motivated me to write about mirroring, which for me can be problematic, anxiety-inducing and distressing.Any insights are very welcome....I feel like the mirroring my brain does can be utterly automatic and all-encompassing. I wanna call it 'Deep Mirroring' because of the degree that - I think - it can affect my thinking and behaviour. An example would be:In any kind of writing - posts, comments, emails, texts - I very typically (and automatically) hear the other person's imagined voice in my head as I write, rather than my own. In fact, I struggle to hear my own voice in my head, and instead imagine 'their voice' or some voice they'd assume I have (or would like to have).To my mind, this affects how I write on a very fundamental level - word to word. Every aspect about my written communication can easily be 'what the other would say' or 'what I should sound like in order to be acceptable / cool / interesting' to them'. These are the key problematic aspects of this issue for me. It feels like I'm very, very good at mimicking other people's style of language and I do it to a very deep level. I can have email exchanges with other professionals, for example, where I can automatically mirror back their language style. I think I can sense that I'm using this to 'make myself appear more likeable or acceptable' to them, or to 'get what I want' or 'make a good impression.' A similar pattern can occur in person-to-person exchanges. Again, I can be with a string of people one-on-one, and very easily - if I don't keep it in check - be a very different person, mirroring the other in all sorts of ways in order to come across as *'the person wants me to be'.*I would go so far as to wonder if it's a form of Depersonalisation. It's like I partially dissociate and enter a kind of fantasy world where I'm just imagining 'what would they say?' / 'how would they put it?'I see this as totally connected to my childhood, by the way, where I learnt to mirror as a survival mechanism.Ironically, I'm trying to consider my words carefully here, because this topic is a key issue for me, and I want to make sure my description matches my experience....People have said to me that "this is normal" - and maybe it is, so hearing that again wouldn't be a bad thing. I understand that we adapt our language and behaviour with different people. I also know that idea that human beings are relational creatures - and so we become ourselves *between* one another. Again, it's about adapting in the moment to the context and the people we are with.However, what I find distressing is that, left unguarded, it feels like that my mirroring just takes over, and I completely lose my sense of self. So I can get to the end of a string of emails to different people, where I feel like I've just copied their tone and use of language - with a background hum of 'wanting to get ahead' or 'please people'. But not actually expressing myself as I would - only as I imagine they would from what I've heard or read from them....I've also had a therapist say that this shows that I have good empathy (and I actually can do). I also see it as functional and healthy to a degree. It's just he degree to which I do this that feels dysfunctional. It causes me distress because I want to have a sense of what I sound like, or how I would behave...,Some Good News:Things have improved over the years. I feel I am much more myself than I used to be. But it's still something I work on every day.One way I do this is to force myself to imagine myself speaking as I type. It takes effort for me to do this, but I find the results to be more authentic. I look back and read my writing and think, "Yeah, that's how I would say it." It feels comforting and even relaxing to feel that I've written in my 'own voice' rather than someone else's.\[ I added the bit on the end of the title to demo and practice how I speak, by the by. \]Also, in real life, I have worked a lot on not mirroring people in order to just fit in and get their approval. Instead, I am trying to speak more from how I feel or what I'm thinking. Being the vain twat that I am, this can be problematic in some situations. But even if it's inappropriate (i.e. self-sabotaging) to speak out loud what I'm thinking or feeling, I am trying to at least note what's going on inside to myself, so I can feel I'm being authentic to me even if it's not possible to do so with others in that moment.So, it's got a lot better. Thank fuck! But it's still something I struggle with....I'm all ears if anyone feels this is total crap, and I'm obsessing about nothing. Having said that, it does feel like an issue for me, and it causes me distress. Again, it's like I can almost Depersonalise and obliterate my sense of self through my communication and how I interact.All thoughts welcome. Thank you.I really can devalue my partner in my mind. I don't want that. It can also come across in my demeanour and tone of voice.It's sad. I'm trying to fight it.To other people, I can be super charming and good to be around. Friendly.I like me when I'm in those more public situations.Why aren't I like that at home?I want my partner to see that person I am to others. But he sees much more of the moody, controlling, scolding, patronising sides of me. Classic.Overall, he's a good guy and deserves much better from me. I love him. Actually, I can really adore him when I grt out of my own way. He has his big issues ... but ... he still has many more plus sides. Incredibly generous. Very entertaining and playful. Very cuddly. Argh. Narcs. Why do we always behave like twats to people closest to us? Life is short. I just want to be more happy.I am trying to confront my negative thoughts and actions. It's been an ongoing process for many years. I could still do better.I want my partner to know the friendly me more often.Or how do you regard that 'old you' before you realised / accepted your narcissism or NPD?Or maybe if you met that person today, how do you think you'd feel meeting them or being around them?What emotions come up for you when you think about that younger, unaware You?. How to you manage your anger or rage so you don't lash out at people when they are annoying or irritating to you?. How do you help yourself feel better, get into a better place?I just want to put addictive behaviour aside a moment, and any leap into grandiosity as a means of escaping. I mean ... what actually helps you get into a more calm, level-headed, steadier, non-reactive, connected mindset? That might even benefit you in the longer-term?What are the resources that support your wellbeing?. I am trying to keep my trauma in mind and body rather than push it away or forget it through all the distractions I do, all the ways I try to escape. The glossy image. The goals. The order.I woke up stressed and anxious today for no real reason. I started crying in bed. I just tried to stay with myself as the feelings were there. It was painful. Like flu, except I don't have flu. I thought it would be good to try to just stay with it and say, "It's ok to be here" rather than even try to soothe.I came downstairs and splurged in a DM to an NPD pal. The sadness was there and I cried as I wrote.I closed the laptop and did a workout. Lol.My partner woke up and call 'Hello!' from upstairs. He immediately detected the sadness in my response. "Are you down?" he said. Rather than just flipping into "Everything's fine!!!" mode, I said, "It's just my trauma stuff coming up."He called back down, offering to go and kill my Mum and Dad as a joke.He went to the bathroom and I noticed I started getting very anxious, fearful. My mind started tripping out. I realised that it was because I wanted to open up to him, but I was fearful of his response. I traced this back to what I received from my Mum when I opened up to her. Ridicule. Dismissal. Shut down. Rejection. Or my Father: well ... nothing because I could never consider talking to him about my feelings with him.That template of fear is there in my mind when I think about opening up. I will be "too much". I will be told to "get over it". I will be told to "stop myself from going too far". I will be told that I am "full of woe". I will be told that I "should be happy". My partner came downstairs and sat on the sofa with the coffee I made him. I told him I didn't want to be a burden, but that I wanted to be real about what was going on, rather than try to run away from it.He listened to me as I spoke about the issues I have with trauma, and he was very supportive in what he said. The relief was visceral. I thanked him. I was still tearful. To have that inner child meet the support that he never got in my childhood ... That's what that part of me needs.He asked me if I would feel better once my parents were dead. And I said, "Yes." He was very accepting of that.He did then say something like, "But I don't understand why you can't just say that your parents were idiots and move on." This brought up anger in me that made me feel unsteady. However, I contained it and said that it was like there were two levels to this. One was to think intellectually: Yes, my parents treated me badly. I am an adult now. I know different. I don't believe their messages. The other was the trauma itself: the disruption to my whole nervous system that is a total mind-body experience. The physical rush of fear. The intrusive and terrifying imagery that clouds my thinking. The urge to run out of the room, while at the same time being in lots of social situations where I feel that isn't an option, nor is actually telling people that this is going on. He was understanding and supportive again. I was a little bit like, "Yes. I didn't rage."I talked to him about narcissism as a coping mechanism for my trauma. I talked to him about finding solace and comfort and emotional regulation in the mirror as an example. Or in my appearance, or in my work. He was accepting and listened.Somehow we got onto my Mum's difficult behaviours, which are more the classic 'covert' type that I used to be. He criticised her behaviour, but I said that basically it was like what I was. "Remember when we went to the States with Jackie and Sharon? Do you remember in how much of a funk I was all the way through the trip?" ... "Yes. You were really hard to be with." ... "I was just very sullen a lot of the time." ... That's where my Mum can be. Pulling people down. That was me.My partner talked about there being a rock in the road, and at some point, you have to go around it and forget that it's there.I realised that I was diving a little bit into self-pity, self-obsession in the discussion, which I was actually enjoying. So I said, as a way of pulling myself out of it, "Yes. And I s'pose I can get stuck at that rock and stay there. But also ... running away and trying to forget it hasn't helped me either. ... There needs to be a middle ground where I keep it in mind but also go forward." You know, like: keep it in the rear view mirror.I said, "I think going forward, I just need to be able to say to you: 'My trauma issues are coming up. So if I act a little weird - especially in social settings - please know that I am trying my best. This is very hard to deal with, but I am trying my best." This is in regard to him often sensing that something is up with me, but trying to put it in a box when around other people. I guess because - in part - I had that tendency to pull everyone down. There are other reasons as well, but that's a fair guess in part as to why he does this. Anyway. He accepted this. In social situations, I often float off for a while to just sit on the toilet and re-centre myself for 5 minutes. Or try to. We had a friend round last night, and this happened again. The same cycle: she arrives. I feel really good to be in her warm-hearted company. After about 20 minutes, I start decaying. I can't keep up the facade. Or I try to, but underneath is a whirlwind. Total chaos. I cling to my seat.She knows about my NPD, and has been good with that. I mentioned to her a little bit that there was stuff going on last night, but it wasn't really the right situation to go further. So it was horrible. My mind shattered. I held onto the broken pieces.This morning she sent me the usual "Thank you" message. I wrote back and told her that I wasn't in a good place at all, that it wasn't her fault, but that it comes from 'nowhere'. I told her not to feel guilty, but that I just needed to now say that I struggle. I said I didn't want to hide from it anymore, as much as I can.Sorry, post-splurge. A lot has come up today. I put everything aside for once and lay in bed - not actually having a wank! - but actually dealing with my emotions....Since self-awareness, I have been actively searching for ways to integrate the narcissistic, king-wannabe side of me into my character. I had previously tried shutting or cutting him out. Or obliterating him from view. Over and over. But he remained. And would poke through in clumsy ways despite my attempts to appear "normal". Stable. But as I got to know this part inside, it turns out ... I quite like him. He's funny. So gradually, I've wanted to let him in and out to other people in appropriate ways. Not that I'm being openly superior. Actually, that part has really dwindled in my conscious mind (still there subconsciously). But it's more of the attention-seeking, competitive, self-interested, show-off side. Finding ways to reveal all that to people around me rather than the "Look! I'm The Healthiest Person Ever Promise!" face that I had been wearing. Humour has helped, by the way. I don't want to forget that wannabe-king in me. I can't. So last week, I bought a necklace online with a king's crown pendant. A silver disc with a little roughly-drawn crown in the middle. It's cartoonistic and childlike in design. Medallion-like. Small but perfect. Kind of Warrior-Viking in style. A tiny shield. I like symbols as reminders of things. I wanted to have something round my neck that reminded me of that side of me, rather than be ashamed of it, or forget it.It arrived today, a short while after that terrible distress came up in me.I looked at it and thought, "How can I wear this now? I feel the opposite. This is silly."...As the terrorised part of me relaxed, I was able to talk with another NPD friend. I related that I'd realised that while I was making headway in integrating my more narcissistic side, perhaps I wasn't doing so well with that traumatised part of me. The broken part. Sometimes after a PTSD moment, it's like I'm a broken soldier. Do you ever feel like that? Shattered? I look in the mirror and I look shattered. Tired. Raw.He too has kept on poking through the veneer despite my attempts to block him out - which include those King of the Castle behaviours.I had this feeling that I needed to be in touch with that traumatised, broken part of me, much more than I have been. That there needed to be integration of both the narc and the trauma. And maybe - if I can keep in touch with them and bring them on board to inform my day to day life - they wouldn't erupt in the ways they have been.But how to integrate these parts? They are so different. The king just LOVES to be in his castle. And the pain of that trauma is so intense....A little voice called out to me saying, 'Don't forget me! You keep forgetting me.' ... I will add that I did some psychodrama exercises in workshops and we had done a thing that was intended to get in touch with that forgotten child in us. That was earlier this year I did that.Laying in bed, I looked at that necklace pendant again. Childlike. Rough. Simple. Shiny. Mirror-Like.I had this idea that I could wear it after all, and that it could be helpful. I put it around my neck and it fell on my chest. I looked in the mirror and saw myself: that broken boy who wanted to be king.Actually, I needed it. Because of the trauma. No, it wasn't the best way to cope. But it was the way I coped as a child, and it spilled over into adulthood.It's like that little child imagined a crown to distract from the torment of a very early and unhealable trauma, which he (I) cannot remember because it happened too early. There were many other traumas that are remembered easily. But that early distress. ... Only terrifying feelings and flashes in the mind. It was too much to bear. Absolute shame. So the child sought out anything he could to confirm to him that he was in fact good, able and whole. Stable. Strong. On his journey to his imagined destiny as king he was Prince Charming, he was the Solider, he was the Wizard (at the piano), he was the Tyrant, he was the Grandiose Lover ... He had his whole castle built around him, including a dungeon where he sometimes could hear screams but shut them out. He had his minstrels to entertain him. He had his Joker. He had his Merlin. (Thank God for Merlin. The ultimate Healthy Adult). And he had his demons, who haunted him, tortured him at night.That's me. I'm looking in the mirror right now, and that's who I see: the broken boy who wanted to be king.And this is me in the aftermath. When the castle crumbled.It's raining heavily outside....Broken. Charming. Competitive. Embarrassed. Witty. Terrified. Haunted. Attention-Seeking. Easily Enraged. Insightful (thanks, [Merlin](https://www.reddit.com/user/Elongated_Mayonnaise/)). Stupid. Warrior-like. Fragile. ... I could go on.I think - I hope - this pendant could do a good job in helping me remind myself of all those parts. I want to remember it all.&#x200B;. I feel he saw me as weak, feeble, effeminate, less than he wanted from a son. Not what he'd hoped for.True or not, that is what I felt as a child and teen. And adult.As a child, I saw my body in the mirror and I wanted it to change. Be better. I wanted the "effeminate parts" to be sliced off and trimmed down. Tucked away. Strapped down. I wanted to be more masculine in my appearance. As an adult, I've gone to great lengths to give the impression to my father that I'm in control and strong. Able. Fine. A man....I see myself through his eyes. I'm constantly propping up the appearance that everything is ok.Lying on the bed now, I see myself in the mirror opposite. Feelings of disgust and ridicule. Aversion. And real weakness. Unloved. A frightened and lonely child.Too much of this. Too little of that.There is an urge to shift position and look more appealing to that part of me. But I stay.There have been little tears. I wonder if this is the right thing to do. Cry. Is that enough?..Sigh ... The thing is ... I actually also like some of those behaviours I do to appear more like my father wanted me to look, and I don't really want to give them up. Like. working out and having a masculine figure. I like it. I know that it's caught up in misperception, but I don't want to stop it.It's confusing. I don't quite know how to reconcile the misperception and the enjoyable behaviour.. Because underneath the glossy veneer, and looking like I've got everything sorted, is a feeling of distress in my body that feels so intense and all-encompassing, has overwhelmed me many times before, and I'm terrified of feeling it again. It feels like everything is going to fall apart.*Checks mirror.*Edit: The distress appeared again. It is like my whole world falling apart. Images of my mother shouting at me, chaotically. Right up in my face. In my ears. Screaming at me. Or running wild int he house. Or in distress herself. Fighting my father. He laughs. She screams. It feels like everything is going to shatter. The imagery is intense and for a split second I feel that it could be real. I see my Mum dead on the bed or on the floor. Again and again I have this. This is the distress.. I was talking with a friend of mine about vulnerability and NPD. I noticed a thing I do in writing posts here where I craft them- semi-subconsciously - so I can't let people in. It's like: quasi-vulnerability. It's there, but behind a shiny glass wall that I also put up as a distraction. To counteract that, I thought I'd just post the message I sent them and see what comes up - or not.&#x200B;Oh God... Exposure!&#x200B;"Hey... I'm thinking just now about what you said about not liking being vulnerable. Well ... I have my own expression of this. I noticed that when I post, I tell myself that I'm 'being vulnerable'. And in part, I do think I share vulnerabilities. But ... I present it in a way that is quite closed off. It's like I introduce the vulnerability I notice in myself, and then use the post to work through it and find some resolution. This has a few functions. I sort myself out BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE AND SAYS SOMETHING ANNOYING THAT I ALREADY KNOW! It's also got that function of 'being impressive' and 'heroic' and a 'leader'. Lol.The idea that I might write a post that is totally vulnerable and leaves it open for question and confrontation - even discussion apart from 'Well done, Peanut! I love you!' feels ... like something I don't want to do! Lol. But ... I notice, too, that in the posts I make where I don't close it off so much, there is much more interaction with people I don't usually hear from, and the discussions are helpful and interesting, and there's more connection - which I also want.So ... something to think about and work on.". My partner and I went to the theatre last night to see La Cage Aux Folles.It's basically a show about gays and drag queens. Lol. That's my summary. I've seen it about 4 million times.The audience was noticeably a load of ol' gay men - including us. (It happens at these kinds of shows. All the gays come out for our catwalk.)...**INTERVAL**The men had to queue for the loo. Usually that's something the ladies roll their eyes over while we toddle by with a smug little dance.But with all the lads out for the show, it was like queuing for the Gents at a gay bar. 😁Standing in that queue (we Brits love a queue), half-eyeing-up the oversized beards, muscles and flowery shirts around me, I felt really comfortable. Like being held. Safe. A feeling of belonging.I like being part of this group....Gay men are funny creatures. It's interesting from an NPD angle.There's a kind of narcissism that's normalised, okay and even celebrated as part of 'gay culture'. You can call is body fascism etc. But it doesn't have to be taken so seriously. There's a playful vanity, grandiosity, a cheeky bitchiness, hierarchical thinking, and a constant hum of flirtation and potential for sex. A lot of it can be wrapped up in a naughty humour and glint in the eye. Last weekend we went to a housewarming of a female friend. She has loads of gay male friends, and at one point in the garden, it was just us lot chatting like gay men do. It's different. It's fun. It's flirty. I like it.And the same thing happened. I felt a sense of belonging and okayness. I relaxed. I felt I could be more myself. I discovered myself, in fact.I don't actually have many other gay friends in my life, so it felt refreshing....There's a layer of shame you grow up with as a homosexual lad. I'm 40, so it might be better now in the UK. But in 90s rural Essex, it wasn't what you needed to be to survive.Once when I was about six (?), I sprung into the kitchen wearing a purple beret tilted to the side. I was beaming with a smile, wanting to show my Mum and Dad my little dance.They were both sitting at the kitchen table. My Dad didn't say anything but looked stern. My Mum scolded at me: "Take that beret off! Other people will think you are queer!"I removed my hat and my little self from the kitchen....The shame sticks around.It forms the near-invisible template in your psyche, reminding you how to behave and what to expect from people if you are 'yourself'. You are so used to it, you don't even notice it's there.It affects relationships. My partner, now 49, is still uneasy about us touching each other at all in public, even in central London. It makes me sad, but I understand it and respect it. I still go to cuddle him. He pulls away saying, 'No! You don't know how people will behave here. We could be beaten up!" 💛Hidden shame is probably the reason why I don't have many gay friends, actually. My parents' voices very subtly steering me away from being associated with gay men.It's there in how you hold yourself, how you feel inside as you meet with others. It is the driver behind the reflection-checking as you walk down the street. Without it, you don't feel the urge to check so much.It's there in how I am around other men, whom I had a fear of when I was younger. It's because I experienced so much belittling and abuse from straight men in the past. So I expect them to recoil and look down on me. Expect me to do and be less-than. Or threaten me. Or actually beat me up.(Fuck you, Matthew Parkinson, you fat, lowlife cunt.)...Looking around the theatre audience last night and watching the show, I felt a kind of pride. It's really just a kind of 'okayness' and ease in my body and mind. Actually, it's also a kind of joy for being who I am.It was cool to be part of all the over-groomed beards, cheeky side-glances, unnecessarily large biceps, and over-thought shirt n' socks combos.Yeah. This is me....This morning, I did my workout in front of the mirror as usual. 😁 Headphones on. [The Best of Times](https://youtu.be/vUqiM4c1oWA). The most famous song from 'La Cage' is 'I Am What I Am'. It was performed so brilliantly last night. Lost of people cried. The lyrics fit really well here, in this sub.But The Best of Times is my favourite.Fuck it!&#x200B;*The best of times is now,**What's left of summer but a faded rose?**The best of times is now,**As for tomorrow well: Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?*&#x200B;*So hold this moment fast,**And live and love as long as you know how.**And make this moment last,**Because the best of times is now.*&#x200B;I lifted my weights (upped two 2kgs yesterday, woop-woop!). I lip-synced along to the song on repeat. I did some super jazz hands. I enjoyed my cheeky grin.I imagined my little self dancing with me with his little purple beret. I showed him how to move. I let him free in my mind. He was happy. I was the parent he didn't have. He needed. A bit of [imagery rescripting](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental-Health-Professionals/Sleep/Sleep---Information-Sheets/Sleep-Information-Sheet---06---Imagery-Rescripting.pdf) there. A few little tears came up as the song played again.I'm proud of that little boy with his special dance. No shame....I need more gay men in my life. We all do....I love this [comedy sketch](https://youtu.be/cOESpIz8Mjg), by the by. From Catherine Tate. She's not Irish, but does a great accent, and impression.Chuckle....I know I'm talking about being a gay man. But I hope some things can translate and find their own usefulness to anyone with NPD.It's that experience of being shamed for who we are, of hiding and pretending to survive. Or that inner critic that haunts us like a shimmering ghost, lurking in the corner of our eye.And the joy is re-discovering our selves and being comfortable in who we are, despite what we were taught, and whoever we may be.You know, the rainbow flag is an amazing thing: 🏳️‍🌈. People keep saying "collapse" and I'm like, "What?" ... "You simply mean depression. Sadness."But today: I get it.With NPD in charge, everything is done just to prop up the self away from what is painful - or void - underneath.Today that sugar-crystal dome completely collapsed and I am in the under....OK, Narc OverLord: I get it. Lesson learned. ⛈⚡🌩The distance between the shell and the core is too great. The balloon is too big. Its skin is too thin.Pop....Looking back, my house of cards has gotten too big many times. It has collapsed often. The worst was in my early-mid 30s. I told myself I would be incredibly successful after studying at a prestigious college. Guaranteed. Genius.I wasn't. I put my whole self in that basket. When the ship didn't come in, I wanted to jump off the pier....Today isn't like that. But I see again how I have been propping myself up recently with my twigs and spit, thinking they were cast iron and concrete.Well, the wind blew in and knocked my scaffold over.I also see how I so want to prop up that scaffold again rather than deal with the dodgy foundations and structure.Dear OverLord of the Narcs (aka u/MudVoidSpark), What is my next lesson? I am listening.🌩⚡⛈. It's coming up to about a year since I started finally accepting my narcissism (having been in denial for a couple of years before), leading to then getting an NPD diagnosis / confirmation from a specialist.Quite a journey. Luckily it's involved a lot of self-reflection, otherwise it would've been boring!It's like the ground underneath completely broke open (drama!) and I went through a kind of self-reconfiguration: a breakdown of the persona I had built up for so long, coupled with a poking-through and eruption of all these different aspects of myself that I'd hidden away.It was initially - and for a long while - disturbing. A lot to handle psychologically. "What is this in me? ... Is this real or fake? ... Who the fuck am I?" ... My mind felt like it was in pieces.But (more drama!) I ploughed on through the oncoming winds.Gradually, a more stable sense of self has emerged: certain sides of me keep popping up again and again, more spontaneously, it seems, without clear reference to others so much. I also notice that in conversations, I feel increasingly like a separate person from others, in the way I talk, write or present myself, interests and ideas, opinions. Other people have their moves. I have mine. Yes, there is some merging and blurring, but we are quite different. I'm not trying to br like them or the way think they want me to be. I don't feel so much of the urge to mirror as I did. I feel I have some kind of self to fall back on when I get disrupted. He keeps re-appearing. And I've found myself more assertive, looking people in the eye when I want to speak about something (usually involving some Powerpoint about Schema Therapy)....I'm about to go on a Skype call with my Dad, who lives in another country. I spent my whole life pretty much being a yes-sir, no-sir, three-bags-full-sir kind of son. I would present myself in the way I thought my Dad wanted me to look, talk and behave - even think. ... I did that habitually from a young age as a way of coping with my Dad's terrific temper that could turn on like a switch; his threats of violence - or actual violence.Today, just before the call, I thought: "What a good opportunity to show up as myself."It's not as sudden a shift as I'm making it: I've been showing up more and more, I think, as different from the son I've assumed he wanted me to be. But today: I feel confident to turn up and be as I am, disagree with him ... Just not turn into that smiling face hiding a whirlwind of difficult emotions underneath. I don't feel I have to do that any more.So we met up. I can say he is remarkably brave, emotionally intelligent and articulate in expressing his feelings.I think he's gonna be just fine. Especially if he listens to the incredible advice from old blokes like me. 😁But watch out. Not so fast! u/moldbellchains can smell the grandiosity from down the road, fellas! Fuck!!!Yep, that's not Dior whateveritis, that's me!But he took a pin and popped my self-inflated ego-bubble when it showed up, and in such a healthy and considered way. He stood up for his feelings when they were being pushed aside by my emotional bulldozer mode, and got me thinking anew how grandiosity can have a negative impact on people....There were actual tears, and it was super. Human. A wonderful moment.We had a real connection. And when the moment felt right, we sat on a bench and had a very long hug.A hug that extends to everyone.
    For some reason, the closer I am with someone, the more uncomfortable I feel when they think or behave in ways I dislike. This doesn't always mean in ways that I feel wronged by. Sometimes it's that, but other times it's behaviour that doesn't harm me or involve me in any way but it's just that it's not what I would do or not what I prefer. Or an opinion that is harmless and doesn't affect me at all, but it's just not the same opinion as mine. These things make me feel disillusioned.The closer I am with someone, the more similar to me I need them to be in terms of how they think and behave. And the opposite is also true. The less invested I am in a person, the easier it is to not feel bothered by things that they say or do. And it's not just emotional closeness, it's also frequency of interactions. The less time I spend with someone, the more comfortable I feel around them. I think this is probably because you're exposed more frequently to a person's "flaws" the more you interact with them. More opportunities for a disliked behaviour to occur. But it's weird because you'd think that liking and caring about someone would make you more tolerant of them, not less. But for me, it's the opposite. I think I hold people I'm close with to a higher standard than I do everyone else. I become disillusioned and disappointed when they don't meet my expectations, and then emotional attachment seems to either decrease or disappear after that, depending on the severity of whatever is bothering me.Meanwhile, with people I'm less close to, I have less of an emotional reaction (if any) in response to their flaws. Ironically, I think I'm most understanding towards people I have no ties to whatsoever. When someone I'm not close with shows me something I dislike, a wall comes up to keep them at the distance where they currently are. They're still allowed to stay where they are, it's just that they can't get any closer.But even if someone has managed to get close to me somehow due to some breach in security or whatever, the wall will still come up and stop them in their tracks the minute they show me something I dislike. And it will push them several levels down in terms of closeness. It won't tolerate anything short of perfection when it comes to the higher tiers. Kind of crazy when you think about it.**Part 1:** Try to improve yourself and your life ➡️ it's hard and you fail and feel ashamed ➡️ "Okay, I can see that improving this thing is going to take a while, what to do in the meantime?" ➡️ "Well even if I have to have this flaw, I can at least keep it to myself and never let anyone find out about it"**Part 2:** Impression management and masking ➡️ feel tired and frustrated because of all the effort you're exerting ➡️ slip up and feel ashamed ➡️ reframe and repress ➡️ continue to accumulate slip-ups over time until you can no longer reframe or repress ➡️ "I'm tired of this shit"**Part 3:** Avoid others, only interact with them if you're at 100% or if you absolutely have to interact with them for whatever reason ➡️ continue to accumulate slip-ups during times when you have no choice but to interact with others ➡️ feel frustrated and irritated and exhausted ➡️ "This isn't worth it"**Part 4:** Giving up ➡️ shirk responsibilities and avoid important things because you're just too tired ➡️ "Fuck everything, who cares anymore" ➡️ predictably, life starts going downhill while you're avoiding it and recovering ➡️ feel ashamed of letting things get to this point and for being so obsessed with something so trivial as your image ➡️ shame makes you even more tired and even less motivated and slows recovery time ➡️ "I'm wasting my life" ➡️ back to part 1. Too much mortification buildup. I just can't. I can't handle the embarrassment and shame. I'll die. They've seen too much. They've gotta go. Not only my therapist, but my psychiatrist too. The dissociation stuff was the last straw. That shit was beyond humiliating and I wish I never said this nonsense. Lately I get stuck in a freeze state during every appointment and I can't make myself speak. Maybe I can pretend that none of it happened? Fuck 😭😭 Why do therapists always have such a short shelf life for me 😭😭. And also do you ever feel like, most of the time, you only experience positive feelings about another person when you're currently having a positive interaction with them? And when the interaction is over, the positive feelings seem to have a shelf life and eventually turn into indifference until the next time you have another positive interaction? And if it's someone who's very important to you, you feel shame/guilt/fear about this pervasive and long-term indifference? And this indifference reduces your motivation to put any kind of effort into the relationship to the point where every little thing feels like a chore? In your opinion, do most people probably feel this way?. It annoys me a lot when someone asks me "Are you mad at me?" "Did I do something wrong?" "Do you hate me?" "Do you still like me?" If anything had changed, I would've faxed the memo to your office. So why would you suddenly assume that I'm mad or upset at you or that I've stopped liking you? So infuriating when they say "Because you've been distant lately" "You haven't been answering my texts" "You haven't been talking much lately" And your first thought is that this is about YOU? Do you think my world revolves around you? Do you think everything I do involves you in some way? Have you ever considered that there might be reasons for my behaviour that have nothing to do with you? Everything I do that doesn't align with your idea of how the world works means that we're on bad terms? How about stop jumping to conclusions and making assumptions about me? Wtf?The wild thing about people is that you can straight up tell them to assume that everything is fine unless they hear otherwise from you, and they'll STILL come back and ask if you're mad at them and if they did something wrong. At that point man just fuck off and leave me alone. Clearly any behaviour that deviates from how you expect me to behave is apparently a problem for you.
    you’re not hot enough to be this emotionally distant. i really think it’s the ultimate superpower to be able to choose between two feelings. they’ll be a moment where I’ll feel emotionally impacted and then i instantly resent the power whatever thing that had on me emotionally, so then suddenly I force my brain to not care. Move on and say fuck them. Being able to shift and no longer care and i mean genuinely genuinely not care is a superpower.side note: would healing be working through whatever emotional impact i had instead of rejecting it? that sounds tiring and annoying asf. i feel like i am so many people. everybody is a specific type of person. they have a typical music taste. a specific type of look, style, voice. all of it is very typical. culture to certain individuals in their personality is very repetitive and common. but i am always changing. i can relate to almost everybody. i am different things for so many different people. i am a different person to different types of people. got caught lying but i don’t feel bad. instead i’m kinda living off the fact that this is happening. the confrontation is more exciting than correcting. the excitement comes from wondering what i’ll be able to come up with to say to them to resolve the situation and if i’ll recover.the closer i get and the more people that tell me i should seek help and talk to someone. the more i wanna do the opposite. i’ve kinda decided to just use the fact that i go to therapy as a scapegoat. i wanna use it so i can freely talk to someone about what’s going on, but i’m not trying to heal. that process is so long and excruciating - i’d rather just settle with my awareness and keep it pushing. i also feel like hella people deal w worse shit and don’t even remotely do the ‘shadow work’ to unravel it, so why should i?. just started therapy and i’m already annoyed. everytime i’ve started with saying i have covert npd, they skip the ‘covert’ part. the meetings have ended with, ‘well you don’t seem like you have npd’ - like that’s the whole mf point. i’m not going to blatantly tell you shit that will make me look bad. I have a reputation to hold with every person, no one is an exception.i try my best to never seem like the bad guy. i really like this person but i don’t wanna be in public w them cause i don’t want it to look like i belong to them. I worry if i’m seen with them, other people will assume i’m off limits and not think of me the same way. is it wrong to tell the person i don’t want to do anything w them because i don’t want that person and people to think i belong to them. the person knows i don’t wanna be in a relationship and they know they don’t ‘own’ me but others watching don’t have that clarity. will i seem like an asshole for saying ‘i don’t want to look like i belong to you’. the title is blunt but i’m really at a crossroad. i just started college and i’m doing long distance but i don’t know how committed i am. i tell her i’m ready to do it with her but ik i can’t trust myself to not pursue what’s around me because of the fresh validation i could get from being here. i like the solidity of a future w her because then ik i can fall back on her no matter where i’m at and she’s also tolerant of a lot of npd traits i show. i feel like i have to thank her for that through my loyalty but i deep down so badly want to explore and set my ground here in that way.i’ve already slipped up and entertained something but i acted differently and actually told her about it (forcefully) but now instead of wondering how to repair the trust i broke, im daydreaming about how sneakier i’ll need to be so i don’t feel the need to tell her.
    I went to the doctor a couple of days ago. It was a new one, and I hadn't visited her before.I was talking about some recent difficulties I was having, and I told her I had been diagnosed BPD, though was much better. She then told me she would have been one too!&#x200B;She said she had worked in another field with very good healthcare, and so had done a lot of therapy throughout her twenties. She said she didn't know anything about borderline disorder, but had learned through therapy, and also learned lots of ways to manage.It was really amazing to look at another person who had just revealed it – I guess I am older so not many people used to do that. But it was also amazing to be more open about it. So I told her I had also had the diagnosis of narcissism.In one way, it was really irritating to no longer be special and unique, though I realise that is hardly a healthy response. But on the other hand, it is really good that people can talk about this stuff.I told her about the podcast. That was a cool moment. And I walked out of there thinking about the fact that we seem to be on the verge of changing as a society, in being open about the secret things going on inside.&#x200B;. Thinking about some stuff with the narcissistic pattern, both from looking at my past, and at things that were done to me recently.My most obviously grandiose times were clubbing in my 20s, when I would do the subtle seductive eye thing, and get guys chasing after me. That was definitely a boost to my ego.I also combined it with my BPD side, so that part of me really knew I was so hungry for love and affection. I wanted to be the centre of someone's world for the night: to go home with them, for them to hold me in their arms, and for them to focus on me for that time, to see me as something special.I wasn't actually interested in them as a person, just in them as a moment in time, who could do this thing for me. It was a relief to not know them, and to be able to drop any efforts at being anything or saying anything but what was required for this transaction.I explained it to myself as guys being callous. My dad wasn't interested in me, my step-father wasn't interested in me, my brother wasn't close and didn't show emotions. Men were cold, and so I would become that way too. I figured they got what they wanted, and I got what I wanted.&#x200B;But nowadays I can see the using part of that, and the imperious, callous bit. I can also see how difficult it is for me to be close to someone, and how I rely on external interactions (out in the big wide world) to fuel me, because at home with my nearest and dearest, I crawl into myself.&#x200B;I have seen a couple of posts about rejecting the other person, and I was thinking about how this might be the narcissistic pattern – to pull people in, but to punish them for being attracted to us. That way, we can punish their supposed need for us, instead of our own need for others.Thoughts?. Saw some people asking about resources.There was an American psychiatrist, James F Masterson, whose extensive work with very troubled adolescents led to him focusing on understanding, and developing therapy for, 3 personality disorders: Borderline, Schizoid and Narcissistic. His work, and others working with the insights he developed, rings very true to me on both BPD and narcissism (as far as I can understand my traits). This therapy is based on the belief that we have part of our inner self which are unconscious: we are not aware of them on a conscious level, however they influence our behaviour even when we are not. This therapy is also based on the belief that these parts of ourselves are shaped by our earliest interactions, and damage occurs when our natural psychological and emotional development is prevented by painful experiences, at which point we block them out in order to carry on in a way that is adapted to our childhood environment. The therapy aims to address these unconscious parts of ourselves, and help us bring them into our awareness, where we can deal with them better.&#x200B;Here are some articles about the therapy. &#x200B;[https://www.counsellingservicemelbourne.com.au/personality-disorder-treatment/](https://www.counsellingservicemelbourne.com.au/personality-disorder-treatment/)&#x200B;[https://www.counsellingservicemelbourne.com.au/personality-disorder-treatment/narcissistic-personality-disorder/](https://www.counsellingservicemelbourne.com.au/personality-disorder-treatment/narcissistic-personality-disorder/)&#x200B;[http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/masterson2004.pdf](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/masterson2004.pdf)&#x200B;[https://www.contemporarypsychotherapy.org/volume-3-issue-2-winter-2011/grandiosity-and-perfection/](https://www.contemporarypsychotherapy.org/volume-3-issue-2-winter-2011/grandiosity-and-perfection/)&#x200B;What's more, Dr Masterson was proposing insightful theories regarding narcissism in the early 1990's, so don't give up hope! All that stuff about it being untreatable is coming from the mouths of people who are ignorant on the subject.This is a post in response to a few recent ones, and based on stuff I've learned since I arrived on this sub.\[For background, I was diagnosed BPD with narcissistic traits, I did 5 years psychotherapy, which resolved a number of issues (not all), and I have recently interacted with several people with strong narcissism/clear NPD in real life, plus with people here on the sub.\]People with NPD tell me they have no sense of self. People here talk of emptiness inside. When I talk (internet call or recording for the podcast PD Raw) with these people, I have heard in their voice a feeling of not trusting their own emotions. When I had BPD, I did have a sense of self, but it was terrifying, because it was a shapeless, structureless sense of self that crashed around depending on whatever input came in from the outside world.When I had BPD, I was still connected to my own emotions – too much. They were overwhelmingly negative and despairing emotions. I felt an enormous amount of pain.&#x200B;**I agree with others that NPD and BPD (and HPD) are pretty much the same thing underneath, but with different surface directions that the person has gone in.** &#x200B;A BPD is created, in their narcissistic family, by other family members subtly dumping on them while telling the BPD that they are imagining it and the BPD is wrong and faulty for being so emotional. This helps the family, because the caregiver/s are making the BPD chase their approval, and increasing the vulnerability of the BPD, to make themselves feel stronger and above the BPD. That way the caregiver/s don't have to feel ashamed of their own feelings of being unwanted.The emotions of the BPD are useful, because the narcissistic family members can always go to the BPD when they feel bad, and stir the BPD up. Then the BPD acts out, and everyone else can look at the BPD and go "What a mess this person is" while secretly feeling release from their own pain.Because of this, the BPD never loses connection with their own emotions. They need to be able to express them. &#x200B;After about 2 years of therapy, I began to notice that I was "absorbent". I would interact with other people and afterwards I would be full of emotions, *some of which were the other person's*. I hadn't noticed before, but I had hated myself for being weak and changing opinions all the time. After I started to see that some of the emotions inside me were absorbed from other people, I began to, very slowly, learn to see which emotions were mine, and which were other's. &#x200B;It seems that people with NPD had to disconnect from their own emotions to survive. I*t's likely that* t*he feeling of emptiness or void comes from the part of the self that experiences emotions.* The feeling of emptiness is that lack where the sensations of feelings should be. However, despite not being felt, the emotions are there, blocked out, but always threatening to burst through.&#x200B;People here with NPD or ASPD report boredom and restlessness. It seems that this may be when some emotions are pressing on the internal walls, and threatening to burst through. To relieve this pressure, someone with these defences will go out and stir up someone else. The strong emotions get expressed, but one step away: not through the self, but through someone nearby. (The same pattern as within the narcissistic family).People with NPD also report here to completely adapting to whoever is in front of them. Becoming whatever (it is guessed that) the other person/people want/s. And having so sense of their own personality. &#x200B;If you had to disconnect from experiencing your own emotions as a child, you would feel empty. I can understand needing to disconnect - it seems that lots of people with NPD had BPD mothers. We can be awful, because we are often truly fucked up. If a child is attacked for showing their own emotions, it makes sense to disconnect from them. What if there has been another step - the child has said, after traumatic interactions, "Well, that wasn't even me or what I wanted, which got attacked. I was just saying/doing whatever the other person (adult) wanted". That way, the child can tell themselves it was not the real them being attacked, it was just a false front that took the damage.&#x200B;The NPD lack of sense of self/feeling changeable with every different person/situation seems a lot like the BPD shapeless, structureless sense of self, but without the connection to emotions that ties sensations together, into a feeling of having "something" inside.The fluctuating moods and sense of changing with each different person/situation seems a lot like the BPD lack of emotional boundaries, so that the person absorbs whatever is around and cannot tell which emotion is their and which is someone else's. But again, without the deeper connection to the sensation of the emotions. &#x200B;The development of a firm sense of self, and of own emotions, is supposed to develop throughout childhood, through interaction with adults who identify, name, respond to, contain, role model management of, soothe, correct and otherwise deal with feelings. The ways that the adults help with this can go something like:*"Aww, little one, you look very sad."**"Look at you smiling - you love these tickles!"**"Why so grumpy? Are you tired?"**"Don't be so jealous and share your toys."**"I know it's scary. Come here and have a hug."**"Stop tormenting your little brother! You are trying to upset him."**"That's great news, how exciting!"**"Get over your pride and go apologise."**"What are you looking so smug about?"*If we, as a child, have expressed our real emotion, and it has been seen and responded to appropriately, then we gradually build internal stability, and we also trust that we can be ourselves and our emotions are normal will be accepted.If we found that, when we expressed ourselves, it got a strongly negative reaction, we stopped. We might even have found that our caregivers had an image of who they wanted us to be, in their heads, and whenever we performed like the image, we got attention – no matter how distant that image was from how we actually felt inside.If we found we couldn't express ourselves, then our emotions didn't get seen, or accepted, or responded to. All these bits of ourselves – how we feel about things, how we think about them – never got strengthened. We didn't get to feel accepted because we had been able to express ourselves. On top of that, we probably got incorrect messages that meant we didn't understand who felt what, or why, within situations.&#x200B;This means that the problem is not that there is something wrong with the person, or something dysfunctional about their psyche. What is means is that the person has not had the opportunities to connect to, feel, understand or trust their emotions. &#x200B;So maybe you feel changeable because you haven't had those experiences that build the solid sense of self inside. Maybe you feel changeable because you haven't had the experiences that clarify which emotions are yours, and which you have absorbed from others. Then, if you have a false front that interacts with the world, nothing is ever going to feel like it goes inside. If it was an excellent defence – which made attacking treatment feel like it was hitting something fake outside the self – then anything incoming that's positive is also going to hit that bit of fake outer plastic and not go where it's needed.Again, if our real feelings come out, and someone sees and responds, it likely builds up our sense of self and of our personality. If we have a fake imitation performance shield wall thingy, then nothing will feel like it connects to us, because it has not connected with us. It hit the fake thing and slid off.&#x200B;In those circumstances, the way others are would really affect your sense of self. We would be absorbing their feelings and going up or down depending on them. We might get some positivity from others, but it wouldn't stay with us because it wouldn't actually connect. Falling asleep so might have to think some more tomorrow...&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;. ...is because we fuse, and I don't know where MeYou ends, and YouMe begins, and I am so confused. I would like to be free of this pain.I've been down and out for a couple of months, but I am steady and going well again. Myself and u/MudVoidspark had a chat recently about the common BPD(or vulnerable narc)+NPD relationships or, to be more precise, the relationship between a dominant and a submissive partner.Probably a lot of you relate to this: I do, as a (recovering) submissive person who is attracted to dominant personalities. Mud, of course, occupies the other side of the spectrum, so it was a good opportunity to try and pick apart some of the complex mysteries of this intriguing Cluster B phenomenon.If you click the link below, you will go to the episode webpage, where I have put up some links to online articles which helped me understand the whole thing a little better.&#x200B;[NPD+BPD - PD Raw](https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/episode/7fd9c011-b704-412b-98ff-321c241b4873). Because they are really talking about a part of themselves.In every narcissistic family, it seems, there are the valued, and the devalued.Winners and losers.&#x200B;For some here, it seems to cycle. Sunshine one day, being vilified the next. Raised up, pushed down. On the pedestal, then sent to hell for breaking a rule.For me, in my family, it was always the loser's role.In my family, to feel good about yourself, you had to have someone to look down on. Having me there, made them feel better about themselves. There was always me to compare themselves to. That was my role. To be deficient. Defective. Incapable. Malfunctioning. The failure of my life, threw their success into greater contrast.I was always on the outside, looking in. Locked out somehow. Wanting to be a part of them, but never being let in from the cold. Instead, I was sick. Unstable. Unwell. Damaged. Fucked up. Unbalanced. In a family like mine, no one calls you names. No one says this to your face. It's not put into words, for you to argue with.It's just subtle. Built in, silent but present, implicit in everyday interactions.And boy, did it seep into me. Into every part. Into my bones, that assumption about my abilities. It became part of every cell. I was the failure they could compare themselves to.Kinda weird, isn't it? You'd rather have a child with scars on their arms, and spending time in a psychiatric hospital, than change? Wow, you almost lost her, lying in a hospital bed and hooked up to machines to monitor the overdose, but that was still acceptable. Let's never even mention it.I cried a lot about this today, but I've stopped being able to directly access the pain again. But I know, me crawling along with my broken life made them feel better. They could look at me and compare themselves.And it is finally dawning on me, after many decades, that it was not true. There has never been anything wrong with me. I am functional. I am capable. I can do the things I was always taught I couldn't. I am *normal*.I am like them. I can do the things they do. I always could, I was just treated like I couldn't. How fucked up is that? You would rather have your own child struggling to survive, than have them flourish, just to make yourself feel better?And it's only a quirk of fate, the fact of being born in the 20th Century, when a group of people had already spent time studying this sort of family system, that allowed me to escape. It's only the hard work of some, and my own determination, that has allowed me to get out. What a terrible, terrible world it was for me.&#x200B;&#x200B;I don't understand people. I really don't.&#x200B;&#x200B;. I was chatting with u/Arise23 and u/MudVoidspark about the NPD feelings of losing yourself/changing for others (something reported often here) and I had a thought. Stick with me, because I'm wondering if I can see a connection, maybe a cause.First off, let me add in some information which will end up being relevant. I was diagnosed Narcissistic BPD, so the BPD was the primary disorder. I used to be incredibly unstable, and I described it as being like a tumbleweed. Nothing to anchor me to the ground, no connection, no stability. I didn't have any sort of internal structure for my emotions: they just swept in and plunged me into awful states.It was quite terrifying, because I had absolutely no control, so I lived with the knowledge that I would be dragged around by these terrible changing moods.When I did therapy, my therapist explained it this way: as we grow, we absorb our parents'/caregivers' words into us. These form into internal walls, which hold our emotions and keep us steady.When I asked him what BPD was, he said that, if you watch a small child, you will see them become overwhelmed with their emotions. From this, I understood it to mean that someone with BPD has not had enough of the necessary experiences to build those internal walls that contain their emotions.This instability, this lack of internal structure, was fixable, because he fixed it for me. He was there, at the same time, every week, for years. Always calm, always understanding, always accepting. The regular, routine, safe experience of reliability and care meant that somehow a platform was created that I could stand on. I know it's not just me, because u/Few-Award-2158 had intensive therapy and benefited the same way, and u/Moldbellchains also talked to me about the soothing effect of predictable, stable, safe therapeutic interventions.So it seemed that a lack of the right type of contact with a caregiver, over those early years of childhood, meant that there was no opportunity to build the internal structure that a lot of people take for granted.&#x200B;A few months ago, I chatted over the phone to another Redditor who has HPD traits, and I was struck by the way her emotions slid and shifted very rapidly, along with her thoughts. It felt so similar to the BPD, except she felt overstimulated, as if she had been revved up through her childhood alongside the lack of regular, steady caregiver who would provide the stability she could draw on to build her own internal structure.If a child missed out on interactions with an adult with mature internal structure, and was at the same time exposed to someone/some caregivers whose thoughts jumped topic rapidly and did not settle on one for long enough to really delve into it, then it could be they developed what is called HPD. The difference with BPD would be the longer time falling into one thought state, and developing deep depressions as a result (also being stuck in hurt and despair). But both would be equally difficult and painful.I have read that Cluster B disorders can be thought to occur from the same roots, but present differently on the surface. It really, really felt this way – that there was not too much in the way of difference. Therefore the same type of secure routine in therapy could provide the way to grow stability, just as it did for me u/Few-Award-2158 and u/Moldbellchains.&#x200B;When talking with u/Arise23, and thinking about that extreme changeability, which seems to come with a sense that there is nothing behind the mask's adaptions to the other person, it was striking how there is the same lack of internal structure in that experience.If you were forced, as a child, to focus very heavily on the caregiver (preventing you from dwelling within the experience of your own emotions), and if you were consistently attacked for your own emotions (meaning you hid them, even from yourself), then your self expression, and your awareness/consciousness would be slightly different to a BPD or and HPD. However, that sense of not knowing who you are, and of being incredibly changeable in the face of exposure to different people, could possibly be exactly the same thing as the other 2 disorders: that lack of internal structure due to the lack of experiencing those stable, appropriate, steadying caregiver interactions.And if you had learned, as a child, to really adapt your external behaviours to mimic what was in front of you, and to behave in ways that were socially acceptable – including not allowing your vulnerability to be seen in the same way as a BPD or HPD), then, on the outsid,e you could present as quite different. But maybe it's not different at all.&#x200B;Anyways, the good news is there are 3 people right here who have experienced a real improvement in this lack of structure, from therapy. And exposure to a steady, trustworthy figure seems to be able to replace the lack of those experiences in your childhood.&#x200B;Thoughts?&#x200B;&#x200B;. Hi everyoneI am a regular on r/NPD, and myself and a friend from that sub have a podcast for people with personality disorders or traits.I was diagnosed Narcissistic BPD, although that was 20 years ago and I am pretty good now. My friend was diagnosed BPD, and we have have people with ASPD, NPD and Schizotypal PD on as guests.However, that's not the entire spectrum of personality disorders! We want to hear people's experiences, what they've tried in terms of treatment, what works for them. Basically letting others know they are not alone, and maybe also giving inspiration through learning what has helped another person. Myself, I have chatted over the phone with a Redditor who thought they had NPD. but after doing tests came out strongly for HPD. When I talked to them, it reminded me very much of my BPD, and the lack of sense of stability. There are theories that many of the disorders are similar underneath, and just expressed somewhat differently, and I could certainly feel strong similarities.Anyway, please DM me if you would like to know more.Oh, forgot to say, it is a volunteer project, so there is not money paid, or to pay. We just do it to reduce stigma!. Some of you will know that I and other members of this sub are running a podcast called [PD Raw](https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/1?order=newest). It's for, about and by people who have/had had personality disorders/traits of personality disorders. We are all volunteers ( I need to give a shout out here to a very generous subber who donated to the running costs recently).Plenty of people on this sub talk about the current dehumanisation of pwNPD/narcissism. Narcissistic abuse is a real thing (admit it!), but none of us here developed unhealthy traits through having a childhood which validated our emotional needs.One of the outgrowths of this current trend is the proliferation of "experts" on the topic of narcissism, who go on to advise others on how to deal with (*people they have identified as*) narcissists. A number of these advice-givers with highly visible platforms are psychologists.&#x200B;What is puzzling is that, if someone has the professional training/knowledge/insight around narcissism, then they surely understand that it is a collection of defence mechanisms, developed during childhood, to protect the person from overwhelming emotional pain. But how come this is not included in the advice?I mean, isn't the actually useful advice going to be that the pwNarcissism is suffering, and covering up their feelings of weakness by putting on an impervious mask? Wouldn't it be better to advise others to see/talk directly to the real person underneath? To learn to brush aside the behaviours based on defensiveness/the fake personas, and to deal with the inner person (who struggles to cope with closeness and relationships)?I mean, if you encourage others to see the pwNarcissism as an inhuman monster, aren't you actually taking away the most powerful tool when dealing with a false facade? And aren't you also training people to devalue their own humanity, as well as that of other people's?***After all, if you are actually against narcissistic abuse, you want to stop it, not add to it...***&#x200B;\----------------------------&#x200B;&#x200B;With that in mind, we want to have an episode called "Dr Ramen", with people's stories of some of the childhood experiences that contributed to the development of their narcissism.We are calling on anyone here to contribute, anonymously or not, a snippet of their childhood experiences. Rather than reinforcing the unfeeling monster image, we want to present an entire episode of people's real life stories. We want to challenge the current stereotype, and to supply the missing piece that unscrupulous mental health "professionals" are not providing: the look at the reality of what is behind this personality disorder.&#x200B;If you want to contribute, you can:1. DM myself or u/Few-Award-2158 and be recorded telling your story (you can give any name, or no name at all)2. Email us at [pdrawpodcast@proton.me](mailto:pdrawpodcast@proton.me) 3. Leave a comment here and tell us we are fine to read it out on air.&#x200B;The podcast is a democratic space, designed to reflect and give a platform to all the different experiences/viewpoints of pwPDs/traits.

I've spent a while now on this sub, and have seen plenty of posts and comments. Some themes keep coming up regularly.Two of them are that feeling of emptiness inside: the lack of feeling substantial, of having an authentic inner self, and then the worry about not knowing who you are, and doubting yourself in various situations, as if your reactions are not genuine.I am coming at this from a slightly different angle, because my diagnosis was Narcissistic BPD, so my primary experience was BPD, but it is definitely in parallel with NPD and I can see so many shared traits. Plus I think we can swap insights, because these two disorders seem to be able to help each other with blind spots and character weaknesses and strengths.My experience was never without emotion, as everyone will be aware that BPD is too emotional (90% of them negative dammit). Therefore, I never felt empty, **but** I did feel horribly unstable. I was terrified of myself, of my dark plunges into deep despair and self-hatred. I always felt a huge burden: carrying that awful blackness on my back, and knowing, when I felt good, that soon enough something in the world would trigger it, and the blackness would break through this temporary bubble and overwhelm me again. This, I believe, is what is called "splitting", which is the most stupid term. You can't split something that was never whole. Instead, it's about holding out against the blackness, until things happen and you can't do that while it washes over you.I also had no internal structure/ stability, and hated myself for the fact that I was so easily influenced. Nowadays, I see that as me absorbing the feelings of other people, when I interacted with them, so afterwards I might walk away seeing things quite differently than before the interaction.&#x200B;**That's Point Number 1 for y'all.**&#x200B;Were you enmeshed? Did your parents/carers confuse you with their emotions/deny your emotions/attribute their own emotions to you? Did they never identify yours correctly, so that you don't even know what they are?It took me until about two years in to my therapy (and we are talking twice a week for that first year or so) until I suddenly went "Oh! I'm absorbent! These aren't my feelings – I picked them up from X..."So when you interact with others, and feel you have a persona, or doubt your own feelings, it could be that you are intermingling yours with theirs, and are not sure where you end and they begin. That's not a bad thing, because it means you are quite capable of having feelings, but also of emotional empathy...yes, I'll repeat that...emotional empathy. However, that capacity is not felt because...&#x200B;**Point Number 2 for y'all.**&#x200B;I notice that lots of people here say they don't feel love. BPDs do, absolutely, though it is heavily burdened with all the pain and rage that is carried inside, so it can get blotted out for a while/faded while the other stuff shrieks on inside you (and then abandoned when the we believe we have been seriously betrayed). I suspect NPDs have just disconnected from their sensations of feeling love. It is there, it's just not felt. In childhood, NPDs have gotten out the liquid nitrogen and frozen off all the ties to this part of themselves. This means that you often feel empty in the situations when you expect to feel love. (But hey, what happens when you feel you are going to be abandoned???? If you didn't love that person, you wouldn't care. And what is idealisation??? *It's love + hope for the dream of feeling safe and valued*.)You're not empty, you're just disconnected from the emotions that were not safe for you to experience. I suspect that those emotions had to be totally blocked out, because any hint of them meant an attack on them. That's how you coped. Pat on the back for surviving.&#x200B;**And here comes Point Number 3...**&#x200B;Lot's of times, people talk about being confused by their own reactions and response, strongly doubting themselves and therefore believing that they have no personality/all their reactions are fake. They may particularly doubt that any of it is genuine, because it can be contradictory. Firstly, if you have disconnected from the feelings of your own emotions, it will be difficult to tell what is what. Also, though, life is very complex. What's more, *every situation is actually complex and also multi-faceted*.I didn't understand this in regards to emotions. My therapist pointed this out. He would say "It sounds like one part of you feels X, and another part of you feels Y." He explicitly explained the fact that *it is quite normal to have opposing feelings about the same situation*. He said that is is painful to be in conflict that way, which is why people project it outwards (and perhaps argue with another person who is expressing one side of your inner conflict). So, the fact that you may find yourself feeling or expressing multiple viewpoints is not a sign of pathology. It is a reflection of that fact that the world is rich, complex, profound, detailed. If you have disconnected from the strong experience of your own emotions, this shifting could be experienced as a lack of true self, but I don't think it is. It is simply that missing sensation of the inner emotions which tie it all together. Plus the gradual establishment of internal emotional boundaries will start to make clear which are your own emotions, and which are other's emotions picked up in a normal and healthy way, as part of human emotional connection.&#x200B;**Last Point** &#x200B;...leading on from Point Number 3 is the fact that it is normal and natural to hate others, to envy them, to feel competitive with them, to resent them, to feel impatient with them. This is what happens when you are in a relationship with another person. You may love them, but that doesn't wipe out the negatives, and the difficulties of two humans trying to get along.However, if you have disconnected from feeling your own emotions of love and care, then you will only experience the negative aspects. When people on this sub write about not caring for others, and feeling like bad humans because of having these really negative feelings for others, I suspect it is that it is a case of normal reactions which are not balanced out by opposing feelings of love and positivity. As more emotions become available to me (taking years to grow and develop), it feels like the negatives, which I thought (desperately hoped) would disappear, actually have a place, and that the experience of the world gets filled out with many positive, warm emotions as well as the others. That means that, although I do feel negative feelings to others, the warm ones persist, and modify the cold, rejecting ones. The warm ones make the ties to others, and keep relationships going even when I feel shitty and tired of someone. I feel like the negatives can be more temporary, or more "here today, gone tomorrow, coming back soon but will disappear", while the connecting feelings underlie and persist. They may not always be felt, but they are definitely there.&#x200B;TLDR: to wrap it up, if you have disconnected from many of your emotions, and are enmeshed/haven't had the experience of caregivers correctly identifying and responding to your inner self (which teaches you to see/feel/understand yourself), then you may feel empty and also insubstantial. However, perhaps it's not the changeable outer parts that are a problem at all: it is simply that you are not experiencing the inner bit that knits all these diverse, varying, appropriate parts together.And maybe, just maybe, you are not as callous as you appear. Maybe it's just that you haven't had the space where you feel safe enough to let in your loving feelings.&#x200B;That's my latest theory. Thoughts?. Dammit I had no fucking clue I had a pd throughout my entire twenties, but I keep meeting ppl on this sub who are self-aware so early.Facing up to that shit is super-hard, I should know. I had to have my face pushed into it by my therapist – and held there – for ages, for me to accept a lot of it. People who grab reality by the curlies have my respect.u/OMGitsRuthless talked with me a couple of weeks ago, and this guy is not afraid to own up to himself. He is determined, direct and proactive. So much for some diagnoses being a life sentence; old childhood patterns don't stand a chance against someone who is resolute.On top of that, he has the best method for finding a suitable therapist.Have a listen to Ruthless on the latest episode of the podcast inspired by/featuring r/NPD subbers:[Ruthless - Facing Yourself Head On](https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/episode/86684792-3c03-49f3-9c22-482550a8507d). Although I had a full nervous breakdown with a complimentary stay in a psychiatric hospital, in what I am starting to suspect is a sign of something not quite right, it has never, ever, ever been discussed in my family in the entire 20 years since.In fact, emotions are never discussed. So I broke a time-honoured family taboo by writing to my sibling and saying there is narcissism in the family. &#x200B;&#x200B;Some background: I have been the family "mess", the weak one, the emotional wreck, the unstable one, the failure etc. Seeing me flailing around down the bottom of of the functional spectrum has given other family members the satisfaction of being above, of having a loser to compare themselves to.My sibling has gone on to have a shining career, in the field that my family considers important. My parents separated when I was small, and both re-partnered. I have some half-siblings on my dad's side. At 21, I rocked the boat a bit, and didn't hear from my dad again. That meant I lost contact with my half-siblings when they were toddlers. However, my full sibling continued in the relationship with my father. This included my dad coming round to collect my sibling when we shared an apartment together as young adults, and me sitting in my room and hearing my dad arrive and them both leave.This is yet another thing nobody in my family ever discussed. Nobody has ever mentioned the fact that I was shut out, or raised the possibility that I deserved anything better.The role of "Loser" was given to me by my mother (who I grew up with). Plenty of covert narcissism on that side of the fam. The role of "The Unwanted One" was given to me by my dad. Quite possibly a teeny tiny factor in aforementioned psychological episode.At the end of my stay in the facility that provides free meals, a bed and free meds, I got the diagnosis of Narcissistic BPD. I may have mentioned the BPD bit to my mum, not sure. But as I said, none of that was discussed.&#x200B;&#x200B;Anyways, I did therapy and settled down, wrote a letter apologising for myself to my father, we established a weak connection, and I met my half-siblings, who were all tall and grown up by then, and started to form a relationship with them. &#x200B;Recently, though, I got shook up, and bits of me -- that I probably don't need – started to crack. A few months ago I was talking to my sibling's spouse. In a surprising twist (that therapists would likely find not surprising at all), this spouse also has an older sister, and that older sister also has the family role of "Loser". I'd noticed this family dynamic a bit over the years, but this time I could hear the contempt in my sister-in-law's voice as she talked about her sister. I started to feel anger.Thank you thank you thank you to everyone here, who shares with honesty. It has helped me to see things more clearly. Just before Christmas, I broke it off with my dad. First, I stopped contacting him, which wasn't noticed for quite a few months...because we rarely speak. Then I got more angry, and I saw that our relationship has not failed because of anything I didn't do right. It has failed because he didn't want it. So I've ended it.And then I wrote to my sibling about the family narcissism. Very surprisingly, they wrote back and said they work so hard because they have impostor syndrome, and because they want validation. &#x200B;Yup, they basically agreed with my assessment.&#x200B;Then I sent them the link to an article about vulnerable narcissism occurring in conjunction with being a Highly Sensitive Person. I titled the email "Cringe" and said I recognised myself in the description.My sibling wrote back with a couple of quotes from the article, referring to themselves!I replied that I was special and unique, and therefore I was not sharing my vulnerable narcissism with anyone else.&#x200B;Not long afterwards, my sibling phoned me and *apologised for not being there for me when I had my nervous breakdown*. They then said that their relationship with my father was shit. Now, this blows my mind, because they live in the same city as my dad, work in the same industry, and see my dad, step-mother and half-siblings on a regular basis.However, they said that they had tried reaching out to my dad emotionally when their first serious relationship broke up, and got nothing but rejection. My sibling described their relationship with our dad as "irreparable".Wtf? Everything that seemed to be, for 3 decades, is not as I thought. &#x200B;You know, my family has held me face down in the mud for so long. They have felt better because I was failing. They have benefited from my pain. Now, I love my mum, because she has continued to make it up to me throughout our adult years, and we are all good finally. But fuck it. I am starting to succeed in a profession that was impossible for family members, using extraversion and people skills and improvisation and crazy ideas. I am starting to fly far above what they ever thought was possible for me. I am handing back all their shit.&#x200B;And I hope they all starting to enjoy the taste of dirt in their mouths.In the last couple of decades, the term" Highly Sensitive Person" has become commonly known. The concept is that an estimated 15–30% of the population have a deeper nervous system response to physical, emotional and/or social stimuli.Brain research suggests that these people have greater activity in the areas associated with empathy, emotion, social cues and self-awareness. It's no surprise then, that this trait is associated with kindness, as well as with creativity, insight, a great appreciation for beauty, and narcissism.....wait, what? With all those super-active mirror neurons, isn't an HSP a pillar of all that is good and selfless in the world?No, says u/MudVoidspark, in a way that, as per usual, does not flatter any sensitivities.&#x200B;Mud also has lots to say about the way society goes about treating "problem" kids, extinguishing their hope and trust in the world. It's too late for us – our childhoods were fucked up. But hey, can we move forward in a way that makes it better for future generations?Yep, the latest podcast episode is out.

Hi everyoneI am a regular on r/NPD and I really enjoy the community there. Lots of people hang round and give support and encouragement. In the spirit of this, a few of us have started a podcast to share the experience of having narcissism or other disorders/traits.The purpose of the podcast is to allow people to feel heard, accepted and respected, considering all of us have fought against feeling the opposite. It is to let people know they are not alone, to allow them to compare experiences and share insights and useful information.It is also designed to give non personality-disordered people the opportunity to listen in and to get to understand the people behind the mask. Narcissism is a trap in that people cannot show how they truly feel – so nobody understands them, then their needs do not get met, and the whole problem keeps on going.Our last purpose is to fight against the huge amount of dehumanising material on the internet, which stigmatises people who are struggling with a personality disorder.Please add a comment here to tell us what you want to be covered. This podcast is for you guys, so don't be shy![https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/1?order=newest](https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/1?order=newest). Hello Clustered friendsOver on r/NPD we have quite a community going, with lots of people deep on their journey, and ready to support and encourage others. It is made up of people from around the world, who have been diagnosed with NPD, BPD, ASPD or with traits of those and others.Inspired by this great work, a few of us have started a podcast for people with PDs (or traits). I myself was diagnosed with Narcissistic BPD just over 20 years ago, and have done a lot of work. The most important was therapy, and in therapy my therapist demonstrated to me that I was accepted and cared for just as I was.This is the purpose of the podcast: to show people just as they are, to give them acceptance, to give them a voice, and to let others know that they are not alone. We are also trying to destigmatise the disorder, and to be a project that battles the current huge amount of dehumanising anti-narcissist material out on the internet.There are several of us involved. We are volunteers and pay for the running costs out of our own pockets. We are also gathering together links to free resources which we include in show notes, to help people find more support.We would also love to hear from any of you. Everyone has their own story, their own journey. Everyone has insights and things to share. If you would like to appear as a guest, just pop over to r/NPD and DM me or u/Few-Award-2158.We also want to hear from you in terms of feedback: what did you like, what didn't you like, what do you want to hear. It's for you guys, so let us know what you want!&#x200B;[https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/1?order=newest](https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/1?order=newest). Katja Pavlovna is a teacher by day, and a mental health campaigner by night...or whenever it is she's not teaching and marking, and writing reports, and all that other stuff teachers do.She is a co-founder of the [Lives Not Labels website](https://www.livesnotlabels.com/), which features a project called **Sorry My Mental Illness Isn't Sexy Enough For You**. In it, people from around the world share stories of their experience of having a mental illness/personality disorder.Katja has a PD diagnosis – one that is relatively unknown – and says the project is run by others with a PD. She also says many of her friends also fall into the category of having a diagnosis. If the 10 hours a week preparing people's personal stories for publishing on the website was not enough, she is also a member of the podcast [The BPD Bunch](https://www.youtube.com/@thebpdbunch).She is full of proactive awesomeness.

Hi Katja! Hear her interview on the latest PD RAW podcast episode. [PD RAW](https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/1?order=newest). We all know that large sections of the internet – including some produced by so-called mental health professionals – are dedicated to gross misinformation about narcissism, in particular painting people with narcissism as some sort of inhuman creature who exists only to hurt others.Against this backdrop, some people are working hard to change that, and to educate the public about what narcissism actually is.The Nameless Narcissist has his own YouTube and TikTok channels, providing explanations of Narcissism from within his own experience. This is particularly brave, considering the online hate that this can and does attract.In particular, he provides insights into behaviours. Considering how much people without strong narcissistic defences struggle to understand people who do, this is an incredibly precious way to contribute to building bridges between the two. This gives people (without strong narcissistic defences) a "way in"; an understanding of what is happening behind those defences. However, it also provides mental health professionals with learning material in order to help them refine and improve their own approach to treating narcissism.Happily for the crew at PD Raw podcast, he is generous with his time and commitment to being open. He spoke with us recently, and the interview is now up and available as the latest episode.&#x200B;(And this time, I have remembered to put in the link to the website...)&#x200B;[https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/1?order=newest](https://pdrawpodcast.alitu.com/1?order=newest).

Most helpful would be to have a collection of ideas from a number of people, so those listening have more chance to find something that works for them.If you guys would be so good as to add comments here, that could be read out, that would be fantastic. If you would like to talk and have a recording of your ideas, that would also be fantastic.The email [pdrawresources@gmail.com](mailto:pdrawresources@gmail.com) has been created with a list of books, authors and websites suggested by u/OkDemand6401 and u/MudVoidspark in it's auto reply, so that people can email it and get the reply with the list. However, it was blocked by my usual email account service, so I may need to figure it out. The intention is that it exists for now as a place for people to email when they want to discover helpful resources, and it is a free service that can be added to continually.Episode 3, which features r/NPD legend u/Few-Award-2158, has just been published.Meet the human behind the avatar!

On this sub, many of us lament the dehumanisation and lack of knowledge about pathological narcissism (and about personality disorders in general). Many of us wish for better understanding, and for compassion.I have been on Quora for 5 years. It was a hobby to read people's ideas, and to post my own. I had a number of followers, and understand how it works.Quora is, as some will know, one of those spaces that are an absolute dumpster fire of narcissist-bashing. However, there is an advantage in that, because it is a topic that people are very interested in.In January, I created a Quora profile under the name Nota Bene, which had not been taken yet. I started posting content, which quickly got views. It is a good platform to start to spread information.Last week, after launching the podcast, I deleted my Quora account, as old material is linked to my real name. Both profiles disappeared. However, 5 days ago I recreated the Nota Bene account, and started recreating the content which combats misinformation about pathological narcissism. I also included links to the podcast in some of my answers.Two days ago, my views were 78. Yesterday, they were 322. Today, there is a notification that the views have crossed over 750. People are hungry to understand narcissism. They have been demonising for so long that now they wish to look Satan in the face. Perhaps the best thing already from Quora is that a Quoran named Bernardo responded to one of my posts. He also suffers from narcissism, and was relieved, I think, to be able to discuss this. He has put up a couple of open comments about the experience, and I have responded. I have also DM'd him and directed him here.If you are on Quora, please go to the Nota Bene profile and follow it, and upvote the posts. This will place them in front of more eyes. (I don't get paid for this. It will, however, mean more people will see content that provides a different view of narcissism and the reality of personality disorders.)&#x200B;It will also drive people to the podcast. At the moment, I am putting the finishing touches to the interview with u/Few-Award-2158. It will be up in 1 or two hours. So far, we have 43 downloads, in (order of amount) the US, UK, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Italy (2 downloads, probably Bernardo), Australia, Colombia, Lithuania and Poland.How cool is that! u/Bulletproofnarc and u/Few-Award-2158 have lots of great ideas for content. We want to keep spreading positive, helpful information. We also want to be able to afford a new website, in order able to include a whole lot of resources for people to be able to go access for free. (Few Award and Bullet's writing would have a prominent place!) If the podcast ever gets enough downloads to attract any advertising, this is what I want for it: a place for people to access help for dealing with PDs and narcissism. A Redditor suggested a list of helpful books etc. At the moment, the only idea I can think of, since we don't have an editable website, is to create another email account, maybe "pdrawresources@..." and set it to automatically reply with the list included in that reply.Therefore, I am asking for your help in compiling that list. Any books, channels, podcasts etc that you have found helpful in your journey. If you could post them here as a comment, that would be fabulous.&#x200B;People here are already working as a team, bringing about change by supporting others, and providing helpful tips and insights. Let's keep going, and spread some positive information out there!. For those who don't know him, he is a Quoran with a large following (23K+), who posts about how evil narcissists are. He does it really well, with lots of creative imagery and rich, emotive language. People love what he writes, and he can have long trailing streams of comments, on the posts where they are not disabled, saying how fantastic his insights are. The commenters go with the usual "my ex" who did this or that, and how awful they are. Basically a crystallisation of the stuff on many other forums. And he really plays into it. His basic story is how disgusting, depraved, empty and inhuman the narcissist is, and how you should either torment them back, or abandon them altogether.It's quite clear how this would make someone with narcissism feel despairing about themselves.&#x200B;However, what about if we flip it around, and look at his posts, and all those others, from a different direction. Because I suspect what Torbay is talking about is not the narcissist, ***but the feelings that narcissistic treatment arouses in people***.I can say, from recent run-ins with people with overt narc traits, that that treatment has the most strangely powerful effect. It must be that devaluation affects all but the most highly self-confident people (there are not many of those) and the struggle against it continues on for some time (months, years). The effect is so strong, that the desire to return and reverse it persists and persists.So what Torbay is really portraying is that fight against the self, against that part that seeks validation, which wishes to return and try to change what happened. To seek approval. To seek affirmation. To do this, he is reframing that inner Godlike Disapprover (the one activated by the narcissistic treatment, and is embodied by the pwNPD), that grinds on and on with the negative attacks, and pitiful and unworthy.In reality, there will be plenty of pwNPD who have done cruel things. But that can be dealt with by cutting that person out of your life. The ongoing struggle between the desire for acceptance and the inner critical voice. Maybe it will feel better, next time you read that stuff, to see it as a slap-back against the universal experience of devaluation, and the behaviour that embodies it.&#x200B;In that way, Torbay is actually not full of shit, because he talks about important inner struggles. However, his posts really need a disclaimer which says something like "*People suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder/traits are inevitably struggling with difficult and intensely invalidating upbringings. It is important to see past the behaviour to the person underneath, to not make the mistake of dehumanising someone with significant psychological issues.*" etc etc&#x200B;On that note, the thing about NPD, and ASPD, is it they are the perfect trap, because they don't allow any of the vulnerability to show which would then change the perception/understanding in the person on the other end.I have been tossing around ideas in my head, about changing this and somehow allowing ordinary people to see behind the facade. Here on this sub, people, I believe, talk from their inner selves, and others respond the same way. When you consider the prognosis for pwPDs, it's pretty incredible seeing everyone share what works for them, and provide support.The idea I have come up with is a podcast. Podcasts are good, because they allow people to tune into the emotions and inner world, by not (visually) showing the outer person. I think it would be great to talk about that inner world, that inner experience, and the conditions that made them occur in the first place, plus what people have found that works to help them overcome that shit.It might be an important resource, for increasing understanding in ordinary people, plus for those suffering and not understanding, and needing more knowledge.I have the name, I've done the artwork, I've purchased the music, invented a pseudonym and have found the platform. Still not sure – kicking around all the doubts in my head. What do you all think?. Just been reading a therapist's blog, trying to learn more about masochism/sadism (thank you to the members here who have kept expanding my mind and have sent me in this direction), and I was completely struck by a sentence in it:*"It’s a heroic act for abusers to decide that enough is enough, that the time is now to break a cycle of generational abuse that they inherited without asking for or deserving."*&#x200B;How true this is. However imperfect the person, however bad some of their behaviour has been, however much the change is motivated by plenty of self-interest, nonetheless, **turning and facing your own bad behaviour is courageous**. Extremely courageous.&#x200B;There are lots of posts on this sub about empathy/"empaths"/the empath subs, spaces, platforms etc. I can see that this is a real point of pain for many here, due to the struggle with empathy, and also the relentless message about it being absent as a feature of narcissism. It seems as if this topic may be something that plenty of people here feel inadequate about, and also the current trend of narcissist-hating inflames that.Now, I totally understand why people need to vent about abusive behaviour they have received, and why you need to go through a period of hating the person, and divorcing yourself mentally from the relationship/the closeness that allowed it to happen.I totally agree that narcissistic abuse is awful. And maybe that's exactly why the people who admit to it are doing something so brave.&#x200B;I'm going to point out that the empath sub HAS A LIST OF RULES ABOUT NOT BEHAVING BADLY TO OTHER MEMBERS.Let's repeat that: the empath sub has to have restraints to stop members from harassing, devaluing, attacking and censuring other members.&#x200B;Spaces like that have never been very appealing to me, and now it's becoming clearer that perhaps these types of spaces are a lot about splitting, and inhabiting the 'all good' mindset. That doesn't seem particularly challenging or advanced.People looking into, and confronting themselves, seems much more worthwhile. &#x200B;When I got diagnosed, it was as Narcissistic Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm starting to think about how, in some ways, I had it easy. The BPD bit allowed me to slide over the "na......." word at the start, and block out its humiliating and awful ramifications. And this was 20 years ago, before the current tsunami of negative material about narcissists.The BPD mindset also allowed me to see myself as an innocent little damaged thing. So it was a soft landing, so to speak, compared to anyone who just has a straight-up NPD and/or ASPD diagnosis. Having that mindset also allowed me to seek help more readily.&#x200B;So, you have probably done shitty things. You probably feel really bad about yourselves. But maybe stop for a moment, and give yourself some credit for the incredibly difficult - and lonely - thing you are doing. &#x200B;**RESPECT** TO YOU.*Here's a brief summary of (my understanding of) what I've been reading from a book by psychotherapist who worked successfully with narcissistic patients.*&#x200B;When we are born, we have no sense of self. We are a swirling mass of sensations. In our very first months, we don't know that we are separate from what is around us. However, we quickly start to pick up signals from around us, even though we are not clear about what they are. At this point in our lives, we do start to learn about safety and comfort – depending on how much is supplied. We can start to feel safe or unsafe, which is more a question of degree that just a simple 'yes' or 'no'.Then we figure out we are separate from our primary caregiver (who I will call 'Mama' because this is the archetype), and we panic when we are away from her. We have started to understand that we are dependent on Mama.Mama does not just feed and protect us though. Mama is starting to teach us what everything means. Mama holds us and talks to us about what we are experiencing. When we screw up our faces in frustration, Mama says "What's wrong little one? Didn't you like it when Aunty took away your toy? Naughty Aunty!". When we laugh, Mama laughs and looks delighted too, and keeps pulling funny faces. Mama says "Isn't that funny, little one! Mama looks so silly!". When we howl, Mama picks us up and says "What's the matter little one? Did you have a nasty nightmare? Let Mama hold you. It's ok, you are safe with Mama".When Mama looks at us, we feel seen. When Mama connects with what we are feeling, we feel seen. When Mama reacts to our feelings, names them, responds to them, we feel seen for who we are on the inside. Mama is also teaching us what these sensations are, and how to cope with them, by demonstrating this through her responses and by naming our inner experiences for us.Then we start crawling, walking and exploring. Wow! How fantastic to be able to move this body we are in. We feel so proud of ourselves. "Look Mama! I jumped all the way off this sofa! I am so big and strong!".But we are faced with some dilemmas. We feel so strong and proud, but there are many things we can't do, so we also have plenty of times where we feel helpless and overwhelmed. Sometimes we feel big and scary in our rage and tantrums, and in the way people rush to react to us, but also we can feel vulnerable and so desperately needy and dependent. We start to understand that we are a separate person, who is different from Mama. We want to go and explore, be on our own, have our own adventures and our own thoughts, but we also want to be the same as Mama, wrapped comfortingly in her arms and part of something bigger and stronger than ourselves.Of course, this is the ideal version. By this stage, plenty of things can have gone wrong.&#x200B;My therapist used to talk about all of us having tasks to accomplish. By this, he meant going through the above challenges, and resolving the different dilemmas. Rather than portraying the world as having 'healthy' or 'unhealthy' people, the picture I got from him was of all of us being a mix of different stages and different resolutions of all the different challenges. Our caregivers, being human, have also gone through these challenges, and they have developed different responses based on their own experiences. They can only draw on their past, their experiences and their understanding. Whatever parts they have inside, whether constructive or destructive, is what they use to respond to us. In the real world, many of us, by this stage, have been rejected when we displayed certain emotions and/or behaviour. On a level far deeper than conscious thought, we are aware that this is a deep and terrible threat to our own survival. As group animals, we are wired to fit in with our carers, so that they accept us and continue to care for us until we become independent.When we are rejected by our carers, we feel a deep and terrible sense of shame. We feel hideous, repulsive, defective, contagious, radioactive. We turn to searching for the expressions and behaviours that meet approval and acceptance. This is when we start to detach from our inner selves, and from our own psychological development. And we start to develop into the the persona that gives us positive (or less awful) feedback from our carers.There are many messages that we might have been given by Mama:"I am so hostile and damaging to you, so unable to see you as a human being, that you will turn away from trusting any human." (Anti-social)"How dare you even have any of your own thoughts! I am terrified! I need you to stay exactly the same as me, as part of myself, because I have no inner sense of who I am!" (Schizoid)"Don't leave me! I am afraid on my own! Keep me company in my fear. Your emotions are scary and overwhelming to me. I have never developed independence. Stay childlike, to keep me company." (Borderline)"Go and run around. Explore a bit. It's safe enough to do that. But stop paying attention to yourself! Mama did not listen to me, and now I want you to be my Mama. You must pay attention to my emotions, and look after them. You must give me what my Mama did not give me." (Narcissistic)&#x200B;The psychotherapist says that the child who develops NPD abandons their inner self in order to invest in the ideal image/version of a child that they are presented with. So the void/emptiness develops in this way:&#x200B;1. Mama/caregivers do not pay attention to the emotions and experiences of the child. They do not respond empathically, as described above. They do not name, address and provide examples of how to deal with the inner experiences. Doing this is how a child develops a sense of themselves, and becomes in touch, and able to deal with everything going on inside them.2. The child detaches from their own inner experience, including their bodily sensations, and starts to look at themselves "from the outside", i.e., through the prism of this fantasy image of the ideal child. Basically, they can hardly see their real selves, as they left that and are so focused on trying to become the image that meets approval.3. This is my own theory: when the child shows any **open** need for love, the caregivers are triggered, because they have been unable to deal with this part of themselves. It also subtly shows the caregivers that the child is a separate person, one who will grow to become independent, and not "Mama" who will be there for them always, giving them the emotional support they need. This threat means they attack the child every time the child shows this need. This is a terrible dilemma so, to keep themselves safe, the child buries this need so, so deeply. It is buried to the point that the child can no longer see it or access it, because it is too difficult and too awful for the child to be aware of this need, while at the same time cutting it off in order to serve their caregivers emotionally.&#x200B;Needing others is also tied up with caring for others. It is intertwined with tenderness, connection, understanding, amazement, delight. So all of this gets buried in the deepest block of concrete, far, far away from the child's awareness. With this need for others is the terrible hurt and rage at Mama/the caregivers, for using the child, for not responding to them, for not caring for them as the child needed. So when the child grows up and tries to reach inside, the child has no/not much of the healthy response which has developed their sense and understanding of what is going on inside. This person also has lost touch long ago, and is looking from a great distance. The final layer is the block, which has distanced the pain and feelings of betrayal, along with many positive and enjoyable emotions that are tied up to what is buried.This is an answer by a therapist who I follow on Quora. I wish I had understood, and appreciated more, the experience of therapy, when I was having it. I believe now that it is the closest thing to unconditional love.Not also his opinion on "empaths". Edit: what I was offered in therapy was not some saccharine artificial love-flavoured processed product. I came to understand that I could have talked about having a sexual attraction to children, and I would have been treated with the same care and respect for my inner self. This was how I learnt to start to distinguish between the person (always valuable) and the behaviour (something that can be destructive, but can be changed).**Is empathy really a feeling? I flinch when someone gets physically hurt but I find most emotional people taxing. Specially when they cry over easily fixable matters. Its annoying. I also dislike people who need attention. Is something wrong with me?**📷[**David**](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-22540) · **Follow** Ph.D. in Psychology, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (Graduated 1994)[1y](https://www.quora.com/Is-empathy-really-a-feeling-I-flinch-when-someone-gets-physically-hurt-but-I-find-most-emotional-people-taxing-Specially-when-they-cry-over-easily-fixable-matters-Its-annoying-I-also-dislike-people-who-need/answer/David-22540)No, empathy is not a feeling. It’s a decision, *sometimes made in spite of your feelings*. Therapists make that decision about every client, or should.Sympathy is a feeling. You feel what you imagine the person is feeling, like you flinching when someone gets hurt.Some people believe that certain humans are “empaths.” Some claim it about themselves. They say an empath can sense and experience other people’s feelings in very deep ways, perhaps mysterious and also miraculous ways, that give them special powers (and special suffering).There’s really no such thing as an empath (except maybe Counselor Troi, my favorite empath from Star Trek)No, empathy is a commitment and a developed skill.For a therapist it’s based on deep attention, and a willingness to understand, appreciate, and accept another human, just as they are, including their full range of emotions. It doesn’t mean personally experiencing all those emotions, at all. It often also means letting that other person know, in language they can easily comprehend, that we understand them, and show we understand them by describing accurately what be believe they may be experiencing. And that we respect them, unconditionally, and that we will devote ourselves to assisting them.That kind of empathy can be the basis of the trusting therapeutic relationship, and sometimes it *is* the therapy.Looking at NPD from the outside, from having recently dealt with a number of people who overtly had it, or had traits (as opposed to my covert family), it seems really clear to me that NPD is about relating to people in a way that has removed all traces of (visible) vulnerability.The obsessive focus on status, as it is described in the medical literature, seems to me to be actually and obsession about powerlessness, and the terror of being placed in that position by the other person. To me, it shows that any signs of powerlessness have been attacked, so the person will continually attempt to claw their way out of feeling that by trying to climb up and away, over the other person. This is not because there is an actual threat in the interaction with another, but because of those childhood experiences of being devalued and degraded when allowing that hint of vulnerability to show.Linked to this is the experience of idealisation. I believe it works like this: when we are that small child, we need hope to keep us going. It is the fuel that we need for the will to live. To have hope, we turn away from the awful bits that we cannot process, and create, in our hearts, in the deepest part, the fantasy of a better life, one with love from our parent/s/caregiver - love that is everything that the reality of our treatment is not.This dream, hidden deep away, is what keeps us going, and we adapt to the world as it is. When we are grown, we are the person who adapted to those conditions, with all the beliefs and attitudes shaped by our treatment. But we have that hidden dream, which we seek. We want that beautiful love to come into our lives, to wash over our pain, to soften the sharp bits, to soothe the shredded, weeping wounds.**Why do Cluster B's attract each other?** Why do we pair up? Surely another person with disordered thinking is the last person that we need? Surely someone who is damaged is the last person who can offer real love, whole love, deep caring, compassionate nurture?NOT AT ALL! Another Cluster B has the same parts, and loves the same parts. The outer, conscious creation, the constructed shell, the socially acceptable face, the manageable self that we have built from what we are able to deal with. And the other Cluster B's also have the hidden side, the crying infant, the damaged child, the weeping wound - the part we have pushed away from our consciousness, and locked away behind the strongest, sturdiest of doors, because it is too awful for us to deal with.To me, the idealisation that comes with NPD/BPD (and probs other disorders) is the entering into the fantasy of impossible love, the one we invented in our hearts as a small child, to keep us going. When we enter into idealisation, we let the fantasy out of our hearts. It is here! It is real! It can come true!Of course, shit happens, and the dream crashes. And we suck the fantasy back inside us and go back to nursing ourselves as best we can, through the heartbreak and the despair.Conventional thinking would say that the fantasy love can never exist, that we have to get used to reality, and learn to accept the imperfect world and the everyday offerings that are available. That we need to simply adjust ourselves to what is available and out there.But what if that's not true? What if that super-love really is available?&#x200B;This is kind of hard to explain, but here goes. I am here as the result of some recent events, which started with me falling into idealising a Grandiose Narcissist. After the event, I have needed to work through it, so it doesn't happen again (too hard! too painful! too messy!). The key to finding a better way was reading a sentence that said that Cluster B attractions can be about finding a missing part of yourself in the other, and the change came when I finally saw the vulnerability and insecurity in this person.It was only when I saw that, that I realised what views of the world I had been operating under. I had always had subconscious beliefs about certain traits/types of people being superior to me. This person had come along, and I had idealised them, because they seemed to have everything that I didn't. They were like an opposite, and I had always operated in a world where I was deficient, wrong, unwanted, because I had parts that these other "healthy" superior people didn't. Of course, those parts were my vulnerability, which made me weak.It was a bolt of lightening to see inside this person, and to finally recognise *the very same vulnerability that I had.* The thing that made me weak! The thing that made me not normal! The thing that made me sick! The thing that made me disordered! That is what I found in my idealisation. That is what brought us together. This is what connected us.Now, I am pretty sure that, for the Grandiose, this was his worst nightmare, and he ran away. But for me it was the opposite. Rather than being horrified, I was overjoyed. This part did not repel me - it made me whole.Basically, it turned everything I thought I knew about the world on its head. I was no longer something inferior, broken and defective. Instead, I had a precious part that could connect to others in the deepest way. And if someone, who I had believed to have everything I didn't have, was also as vulnerable and insecure as me, then everyone has this part also. I am not wrong. I am not defective. I am not repulsive. I am not going to be cast out because I have these bits inside me.I was taught that my vulnerability was wrong. But what was wrong, was that teaching. Not my vulnerability.To me now, the personality disorder is in the beliefs, it is not the person. There is nothing wrong with the person. The beliefs make you suffer, not the bits of you that you think are awful and shameful. The thinking is disordered because it lies about the world. The disorder is the lies, believing the lies. The disorder is the pain caused by the beliefs.I will say it again: looking into the person with (no doubt undiagnosed) person with Grandiose NPD, I was not repulsed at all. His vulnerability was incredibly meaningful and precious to me.The trap of NPD is that it teaches that everything else will make you happy **except the one thing that will**. Without allowing your vulnerability to connect with another's, you cannot feel good about yourself. It is intimacy without intimacy, closeness without closeness. It is a relationship but with the one key ingredient missing.&#x200B;I had what I now call The BPD Advantage (there are not many!!!), in that I believed I was defective, I was very much in contact with that, I believed I was sick, and so I kept seeking out mental healthcare, and in the end, I got lucky. I found the right person, the one I learnt trust with.Because I thought of myself as damaged, I did a lot of crying and talking about my pain. It felt pretty bad for a while, but I knew I was fucked up, so this is what you do when you are a mess. And, although it took maybe 2 years of crying every frigging week (weekly appointments), that gradually reduced the pain. And once you release each bit of pain, it goes for good. Does't mean you are confident or whatever, but it does lift the burden.I believe straight NPD/ASPD is about having exactly the same pain, but never having been given the space to let it in. Instead, it was more weakness to attach, so the NPD has bundled up everything and shut it away behind the fortress walls. All the vulnerability is tied to emotions, tenderness, love, sweetness, care, intensity, yearning, highs, lows etc. Thus the deadness. Thus the emptiness. Thus the void. Thus the lack of connection, which means there is no/low empathy.The bad news is that you probably have to find this terrible pain, connect to it, live it, go through it, to find your hearts. In there is your care, your empathy, your delight. Your Self.&#x200B;The good news is, that you don't actually have to hide your vulnerability. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. I know, from the inside, it doesn't feel that way. I know that, instinctively, it is terrible and we want to hide it. But I know from the outside also that it is what makes a connection to another.In psychotherapy, there is the term "unconditional positive regard". I understand, having experienced it, that it is about always loving (in terms of respecting and treating with care) a person, **no matter what they did**, **no matter how they feel**. I didn't fully appreciate it in therapy, but now I understand it more. I get it - people are so essentially valuable, no matter the stuff that swirls around inside them. The aim of the unconditional positive regard is for the person to experience being cared for in all the bits that were rejected as a child. Slowly, slowly, you can start to uncurl from the ball, and reach out with the bits that you had crushed up, squashed, mashed, hated. Instead of horror and disgust, the other person is accepting, warm, curious. When they reflect back to you, they are making clear the things you have never had a chance to take out and express. You don't know you have these bits, and they put them into words, make them take shape, and gently show them to you. And, instead of horror, you find that you can sit with them and nothing has changed! They are still there, warm, caring, interested in you! Wow! Life-changing!&#x200B;So I am going to say something here that is radical. What if those secret, hidden, rejected parts of you are not just normal? What if, instead of being defective, they are special? What if they make you MORE loveable to some other people?&#x200B;Those bits, the bits you have suppressed, the bits you reel away from when you catch a glimpse - they are your most dedicated and profound inner parts. Searching for love is healthy. Searching for love is the most meaningful thing a person can do. It gets us into trouble, because we do it as children, and, if our caregiver is damaged, they will damage that part of us. But that is not because there is anything wrong with those parts, only that the circumstances are not right, for it to be treated in the way we needed.That experience, the wounding, is what connects us here to each other. We can offer each other a deeper care, based on our shared experience. Perhaps it is only the beliefs that are wrong, the patterns we have adopted. If we learn to relate in healthy ways (which are simply ways of seeing the world, of talking, interacting), then our connections are deeper and stronger than with average people.Another Cluster B is not sick, just hurt and spinning round and round in a pattern that will not release them. Break out of the cage, and find that there is a deep joy in being understood and seen for all those vulnerable bits. We are not defective, just connected in the experience of believing we are. Who else will understand us better? As scary as it is, we bring all our hidden parts here, and, rather than being rejected, we find support! There are, in fact, plenty of people like us. Plenty of people desperately ashamed of parts of themselves. That makes us, in fact, normal.I have thought a lot about the way having a pd means having the "cage" that is the role you slip on to interact with the outside world, and the hidden parts that are off to the side.This for me was the experience of feeling that parts of myself were rejected and unwanted in the world, and that, to be accepted by the outside world, I had to act within that narrow cage that was the defined role.It was only very recently that I became really aware of that hidden side, to the extent of seeing it, not just as something inconvenient that was there, but perhaps ***as the key to my happiness***.That was because I saw the same hidden side in someone else, and that made me want to talk to them about it. It was life-changing, because I realised I was not alone, and I also realised that I had not even realised that I had felt alone!Well, naturally, the person with the hidden part did not seem interested in me seeing that hidden part (quite the opposite), so I was left with wondering what to do about that, and here I am.The thing that was really interesting was that, rather than being repulsed by that part (that feels from the inside like it is repulsive and unwanted) in that other person, I was overjoyed by it. That was such a strange experience, and not one I could talk to anyone else about. How could I tell anyone that seeing someone else's desperation and insecurity made me feel connected to the world in a way I never had before?Now I look back at my therapy and think I only went part-way. I never fully trusted my therapist, at least, not enough to take massive leaps into the emotional unknown. Though I suppose I did start from a very low baseline, so the progress I made was quite significant.Anyway, my point is that I can now understand why someone like the therapist below would write this piece. I used to think that I had to say the "right" thing, and that's what I still did in therapy. However, I truly believe that a good therapist wants to actually see the real person, in all their authenticity and complexity. The few that I follow on Quora speak of this: of wanting to be with someone **wherever they go** in their emotional journey.This sub feels like it is doing something similar, because it is a place to come out of hiding, and then to keep opening up. When I saw that hidden place in another person, I felt like this part is the part that contains all the aspects of the real self that need to be nurtured and grown, and then absorbed into the outside shell, to then go out into the world, in order to feel whole. I really believe this is a space where we all practise this.FROM QUORA:[**Peter Coster**](https://www.quora.com/profile/Peter-Coster) Relational Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy [**Psychotherapists, what makes a clients problems big enough to be worth your time?

The therapeutic process is about transforming the person you have taken yourself to be that limits and inhibits your true nature from manifesting in all it's fullness and glory and prevents you from coming out of your hiding place and sharing your preciousness and value with the rest of the world.I would encourage you speak with your therapist, not about the problems you think are too small, but about the way you have framed them as not being worth the necessary time and attention to even bother with them.Hopefully, our societies have moved beyond chattel slavery (though plenty of impoverished people in a number of other countries live pretty close to it), however, has the psychological function behind it been removed?Seems to me that it’s simply a case of the targets being moved.Narcissist-bashing is really reaching a peak at the moment. It has all the hallmarks of ‘Burn the Witch!’I get it: narcissistic behaviour can be incredibly hurtful, overt or covert. But it’s not the whole story.There are also other groups being demonised, which doesn’t seem to indicate that we’ve progressed beyond ‘-ism/phobia’.Seems to me there are plenty of people being damaged by targeted hate.At least, on a couple of subs, somewhere deep in the interwebs, there are people taking courageous steps to look in the mirror and own their destructive parts.; ). I feel so happy to be on this sub.Just for a minute or two, I visited the dreaded empath sub. As I expected, it had lots of self-serving, self-aggrandising garbage about being special etc etc.Right here on this sub, there are real people, with real struggles, who are looking honestly in the mirror. They are facing the painful and ugly. They have humility and grace. They show so much empathy.Over on the supposed-empath sub...not so much.I am so glad I have met you all, and shared a glimpse into your journey, as you have in mine.&#x200B;And those of you dealing with family today, HANG IN THERE!!!!!! (I have sent a brief text to mine, who are 14 hours' drive away... ; D. ) It's almost over!. I follow this psychotherapist on Quora, and, in her 3rd paragraph, she completely describes a need that was not met for me, and, at a guess, possibly lies under the development of personality disorders.The 3rd paragraph is, to me, about being accepted for who you really are, as a child, not the false acceptance of gaining attention through the artificial role you are forced to play.As a child, I certainly know what it feels like, to feel invisible. And being invisible can come from gaining attention, while at the same time not being seen. Instead, gaining attention for performing – like a puppet – a role that was comfortable for your family of origin.I know what it's like to open my mouth, as a child, and to try to communicate, and for nothing to connect. As if the words, once they left my mouth, changed shape, into something different, and were received as completely not what I had meant. So I gave up, and disconnected.Paragraphs 9 and 10, to me, give reasons as to why NPD can fail to connect in adulthood, with relationships. I've highlighted a fragment (all the rest is as the author wrote) which sums up why relationships may go in ways that don't seem to work in the way adult relationships are supposed to.And I am often struck by the lack of trust of others in NPD, and paragraph 2 and 3 explain to me exactly what was not met, and fundamentally why there is such a lack of trust.Paragraph 3 also explains, to me, what NPD truly seeks, through admiration. But doesn't get, as admiration is not the same thing as acceptance and approval **for the real self.**I did have a therapist like this. I truly did come to understand that every emotion and thought was ok within that space (of our therapy), and that, no matter what I felt or said, I would not be rejected. That was the core experience for me – *that whatever was inside me was totally fine and acceptable*. Before that experience, I was just a mess.If my therapist had not retired, I would think of going back now. I am even thinking of finding a similar one, if I can, for next year.&#x200B;**Natalia Perevalova from Quora**"**How does one know if the feeling of spiritual closeness to another is not simply an attachment based on an unmet need as a child? If wanting a friendship is built from a genuine need to connect as an adult and not the unmet need from childhood?**I think we can probably only know if our wish for closeness, and friendship comes from the adult stratum of our personality, if we have some self-knowledge, and understanding of our internal world - ie, if we have some idea of how our unmet childhood needs affect, and influence our existence.The needs of a our child’s Self are centred around ensuring \*safety (\*from being abandoned, physically or emotionally) - as well as ensuring the *goodness* of the world, and of the Self in the world.A child’s Self requires validation, acceptance, and a continuously affirmed sense of *being approved of* \- all of which point back to a child’s profound existential need to be safe in this world.A child’s Ego (an ‘organ’ that is in charge of processing the sensory, and the mental data, and making sense of it) is not yet robust enough to withstand, let alone ‘digest’, strong emotions, especially the negative kind - such as frustration, and anger, which are an inevitable part of a human emotional existence.Even strong *positive* emotions can feel uncomfortable (through being over-stimulating) to an immature Ego. Children need the external others, to help them understand, and regulate their management of the emotions. Without the assistance from the others, a child can become completely overwhelmed by their own emotional life - which can result in a breakdown, or a shutdown.Additionally, a child’s Ego needs others for stimulation, because it is not yet capable of generating a sense of psychical aliveness, by itself - at least, not *continuously.*An adult’s Ego needs stimulation, too - but not because of it is incapable of stimulating itself. As adults, we seek stimulation - spiritual, emotional, sexual, and intellectual - in order to feel rejuvenated, energised, enriched. Flexing our own capabilities, by contending with the worthy opponents - our equals, is immensely *satisfying.*An adult’s unconscious (providing that the childhood needs were met in a consistent enough way) is less preoccupied with the safety, and more with having its own generative abilities, affirmed - through excelling at one’s profession, or/and parenthood.A craving for an adult closeness is strongly imbued with the need to matter, to be important to a somebody - to be appreciated, and valued. But, as adults, we have the ability to understand, and to accept, that those longings of ours need to be reciprocated. An adult closeness is a two-way street. As adults, we need to be *adequately* equipped to make the person/s, whose closeness we crave, appreciated, and valued, in their own right. Those of us who had reached the *emotional* adulthood, as well as the *biological* one, know this, implicitly.Neither the child’s, nor the adult’s needs are ‘superior’ or ‘inferior’ in regard to each other. They are simply different, and are destined to compete with one another, for space, if a person’s childhood needs have been chronically unmet. When such a chronic deprivation takes place, a person can end missing out on their right to grow into a capable adult - an adult who feels invigorated by applying their capabilities. Or else, **these very capabilities get overshadowed by the urgency of the child’s needs**, while an adult ends up missing out on even knowing that they *are* good at something (likely, many things).Needless to mention, often, unmet childhood needs *do* get perceived as ‘inferior’, and treated with the extreme, shaming, impatience. As though a contemptuous attitude could facilitate development, let alone happiness!Even if a biological adult did have adequate chances to truly grow into an *emotional* adult, many of our child-like longings never completely go away. Which, I think, is fantastic, because this allows us never to completely outgrow a fresh, innocent - ie, unburdened by the pragmatic wisdom - appreciation of life!I have always believed that if we want to comprehend, in as much as it is humanly possible, which internal forces drive our wishes (including a wish for closeness), the least we owe our Selves is knowledge, and understanding, free of blaming and shaming, of the ways in which our Selves unfold, throughout all of their ‘ages’.As a psychotherapist, I see my profession not just as a method which either works, or doesn’t work, but as a space in which a person can gain an understanding of their psychical functioning. So, if someone contacted me with the question you have asked, requesting a few sessions, in which to find, and to ‘digest’ the possible answer, catered to their unique personality, I would be absolutely delighted to lend my services!". So sick of being raw, raw, raw.Just found out I was unsuccessful for 2 jobs I went for, and I seem to have hurt someone who means a lot to me.I seem to suck in and amplify the emotions around me, then I spurt them out, and it just causes destruction.I don't seem to be able to detach, and just focus on everyday things. Instead, I obsess over emotions. I can't build a wall between me and them. It has led to people having to push me away. This is the BPD side, and the either inherent of now totally embedded part that causes trouble. Got fucked over in my main job, and humiliated, and if I had just been able to detach maybe things would have gone better. I don't know if they are poisoning the well as far as giving bad references for me, in the limited field I work in.Bing, bing, bang, bang, crash. That's the sound of me stumbling around in life, and fucking up.Why can't I be like normal people and just focus on normal stuff? Put all the shit in a box and kick the box out of the oval and far away?&#x200B;Wanna jump off a bridge, but a sedative and crying/curling up in a ball for a day will do.&#x200B;: (. The paper references work going back to 1971, so just because your current healthcare professional may not know much about NPD, does not mean humanity does not understand it, or has not been working to treat it for quite a few decades.The names of the authors are some profound thinkers in this field, imo.[https://www.psycheblog.uk/2018/09/14/co-morbid-narcissism-in-bpd-transference-focused-psychotherapy-for-patients-with-comorbid-narcissistic-and-borderline-personality-disorder/](https://www.psycheblog.uk/2018/09/14/co-morbid-narcissism-in-bpd-transference-focused-psychotherapy-for-patients-with-comorbid-narcissistic-and-borderline-personality-disorder/). Just chatting with a contributor here, and talking about dropping the armour (I'm calling it a cage) and being honest about your shame and insecurities with your partner. It would involve apologising for past behaviour.Two decades in to my relationship, which has had plenty of stormy fights. He would say to me that I had to be always right (meaning I would never acknowledge his side, or admit being wrong...so therefore never apologise). Maybe in the last year or so, it somehow got a bit easier and I started doing it with him.This year, lots of shit went down with my job, so I left it, and went to a new one. I am starting to really step out and stretch my wings as far as what I can achieve.This created some challenges for me, because, how am I going to manage high-pressure situations, and much bigger expectations?My partner said to me, if I fuck up, to just put up my hand and own it.....He said, not many people do, and people really respect you for it. He said, put your hand up, and say "Yeah, I did that, I fucked up. It was my mistake. I thought X was going to happen, and instead Y happened. My ideas were wrong and I apologise".&#x200B;Anyways, with my new job, a situation came up. I had made a decision, several people were unhappy about it, they got together and made a complaint direct to the Big Cheese (head of the whole organisation). I found out because my manager called me in.So I said to myself "Come on Nina, balls to the wall, all in, let's do it" and I took full responsibility. I wrote an email of apology to the complainants (Cc.ing my manager in as well), I said I had gotten it wrong, I was still learning, my judgement was not final or perfect. Basically I had had some conflicting advice from my manager, but that was neither here nor there, coz she was never going to see that, and I decided to leave my pride out of it and act in the best interests of my work role, rather than have any personal interest in it.I got a reply back from the main organiser, who was happy and understanding. Since then, our interactions have been happy and warm, so it made the relationship better. And my manager was all happy and relaxed with me afterwards. It seemed, in other words, to flip the train tracks so we headed down a completely different one to where it was going before.Thinking about it now, anger is the emotion that arises for protection. When we have been violated (or think we have/will be), we get angry. It's a big roiling force that pushes us forward to protect ourselves.When you apologise, you take ownership of whatever you did that violated someone (or led to them feeling violated). THERE IS NO MORE NEED FOR THEM TO BE ANGRY.I'm gonna write that again: when you accept ownership, when you gather up all the shitty things you've done, when you draw into yourself your mistakes, or poor judgement, or whatever it is that hurt someone else, when you wrap your arms around all your errors and say "Yep, these are all mine, I did this", then THAT PERSON DOES NOT NEED TO BE ANGRY WITH YOU ANY MORE. They have been in attacking protective mode. They have grabbed their lances and got on their chargers, and attacked you for the things you did to hurt them.But suddenly, you've looked at it from a different perspective, and gone "Dogs of War, back in your cages! I've let you run around, and you've bitten the wrong person. Back you go, I need to rethink this situation and do things differently". And because you have looked at it from their perspective, they do not need their chargers or their lances, because you have taken over that activity for them.And they drop all their weapons and feel relieved. And then, THEY ACTUALLY FEEL GRATEFUL AND CLOSER TO YOU!!!!! &#x200B;I know - weird huh? Being a fuck-up makes you more loveable. Who would have thought? Making mistakes makes people like you more (well, apologising for them does). Being flawed and crappy at something is met with..what?...warmth? WTF???????????For some reason, it increases the trust they have in you.&#x200B;Actually, that makes sense. Because they know you will protect them if needs be. (Not to say that you have to then take shit from them, because what is good for them, is good for you too).All this reminded me of a really good article about NPD which I am going to put at the bottom. It says that the core of NPD is a desperate battle to never show vulnerability to others. It's not about the grandiosity, or the other stuff, which is the window dressing. It's about never, ever, putting yourself in a position of vulnerability (showing weakness).That made me think about how, for people with NPD, the showing of vulnerability has led to being attacked by caregivers. This is the initial early experience that shapes the perception of the world, going forward. In fact, the word "vulnerability" could easily be changed to "powerlessness". Think of the Grandiose Narcissists I have dealt with recently, it was all about climbing to the top in order to have (overt) power over others, and interactions can involve a power struggle, or at least, a consistent message from them that they have the power over you.So the internal thinking of NPD, as far as I am getting, is that is is urgent to always get to the top position, because to be in the lower position means being attacked. So there's always a struggle with others, to push them down so that you are not in the powerless role.&#x200B;And then, apologising and admitting weakness/imperfection feels like rolling on your back and exposing your soft white underbelly.Except, for some reason, I found that, instead of being disembowelled, the other person drops their killing stance and cuddles up to you. Very odd.&#x200B;Because for them, maybe, it was all about getting close, and learning to trust you. And they didn't want to dominate you, or be underneath you. They just want to get to know you, and be a fellow traveller on this journey of life.&#x200B;In this article below, the author suggests an alternate name for NPD, in the hunt for something which is more realistic and descriptive. This stuck in my never-shut-the-fuck-up brain, along with a similar question asked by a therapist on Quora, who asked readers to suggest another name for BPD. At the time, I did think "They should call them Protection Disorders, not Personality Disorders, because that is what they are really about". And I thought about the fact that the names are really patronising, and all they do is describe the end symptoms, not what it is like from the inside.Here's my alternate take, feel free to add your own:NPD = Powerlessness Protection DisorderBPD = Rejection Protection DisorderSPD = Invasion Protection Disorder.Here is the article:[https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/insight-is-2020/201701/the-true-roots-narcissism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/insight-is-2020/201701/the-true-roots-narcissism)&#x200B;Anyway, thanks for listening while I try to figure out my own head.Was talking with one of my narky companions here, and the subject of pity came up. Specifically, the subject of hating to be pitied. And it struck me, because I have read this is really, really common for NPD.Looking back at my life, at my BPD side, I was always at the bottom of my family. I was always the "defective" one that they got to look down on. That is the core of BPD rage to me: being made into the doormat that people can repeatedly wipe their feet on, to make themselves feel better.BUT there is one benefit to it, because, outwardly showing vulnerability, you get to be cared for and looked after. Being told I was "unwell" meant I was always seeking care, and, wrapped up in "care" is actual care. Plenty of people were good and kind to me, when I was desperate.I told my reddit NPD companion that, recently, I had been talking with someone I know well, whose older sister is also a "mess" and the family "screw up" - at least, that is her role that they have given her. I have identified with the sister as far as her life path and seeing it play out not so differently from mine (but milder, lucky for her).For the very first time ever - and I have known this person 25 years - I heard contempt in their voice, when they spoke of their sister. Previously, I think I have felt the contempt, as in, I have simply been in that lower position, and it must have been normal and not something I was aware of. But now, I seem to have popped out of that hole, which makes me no longer blind to my treatment. Anyway, since hearing that contempt, I have felt a boiling rage about it, and about my treatment at the hands of my family.So I'm thinking, in narky families, sympathy must be wrapped up with contempt. I feel it is like "I feel sorry for you, but at the same time I am rejecting you and saying I am nothing like you. I am looking down on you at the same time as I am handing you this sympathy".But, from what I am experiencing now, since my connection to others has zinged into life, and in particular to the people here, who have suffered something similar to me, is that when I feel sympathy for others, it is *because I feel they are just like me*. Not that they are the same, but that I can look and see that I have had very similar feelings, and I have the same part inside my that got hurt, as they have inside them. So instead of the pity being handed out with "Oh, you pathetic worm, here is some pity, and it's a shame you can't handle life", it's "Oh yeah, I hear you, I've been there too. You poor sweetie, I know how it feels, it hurts, doesn't it". Like, it's about *sharing* experiences instead of rejecting someone - the opposite of creating distance. It's about shared parts bringing you closer to others.What if there was a chance to really connect with another person? To really feel close to them, and to feel safe?What if the chance to connect was different to what you thought?What if it was not about the perfect person, or how you used to dream it would be?What if it was not about getting the perfect parents, or the kinder ones, or the better ones? What if you could swap, and instead of that internal dreamy hope, it was right here, possible, living, alive?&#x200B;What if it was not about connecting in the way you wanted, to a better parent, and getting the love you missed? What if it was letting go that that could ever happen at all?&#x200B;What if it was, instead, having a real live human look inside you and know just how you feel? Not a parent, but another adult, someone crazy and messy and stumbling around in the world, just like you?What if they could look in your heart, and understand your pain, and see you for who you really are? Care for who you really are? Feel sorrow for your pain? Know how life has made you feel, without you having to try to explain, again and again?&#x200B;What if that's what connection really means? Just another imperfect adult – but a real live human being, sharing this planet with you, right here, right now, picking up the same wavelengths, suffering in the same way?&#x200B;Is this what this sub is?. Yes, I think it's possible. I was someone diagnosed with Narcissistic BPD, and, now I look back, I fit the criteria for low-functioning rather than high-functioning BPD. My life is far better after doing psychotherapy, but it took 5 years. I am more than 10 years out from that again, and going through a lot of turbulence (which is why I'm here) and seem to be in a growth phase.My empathy definitely developed during the therapy. I don't think BPD ever cut off from it, because they (as opposed to NPD) are allowed to explicitly feel – and show – a longing for love. In fact, I think that is the role of the BPD; to show the longing that the rest of the family is not allowed/does not permit themselves to feel. Since all this turbulence, and working thorough it, I believe the narcissistic parent creates the BPD in order to express the vulnerability/longing for love that they do not feel safe to embody. They then, because it is so threatening in their past experience, repeatedly reject the BPD for expressing what they feel at their deepest level. This is the source of BPD - that ongoing rejection.BPD felt like crushing pain. I think about it as basically the same as having just fallen and snapped a bone. The pain is flooding your senses. It's screamingly loud. You are still aware of other stuff going on around you, but it is dim, in the distance, and you don't have the capacity to process it. So you are not able to respond properly to everyday life, with this screaming pain in your selfIdealisation feels like this: you know things will turn out shit, but you desperately hope they won't. You want to meet someone, fall in love, be happy. You want the people around you to love you. You almost manage to convince yourself that it will happen, and that's the times when you are happy. But behind you, on your back, is the Blackness. The Blackness it a deep, roiling dark full of all the awfulness you have gone through. You know it's there. You don't dare turn your head, not to the side at all. You don't want to see it. You don't want to give it even the smallest chance to enter you. You are terrified of it.When you meet someone, your desperate hope is activated. You must see only the positives! You must stay absolutely happy! You cannot let the Blackness in! You cannot make even the smallest slip, for it will come in and destroy everything!And the Blackness is – I now believe – the terrible rejection of your earliest years. The Blackness is the wasteland of sheer terror, the feeling of awfulness, the feeling of triggering the deepest rejection, the deepest abandonment, just by being you.The truth is, in yourself, just by being you, and showing that you needed the parent, you triggered such a horror that they threw you away, again and again. You would do anything, crawl up walls embedded with broken glass, just to get away.So now the dilemma is, what to do with love? How do you cope? How do you try to keep away the Blackness?Idealisation is that desire to make the love all perfect, so there is no chance of it being wrecked this time. Idealisation is the desire to make the love all perfect, so thereis no crack for the Blackness to get in.But fat fucking chance to that. You know, deep in your soul, that it is right there beside you. And when that crack arrives, all hell breaks loose, because the Blackness is there, contaminating things. It is going to wreck love.That's idealisation. When I read about splitting nowadays, I think what a bullshit term it is. You can't split something that was never fucking whole. Idealisation and "splitting" are about trying to manage hope and despair. Nothing fucking else.&#x200B;Here is the thing that allowed me to develop more empathy. The first time I had a therapy session, I was yelling, and he said to me "You are yelling because you are angry, and you are angry because underneath you are afraid." I suddenly felt so much at peace, because he could speak the things inside my heart. There were all sorts of tangles in there, things I didn't understand, couldn't see properly, couldn't make sense of; confusing clouds that were so painful. When he spoke, he put them into words and brought them out of my heart and into the world. It gave me so much relief. That made me trust him.A few months later, I moved hours away, to another city. So I wrote to him and got a referral to another therapist. He was a different personality, but he was gentle, and I trusted him enough to keep going.What he gave me, what I learned from him, by experiencing it from him, is that there is a person inside beyond behaviour and beyond emotions. I had thought that was all there is of a person. He went beyond all of that, to the spark of awareness and humanity right inside. He spoke to that, and gave me respect and care. He taught me that no one chooses their emotions. He said to me that childhood is a giant crushing wheel, that grabs you up and turns you round and round, and deposits you at the end no matter the shape you are in. Those are his words. And they are true. Everyone goes through this, and we end up facing adulthood in whatever shape we are in, but being forced to put on the persona of being an adult, and having to manage life as best we can.He taught me that everyone has equal value, because we are not our emotions. Sure, they make up part of us, but beyond that, we are those sparks of awareness. And we don't chose our emotions, but we can (or can learn) to chose our behaviour. That's what makes the emotions not scary any more.During that time in his office, I learnt that you can both experience emotion, and also sit to one side and observe it. You can go through it, express it, rage like you need to, weep a thousand tears (no joke, I probably did), feel hate and fury and extreme pain. But you don't need to lash out, or do something nuts, or destructive. Because someone else can listen to you, and understand. And that's all you need to start feeling better about it. And both of you together can start to plan what to do with it, and about it, to make your life better. And the therapist always respected my pain. He always gave it the deepest respect, far more than I did. In doing that, he showed me respect for my deepest self. That's how I learned some. Respect and care for myself, that is.&#x200B;Looking back, being able to become more empathetic was 2 things: the relief of the awful pain. Every tear I cried was one tiny ice shard melting and being expelled from my body, and from my heart, where they had been lodged. As the pain lifted, more space was created to be able to listen to the signals coming in from outside. Instead of being faint and in the distance, they were clearer and I was able to react to them. The pain that had taken up almost all my attention had shrunk considerably, giving me the room for other things.I have read recently that brain scans of people with NPD show that empathy exists – the brain activation shows it – despite the actions/outward appearance of the person not showing it. I suspect that the experience is similar: all the parts are there, but the possibility of acting on them as (many) others do is not there, due to the overwhelming pressure of other stuff. This other stuff is so intense that it overrides what you would normally do, if it was not there.The other thing that allowed for more empathy was that experience of care for who I was, right on the inside. I learnt to care for myself, and to respect this essential essence of humanity. I was then taught to extend that, and see it in others, by my therapist explaining my behaviour, and how it would hurt other people. In his words, I saw him giving others the same respect as me, and showing me that they also had this inner essence, and also that they did not choose their own emotions/experiences either. That gave me the freedom to feel caring for them.&#x200B;More recently, I had interactions with a high-functioning grandiose narcissist, which woke up the narcissistic parts of me. (I didn't know it at the time, only in working through the whole experience.)The most impactful, profound, incredible part for me was in realising he had subtly manipulated me to feel attracted to him. When I met him, he was not my type at all. He was too straight, with no rough edges. After a little while of knowing him, I realised he was a very similar Myers-Briggs personality type to me, which gave me more ability to see inside him. Then I realised he was highly perceptive/tuned in to emotions, like me. He could shape them, shape the emotions in the world around him. It was seeing him doing it, manipulating emotion in an extravert way, out in the world, that gave me the confidence to jump, out of my cave, and be more adventurous. I had always been super-aware of emotion, but had kept it focused on the inner world, and on myself. I didn't know it could be useful in any other way.Then, after leaving that job and getting far, away, then working through it, I had the most incredible revelation. I realised he had manipulated me *in the same way I used to manipulate guys*. I used to secretly send out sexual energy to make guys attracted to me, to make me feel better about the world. I already knew he was a flirt with plenty of women, but I suddenly saw he had done it in the same way I had.And, in seeing that, I realised I was not alone in the world. I realised that t*here were other people like me, who were as desperate as me, who resorted to the same things as me just to survive and get by*. It was like I suddenly saw that part of myself clearly. It had always been tucked away to the side, something I was only half-aware of, something I never focused on. And suddenly, by seeing it in him, it came alive in me. I could turn and look at it clearly. And I suddenly saw how much of myself was hidden from the world, how much I kept back, how much I had always assumed was unwanted, and had no place in the world.And the crazy thing was, the part that I always believed was unwanted, the part that had no place, the part that I had stabbed and hacked at and shut away, *was out there in another person*!!!!!!!In turning and looking at that part of me, it grew a little bit, and took up more space. I have a feeling that, the more I turn and look at it, the more I allow it to grow, the more it grows inside me and filters through to every part, the more whole I will feel. And somehow, it might even make relating to other people easier.I have had more instances of connecting to people recently, and it feels weird. It feels like, whenever I am kind to them - when they are upset - I am also being kind to me. It is the weirdest feeling, like it is all wrapped up together and you can't separate the different strands. I have also realised I have a wall to most people, and just ignored them as I didn't think there was anything to connect over. Instead I focused on only a few people. I am starting to go out and about and talk to lots of different ones. They are very interesting, and I am learning stuff. So weird to have a friend-book that has quadrupled in just a couple of months.Lastly, I have opened up a bit more with a close friend, and this has allowed me to connect in way I had not done before. Luckily, she has had similar experiences to me, so she understands.This is what my increased instances of empathy feel like: they are not about being below or above (I'm saying this because I believe NPD interactions are about trying to stay above the other person). They are about feeling that someone else has given you something at a time when you felt sad, and it made you feel better. And then, some time later, when you can see they feel sad, you feel sad, and you want to give them something in return, and see that they feel better. It goes like this:*"We are in this giant ship together. We are rowing hard. I was tired, and when I was tired, you allowed me to put down the oars and rest. You let me rest for awhile, and you rowed for me. I look at you now, and see you are tired. Lay down your oars, put your head down. I will row for you.**We are companions, you and me."*&#x200B;I was surprised, in my investigating NPD to try to work out what happened, to discover that NPD/BPD attractions are common. Now my guess is that they are two sides of the same coin.I suspect that an NDP family works like this: the BPD is created, like I wrote above, to embody all the longing for love and the awful rejection of that longing. The BPD is full of rage at being used as a doormat by everyone else in the family, and having had people wipe their feet on her/him. The BPD is stuck in that role, of being the doormat. And the BPD sees that the NPDs have been given the upwards role, and don't have to suffer the degradation and humiliation that BPD is given.BUT the BPD is allowed to express the longing for love, and the BPD is shut out of the family. That is a dreadful thing, but it means the BPD wanders off, with no thought of getting back in to the family that doesn't want him/her. BPD then interacts with different sorts of people without expectations of fulfilling NPDs role. And BPD has some experiences of life outside the NPD family. BPD is also allowed to ask for love, and ask for help. One day, that might have an effect, and BPD starts to escape the mindset.&#x200B;My guess is that NPD has an extra layer. NPD adds disgust. NPD has much of the terrible inner rejection of BPD. NPD also has the Blackness. NDP has the awful roiling cloud, the darkness, the pain. However, NPD has the disgust, and the disgust is how the parent reacted to the NPD's neediness. The disgust is given to the NPD. The NPD feels the awfulness of triggering disgust in the parent. And the disgust becomes the sheer horror at yourself for every having let yourself be in that situation, sheer horror at your own vulnerability. I have felt the disgust, and been horrified at myself, but not to a large degree, which is the gift of BPD (there aren't many!).I suspect that the difficulty with treating NPD is that horror at the disgust, the determination never, ever to be in that position again. And why would anyone. Our rejection was unbearably, overwhelmingly awful.But the thing is that NPD thinking is completely wrong. It teaches that the part of us that is valuable, is wrong. It teaches that the part that connects is the part that will repel. It teaches that what will actually be valued by others, is what will cause them to totally reject us.It's the NPD thinking that should be rejected, not those inner parts that want love and connection.&#x200B;Just my guesses at the moment.[Counselling for Narcissistic Personality Disorder](https://www.counsellinginperth.com.au/personality-disorders/counselling-for-narcissistic-personality-disorder/)And rather than reeling back in the horror of the Hideous Vampire Evil Narcissist (like all that crap out there on the internet), this therapist wants to meet their real selves and support them to come out into the light.That's just one therapist, there will be plenty more like that (met one, still working through the impacts, only realising some shit now after over a decade since I finished therapy).I just wrote something about males last night, this could not be a better place to post it:"My friends had told me that boy babies are more affectionate than girl babies. When I had my son, I discovered boys’ enormous capacity for love.There are so many beautiful parts to boys: their affectionate nature, their boldness, their protective side, their passion, their dedication to a topic, their wildness, their capacity for fun.My happiest times have been with males, sitting around, having a drink, them fooling around in the back yard, laughing, forgetting the world and feeling light and free.'I work in a high school, and every day henceforth will be "compliment a boy" day. I have other tools for this too, since I create most of the newsletter and media/social media content.Boys gonna be happy on my watch.
    I blocked him on everything and have been NC for almost 2 weeks now. I have not been looking at pictures and I only have checked to see if he still had me blocked too on Instagram once. I have been talking it out with friends and journaling because I feel like I need to get it out! I’m also in group and individual therapy and am working on anxiety tools and somatic experiencing for anxiety/trauma release.My thoughts are still consumed by him anytime I’m not actively engaged in something like work where my brain is being totally occupied. What more could I be doing and what should I stop doing? Please help!. Mine had a serious mommy kink. Wanted to call me mommy in bed and be praised, dominated, and coddled by me. Had a breastfeeding fetish. I know for some this can be just a sexual thing but for him it seemed… deeper than that. He would cry (literally sob) about wanting to make his parents proud and talked about being jealous of his sister because she was the golden child and his parents thought she was perfect. He told me once he remembered seeing his mom naked as a kid - he said it so randomly. And when we spent time together he would often say he had to go when he told his mom he would be home for dinner (still lived at home and even after moving away when he’d come back to visit he would always go home for mom’s dinner).Our relationship derailed when I found out about all the cheating. It created a toxic dynamic where I was trying to control him all the time because I couldn’t trust him. And he would push back and fight me for freedom while still lying to me and not telling me things because he never stop trying to do what he wanted to do. It essentially created the dynamic he had with his mom, controlling and overbearing, and he *hated* me like I think he deep down hates her. But he has to respect his mom but he was allowed to treat me horribly. It felt like so much of his anger from his childhood at his mom was taken out on me.. That’s all really. My nex was my best friend. I just feel so lonely. It’s a week since final discard and I’ve been leaning on friends but they can only do so much ya know they have their own lives and shit to deal with. I’m working on tolerating being alone and trying to enjoy my own company. I know this is key to healing my disorganized attachment. Wow it’s just hard. I wanna start dating just so I can have some intimacy and companionship but I know that’s not healthy. And then I think of maybe just having sex with someone but I know that’s not healthy either. Just hoping there are people out there who can tell me these feelings are normal and they will pass?. I went to float for the first time (loved it!) and afterwards thought I’d pop into the store to get a lemon real quick because it’s all I needed to make something at home for dinner. I’m walking through the store feeling so relaxed for the first time in weeks (traumatic break up from a cheating narc) and then I hear a man yelling “hey miss!” He can’t be talking to me. He yells again. Then I see the movement out of the corner of my eye as he’s getting closer “hey miss!” And I think oh maybe I’ve dropped something so I turn “hey miss I just *had* to ask, what is the M on your shirt for, Mizzou or Michigan???”This set me on edge and ruined the peace I had found, putting me instantly on high alert. I left the store checking over my shoulder to make sure he wasn’t following me to my car.Why do men think it’s ok to yell and approach us like this!?. I have been out of the relationship for 2 years. I ended things and he tried to Hoover and regain control and I blocked him. He found a new supply and is still with her. We have mutual friends still (they are aware he is a narc or at least abusive) and I will be attending a Halloween part at a friends house. I’ll be getting there early. Idk if he knows I’m coming.Since he has a new supply I will be fine and safe at the party right?It’s a small house party and we typically just play board games, there’s music, and food and some booze. It’s nothing wild we are all in our 30s.I’ve been reading about both and see how he could be a sociopath. Anyone else?. Therapist recommended floating so I’m giving it a try this week. After I booked my session I was reading on the website about preparation/what to expect and it mentioned that it may burn women’s vaginas? It may be so uncomfortable you can’t complete your float session and can reschedule.Has anyone experienced this? I have sensitive skin and a sensitive vagina. I was really looking forward to my session and now I’m a little nervous about this especially being at the end of my cycle. Did you ever feel like your nex was sitting in front of you but they just weren’t “there”? And when you’d comment on the emotional distance or that they weren’t really engaged in the conversation or *showing up* to the relationship they would say “what are you talking about I’m right here?”. He always had to be doing something. He was always on a schedule and a time crunch.It seemed like he had a limit on lounging and if we did it too long he started to get irritated and going over his mental to do list.Being alone is so fucking painful after the discard. It’s like a feeling of fear? panic? inside me that’s unbearable.I get flooded with thoughts. I guess it’s the calm.Mine didn’t name call, ridicule, or belittle me really. I see a lot of posts saying their nexes did this and it’s making me question mine. Was he not really a narc if he wasn’t insulting me all the time?. Anyone else feel like this thing is completely inaccurate and doesn’t reflect the reality of the western world? I set it to age 30-45, not married, not obese, any race, 5’10, and $55k. Seems pretty average in terms of the population and it still gave me alike a 2% chance of meeting a guy like this.Makes no sense.Is there any way to predict whether or not the nex is going to hoover you after they discard you?. I asked him to help we pick where we should go. I gave him a month and never got an answer so I picked the place.I asked him to help me plan. I gave him another two weeks and again never got any feedback so had to make all of the decisions myself.I asked him to plan one thing he wanted to do with me on the trip that was going to be a surprise. Just plan one thing. He never did and claimed he forgot. You forgot.. the ONE thing I was willing to settle for and he couldn’t even do that.And let me tell you guys I planned a phenomenal trip! It was beautiful, it was fun, it was an adventure, and the food was delicious. The perfect get away that I look back on so fondly! When I look back I forget he was even there for the fun parts honestly. Like his presence doesn’t make an impact. I was so excited about everything the whole trip and he was just there, along for the ride. I remember him asking if he could have some time to play video games a lot. We had sex one time and I don’t remember the details but I remember little to no foreplay and not cumming.I snooped his bags and found a condom in his gym bag. The brand we bought and specifically kept at my place because we could never have sex at his place (lived with his parents at the time). The one time we were able to have sex at his I brought over 5 condoms and left them there in case we had other opportunities.When I questioned him about it he said he put in in there in case we ever needed it. I asked when we would ever have needed it and not had access to the ones at our places and he fumbled around repeating himself “just in case we’d ever need it”. This was after I caught him cheating with countless people including a long term affair partner… Two months after.He should have been putting in so much effort to make this trip feel special for me and show how much he cared but, as usual, I was the one doing all the work. I understood he was going away to school afterwards and had a lot to plan for which was why I kept giving him grace for not contributing. But, in two months, to have contributed NOTHING other than showing up.And on the last day of the trip he turns to me in bed with his *sad little puppy face* and says “I didn’t end up helping with any of this or planning a surprise for you I’m sorry” in complete shock and remorse. Equivalent to going to the store and forgetting to buy milk. And like the gullible idiot I was at the time I reassured him “yeah I know you had a lot going on with school so I just focused on making the trip special for you and stress free as possible before you start school”. Afterwards, I am snooping his phone (open policy) and he told his friend where he (not we) went and his friend made a snarky comment about it asking “why *there*”? And his response was that “it was cheap”. That’s all. And when I asked him about the trip later and didn’t he have a good time and feel like it was a bonding experience for us he was just like “idk we were in a weird place at that time I didn’t really think of it as like a nice vacation we were taking together and we had a big fight one of the nights (me getting upset about the cheating and needing reassurance) and you couldn’t even sleep afterwards.” That’s what they do. The see the negatives, they are entitled, they are ungrateful. It feels like a perfect representation of how the relationship goes with a narc. They sell you on a fantasy of what could be, you expect them to function as an equal partner, you end up downsizing your expectations until you’re settling for breadcrumbs, you try to pick up the slack and exhaust yourself doing the emotional labor of two people, you try to make the best of it and make excuses for their behavior but it’s still not enough to make them happy, and when they look back on it they devalue the whole experience.Fuck you nex.That blank stare. No emotion in that face. Nothing going on behind those eyes. Even thinking of them now causes a visceral reaction for me. The worst is when you’re emotional and look up and they’ve stopped trying to mirror your emotions and provide empathy. They are showing nothing and you can see, sense, the black void inside, nearly feeling its pull.*shudder*. I see a lot of struggles on here with trying to escape the narc who you can’t get away from and they hoover and keep coming back trying to regain your supply.What about those of us who were discarded because they found a new supply or decided we weren’t the supply they wanted anymore. How do you deal with these feelings? I feel like our side of the spectrum is harder/worse as I’ve been on the other side and honestly there was something about the validation of them trying to come back around and having to block them that made it easier for me. Escaping for me was nothing compared to this feeling of just being left out on the curb 😞. I am dealing with a lot of guilt for subjecting my mind and body to the torment my nex put me through. Blaming myself and feeling so stupid. And hating myself for still loving this person who isn’t even real! I know it’s not my fault logically. How do I start to forgive myself?. I was discarded 2 days ago. We were together for a year and he was cheating on me the entire time with one long term sexual partner and countless other sexual flings. I feel he used me as his “cover” to present to the public while he was free to pursue his taboo sexual desires with other men and women he was meeting online and on apps. He’s a med student so I think he needed someone to help him look “normal” and I filled that role. A part of me still believes he did really love me but people who love you don’t cheat on you repeatedly. Maybe he loved me as much as he was capable of and maybe the cheating came from his fear of abandonment/being unlovable but I know that’s still not enough or an excuse for his actions. After I discovered the cheating he wanted to stay and try to make it work. My stipulation was that he sought therapy for his sex addiction. It was 5 months of hell and then he broke up with me saying he needed the space to work on himself and heal but that he would want another chance at our relationship in the future but it wasn’t fair to ask me to wait for him.Things evolved over the next 1.5 months with him changing his story over time and citing it was because he was healing in therapy. I said I felt like I was just slowly losing him. And then I was finally discarded. He said he is still in therapy working on himself and I am overcome with anguish thinking about him getting better and being a healthy, wonderful partner for someone else. He is using his student health free counseling services for therapy and goes once every 2 weeks because that’s as frequent as they let you have appointments. One of the last things he said to me while I was crying on his shoulder saying I loved him and didn’t want this was “I think it’s going to be okay.” And left shortly after.I feel completely empty. And thinking of him out there healing and being happy makes me sick.I’ve been having horrible anxiety with major life stressors and work 12 hour shifts as a nurse. I can’t sleep more than 3 hours and it’s compromising my ability to care for patients or work at all I’m having to call in today. Will urgent care give me something that would help me sleep or would they make me see a specialist for that?. A year of cheating on me. 5 months of convincing me he wanted only me and we could make this work. Ended the relationship with me. 1.5 months of hovering saying he needed to work on himself and wanted to be with me. Finally discarded while claiming he still loved me and wanted to be with me. So much mental abuse in such a short amount of time.I was doing fine after I asked him for NC and then two weeks in he messages asking if he can send me a birthday present and we end up meeting in person only for him to tell me he doesn’t think we are ever going to work and he doesn’t want contact with me. Still loves me and wants to be with me he just thinks the relationship isn’t right and not what he needs. Then why did you even reach out why didn’t you just let me go???What the actual fuck.They’re so bloody good at lying. Even more girls coming out of the wood work today that he fucked around with. I always knew there were more. I’m a combination cluster b but I would never do this to another human being. The spectrum is truly wild and I just hope I can heal from this even though I’ll never be able to make sense of it. We’ve been in a grey area for 1.5 months and today he told me he knows we will not work outI feel so empty and numbHe cheated on me the entire relationship and jerked me back and forth through the last 1.5 months so I guess at least I’m glad that’s finally overIt feels like he kept me around until he decided if he wanted to be with me or not and once he decided he didn't he threw me away I tried everything I could to be what he wanted and I guess at the end of the day it just wasn’t meNot really feeling like anyone is ever going to love me so not sure what reason I have for going on in life at this pointSorry this is so pathetic I guess I just am pathetic right now.

The devastation makes me feel better about how alone and empty I am.I’ve only done it a handful of times over the years but it’s where I am tonight so let the good times roll!. I look at pictures of myself as a baby, young girl but I don’t recognize that child as myself.Like I have some faint memories but it’s like I know they as more of a “story” I know than a true memory of it happening, particularly the traumatic parts.Does this sound familiar to anyone else?. Like I want a grown man as a partner who knows how to do life. Has a job, has a place, knows how to cook/clean/take care of himself, knows how to communicate openly with emotional intelligence and vulnerability. Basically an equal, mature partnership. I also want to be his mommy in the bedroom and for that to be the place I get to dominate and take care of him. I don’t think it’s cute when men need an actual parent because they can’t function and need to be taught how to be in a relationship. That’s not attractive to me. It’s a sexual kink for me not a life kink. Am I in the minority here?. I am working on identifying my feelings with my therapist because apparently I live in my head and I’m not in touch with my actual feelings. I’ve always thought my thoughts *were* my feelings but it turns out they are different things.And I’m just deeply, deeply sad. It’s taken me like 12 hours to identify this is how my body and heart is feeling. And I feel it in my chest, specially my sternum. I have no one to talk to so just wanted to post here.I am fresh out of a soul crushing break up and feeling truly awful about being alone. I’m in therapy working on this and trying to heal the parts of myself that are still wounded from an awful childhood. I know I’m doing what’s best for myself but every night when I come home alone to the quiet, the void, I think “I wish I had someone”.Last night, I went out to dinner with my parents and the couple at the next table was obviously fighting. There was no hiding it. They were arguing about how the girl felt the guy was not showing her any empathy towards the way she was feeling. She cried twice. He was apologetic but there was still very little emotion there for him and he seemed more focused on making her laugh and forget how she was feeling. It was truly a horrible thing to sit by and watch. This girl was a young, beautiful, passionate, and emotionally available woman. She could have the world at her disposal and she’s wasting her tears on this boy. I saw this situation as a reflection of how many toxic relationships I’ve been in and tried to convince myself it would get better, I could change him, we could make it work, I know he’s a good guy deep down, I was asking for/expecting too much, etc.It was the first time I realized I would much rather be going home alone than going home with someone who makes me cry.This is a big shift from my last post which got a bigger response than I was expecting and figured this might be a nice update and show of support for all the people who were feeling the same way I was.I’m single, never married, childfree.I do want a relationship. I want love.I hate that society has conditioned me to think that my chance for this to happen is essentially over because I’m not in my 20s anymore. I hate feeling like I missed the boat.Logically, rationally I know this isn’t true but damnit the social conditioning monster is so fucking hard to tame! Especially when it’s continuously reinforced by everything in the media. Ugh!. I’ve always wanted to try it. Any good places in our city?. I thought it had been like 6 weeks since I quit. It’s been 4. And only 2 since I had one small lapse in a social situation.What the fuckkkkk. And you get the useless 20 cosmo petals. Has happened twice in a row now 😤And now I have to plant a bunch of Gentians when I only have 30 petals and no idea how to get more nectar so I guess the event is over for me 🥲. I’m realizing in therapy that my mom was never there for me. She had me and then left me with my grandparents to raise. When she met my stepdad she moved me states away from my family to follow him for work. He was a violent and angry man. My earliest memories of him are him beating me with a belt. Throwing and breaking things. So much yelling. When they divorced my mom dated a lot of men and brought them into my life without my permission or desire. She treated them better than me. She was gone a lot when I was growing up. I remember being home alone while she was out on dates. I guess I preferred that to her bringing them home where I could hear them fuck. She treated her boyfriends kids better than me too. Giving them room in our house to stay, letting them take my toys, buying them things on top of that. She bought one guy an SUV. When I turned 16 she got me a sedan that could barely run and released carbon monoxide into the cabin. I didn’t even realize how abusive she was until the last couple months. She’s all that I had so I guess I needed her and didn’t know any differently. I just kept waiting for her to take care of me. She has mentally and emotionally abused me her entire life. Making me her identity, entertainment, competition, responsible for her emotions. At times she got violent too hitting and kicking me.I saved up all my money from babysitting, birthdays, christmases for years. She sent me on a trip for school and when I got back she had cleaned out my bank account. It wasn’t much, $700 but it was everything I had. I asked her why she did it and she simply said she needed it. Anytime I have brought up that I was mistreated in some way by her growing up she starts to meltdown saying “I can’t! I can’t go back 20, 30 years I just can’t!”She wants to pretend none of it ever happened but she is still just as nasty now as she was then. In the past year alone being emotionally abusive and hitting me in the stomach for making a lighthearted joke in front of my boyfriend at the time. She said she was “just joking too!”I HATE HER!I am in therapy to work through this. I’m close to getting my car in my name and my finances in order and when I do I’m leaving and never coming back.My mom used to do this with slippers a lot as a kid. Idk why these specifically. She would give them to me (often for Christmas) and I’d wear them for a little bit then she would take them and start wearing them herself. When I’d ask about them she’d always have some reason or excuse I honestly don’t remember what she’d say at this point. Probably something about me having other pairs (I like slippers a lot). She would buy food that was special for me at the store. I’d go to get some and most if not all of it would be eaten.She did this even recently with the food while I’m staying at her house and I’m 33 now.I texted him late and he shares his location with me so I saw he was still awake. But then an hour later I saw he phone started charging and that always meant he was going to sleep. So he didn’t respond to me text. I wanted no contact but he broke it by texting me a week ago saying he needed to reach out and said he wanted to send me something for my bday. We ended up agreeing to see each other next week when he’s in town. I was doing ok before he broke NC but now I haven’t been able to stop analyzing the things he said. That I was constantly on his mind but couldn’t be what either of us needed right now. He said he’s putting in the work to fix himself.He put me through hell but I know I put him through it too. I love him so much. Not talking has become unbearable so I reached out saying I wanted contact.He didn’t respond. I’m losing my fucking mind. I know it’s late and he could respond tomorrow but I’m so crazy.I went downstairs in my parents house to look through a box of stuff my grandma kept. It was really hard looking at pictures of me as a baby - before any memories and seeing how innocent I was and how if I had been properly cared for my life would be so much different now.It was hard looking at pictures of me growing up - as memories of trauma were forming and knowing how I felt at the time and the things I was doing to cope, to *survive*, that I’ve never spoken of.I guess those are the things I need to bring up in therapy now, huh? My shadow self. The part of me I’ve always rejected and never loved and believed made me unlovable by others. Looking at those pictures I realized how disconnected I am from myself. Like I could not look at that little face and wrap my brain around “that’s *me*”.When I tell you I sobbed you guys.She didn’t ask for or deserve any of what happened to her. What happened to *me*. But I’m 33 now and I make my own money and I’m in control of my life and everything that happens to me now is my decision. I choose a better life for her. For *me*.I’m having a moment of vulnerability and I just wanted to tell everyone here I know we all have different stories and the world wants to paint us as monsters but we are all still that innocent kid who deserves love, understanding, and healing. I wish it for all of us. That’s all.I went downstairs in my parents house to look through a box of stuff my grandma kept.

That’s all.My mom did something she thought was nice for me and I didn’t show her “enough” appreciation.I mention I’m trying to figure out what to do for dinner tonight and her response is “well you probably aren’t interested because you never appreciate anything I do for you but anyways there’s lettuce and peppers and eggs in the fridge”Oh and it’s my birthday tomorrow and I told her how much I’m struggling with suicidal ideation two days ago.My mom did something she thought was nice for me and I didn’t show her “enough” appreciation.I mention I’m trying to figure out what to do for dinner tonight and her response is “well you probably aren’t interested because you never appreciate anything I do for you but anyways there’s lettuce and peppers and eggs in the fridge”Oh and it’s my birthday tomorrow and I told her how much I’m struggling with suicidal ideation two days ago.Like even when I was a kid it was instant hatred of younger kids. My friends wanted to play house and pretend to be moms and I was like this is fucking gross.I hate their baby voices, I hate that they don’t know anything and need to be catered to at all times because they can’t do anything for themselves, I hate how much attention they need, I hate how messy they are, I hate how loud they are, I hate how expensive they are.Like I genuinely hate everything about them.I hate how much people seem to love and coo over them. “Precious innocent angels”. Like, do you not remember all the bad shit you did as a kid knowing full and well it was bad and you were going to get in trouble but still could ultimately get away with it. They fucking suck. Even parents are miserable, they have their entire lives taken away from them, and then they have more kids thinking that’ll make it better, and then they try to pressure others into having kids because misery loves company. I see so many adults that use children to validate their own existence, using them as an extension and representation of themselves, and it’s disgusting. Idk if anyone else feels this way.Like even when I was a kid it was instant hatred of younger kids.

They’ve given me a lot to think about and have prompted some deep introspection. I’m really glad I posted this!.
    Like you don't love them for sure. You just like don't care for them at all you don't idealize them it's like you borderline don't care about them, but as SOON as they are about to leave or something threatens you having them you're like "fuck that they're mine" type shit. Like you want them to be yours and no one elses?? Even though you could care less about them??. Like...you hurt me? Silent treatment. I'm pissed at you? Silent treatment. You're clingy and annoying? Silent treatment. I just don't like you? Silent treatment. It's literally my go-to, other than like completely degrading the person either passively or just straight up. Man that's kinda fucked actually. But like what else do I do I hate them.. Hii, I know you're like wtf are you doing here if you are someone with NPD and like I know what it looks like, but there's a lot of comorbidities between BPD and NPD, I think yall know. Anyway, something I go through that I'm not sure if any of yall do is like, do you ever feel so hurt emotionally, like its like an indescribable sadness and like emotional pain you can't deal with it so you like cut yourself? But it's not with an intent to hurt yourself or like kill yourself, just to get rid of that emotional pain or alleviate that? Is that a BPD thing? How do I fix that in different ways than just grabbing the random sharp thing? Like what do I do when I feel that emotional wave of like hell and feel like I'm stuck.Okay so it's obvious I'm undiagnosed for anything really but I mean based on a lot of my posts you can tell something's up. I am very confident about having NPD, but It's just I saw this video on youtube describing the internal thoughts of someone with BPD and I relate hard, just not the part where they would do anything for that person because I still put myself first I think. I'd hate to feel like im self-diagnosing anything because I'm NOT, but jesus I've been confused for the longest on what personality disorder I have. I'm not asking for a self diagnosis, more of like asking why am I relating so hard to bpd AND npd?? What's wrong with me? Do I have either or both? I am not diagnosed with either only because I am 17, not old enough to get a diagnosis. I just can't comprehend why and how I am relating so hard to both. I'm probably not even making much sense either I don't think, sorry. I don't know who I am.Okay, I'm shitty. I know that and I'm not mad at it, so feel free to talk shit after you read this. Okay so my friend told me today she has a crush on this girl right, and honestly I was never even thinking about the girl at all, but now that my friend likes her I want to obtain her, and now I think she's kind of fine? I didn't even feel like I had those types of feelings for the same sex before, maybe that's something else, but I genuinely want to introduce myself to her and get her to like me partially because my friend wants her, and now she's super appealing to me and I'm like "Okay she's actually really cool I want her". And I'm gonna just like get to know her and all that but not make it obvious. It's like a game I wanna play or something?? I'm actually an asshole holy shit what the fuck. But I'm gonna talk to her and win her over just for fun. Is this even an NPD thing or am I just a bad person?. I love the rush I get when I meet a new person or something, and I don't mind being with them a lot and dealing with them, but as time goes on and they genuinely seem to wanna get hella close it makes me just drop them altogether. Being in that kind of commitment is 1. Boring. 2. A lot of work. 3. Repulsing...they don't deserve me like that, they aren't on the same level as me to deserve all of that. Anyway anyone relate?. Okay so related to a post I saw earlier here, I just wanted to know like..is it normal for other people with NPD to split like this. Some days I couldn't give a fuck what anyone thinks about me since they're all not better than me anyway, but on the other hand on some days I am the best person there, popular, and hot, being the literal embodiment of the shit. And I will make sure I look good all day while I'm there. I will talk and hang out with anyone I think is worth it and I am the center of the attention. But then there's some days I couldn't give a single fuck about anyone there and will just not really talk to anyone. Is this even a NPD thing or like??. I'm on season 1 right now and I absolutely tried to like Beck but I cannot stand her like she makes me so mad at the world jesus christ I am not gonna be mad whenever she dies. Like seriously you broke up with him and then act like the biggest pick me bitch right after he did hella shit for you like overall he was a good boyfriend. Oh my goddd she acts like the literal biggest pick me annoying bitch I wanna bitchslap her and then get mad when he gets with Karen like shut the fuck up. Couldn't Joe pick someone actually good jesus christ I wanna lose my shit everytime she pops up on the screen I'm loosing days of my life whenever she pops up on the screen and speaks. Goddamn, is there any good love interest/victim...women?? I don't know.Okay so. Im 99.9% sure I have NPD right. Sooo I have these hierarchies. and theres two kinds of people. people above me, people below me. There are only a few people id see as equal to me, but they're like...extensions of me? Like I don't see them as their own person. Anywayyy....When I feel infatuation...obsession...its cause I see them as above me.... not everyone is like that.... like friends, classmates, even certain family members...are already below me, so it's no infatuation phase... it just goes into... okay nice supply, you're just there whatever....and then resentment if they get too close. People I'm infatuated with are different. When I hang out with them more, they are less of a god than I thought they were. And that in itself brings resentment and devaluing, and once they are below me...its kinda over and that's why I have that obsession, discard, hate cycle. They become less and less 'godlike', becoming just another 'supply'...like all my other relationships. Once my feelings of infatuation disappear the cycle of 'discard, hate' begins and this person becomes a completely undesirable individual. Anyway if anyone agrees or it's relatable let me know, or just let me know if I'm a crazy person. That's cool too.. Once in a blue moon id randomly be hella vulnerable with someone, and be super affectionate and it's the closest my mask is to getting off, and then soon after I'd hate them. I mean I know they're already judging me for everything I did and I actually tainted their view of me. That perfect person is now gone and I'm just a flawed mess of insecurity. Yet of course I then come to hate them, not even for that but then I have the audacity to find THEM clingy, and below me. Like I'm not even interested in them anymore after I do it. I decide to just cut them off and not speak to them anymore, even if they truly did nothing.I mean like, maybe? I mean I see people as like..my property....but like do I love them? What does that feel like, maybe I do? I'm so lost like can we actually love people or is that not possible because I don't think I felt love for another person..like what does that feel like? I know I can feel infatuated but I heard that's not the same. Is caring about them love? Is treating them nicely love?. Like I don't know if I'm good at reading people but I always know when my friend who's bipolar is acting different. I then feel like I'm walking on eggshells and the way I treat them changes so I can be in their good graces because my friend tends to get really pissy when she's different. I still need her to like me so I just give her more space, or be reeeeallly nice. Or not try to be annoying ("annoying" to her because when she's like it its like...I cannot explain it) I can't explain it but can you guys ever see a shift in people, even if slightly, and adjust your personality to fit?. It's sooo ironic but I hate when people only like me because of my looks, even though I strive to be as beautiful as I can. It makes me hate them so much, when I'm doing it to myself. I should be happy right? That I'm getting recognized for what I'm striving for? No, I can't be happy. I feel like they're using me, or that they only like me for the social mask I wear outside, even though I never showed them anyone else. I'm mad when they admire the one trait I aspire to be. Why? I am beautiful, why do I hate when people tell me that's one of the reasons they like me?. Complete turnaround from my last post😜, do you guys ever feel so bored, like life has a gray filter over it when there's no person you feel like you need to obtain, someone to obsesses over, someone to keep you entertained? Like I feel like I'm living on autopilot until I find that one person...and like I'm back. And that's when my grandiosity is the highest too. All my thoughts are just about them and its like a game....like a challenge I wanna win. I'm infatuating over them and everything, my life has color. And when I get the person or over that person...it gets boring and gray again...and life is just so unbelievably boring.EDIT: LMFAOOO YALL I FUCKED IT UP I MEANT TO SAY (DO PwNPD EVER FEEL LIKE PEOPLE WITHOUT ARE JUST SENSITIVE) I don't know if it's just me but like people take shit wayyy too seriously. Like they're ACTUALLY hurt by something I said or did and genuinely cry about it? Like get over it no shot you're letting this fuck your day up it's pathetic. Like just cut me off or shut the fuck up. And I don't even really be doing anything. And they really think an apology is going to help how is that gonna help. People who apologize piss me off because you're not sorry you're just saying you are. Anyway yeah, people are genuinely sensitive as fuck and take shit way too seriously.Maybe it's my ASPD traits talking or something but I genuinely think a lot about murdering someone. I know yall are like what the actual fuck but it's like, I just think like if I have to do this, to save myself or someone else I can do it really easily. Is this normal? Like something will probably happen to where I'll have to end up killing someone and I'm honestly fine with it, like I'm glad I know I can do something like that if it came down to it. I'm so ready for this to get downvoted but I just wanted to share. Someone answer if this is even ASPD traits at all or what.So like, does anyone feel like they lose their sense of self...or like they lose their...I hate saying it like their persona whenever they aren't using it much? Like aren't around people for a while? I feel like I become a loser if I don't use it...and I need to interact with people to make sure I still know who I am. Like I can't explain it so I hope someone gets it.I know yall are like what the fuck are you talking about so let me explain. Whenever I get into a argument with someone else on another subreddit the FIRST thing they say is "you're a narcissist so of course you're acting like that ehehe you post on the npd subreddit🤓" SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU'RE FUCKING ARGUING WITH ME MOTHERFUCKER WHAT THE FUCK IM ON THE NPD SUBREDDIT DOESN'T FUCKING MEAN IM INCAPABLE OF HAVING A FUCKING CONTRUCTIVE ARGUMENT DUMB FUCKING BITCH. Anyway that's it bye. I kinda wish they were mentioned again cause I felt like ppl moved past them way too fast. Like the way they lived and were treated were so much harsher than everywhere else. It's like that whole episode was a nightmare. Bro just being silent and your fucking mouth stitched shut? Yeah I'd feel so dehumanized and I can literally say one of the few things I was genuinely scared of frfr. It satisfied me sooo much when Serena's bitch ass was in that immigration thing asking June what she would do. Felt like I was watching season 2 again but everything flipped #1 Serena hater fr. Okay obviously I'm overexaggerating but honestly Jaeden is a really good character he's so cute and he shouldn't of been blown up like that. He was so cute and I felt so bad for him omg :( and I knew something was gonna happen to him but I was praying it wouldn't but of course they'll blow up the more pure character in the show.Like if yall love Gilead so much why don't you Blessed be the fruit your asses to Gilead but yet they're staying their asses in Canada with those dumbass candles.Yall know the blond lady with Luke and she lived with Moria and him...in season 4 where did she go she just disappeared.. He literally doesn't gaf he'll flip on anyone to benefit himself and the government and I kinda liked him at first now I'm like wtf.I mean sure he was manipulative or whatever, but he was just playing the game yall act like he killed someone's cat or sum LMFAOOO like if it was a million dollars, I'd do the same like???. So if you make your own bot or something, something that helps is in the greeting adding dialogue from the character that you think they would say in the scene literally helps so much. That's it.Hey, actually tried to lucid dream last night with my method and did it. But uh it was a little weird. I had a dild ofc but this guy was chasing me. I tried to think "its my lucid dream so he will stop chasing me" and he didn't. So I thought "Im going somewhere with peaceful grass" or something and closed my eyes. He was still there and like he picked me up and I lost lucidity. Help?. Because of some stupid parenting my life is fucked up forever. I’m stuck with this whole fucking personality disorder just because my parents were abusive. Because of their mistakes I’m stuck being a monster my whole life and never feeling like everyone else in society I’m just a pathetic evil person because of stupid parenting.I used my technique last night and Instead of procrastinating I did my technique and got lucid in my dream!! It lasted longer than most of my lucid dreams and I even made sandals on my feet bc the ground was hard😭😭 On a scale of 1-5 my lucidity and control was a good 3.5-4. Hate is a strong word so not exactly that but it’s a hugeeee turn off for any kind of relationships. If I were to be with someone, my Ideal person would just be there for me not show all kinds of lovey dovey affection. I see people who simp as lower than me and why would I date someone who’s below me. Like grow up and stop. That’s it bye. As you all know narcissist can’t have that high sense of self esteem forever and eventually hits rock bottom. That’s where I’m at right now and I haven’t been this depressed since like two years ago. I am a girl so beauty is of high value to me. Today some things was said to me and I feel ugly. So now I’m worthless. No one could ever love me WITH beauty now I don’t have that and I’m done for. I don’t remember how I got my self esteem up when I wasn’t aware but I really don’t want to feel depressed right now. I don’t care.Update: we up yall I’m good again I got some validation 🔥🔥. Maybe it's just me, but I want to see if this is common or not.Hi, I'm new here but Id thought id vent. Yes, I'm a narcissist btw. Why can't I keep a friendship. I do everything right but then something happens, and we aren't friends. When I started my new school, everyone loves me and wanted to be friends with me. Now they all don't like me. I'm not alone though I always have other people to fall back on. But even if nothing happens, I fall out with my friends. I have a feeling they are probably just jealous of me though, but it's still crazy how EVERY FRIENDSHIP I have doesn't work out.So I'm still kind of new to this so control and how long they are is what I need to work on, but just realizing I'm dreaming when I do this method is great. So pretty much the method is when you go to sleep, keep lucid dreaming on your mind and watch lucid dreaming stuff before bed. Then do WBTB but keep LD on your mind then too. This plus consistency pretty much guarantees a DILD and I really don't want people in the comments to smart mouth me saying how this is a method already and this and that. This is my method that works for me whenever I do it and I decided to share it. Its super easy and requires little effort.contrary to the title this was the closest I ever had to a lucid dream since last year. So recently ive been doing spotanious awareness during the day successfully meaning I was doing it almost every hour. Usually, my dreams always have something to do with p\*\*\*philes and r\*\*ists, unfortunately and im not going to get too deep into it but I was at this school I wanted to go to and this girl walked ina classroom with me and said these two teachers r\*ped me and stuff. Later when I went outside, I was like "Am I dreaming?" And everything went sooo clear. Then it went black, and I woke up. Can someone tell me if this is progress and what do I do now. And the reason I even mentioned that is because I wanted to do MILD too but with these dreams I literally can't.So, I recently read a guide on this lucid dreaming method, and he said something about schemas. Before I went to sleep, I would have this vision and then I would always think to myself "yea ima lucid dream". That went away and before right now I couldn't quite get why that would happen. It is because I was associating that vision with LD. If I can do another one like that, maybe I can have a guaranteed one every night. Im sure this is a method somewhere already so im not even gonna try to take credit.. but damn this could work.Hi im starting a lucid dreaming attempt journal where I go over how my body was feeling and what was happening while attempting a lucid dream method and maybe you guys can give me some advice, because when I lurk here, I never know what to ask people so I might as well describe my experience for help. sooo #1 I guess.I'm using [How to become a Lucid Master in 60 days or less : LucidDreaming (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/adlsc4/how_to_become_a_lucid_master_in_60_days_or_less/) for two months.My first day was yesterday and here are notes I wrote the following morning:\-I was too focused and couldn't get to the second stage\-It was hard to go back to sleep in general and to do it I had to give up completely\- Every time I did WBTB these last few days it would be much harder to go back to sleep and ended up staying up having to give up completely. I even took melatonin.So there are two lucid dreams that I still remember clearly to this day, and ive been trying to lucid dream for a while now but I can't. Maybe someone can help find a pattern. So my first one, I went to sleep then all of a sudden there was this bright white light that filled my vision and it felt like it was just there for like 30 minutes then I woke up on the ground of my old school, fully lucid. My second one was I woke up on the ground by a park, immediately lucid. Can anyone please help me figure out how I did that or what method that was.So when I was younger when I used to fall asleep I used to get these images into my head when I’m going to sleep it would be chaotic but I would always know I would have a lucid dream from it. Then one day it stopped and I’ve been trying to get into it again and one time I got the vision. Anyone know what this is what causes it or anyone relate to it at all or am I just weird.Ive been trying for three months straight, using all kinds of techniques, dream journaling, reality checks constantly, use mugwort, and wake back to bed. for some reason I cannot seem to lucid dream anyone help please.
    Hey, daignosed narc here.No matter what I do or how much I practice I'm always a failure. Anything I take joy in eventually becomes like torture to do because I know I should be better at it than I am, and that I'm a failure, that I'm weak. All I've been good at is lying and cheating. Maybe that's all I'll ever be. Maybe that's not a bad thing.Hey, daignosed narc here.Recently I ditched a long time long distance friend because of some crazy views they had. Between that and my best friend and ex being busy with school I don't talk to anyone I don't live with anymore. I feel lonely of course, like there's me and then there's the world existing on an entirely different plane of reality you know? But it somehow feels more simple, better in some places even. I don't have to talk to people, I can just live in my head and do my work. I know it's not healthy but I wish I could get rid of wanting to talk to people. Not sure if it's an NPD thing or what.Hey, daignosed narc here. I used to meet people, now I don't. It's been forever since I regularly went places, like went went places, like the city or something. I feel like as I've gotten older my world has become smaller and I've become more isolated. I spend most of my time in my room now, it doesn't even feel like a real place, just an area in my mind that I hide in. The more I think about it the less I want to go out and talk to people. I know something is wrong and I know it's getting worse but I don't know how to fix it and I barely know what it is.Hey, daignosed narc here.For the last few weeks I've been messaging someone planning to meetup for casual sex. I made sure not to give them any information about me, and no images of my face. I made sure that I was physically larger then then so I had little to fear. I ghosted them out of nowhere. I deleted all my messages and blocked them on everything. I still struggle with overactive sex drive and low to no human contact, I just couldn't get myself to meet with them. I don't even think it was the fear about meeting with a stranger for sex, I would have done the same if there wasn't sex. I just really don't like meeting up with people, I still struggle to see the point in socializing without the toxic parts that I took pleasure in.Hey, daignosed narc here. I've been working so hard to grow as a person. I can't enjoy social interactions anymore because I've stopped doing the bits I enjoy (the toxic bits). Everything ive done is in an effort to be better and do better. It would be the easiest thing in the world to just go back to how I was, start lying to everyone like I did, start manipulating people again. To all of you going through the same thing I am, it would be easy to go back, but going forward is what makes us strong.Hey, daignosed narc here. My whole life I've been daydreaming and living in my own imagination most of the time. I don't know when it started but my emotional life has always been invested in my imagination and imaginary worlds. I think this is why I find i find my real life so boring. Does anyone else have this problem?. Hey, daignosed narc here.In my experience basically every part of my NPD can be traced back to an insecurity and an overcompensation in response to that. An example is my body. I don't think I look that attractive, I could list off things I hate about my body, but because of that I spend a lot of time grooming my facial hair, obsessing over my clothes, ect. When I go out I project all my ego to make it seem like I know I'm hot (when I'm not). The thing is that I truly believe I am not attractive but I lie to myself to get that ego to project that confidence. So much of it is lying to myself ignore an insecurity.Hey, daignosed narc here.I was sitting at my Sunday night family dinner and I was being quiet with my elbows off the table and my back straight, I had my "classy" persona on, I didn't think about it at the time but I shifted to the persona unconsciously. While I was listening to the conversation my mind wandered to a relatively anonymous hookup I had scheduled that week and I thought something on the line of "that's not something I would do", but I did schedule it, and I was down for it but at that time I felt like that is something I wouldn't do. I think this was because of the persona I had on at the time but without the persona I don't know if something is or isn't something I would do.Hey, daignosed narc here.There has been a dream of mine I never let myself wish for because I thought it could never happen, its like a hot stove to me, every time I think of it I go to something else because I know longing for it will just be pain. The dream is friends I love, a life filled with connection and honesty and everything I can barely feel right now. I hate people who have it because I'm jelous and I don't think I can have that and it would just be pain and humiliation to try. Ive never liked happy endings because I thought I could never get one for myself, that it was my nature to be what I am and to hate so much. I don't even know what to do now. It would be the easiest thing in the world to have anger wash over me and to get rid of the sadness that helped me realise this.Hey, daignosed narc here. I thought I was just fragile or overly sensitive when I took everything personally but over time I realised it was something more the that. I've always liked being angry, it felt like a state where I had more power and strength, where I could take charge and do what I wanted, child logic I guess. I think I seek out narratives that give me that sense of being slighted, betrayed, stepped on, all to justify letting out all of my anger on someone who unconvinced me in the smallest way imaginable because I wanted to be angry to feel powerful. Anyone else get this?. Hey, daignosed narc here.Most of the time I don't look forward to stuff. Even if it's something pretty good. Going out to meet a friend? I feel nothing. Coming up on my birthday? I feel nothing, getting a new computer? I feel nothing. When things are coming up I feel dread more often then excitement. I think I felt excitement at one point in my life but it's very rare now. It's part of the overall numbness that encompasses most of my emotional state. I don't look forward to things, I don't feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish a project, I dislike pretty much all of my friends and hate some and that's the only emtion I have towards them. Do any other narcs have this level or approaching this level of numbness? Trying to see if this is normal. Hey, daignosed narc here.Right now I'm ghosting someone because they where a friend who was quickly becoming too dependant. Whenever I see they have sent a message it feels like Im having a conversation with them, because what I chase in a conversation is validation of my existence and having someone message me when I haven't replied to their last text feels so validating, it feels like I have worth, like I deserve some of the air I breathe. I know this is unhealthy but it's an interesting thing to bring up with my therapist next time I see him.Hey, daignosed narc here.I struggle enjoying talking to people, it's like a game to me and I always try to get to a set end point, in reality I know that if you try to force things and plan them and manipulate them it feels so much less genuine and can be much more frustrating which can make it harder to connect with people. I was going to meetup with a friend in a library but their alarm didn't go off on time so it was called off, but I was already there. I saw that there was a writing festival thing with speakers and since I have an interest in writing I sat down, intending on killing some time.I sat next to a woman maybe five or so years older than me and I struck up a conversation, we both are passionate about writing and we had an exchange about that. The most amazing thing is that when there was a lull I just sat back and we both went back to our phones. Every part of my instinct screamed at me to try and keep going, to maybe get her number or something. I took a breath and made the conscious choice to just let it be, if we talk again we talk again and if we don't we don't and either way it will be organic and that's enough. That's big for me.Edit: The next thing during the event was a long table open forum with microphones on the table led by three relatively prominent authors, the crowd was like 50-70 people. Anyone was allowed to go up to the table, take a chair and contribute to the conversation, and so I did. It was amazing having a mic, I made them briefly laugh and I also made a comment they all agreed with and found inspiring. I love being on the mic. Daignosed narc here.I met someone really cool. I really liked hanging out with them, they seemed exciting but also calming at the same time. They always kept saying they where busy and I was always the one who had to text first, they encouraged me to double and triple text if I wanted their attention since they said they liked coming back to the messages. Eventually after enough time of having every message exchange being like getting blood from a stone, trying to get them to message me, I thought fuck it and decided not to message first anymore. It's been around two or three months and nothing. I stopped messaging first with everyone else too and the only people I talk to are my family now. A part of me feels happy about this, because I knew people would let me down but now I have an example, now I get to use this as ammunition to get myself even more isolated. I don't get it. How can I justify trying to socialize to myself if I'm always going to be the only one putting in any effort?. Hey, daignosed narc here.Whenever I'm watching a show or listening to a musical and everything's resolved and everyone's happy, when the couple end up together or the hero saves the day, when the conflict ends Im filled with so much anger. Once when I was listening to the ending of a musical and heard how happy and at peace everyone was I was filled with so much anger I had to go a few rounds with a punching bag in my back yard... with no gloves on...I know this is because I'm jealous, I dont think I can ever have a happy ending, I don't think the fight can ever stop for me, so when I see people happy i want to ruin it for them to make them feel what I'm feeling. I suppose this is because I can't feel happy for others. I never knew how I was supposed to do that.Hey, daignosed narc here.One of the hardest things I've learned is that I don't know how to really process emotion, I just push it down, ignore it and move on. This has lead to building up a lot of unprocessed shit thats still pretty raw for me. A couple of my mental health professionals gave me an exercise that with their permission I altered a bit and it's really helping me to learn how to really get through emotions by feeling them.A lot of my NPD traits can be linked to a specific incident so the emotions around that will be the focus of the exercise for a while. I sit down, close my eyes and focus on my breathing. I clear my mind and when I am focused on my breath enough I imagine a tornado coming at me. When I step into the edge of the tornado, the really rough part, I recollect the incident, slowly, going through it and feeling it, and when I've reached the end of the incident I step into the eye of the storm and let the emotions go, I see the emotions and the incident as something apart from me, they are the wind in the tornado, affecting me without being me. I do this every week day, not saying you should but I hope someone can get something from this post. At first I cried every time but no I don't really cry anymore, I feel the good and bad and I'm learning to process emotions by feeling them.Daignosed narc here.Most of the time my feelings are numb, dull, flat; except for anger that is. But when I actually manipulate someone, get them in the palm of my hand, figure out what makes them tick and get to push their buttons like a mental autopsy while they are still alive I feel complete thrill. It's the best I've ever felt, better than anything sexual, complete release and complete bliss. It's like a rush of erratic energy combined with a feeling of complete power, it's incredible. I know that following through on those instincts are toxic, but I can't imagine anything that isn't toxic being able to give me that bliss. I think a lot of people get fixated on this feeling like I did but that's just a theory. Without the bliss all I'm left with is the numbness, and I know it's about mindfulness and I'm working on that, but how close can I really get to that high without that feeling of total control and manipulative thrill? Does anyone else have this problem?. Daignosed narc here.So I play video games, all against people since I find it hard feeling accomplishment in any games if it's not against someone. I feel like every time I lose, and like LOSE LOSE, I feel everything I am come apart, its like a physical pain, worse, I would rather do cardio by using a tree as a punching bag until my hands bleed. I have such a drive to try and win and it feels great when I win but every time I lose it feels like a punch in the gut, and I hate whoever I'm playing against, like I would strike them sometimes if I could. I feel almost obsessed with trying to win but it's never fun one way or another.Hey, daignosed narc here.I don't have a lot of emotional reactions to thinks if the emotions are negative, mainly anger. Any small victory or progress leaves me numb, and any real progress leaves me numb too.The things that get me the biggest positive feeling are bad stuff, manipulation, sadism and the like. I've never been emotionally or physically abusive (intentionally at least), but the best feelings I've ever felt come out of relishing in other people's pain and the control I can excert on others. The funny thing is that my condition encourages me to dehumanize people, but most of the time I dehumanize myself and see myself as something other than human. I don't know how much I can get better, but I know I'll be on meds and in therapy for the rest of my life either way.Hey, daignosed narc here.I always try to be the best in anything I'm passionate about, it's all about ambition for me. No matter what I do, I lose, I end up at the bottom again and it feels like I can't do anything. I want to win, no matter what game or what instance, I want to win. I've spent so much of my life on games and shit but it never feels like I can really win, and no matter what I hate the person I'm playing against most of the time for being an obstacle to my victory. I'm a writer, but I haven't really been published and it's been longer than I'd want to admit since I wrote anything or edited it. I have a YouTube channel that was growing rapidly but my computers broken so that's on hold too. All I have is my schoolwork and I want to be happy with that since I'm actually kind of good at that (straight A's and B's) but that's not enough for me. All I want to do is win and I can't manage to find a win in anything I care about. This hurts a lot since I don't really have any self esteem so each loss just hits me hard. I know I'm not owed it, and I know I have to work for it, but I have and it's never enough.Hey, daignosed narc here.I've heard people talk about a collapse, what does it mean?. Diagnosed narc here.So I don't have a lot of patience who fuck up and seem like a mess, like in almost any way. This is because I've always thought people's value comes from how good they are at what they do or sometimes just the basics of life, and that if they fuck up they're worthless. I realized the reason I'm so hard on myself and unhappy so much of the time is because I apply that to myself, that's where I got it. If I fuck up I see myself as fundimentally worthless, I have to prove that I have worth so I apply that to everybody else. To start understanding other people's inherant worth I have to understand mine first.Hey, daignosed narc here.I've talked before about sex but here I want to talk about sexual preferences and their relationship to my experience with NPD. Most of the time I want to please the person I'm fucking, as a form of performance I want to be the best they have ever had and I don't care if I cum or don't because the satisfaction for me is impressing them. Other then that my personal kinks are either related to complete dominance over the situation or an emmense amount of closeness in the situation. I know our lives shape our kinks but how has your NPD affected yours? I'm not going to be wierd.Hey, diagnosed narc here. When I'm doing something socially I put a LOT of effort into the way I dress. I'm a guy so that includes dressing subtly well, since you can't be seen making an effort to look good if your a guy. The outfit I put on is in tuned to the situation, maybe it's someone's favorite color or perfect for the occasion but that's not all. I shave where I need to, moisturize and use specific deodorant. All the while I prepare myself mentally to mask my autistic and ADHD symptoms and assume a personality that will please the person I'm meeting. How do you get ready mentally to mask and what kind of shame is the reason why your masking?. Hey, diagnosed narc here.I have a lot of disgust for basically everyone at all times because I'm afraid of social rejection and that leads to a lot of hatred, but any of you narcs who feel a strong amount of sadism, do you feel the cause is hatred or something else? I just love seeing people in pain, especially people I hate but in all I enjoy seeing fictional characters suffer or almost any real life person, even some people I like.Hey, diagnosed narc here.I know that mental health shit is all spectrum, and while looking up covert and overt narcissism I found I have some of both traits.In person I am self depreciating, humble and somewhat shy, but I crave attention and grandure. Interpersonally I disarm people with shyness but ultimately I want the center stage. Ultimately I know nothing is cut and dry and real life isn't Harry Potter where everybody gets a Hogwarts house that describes them perfectly.Hey, diagnosed narc here.When I was in my last long term relationship I would pick desperate people who I could impress and string them along as backups in case I wanted to breakup with my partner, there are two people I did this with. I realized that the manipulation I was doing was wrong and I ghosted both of them because I thought that was healthier than stringing them along. I don't have any interest in those people as I don't have interest in almost any people outside of what they can do for me. Last time I checked both of them still liked me and I'm not sure what to do with possible messups like this, what's the healthiest option?. Hey, diagnosed narc here. One of the big things they never talk about when it comes to narcissism is how lonely it is. Most of my life it feels like I'm in a zombie world and everyone else is a zombie, not trying to get me, just trudging through their existence. How can I make friends with the zombies? Like I can give them brains and make an easy alliance but I can't connect to a zombie. It feels like I'm the only person in the world sometimes and that's the loneliest thing in the world.Hey, diagnosed narc here.I put so much effort into being likable, disarmingly likeable and approachable. I put to much fucking effort into the art that is social contact and there is this subset of people who skate by being abrasive, unpersonable and uncharasmatic. I hate that I put in all the effort I can and there are these people who I have to put up with who sidestep the art of social contact by forgoing all charisma but they still have friends and they still have loved ones. I hate them so much.Hey, diagnosed narc here. So recently I was looking for local hookups, not intending on fucking anyone, just wanting to see where things go. I've always like the idea of having someone I hangout with while having a sexual relationship but that's beside the point. I was talking to this one person and we had similar taste in shows and had a good conversation about it before we got to talking about sex. They didn't want anything about friendship and just wanted the fucking. The cool thing is that I feel that it's some kind of social rejection but I didn't go to devaluing the conversation we had or the connection I felt. I just had a cool conversation with someone and it didn't work out, which is big for me. I hope I can continue along this more healthy path.Hey, diagnosed narc here.I know media has not been kind to us narcs, somewhat deservedly, but what is a character you relate to in film or movie? I know the Patrick Bateman thing is a meme but I genuinely relate to his morning routine and his line about simply not existing.Sometimes I remember I'm going to die and it REALLY hits, like REALLY hits, and I feel this intense stomach ache and it's the most crippling anxiety I have ever felt I my life, all danger feels separated from me, manageable, but with death it's so debilitating sometimes.Daignosed narc here. Every time I see someone having fun with their friends and being genuinely secure and happy I jump from not angry at all to a 10 instantly, I want to inact violence (I would never act on it). I am so envious of people who can be secure in their self worth and have fun hanging out with other people and making connections that all the anger fluds in and I hate them as much as I am capable of hating someone. I know the solution to this is to become more secure in myself but I have no idea how to do that, I'm working with my therapist with regular sessions but it the lack of self esteem that causes this seems so fundimental to my self I'm not sure how I can change that.Hey, daignosed narc here. I have always had long-term plans for everything I'm really interested in, plans of how I'm going to make it big, 4 or so plans I am going to execute at the same time. With all my being I think I'm going to one day stand on the stage of a sold out stadium with all the seats sold out and everyone chanting my name, I believe that with every cell of my being. Weather it be for one of my plans or none of them or all of them I am so driven to get there. Is this delusions of grandure? Where is the line between ambition and delusion? Any examples of your own grandure is appreciated to demonstrate the line or the field of thought.Daignosed narc here. I've had sex before, plenty of times, and it's cool and all, like really cool and I'd love to have more of it but at this point the needed amount of human interaction is too annoying, the amount of needed trust in the other person is way too high for any kind of sexual activity, even for casual sex I hate having to spend time with people it's not worth it. It sucks because I have a high sex drive but I just hate people too much. This is not a weird invitation for DMs, DONT send any wierd DMs. Sex drive is the thing that keeps getting me to seek human connection and it's a mistake every time.Daignosed narc here. I may laugh m all at the time but I'm not sure I've ever enjoyed someones company. Some of my siblings or my exes maybe but I hate all my friends and everyone I've ever been friends with, I hate spending time with most people in general, I always have an agenda and I always use the time to use the person to further it, without that I can't justify tourtuing myself with spending time with anyone. People seem to love the most basic human interaction and savour the most simple conversations with their friends but all I can think about it wanting it to be over. Do you feel this way? (you being a narc). Daignosed NPD here. Every time I try to look up resources or anything on NPD it's always from the perspective of trying to help the victim of the narcissist, which is good for the most part those people need help, but it makes it so hard to find the resources that are there for people with NPD. I know this is because there are more victims than narcs and that makes sense, it's just so frustrating to read through an article and realise when it says "can a narcissist change?" It means my behaviour, not my condition. I know I can change my behaviour, I want to know if I can really fix the thing that is making me miserable.Daignosed NPD here. I've made a lot of progress in not manipulating people and it's good that I did that and continue to make progress. But I miss feeling good at something. I know that it's a very small sacrifice but it's one of the little things I never expected to happen. I miss making manipulative plays and then panning out because I read the person well. I know it's kinda like a mugger missing mugging but it still sucks. I just miss being good at something.Diagnosed narc here (it's our word I can say it lmao). I was trying to fix my computer because a part of my headphone jack broke off in the headphone jack socket, so I put some glue on the rest of the headphone jack and put it in the socket, waited for it to dry and tried to pull the whole thing out and ended up having more of the headphone jack broken off in the socket ans covered withe glue. I didn't ask for help at any point, I didn't want to be embarrassed and I didn't want to admit fault so now I have to take my computer to the repair shop. All of this could have been avoided and everything is worse off because I didn't want to ask for help because of my fragile ego. I think it's important that we notice the small, everyday ways that our NPD hinders our ability to solve problems and make our life better.I have been diagnosed with NPD. I am a very sexual person, I have a very high sex drive and I feel like in the past I have used sex as a stand in for real vulnerability. I took pride in making my partner feel good because it made me feel worth it, that I was better than everyone else. Now I broke up with my then partner because I was incapable of being emotionally honest with them and I am self isolating a lot but I have the urge to go to reddit or something for local hookups, I'm not going to of course but I crave that kind of connection. How do I move past wanting sex with other people (it's not worth the risk of getting that close to someone) and how do I stop wanting that vulnerability?. I have so many plans about incredible things I'll do, and I plan to do them and I will, I feel certain about that. Whenever I'm alone or feel like I'm wasting time I can almost hear the ticking of a clock, I can hear my time running out, seconds I'll never get back that could be spent better. The average life span for someone in my country is 90, I have 70 years left and I keep that in mind with everything I do, I have to do the best with every second. Is this obsession normal with people with NPD?. When my nanna died I felt nothing. I was the one to get the call when I was a kid because Dad's phone was left in another room and I was the one to bring it to him, that was the only time I had seen him cry, I still felt nothing. I felt nothing with grandad died, the last thing I told him was a joke about cars, he had worked in a car factory most of his life and he laughed at my joke, I still felt nothing. It felt weird. Is it normal to be dumb around death?. Hey, diagnosed narc here. I've been doing a lot of work with my therapist and a lot of it has been around vulnerability and how my coping mechanisms are based around substituting that for control when interacting with someone. This means even though I can control the environment I can't really get close to people. I get that internal narcisism is unhleathy but are people really worth it? I feel so close to not needing human interaction or at least needing little human interaction. It feels like everyone I've met I have either hurt or they abandoned me, than I hurt them if I could. It is worth trying to be close to humans when everything I want to do doesn't require it? Everyone feels so beneath me, worm-like and disgusting I don't understand the appeal.Hey, I have a NPD diagnosis and I'm new here. I'm active in disability spaces and Its driven home how fucked the perception of NPD is. Functionally NPD is a disability, given it's a disability that increases the chance someone is a asshole, but in the end it's an architecture of coping mechanisms that hurt not only the people around the narc but also the narc themselves. It's like depression if depression made someone really want to lie to people. I wish people could see this as a disability and not as an evil gene or whatever. It's a medical issue not a magical curse.I'm 20 and I've been in therapy since I was 6 or 7 for depression and other things. Semi recently I found out I was a narcissist and it made everything make a lot more sense, I got the diagnosis after talking for 30 minutes straight. How much of this shit is just set for the rest of our lives? I know I can change my behaviour but can I change my everything? Can I get some real self worth? How possible is my dream of being able to hangout with people casually and not hate all of them?.
    Now it's been a while since I first cut myself. It was earlier this year and I didn't do much, just a couple marks on my shoulder, now.But I've found other manners of harming myself. Sometimes I get so mad I punch the ground. The punch leaves my hands with a few tiny scabs and a bit of pain. Whenever I floss my teeth, I push a bit harder in the sensitive area. It hurts. I even bleed, but something about seeing myself bleed feels invigoratingAnd no, I don't derive any sexual pleasure from this. This is from my anger and my discontent for others' behaviors. I only wish not to feel any longer, for happiniess is but a myth in this unceasing nightmare.I've held that title before. They just don't realize I only want what's best for me. For my image. Even the lowest man has power over my actions because of that. Remaining "kind" as a facade, I'm only doing things because I want to or because it benefits me. It angers me. I want people to understand who I am, but they never do.Like... I do it all the time, a couple years ago I took up stage acting and I'm (generally) pretty good at it. I'm thinking this may be an NPD related thing. I dunno, I might just be lucky.I'm stuck here, in a place I won't let you comprehend. It moves me to no end, and my mind it is covered in gunk. God knows I love to be clean, yet he gave me a repulsive desire for filth.I despise this desire, as I do all my desires. They are remarkably human and I am ashamed to have them. All desire does is make me fear and greed, envy and hate.I can't stand who I've become, cowering at the impossible notion of discovery. I know one day God will find a way to purge me of my filth. But I just don't know how yet. He'll get me, I know he will. I'm not strong enough to do it myself. I am enraged now. I wish to have never been created. God didn't do it right. I can make me better than he can, I can be happy. It would be a better me. I'd die for it, right now. I would kill myself for a better me. I don't expect a consciousness shift or anything. God is perfect, they say. I don't know how to trust them. God has made me wrong, and he's so easy to blame. God knows what I can be, whio I can become, but first I must tear this filth from my body.This filth is of no benefit to me. All of this anger, hatred, and desire for pointless connection is just filth. It's a smudge on my body. I can't be clean with it. And they'll notice it one day. On my glass statuesque character they'll find my smudge. They'll find it and try to clean it off. They'll just make it worse, I'll never forgive them for it. My body has a purpose. To do what it needs to do. Far too often I feel compelled to do what I need not do, and I ALWAYS regret it. It's begun to damage me, jeopardize my saftey. I hate it. I hate my humanity. My instincts, my primal urges. They are jothing to me and I FUCKING HATE THEM.Logic tells me that I'm incredibly loved, and most other people in my position would feel and agree with that. But I just don't *feel* it. I don't know why. Maybe because I've never gone without, but having to reciprocate all of this love is just so freakishly exhausting. I want to but I feel like I can't. How the hell do people do this? Everything feels like something I have to pay back. Like I owe something back to them. It makes me despise God sometimes. Knowing that I was "created" and I can't do rat-shit about it makes me very angry and borderline suicidal.I've taken so much from the world. I'm only doing things because I'm expected to do them. I don't want to hurt anyone else. Everyone makes me angry. I wish it would mean something. I wish my death was something they can understand. But they never will, so I have to live in this suffer state of seething anger.When I was little, I made the decision not to ever get romantically involved with anyone. This is far before any of my so-called symptoms had manifested. I'm still only 16, so take this with a grain of salt.I don't exactly remember why I made this choice initially, but I know why now: I would manipulate the hell out of someone who liked me like that. That would be a cruel thing for me to do. So I avoid romantic relationships. Anyone else do this too?. I am an above average human intellectually. I know this to be true. Now I'm not a genius but in a room of average people I am aware that I am smarter than a majority of them. Physically, I've got work to do. I'm aware I likely cannot outstrength most men.Yet I feel like even with that physical strength I would be unhappy. I could be the best in the entire world and I'm unsure if I would be satisfied with it. I want to be more. Every day is a day closer to doom, and while I've still a long time left, it hurts me to feel so limited. The human body is so weak, so frail. I have to eat to maintain myself. I have to excrete filth and waste. I have to socialize to get what I want and I have to distract myself from these thoughts of suicide. God, should he exist, created me. I wish he hadn't. Because there ain't a thing wrong with me yet I feel so absurdly disappointed with things I have no control over. I want to be more. I hate being like this, this fleshy mess with instincts that disgust the only part of myself that I love with no guilt. It's the only thing I love with no guilt, no shame. Knowing that I'm still but human everyday when I wake up only begs the question of suicide. I have two hours every morning alone, and at least 30% of that time is wondering why I don't just destroy this angry mass of flesh. It would be so easy, given how weak it is. One day I'll be free from this. One way or another, be it eternal nothingness or unfathomable pain/joy. I am disgusted and ashamed.I have found a new layer behind my mask. I thought the disgust was over. It isn't. Behind the disgust is a film of filth, one I am extremely ashamed of. I was always told to be a good man but with that filth I fear I can't be.The second layer of disgust drives me insane. It screams all day long to be who you are. It can't comprehend my brilliant lies. My magnificent schemes. And it hates me for it. It wants so desperately to be free but I know better than to let it. It's disgusted with my suppression, and it sources my anger. I want it dead.God I feel so smart right now. My therapist said I had emotional intelligence and I really didn't understand what that meant for a while until now! I say that because were I not a man of exceptional emotional intelligence, I'd still be vexed by the question. Why do I not beleive in unconditional love? It wasn't something I questioned until about 5 minutes ago. But then I did and I've found the answer! I don't believe in unconditional love because I can't fathom someone loving my exposed self. I've crafted this (rather brilliant) mask for myself so well that if it were removed I'd be in the most manipulatable position possible! In that situation, I know the person I showed my true self to would have a power over me that no one has held in quite a way before. What that person says or does literally changes the way I will operate for a significant amount of time. I don't trust anyone with that, evem those whom are supposed to unconditionally love me. Some parts of me really want me to kill myself. But I feel like I always end up avoiding because I know I'm way too smart to die before my brain is even partially put to record. I've got plans and everything, but I just can't do it kmowing that I'm tok smart for it. Kinda funny, almost.Do you ever feel so much that you start finding whatever method you can to get it out of you? Like, right now, I feel angry, nervous, paranoid, and a tad bit suicidal. Mostly those first two, don't worry. Or do. I don't mind. Anyways, I find that when enduring these extreme fits of emotion, I laugh uncontrollably. It always feels like I'm expelling the emotion, and clouding my mind. Do y'all do something like that?. Such degeneration shan't besmirch my nameIf ever such a thing occurrs I cannot ensure my own safety. I will have betrayed myself, in a manner irredeemable. I'd condemn myself to death.For the filth and digust are too much to feel, and I cannot insure my reputation. Once the filth overflows from my now-corroding walls, I will have acheived the worst-case scenario. The feeling disgusts me, and feeling innately betrays me. I'm left a fragile casing, filled only with fear and paranoia. I can only endure for so long.Mental fortitude is rejuvenated by the kind words once more but still creeps the paranoia. Just walking and enduring and so close to pain shall I erupt in a cacophony of laughter. It is not a laugh of joy or any immediately comprehensible emotion. It's beyond my control, which hurts deeper within. A crack that can't be seen, a ravine with a narrow entrance. Deep dark warmth from mysterious places arise, finding steeled nerves to the cold. More laughter, hiding something underneath like a bear trap for the uninitiated. You'll be lucky if you only lose your ring finger. It's not like you need to use it. But with you it lies again a deeper feeling. You want the whole hand off of ya, you cakling incoherent slob. Hurting for more pain, just to feel shame after it's all over? You deserve such things!. With enough screeching anger I find myself cursing this weak and frail body of mine. I strive to find reslience but my will is not strong enough.I can feel the respect they have for me, without it I do not exist. I will uphold and maintain this brilliant facade for as long as it lasts, performing my acts of adequate magnificence and prancing the earth as a man of magical mysticism. Behind that is something deeper, something meant to scare away those persistent enough to ask the right questions. The fear forms fear, and I find myself unable to control that aspect. That's not right. I'm a man of control, anything less than that is unacceptable. The layer meant to scare is a layer hiding fear. The toxin is addictive, the paranoia reinforces the thoughts. The toxin keeps my safe from private aggressors. And I'm clean again.I've been doing some thinking, and I've come to a realization.When I function in unsavory ways, I use my name to bring myself back to social morality. I think this may have to do with my narcisissm, and desire for a clean reputation.If I cannot retain that, I feel subhuman. It bothers me to feel filthy. When I have a moment where I do something stupid or wrong, it makes me want to take a different name, just to avoid the shame. Does this happen to you too?. I've been waking up every day at 4 AM for about a year and a half now. I told myself it was to hear the birds chirping lously in the morning. While that may remain true, after I started doing that I read somewhere that staying up super late is the mind's attempt to take control when it feels it has little. I don't stay up late, but I think the reason for me liking waking up so early is because of the control it provides me. I beleive further that the desire for control may explain my urges to harm myself. Along with the guilt and shame, of course. I've only ever self-harmed legitimately one time. I wimped out, I couldn't force myself to press the knife hard enough to leave a scar. I'm a little upset at myself for not taking it further, partially because I want to be caught so I can receive psychological assistance without having to ask like a wimp. But too I felt I lacked the self control to properly harm myself, and that irritates me even now. I did it because of the shame and the desire for control, and all I ended with is the inability to not lie about saying I've never self-harmed, and a more intense desire than before to replace my hands. I suppose the questiong I'm getting at is: Is that a reason people hurt themselves? I did it because I hate my lying self and for the feeling of control. Why do people do it?. I have been thinking a lot, recently. To the point where trying to distract myself with games and tv isn't working. I don't feel deserving of it. Just sitting there, wasting my mind as it struggles to troubleshoot my mental issues. I stand up and I realize just how heavy I've been breathing, how angry I feel. I'm the most angry I've ever been right now. But there is nothing to blame for it. I am a victim of nothing. To nothing I can claim vengeance.Reality let's me know that nothing is wrong, at least. But that doesn't matter anymore. In reality I've no reasoning to feeling. I've got nothing in terms of purpose keeping me alive. I'm a mastermind with nothing to control. I've become a cog in my own machine, running off of nothing but hypocrisy and an insatiable desire for knowledge and control. I can feel my mind imploding, a senseless destruction in a babbling question over morality. I am not a Good Man any longer. I can hardly call myself a man at this rate. My throat is blocked, and the only thing keeping me from harm is instinct at this point. I suppose this may be the collapse you all refer to. I can't tell. Maybe this is just a burst of sychophantic insanity. I thank you all for your time. It's something you can't get back, so I sincerely hope you aren't too upset I stole it from you.The shame makes want to be a better person, and I really do want to, but I feel unable to change due to a lack of any particular discipline. Any tips?. Though it's been a couple years since, my sister has once explicitly stated me to be "unreadable" and "mysterious" in terms of my emotions and mentality. At the time, I took this as a compliment, and to an extent I still do. If people could always tell what I was thinking I would have killed myself at 12 years old. I enjoy my enigmatic properties.Still, I was wondering if any of you guys feel the same. Also, could anyone tell me the roots of these issues?. I've noticed that with the few I've ever been vulnerable with, I become terrified of the power they hold over me, and never be vulnerable again.It irks me. I can't trust them again without feeling weak. I hate feeling weak, it's emasculating.I care a lot about how I'm perceived by others. It dictates my life. If I ever have my reputation so irreversibly tarnished, I can always off myself. That makes sense, right?. I realized relatively recently that I don't say I miss people. Whether or not this is true, I cannot neither confirm or deny. However I still suspect that this may be a trait of my narcissism and fear of vulnerability. I don't even say it to my parents when they say they miss me. It doesn't quite feel right.Now, I've never pursued a romantic relationship in my life for various reasons. Mostly because I think I might be asexual.But recently I feel it may be because I know that getting a partner would not only be a confession that could be turned against me, but that I would be a horrible boyfriend. I know I'd get obsessed. I know I'd be terrified of showing the slightest bit of vulnerability, and that some point down the line I'd become paranoid and likely abusive. So I avoid it. I'm not even sure I'd enjoy it, really. Relationships are often gateways to negative public opinion. I'd rather avoid that.They're better off a friend.For a while now I've been rather obsessed with my face and hair, I love it and am proud of the way it looks, but that almost feels like an excuse to give me something to like about myself. When I think about myself mentally and emotionally, I really understand how awful I am and how bizarrely weird my thinking habits are. Mentally, I'm a disgusted and angry kid who hides behind these massive barriers I've contructed around my deeper thoughts, and managed to present myself as some sort of intellectual. Yet still I tell myself I actually love who I am? It feels like I'm just hard-coping and am unable to accept that I am a man of paranoid fragility.When I think about what love is to me, I seem to blank. It feels like I only say I love people because that's what I've always done, not because it means anything to me.That's as simple as it sounds, really. I'm a secretive person; there are many aspects of my character that I like to keep under wraps. Except some of those secrets are really just strong repressed emotions, I think. And I'd like to stop doing that. But I can't do that around others, not even my therapist!However, my logic here is telling me that if I live alone, I may learn to release those emotions. Or I'll go insane, which I'm not totally opposed to, and utter insanity must be better then this half & half shit. Still. I have family. I can't afford to leave yet. But I want to. I hate bearing this facade of a person I've become to them. It's silly, maybe stupid, which is very upsetting, but logically, living in isolation sounds amazing.Really, I've seen a couple people say shame is a defense mechanism, but I fail to see how that's true. If I feel bad for doing things that are bad, how is that bad? What else am I supposed to feel after doing something shameful?. I know that sometimes, even when I'm not telling him anything particularly important, I get this weird feeling in my throat, like everything is hot and I need to eat ice, or like I'm confessing something evil on TV. But it never is anything truly bad, in retrospect. It also feels like this ethereal pressure on your throat, if that helps explain it better.See now I've been trying to absorb more information about NPD, because I beleive I may have it. I know I'm emotionally different from others, and I really don't like tell people who I care about, even if I really do. I haven't said "I love you" to someone new in years, and the last time I did I hesitated profusely. Luckily, I doubt my brother remembered at the time, seeing as he was about 3 years old. I have major difficulty with telling others that I care about them, or anything personal, for fear that they may take advantage of that fact. I'm trying to learn more about myself, so if you know about anything in this regard then I'd love to hear it.In truth, I cannot trustGetting angry at their lust.It isn't normal for me to hateSo I leave in frustrate.It isn't for any good reasonThat I can't stand their lives.From terrible poisonous treason,I cast myself from their hivesThey loved & accepted me, For who and what I am.But my hatred had not taken leave,So I distanced myself from them.They deserve better than meThat man who can't trust whom loves him. They deserve someone who'll beThat man who they trust and comfide inThey deserve my perfectionAll my trust and affectionBut within I'm conflictedLonesomeness self-afflicted.Real neat stuff. Sorry for begging but I think it would look good.
    Zu dem Kind in mir, das kleine 5-jährige verwirrte Mädchen was aus all dem scheiss Streit und dem rumschreien und den Drogen und allem anderen keinen Sinn tun kann: Es tut mir Leid. Du denkst dass das ganze scheiss streiten total sinnlos ist und wünschst es wäre anders. Tut mir Leid man. Tut mir Leid dass ich so bin, und dass die anderen so sind, und dass wir ständig Streit und Stress und Konflikte und Drama verursachen was du alles total sinnlos findest und was dir Angst macht. Tut mir Leid. Ich wünschte es wäre anders. Wir schaffen das. Wir kommen dadurch. Fuck. Tut mir Leid man. 🫂. I feel like something’s not right with my body I need to get to a doctor ASAP ugh :((( I can only go in 2 days tho >.< fuuuuuckkkI don’t wanna die. I rlly fucking don’t My lymph nodes in my throat are swollen for weeks now with on-and-off feelings of sickness or as if I’m catching a cold, and my legs randomly hurt as if I have varicose veins or some shit I don’t wanna have a stroke fuck 😭😭 and I feel kinda sick today without knowing why and just now had a dizzy spell 😭😭😭😭 pls someone help me I don’t wanna die Idk if it’s psychosomatic either, or if I’m in danger man fuck,,,,. Had an okay-ish day, rn I’m in dissociation land but someone in our head just had the idea “hey why not just randomly take some acid and fucking staying up all night so we won’t study tomorrow wooh!! 🥳🥳” guess we won’t do it tho. And also to have an ECG done and to get checked out to make sure my health is ok My primary care doctor sucks I rlly gotta fucking switch himPanic attack (??) again Feeling as if I can’t breathe , fear about my heart being wrong somehowFuuuck 😭. God it’s so fucking obvious. God how the fuck did I not notice this earlier?!I run around all the time and I never stop and I’m never calm because I wanna feel alive. I’m in the city every single day going to some restaurant (or not) being shallow as fuck or fucking up my sleeping rhythm 3 times a week by deliberately leaving the house again at 11 pm so I can randomly drive somewhere with the tram or take a 3 hour long walk or go to a strip club or bar or visit a friend in the middle of the night and do drugs with him and fuck up my academic life and success cuz I’ll come out of it with eye bags of death and unwashed hair and sweaty shirts because I wanna feel *fucking alive*. I’m depressed and that’s why I wanna feel alive because I fucking hate depression and this state of being in a foggy swamp not being able to see or do shit like almost nothing else. Because I can’t fucking stand or tolerate in myself and others this soggy foggy swampy nothingness itch like of being a depressed slouch and not doing shit all day. That’s why I *need* to run around all the fucking time and never stop and never take a break and never process. Just take in take in take in.But it’s all fucking shallow anyway. It’s all just depression in reverse, it doesn’t give me anything, it doesn’t give me any deep feelings or deep talks or deep realizations, I’m just as fucking depressed as I would be if I’d just lay in bed all day doing nothing. Nothing real gets thru to me until……until I take it to an extreme. Until I go to my local BDSM munch and let them beat the shit out of me. Until I go see a play in the theatre that really touches me and makes me sob in the middle of the theatre. Until I do new or more drugs that finally make me fucking *feel* something and that finally make me feel *alive*. Just to finally have this moment again where this fucking pressure drops off of me and I can breathe freely again. Just for a few moments, a minute, an hour, a few seconds.It’s pretty ironic isn’t it? Doing all this shit just to feel something whilst I would feel *the most* if I were to just fucking sit down with my feelings and finally take a break and finally start to process all this shit I’ve done in the past few, idk, weeks, months, years? If I were to just stop running and taking in and numbing myself. Hahah but that’s what I want isn’t it?No it’s not really. Ugh. I’m ashamed and I’m scared. I’m scared of all this shit that will come crashing down on me if I finally sit down and breathe. Im ashamed of myself for never sitting down and breathing and fucking *listening* to whatever my brain is trying to tell me. I’m fucking terrified of my own feelings and my own parts and everything that will eventually break down and crush (crash down on?) me. Even though that would be the safest bet to finally feel alive.. Didn’t think I’d come to this point ever again cuz clearly we are the most recovered and most healed fuck out there 😎 but I think our eating disorder is srsly flairing up again. For real this time lol. We keep saying this every half a year or so but yeah idk. We’re eating less on semi-purpose and we’re using food as a sort of reward thing - if we don’t eat that’s great, that means we can deprave ourselves of food and energy AND get thin and “reward” us later on with nice food after a while. That’s the addicting factor I think Plus the ego boost we used to get from it. Rlly it was a great fucking source of supply and honestly I think the ED was also partially “symptom” of our “outlet” for our narcissism Did any of y’all have EDs? I think it goes very fucking well with NPD just like beer and beer glass or wine and meat or coke and alcohol or tea and hot water go together lol. Everything is so far away even my/our anger 🤬🤬😡😡I fucking hate this shit omgomgomg ahhhhh dlflekekAll just cuz we suppressed our fucking feelings for too long omg I hate thisvstatebughhhh This motherfucking BITCH this PIECE OF SHIT I fucking hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him 😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🙅🙅❌❌❌I can feel several ppl being close to front but also like. Ugh fuuuuck over everything is just this dumbass stupid fucking blank canvas layer 🤬🤬😡😡. Empty rage. This fucking empty rage It feels so empty itchy and antsy and I’m so scratchy and tense and just never calm, never quiet, just wanna run around bc I’m never calm or quiet I rage and I get mad and everything is shit and everyone wants to harm me or do me bad and I rage and rage but it’s never enough !! It’s never enough rage. It’s just so empty. Like a bloody red black void with blood dripping from the walls like tar And the others in my head told me “Kal, look into it, there’s something behind this rage. The void is full and filled to the brim with emotions and yourself. What do you feel behind it, what is it?” And I’m like “fuck you don’t tell me what to do” but also like fuck man, shit they’re right.The empty rage is never full bc it’s itchy antsy shame behind, and feelings of betrayal abandonment and fear and sadness and grief How do I get to those feelings, how tf do I feel themI keep running around never being satisfied and just filled to the brim with this fucking empty rage. I never feel anything else unless after days of struggle where I desperately wanna have other feelings and nothing works until some trigger hits me and I can finally cry and it feels almost orgasmic, so much relief. Fuck you all and your fucking momma you dumb ass cunt bitchy shitty fucking motherfuckers pieces of absolute utter trash and garbage!! 🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻Omfg I hate ppl so fucking much. If those bunches of whiny ass babies can’t fucking take what I’m saying then THATS NOT NY FUCKING FAULT!!! Wtf is WRONG with those dumb cunt suckers!!?????? I fucking hate them dude wtf. DISCLAIMER: No literal asses got kicked. It’s just metaphorical. I have my people for kicking my ass ;) bitch-boy is not one of em There is some weird ass dude in our classes that everyone knows cuz he’s just the strangest fucking weirdo you could’ve seen in a while. Paranoid as hell, vulnerable narcissistic, bitter and envious and passive aggressive as fuck and diagnosed autistic as disability. Oh and unaware as fuck. He recently joined our study WhatsApp group. I texted with him for two fucking days and he just fascinated me cuz he was a paranoid, mentally sick fucked in the head fuck that reminded me so much of my younger self that I started liking him even though I looked down on him and thought he was pathetic as all fucking _hell_. I opened up to him more than I had probably with all others I know in my current Uni lectures, told him I have DID and shit. We talked about mental health shit and at first he thanked me for talking to him so he “wouldn’t have to cry in his pillow at night anymore” and then he fucking blocked me because I let out some alters that were patronizing and belittling but also directly telling him to the face what’s going on with his mental health bullshit. He didn’t fucking like that, cuz the shit I’m telling people stings, even tho its true. And THEN, a day later, he covertly shit-talks me behind my fucking back in some lecture as I just found out and I was fucking INFURIATED AND BURNING WITH HATRED. Oh my god it makes me so mad. And sad. It reminds me of my fucking school days were I got bullied and constantly shit talked about. I feel fucking betrayed and if I see this little bitch irl tomorrow I’m gonna tell him to his fucking face that he should directly face and talk to me, instead of blocking me, excusing all of it with some covert “ohhh I’m too sensitive and I’m sorryyyy, I can’t keep talking to you anymoreeew 🥺🥺🥺” and then FUCKING SHIT TALKING ME BEHIND MY BACK TO MY FRIENDS. I hate this fucking little bitch oh my god Is this rlly what I’ll fucking get for opening up to someone?? Holy fuck I feel so betrayed man Edit: also I should specify that this little bitch is looked down upon by most ppl due to how weird he is. So my image shouldn’t be too broken but srsly man, fuck this dumbass piece of shit motherfucker. It’s a breath of fresh air. We’re nasty disgusting bastard dickheads that stab each other in the back at every opportunity but like… we also get each other. Like no one else probably. And like. I feel at home here. I feel accepted and understood and it’s just nice I just had an argument with my mom where I first raged and was mad as hell and then eventually ended up crying and I kinda partially got thru her defenses and at some point I told her all I want is just a mom or well… *someone* who gets me. Who listens to me and who accepts me and understands meAnd we (me and the headmates) feel better now cuz we at least got some of that shit off our chest And yeah I just wanted to say thanks. We love this community for what it is, fuck man You can be yourself around here and be heard and seen and understood and I wish for us to keep being the backstabbing cheating lying and painfully empathic bastards we are ~~(and maybe heal a bit more on the way)~~Edit: and it feels soooo wrong to tag this shit as “upbeat talk” lmaooo I wish I would’ve tagged it as “venting” just to fucking mess around. Ugh idk I’ve been scared of shit being wrong w my heart all day now Ever since this stupid dumbass K event at the party on Saturday I feel like there’s smth wrong w my heart and I’m terrified terrified terrified ugghhhAlso my blood pressure been too low all day I’m. Scared. Waking up in the middle of the night thinking you’re gonna die is just fucking awesome. Mhhh yeah love that,. Nothing better than this shit Forgot how fun this is cuz we haven’t had it in a while 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥. And they can go fuck off 🤬🤬 everybody !! Dumb fucks 😡😡🤬🤬 pieces of fucking shit garbage dumb trash can fucker. I’ve done like 2 lines of K at a party yesterday night, and after the second line I‘ve started having arrhythmia/an irregular heartbeat (blood measuring thing confirmed that) which lasted for like, hours, and only went away after I slept. :/Can K cause arrhythmia? It was scary as fuck and I didn’t know what to do about it except „sitting (sleeping) it out“. Getting a heart disease is like my worst fear health-wise lmao. Is there anything you can do about it??. Like seriously man, fuck them. 😞☹️😕😞Tired of those I want real human connection, I want warmth and compassion and affection Fuck this shit, don’t wanna anymore. Nope I’m outta here. I feel depressed. I feel sad. I wanna cry and I have this weird fucking feeling stuck up my throat I‘m tired of all this mental health bullshit. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why on God‘s fucking earth was I blessed with so many shitty fucking things? Idk I wanna hug my inner child and I have no fucking idea how to deal with them. Fuck. They’re scared all the time and always have these „nightmares“ which are flashbacks, and they’re constantly stuck in there. Idfk how to deal with them and I wanna tell them that everything is okay Idk why I have so much chaos and drama in my life. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why the fuck can’t I be stable? Why the fuck can‘t I have any more goddamn fucking order in here than anybody else? Idk I don’t understand Why do I have to let myself get beat up and run after weird psychopath men and fuck up my goddamn Uni career and constantly be a fucking. Goddamn. hindrance in my own fucking way?? I don’t want this anymore. And even tho the Flair says „Venting - No Advice Request“ (I rlly don’t like how caged this dumb flair tag makes me feel - what do you mean I can’t vent anymore without having some advice? What happened to the good ol wild r/NPD territory?🤬🤬 Is this lawful country now? Is this „stick up your ass“ land now or what?) if anybody can look thru my bullshit by all means - do it! But only if I respect you lmao But yeah idk everybody whom I even get remotely close to just keeps telling me how very fucking ✨✨special✨✨ I am Maybe I am! I mean who the fuck knows! Maybe I am indeed very fucking special and everyone who says otherwise can go fuck themselves with a pizza up their ass bro.

And it’s the most narcy apology I’ve ever read lmaoo “I’m sorry for having overwhelmed you with my expectations that we’re too high, and it overwhelmed *especially* you”, like wtf lmaooo I don’t even feel that mad tho. Just kinda a mix of disappointed, betrayed, a bit angry, and also grandiose weirdly enough, sickly sweet taste of “he’s thinking abt me, he desires me, he wanted to apologize”And also I want someone to help me make sense of all of this and I wanna shit talk hun to everyone and at the same time not Ugh I’ll have to wait and ponder a few days before I answer him.

Fuck you. Fuck you all. I’m cold and angry and bitter and envious and frustrated. And fed up.Just because this dumb fucking ego is standing in my goddamn way all the time. I screw shit up constantly. I’m ready for something else, ready for change. Ready for facing all the crap and bullshit and dumbfuck garbage that’s stuck up my butt and my head like a fucking buttplug reaching to the goddamn moon.And you’ll have to deal with this crap. I’m good, I’m better than everyone in this entire fucking world, and I suck and I’m shit and a dumb mean nasty sadistic narcissistic bitch.I’m also warm and kind and giving and hopeful sometimes. I’m hot and cold like an alternating hot-cold-shower and I’m green and violet and black and red and blue and full of frustration and bitterness and anger.Hurting people and loving them is the same side of the coin, whatever dude. Fuck Reddit, fuck everything, fuck the entire world so you’ve at least done something *useful*. So you’ve at least been useful. The least fucking shit you can do, for me.Of course it’s all for me and I fucking hate you and I put myself above you because *clearly* I’m fucking better than you, and *clearly* I know better and you’re a fucking piece of shit. But really, I’m angry about myself and frustrated and bitter and envious because I can’t fucking deal with shit and fuck things up. But I’m not gonna succumb into this trashhole of a garbage dumpster fire self pity again. I’m fed up and fucked up. Screw you, fuck you, do something, just do *something*. Don’t care what it is, just do *something*.And then I’ll make a deal with God and sell my soul so I can burn in the entire hell pit of fiery hot soul-bonding sound-fucking ass-bending eternity, and burn this fucking place down and take it all with me.Until I wake up in the morning and see it’s all been the fucking same again, and always has been. Fuck you.Idfk what it is but I’m full of rage and contempt and envy ugh Just make these dumbass feelings stop omg. It’s funnnnn I had bugs crawling in my food and saw the shadow people :D I love it I’m having fun 💕. Just talked to this one fucking Uni prof that I liked and now I’m so fucking pissed at him like how the FUCK has this guy the audacity to fucking tell me what to do and covertly be all like „I think you shouldn’t ask whether you’ve made a mistake so often“ wtf man fuck you bitch 😡😡🤬🤬🤬🖕🏻 I’ll ask whatever the fuck *I* want nothing and nobod fucking ELSE has the mere fucking RIGHT to tell me what to do GOD this bitch is so fucking entitled like what the fucking hell man fuck yooouuuuu 😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬🤬🤬🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻😤😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻“Guys guys maybe we should like ease up on ourselves for having fucking put ourselves below him and for let to me us get caught in a corner again. I know your angry at yourself Kal, maybe we should just ease up”. why tf does SOMEONE ELSE always get me into this mess where i like have to pretend to give a shit about others. cuz i fucking don't. like just leave me alone with this bullshit lmao. motherfucker. bitch. piece of shit (ok Kal)and also why the fuck is everybody always SO FUCKING UPTIGHT?? like, everyone's just got a fucking STICK up their ass that reaches to the fucking MOON baybeee. Why the fuck do those fuckers always want ME to give a shit about THEM? Like, wtf? Nope, not me, I’m not gonna care about them bitches, screw them Why do *I* always have to fix everybody and everything?? Fuck you, not gonna do that anymore, it’s exhausting and tiring and feels fake af and I don’t wanna do it, screw yooouuu 😤😤🙅❌. I’m a people-collector. I collect people like others collect stamps or lighters (I actually collect lighters too). I went to a jazz bar yesterday evening and had like two drinks and I was tired as fuck and lowkey felt weird and strange and tense and I listened to the concert those people played and this made me happy and then afterwards I talked to one of the musicians, the bartender, a random girl my age and a random gay dude I met there and who seemed similar to me (they all did) and with whom I exchanged numbers in the end.I barely fucking remember this evening and I felt like another person was at that bar entertaining people listening to music and just generally being there and… existing.I told these people I’m very fucking good at getting to know new people and very fucking bad at keeping contact. This makes me run around irritable as fuck all the time and collect new people constantly. I always want more more more and the new shiny thing I just got two weeks ago isn’t new and shiny anymore and I don’t wanna play with it anymore. The glow has faded and it’s stale and boring now. Kinda. Mostly. After getting to know someone just a little bit better or after having broken their shell.All I want and care about is these people and new shiny toys liking me. I care about you as long as I haven’t gotten thru your shell and as long as you don’t like me but I’m interested in you and I wanna make you like me. If I succeed at that, you’re boring and I wanna go look out for new people and new shiny toys.It’s like. I feel like I’m at a funfair doing a carnival game, in one of those stands where you can shoot those little porcelain stars and depending on how many you’ll get, you’ll get a price. All I care about is shooting as many as possible and getting better at that game and then if I aim and shoot a star and it’s broken, that’s my supply and my praise and validation. The more, the better. The less, the more I wanna get better and be able to hit all of those exact 20 shots next time. The price is you and the price isn’t really interesting to me. The activity is much more fun and the activity is getting to know more people and charming them and making them like me. *Especially* if they’re a challenge and don’t like me at first or they don’t admit they like me. That’s the most fun thing. That’s shooting even tinier porcelain stars which makes it a lot harder but also more fun. (Those fucking dismissive-avoidants 😒😗🙄) I like that. Finally, if I’ve succeeded, I just move on. People are exciting and fascinating and they give me highs and lows and some of them do it *so well* I can’t fucking stop anymore. It’s like an addiction.Idk where I was going with this anymore so I’ll just keep it at this. And I didn’t wanna do it at all in the first place but then I kinda succumbed to it and decided fuck it, why the fuck not. Writing it down so I’ll remember So we had like this piece of rope laid out on the ground and I imagined myself as now and I started crying and then I walked towards the end of the rope with my therapist and imagined myself in 5 years from now. I felt very fucking embarrassed about it and felt blocked doing this shit but somehow still did it Imagined future where I’m living in apartment with cat and maybe partner surrounded by plants working full-time-job in IT and I’m just… calm. I’m comfortable with myself. It was nice and interesting. Because I know I have it in me. This calmness and the ability to heal But the 5 years in between were a tumultuous and chaotic trouble but it’s just.. nice knowing I have this in me man. Ugh idk. It’s just so fucking frustrating. Like, I study maths and a lot of my peers are shy introverted dorks with low self esteem that never really have opinion on shit and just do whatever the fuck you tell them to do. It’s so frustrating and infuriating. I’m someone who has strong opinions on things and who’s loud about them and tells them to people if they ask. For example we’re in a group of 5 people and wanna go grab lunch. Which canteen do we wanna go to? I say: Well, canteen X cuz I think they have Y and I like this and it’s tasty. *Literally nobody fucking else has an opinion* so we just do whatever the fuck I told them to do. It’s so fucking weird because isn’t this what I always want?? Leading people and them doing whatever tf I want them to do?? But it just gives me this weird icky suspicious as hell shame feeling inside. „Like, am I really the only one who has an opinion on this? Why the fuck do they do as I say? I feel ashamed of myself, I don’t wanna run all over them. Am I too dominant? Too loud?“ etc Like, here’s the thing. I still wanna be friends with some of them cuz I like them and some are quite interesting and I just. Don’t wanna end up abusing everybody all the time and being toxic as fuck and running all over them cuz I genuinely wanna get better. But like. HOW THE FUCK DO I DO THIS IF THEY JUST LITERALLY *PROVOKE* ME TO BE THIS WAY AND RUN ALL OVER THEM CUZ THEY DON‘T HAVE AN OPINION ON ANYTHING AND JUST DO AS I SAY ALL THE FUCKING TIME?? 😭😭😭How do you *behave* around ppl like this???It’s like, what the fuck do you want me to SAY, should I just *also* not have an opinion on shit?? So nobody’s taking the leash here?? Or should I just be fine with this?? I’m not fine with it! Just… say SOMETHING MAN!I kinda wanna tickle out their personalities and their opinions on shit but ahhhh idk how to handle stuff like this.Dad, I wish you could read this. I miss you. I’ve figured out a lot since your death and I’ve worked thru even more of fucked up things. (Actually making myself this vulnerable makes me feel sick and I lowkey feel disgusted with myself but whatever.) I’ve loved, hated, been heartbroken, fucked up, betrayed, succeeded, did some things that probably would’ve made you proud and some things you probably would despise and hate and harshly judge me for. I’m listening to my songs from the 70s/80s/90s playlist rn and fuck I think I might start crying. You would’ve loved those. You couldn’t show me how proud you are, Mom is probably right with this. Or you showed it in your own way, idk. I used to have a fuck ton of anger and hatred and contempt for you but actually… I understand you now. A bit better. A lot maybe idk. I miss you. I want you back. But you’re gone. (Rn “One Night in Bangkok” by Murray Head is up. I know you liked this song.)I’m not your little daughter/son/kid anymore that wants to make you proud and is driven by spite and hatred for you and an obsession I didn’t recognize up until lately. I’ve grown up and I’ve seen things and I’ve lived thru a ton of crap in my short life so far. I know you probably still live on in my head somewhere as an Introject, idk maybe (thanks Mud?). And I get you now more than ever before I think. I wish we could’ve made up before you died. Remember that one phone call we had? Where I made you sob? I felt fucking terrified and angry as fuck and powerful as fuck afterwards. I had hope and I thought it was completely pointless to talk to you about all this. I thought “Man, we’re never gonna talk about all this crap that happened”, but I also thought “God, holy shit. That was something new. That was good. Fuck. I feel hopeful. I know we have to talk this thru somewhen. I wanna pity you but I’m not gonna do that cuz FUCK YOU!” and I had my fists up again. I thought you were the end boss and I thought if I could beat you, I could beat anything and everything in the fucking entire goddamn world. I really believed that, like goddamn man. Now I know much more. You live on in myself and my memories and in other people and in lovers and therapists and friends and inanimate objects and events to come. Man I wish I could hug you. I miss you a lot. I love you. I think. Idk man. I don’t know. You’re not the end boss. Well not anymore. Maybe somewhere still, inside, idk. I’ve faced you before, thru myself and thru others.You’re just, like, my Dad. A confused and traumatized old man (thanks u/PoosPapa) who’s lived thru a lot of bullshit (just like me) and wanted to make things better than your father did, I know you wanted to. I know you fucking hated him and despised the shit out of him and he fucked you up real good. Fuck man. It runs in the family huh?Hell I never could’ve said this shit if you were still alive. God knows where the fuck we would be now if you still lived. Man. Fuck you Dad. But also I love you. What the fuck is it always with this fucking narcy thing about admitting love only ever after you don’t have anymore what you love? 🥲 If you hold it in your hands you fucking hate it and throw it away like a hot hard boiled egg you just grabbed straight outta the pot, and if it’s gone you might finally acknowledge shit and miss what you just had. Anyways, Dad. I love you. And I fucking hate you. And screw you man, you stupid bitchass dumbfuck cockroach eating trashcan motherfucker. But also I miss you.And well uh…I’m just like you.We had a flashback or more like, our little had it. Damn I feel so sorry for them and I sat down and told them what u/Emotional-Climate777 told us they do with their littles which is: we told them it’s all just a movie playing and we can make it move faster or slower or make the voices all high pitched and sound funny or turn everybody into colorful plushies and make it all funny and ridiculous.Flashback was something very heavy, probably vaulting box like you have in gym class during high school (?) being pressed into out rib cage and felt like dying. Couldn’t breathe. Though we’ll die. Cried and called for help but nobody came Up until later someone rescued us. Thought we’re dying Have trauma around having sudden heavy “sharp” “pressing against chest” feeling which we sometimes got and thought we were dying and getting a heart attack. Dying Could never get behind this feeling until now Comforted little, tried to ground them and then Gabriel came around and calmed themHe told them they can always call out for him if they’re in trouble and we told them we love them and we’ll always be there for them and we won’t, WON’T let it happen that someone hurts them. If someone should ever hurt them we’re so gonna kick their fucking bitchy ass 😡🤬😤Now sitting in the care being itchy and antsy uncomfortable af irritable and idk what to do abt it. Maybe too much coffee maybe someone not doing well idk can’t get thru to them.you’re the spoiled golden child, the little chick getting everything and everybody she’s ever wanted Having more money really suits me I can buy whatever pretty outfits and dresses and all that shit I ever wanted. Fuck yeah it’s amazing Like others hold me back from spending too much money cuz we shouldn’t use it all up and ppl b getting mad at me for spending hundreds of euros but idc some of it allow it But being the spoiled little baby girl golden child is really nice 😌I wanna be the prettiest, the sexiest, the hottest. We just bought some new outfit and got complimented as “outfit of the day” by an employee and damn it just made us feel so fucking amazing.Spoiled little baby girl that gets spoiled with everything she ever wants and deserves All I need and want and deserve cuz I simply just fucking deserve it Spoiled little bitch baby girl getting her needs met Golden child, golden girl getting satisfied and all her wishes fulfilled Having more money really suits us/me, damn Can get and buy whatever the fuck I wanted and always wished for Nice 😌 love it love it I want more of it and I never want it to stop I wanna wear ALL the pretty outfits and dresses and be a spoiled little golden baby girl chick and hot and amazing and justYeah 😌☺️. I feel like I’m losing it and someday I’m just gonna fucking snap and explode and tear down everything I’ve ever known and loved and take it with me onto an endless spiral of doom. Why always patronizing Why always demonizing Why always belittling others and why always being on top of everything It’s tiring it’s tiring why the fuck should I always do those things it’s so pointless to me so fucking pointless Why not just simply stop doing this bullshit Why always arguing and having conflicts and doing whatever IdkWhy always that and this and that. What the fuck man. Get the goddamn stick outta your ass you fucking bitches. Why in the FUCK and why on heaven’s earth do these fuckers think I’m larping? Yeah I’m having sooo much fun having NPD and DID and I think it’s fucking amazing woohoo!! 🥳 🥳 If someone could present me with a viable reason as to why I should be “larping” having mental disorder then fine, go ahead and tell me! Give me logical reasons as to why I think I’m fucking doing that shit. Bugger off you dumbass fucking bitches If you can’t deal with the way I literally am then that’s not my goddamn fault So I’m larping and playing a role, so what? Nothing is real anyway, have fun with your fucking projection you fucking bitches 😂🤣. Right now i feel like im me and myself like im normal and just me. I feel like ive always been that way and always will be. But when were switching we feel so unstable and mostly when we havent fully switched we're a mould and a mix of several different people at once. Idk whats goibg on its confueing im confused. Yeah I need to bring back order into this system. Like wtf man. Everyone’s having beef with each other like some sour grapes. That’s complete bullshit cuz I KNOW y’all can do better. Just posting here for the others to see. I think us spending so much time on Reddit and the internet is bullshit cuz we really gotta get our goddamn shit together lol. Don’t need supply from this pathetic ass platform, we gotta focus on ourselves. Working on bringing everyone together again.I realized I had FUN with my death anxiety and actually LOVED IT like oh my GOD dude Reminder to self to make post abt it later. If I die right here and right now then so be it. (Except I don’t wanna die lmao fuck lol) I just accept things as they are I’ll have a heck of a bad time if I resist against the experience, even if the experience is… dying Fuck you death, I’m ready for you. Here it comes 💀.
    Zu dem Kind in mir, das kleine 5-jährige verwirrte Mädchen was aus all dem scheiss Streit und dem rumschreien und den Drogen und allem anderen keinen Sinn tun kann: Es tut mir Leid. Du denkst dass das ganze scheiss streiten total sinnlos ist und wünschst es wäre anders. Tut mir Leid man. Tut mir Leid dass ich so bin, und dass die anderen so sind, und dass wir ständig Streit und Stress und Konflikte und Drama verursachen was du alles total sinnlos findest und was dir Angst macht. Tut mir Leid. Ich wünschte es wäre anders. Wir schaffen das. Wir kommen dadurch. Fuck. Tut mir Leid man. 🫂. I feel like something’s not right with my body I need to get to a doctor ASAP ugh :((( I can only go in 2 days tho >.< fuuuuuckkkI don’t wanna die.

And also to have an ECG done and to get checked out to make sure my health is ok My primary care doctor sucks I rlly gotta fucking switch himPanic attack (??) again Feeling as if I can’t breathe , fear about my heart being wrong somehowFuuuck 😭. God it’s so fucking obvious. God how the fuck did I not notice this earlier?!I run around all the time and I never stop and I’m never calm because I wanna feel alive. I’m in the city every single day going to some restaurant (or not) being shallow as fuck or fucking up my sleeping rhythm 3 times a week by deliberately leaving the house again at 11 pm so I can randomly drive somewhere with the tram or take a 3 hour long walk or go to a strip club or bar or visit a friend in the middle of the night and do drugs with him and fuck up my academic life and success cuz I’ll come out of it with eye bags of death and unwashed hair and sweaty shirts because I wanna feel *fucking alive*. I’m depressed and that’s why I wanna feel alive because I fucking hate depression and this state of being in a foggy swamp not being able to see or do shit like almost nothing else. Because I can’t fucking stand or tolerate in myself and others this soggy foggy swampy nothingness itch like of being a depressed slouch and not doing shit all day. That’s why I *need* to run around all the fucking time and never stop and never take a break and never process. Just take in take in take in.But it’s all fucking shallow anyway. It’s all just depression in reverse, it doesn’t give me anything, it doesn’t give me any deep feelings or deep talks or deep realizations, I’m just as fucking depressed as I would be if I’d just lay in bed all day doing nothing. Nothing real gets thru to me until……until I take it to an extreme. Until I go to my local BDSM munch and let them beat the shit out of me. Until I go see a play in the theatre that really touches me and makes me sob in the middle of the theatre. Until I do new or more drugs that finally make me fucking *feel* something and that finally make me feel *alive*. Just to finally have this moment again where this fucking pressure drops off of me and I can breathe freely again. Just for a few moments, a minute, an hour, a few seconds.It’s pretty ironic isn’t it? Doing all this shit just to feel something whilst I would feel *the most* if I were to just fucking sit down with my feelings and finally take a break and finally start to process all this shit I’ve done in the past few, idk, weeks, months, years? If I were to just stop running and taking in and numbing myself. Hahah but that’s what I want isn’t it?No it’s not really. Ugh. I’m ashamed and I’m scared. I’m scared of all this shit that will come crashing down on me if I finally sit down and breathe. Im ashamed of myself for never sitting down and breathing and fucking *listening* to whatever my brain is trying to tell me. I’m fucking terrified of my own feelings and my own parts and everything that will eventually break down and crush (crash down on?) me. Even though that would be the safest bet to finally feel alive.. Didn’t think I’d come to this point ever again cuz clearly we are the most recovered and most healed fuck out there 😎 but I think our eating disorder is srsly flairing up again. For real this time lol. We keep saying this every half a year or so but yeah idk. We’re eating less on semi-purpose and we’re using food as a sort of reward thing - if we don’t eat that’s great, that means we can deprave ourselves of food and energy AND get thin and “reward” us later on with nice food after a while. That’s the addicting factor I think Plus the ego boost we used to get from it. Rlly it was a great fucking source of supply and honestly I think the ED was also partially “symptom” of our “outlet” for our narcissism Did any of y’all have EDs? I think it goes very fucking well with NPD just like beer and beer glass or wine and meat or coke and alcohol or tea and hot water go together lol. Everything is so far away even my/our anger 🤬🤬😡😡I fucking hate this shit omgomgomg ahhhhh dlflekekAll just cuz we suppressed our fucking feelings for too long omg I hate thisvstatebughhhh This motherfucking BITCH this PIECE OF SHIT I fucking hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him 😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🙅🙅❌❌❌I can feel several ppl being close to front but also like. Ugh fuuuuck over everything is just this dumbass stupid fucking blank canvas layer 🤬🤬😡😡. Empty rage. This fucking empty rage It feels so empty itchy and antsy and I’m so scratchy and tense and just never calm, never quiet, just wanna run around bc I’m never calm or quiet I rage and I get mad and everything is shit and everyone wants to harm me or do me bad and I rage and rage but it’s never enough !! It’s never enough rage. It’s just so empty. Like a bloody red black void with blood dripping from the walls like tar And the others in my head told me “Kal, look into it, there’s something behind this rage. The void is full and filled to the brim with emotions and yourself. What do you feel behind it, what is it?” And I’m like “fuck you don’t tell me what to do” but also like fuck man, shit they’re right.The empty rage is never full bc it’s itchy antsy shame behind, and feelings of betrayal abandonment and fear and sadness and grief How do I get to those feelings, how tf do I feel themI keep running around never being satisfied and just filled to the brim with this fucking empty rage. I never feel anything else unless after days of struggle where I desperately wanna have other feelings and nothing works until some trigger hits me and I can finally cry and it feels almost orgasmic, so much relief. Fuck you all and your fucking momma you dumb ass cunt bitchy shitty fucking motherfuckers pieces of absolute utter trash and garbage!! 🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻Omfg I hate ppl so fucking much. If those bunches of whiny ass babies can’t fucking take what I’m saying then THATS NOT NY FUCKING FAULT!!! Wtf is WRONG with those dumb cunt suckers!!?????? I fucking hate them dude wtf. DISCLAIMER: No literal asses got kicked. It’s just metaphorical. I have my people for kicking my ass ;) bitch-boy is not one of em There is some weird ass dude in our classes that everyone knows cuz he’s just the strangest fucking weirdo you could’ve seen in a while. Paranoid as hell, vulnerable narcissistic, bitter and envious and passive aggressive as fuck and diagnosed autistic as disability. Oh and unaware as fuck. He recently joined our study WhatsApp group. I texted with him for two fucking days and he just fascinated me cuz he was a paranoid, mentally sick fucked in the head fuck that reminded me so much of my younger self that I started liking him even though I looked down on him and thought he was pathetic as all fucking _hell_. I opened up to him more than I had probably with all others I know in my current Uni lectures, told him I have DID and shit. We talked about mental health shit and at first he thanked me for talking to him so he “wouldn’t have to cry in his pillow at night anymore” and then he fucking blocked me because I let out some alters that were patronizing and belittling but also directly telling him to the face what’s going on with his mental health bullshit. He didn’t fucking like that, cuz the shit I’m telling people stings, even tho its true. And THEN, a day later, he covertly shit-talks me behind my fucking back in some lecture as I just found out and I was fucking INFURIATED AND BURNING WITH HATRED. Oh my god it makes me so mad. And sad. It reminds me of my fucking school days were I got bullied and constantly shit talked about. I feel fucking betrayed and if I see this little bitch irl tomorrow I’m gonna tell him to his fucking face that he should directly face and talk to me, instead of blocking me, excusing all of it with some covert “ohhh I’m too sensitive and I’m sorryyyy, I can’t keep talking to you anymoreeew 🥺🥺🥺” and then FUCKING SHIT TALKING ME BEHIND MY BACK TO MY FRIENDS. I hate this fucking little bitch oh my god Is this rlly what I’ll fucking get for opening up to someone?? Holy fuck I feel so betrayed man Edit: also I should specify that this little bitch is looked down upon by most ppl due to how weird he is. So my image shouldn’t be too broken but srsly man, fuck this dumbass piece of shit motherfucker. It’s a breath of fresh air. We’re nasty disgusting bastard dickheads that stab each other in the back at every opportunity but like… we also get each other. Like no one else probably. And like. I feel at home here. I feel accepted and understood and it’s just nice I just had an argument with my mom where I first raged and was mad as hell and then eventually ended up crying and I kinda partially got thru her defenses and at some point I told her all I want is just a mom or well… *someone* who gets me. Who listens to me and who accepts me and understands meAnd we (me and the headmates) feel better now cuz we at least got some of that shit off our chest And yeah I just wanted to say thanks. We love this community for what it is, fuck man You can be yourself around here and be heard and seen and understood and I wish for us to keep being the backstabbing cheating lying and painfully empathic bastards we are ~~(and maybe heal a bit more on the way)~~Edit: and it feels soooo wrong to tag this shit as “upbeat talk” lmaooo I wish I would’ve tagged it as “venting” just to fucking mess around. Ugh idk I’ve been scared of shit being wrong w my heart all day now Ever since this stupid dumbass K event at the party on Saturday I feel like there’s smth wrong w my heart and I’m terrified terrified terrified ugghhhAlso my blood pressure been too low all day I’m. Scared. Waking up in the middle of the night thinking you’re gonna die is just fucking awesome. Mhhh yeah love that,. Nothing better than this shit Forgot how fun this is cuz we haven’t had it in a while 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥. And they can go fuck off 🤬🤬 everybody !! Dumb fucks 😡😡🤬🤬 pieces of fucking shit garbage dumb trash can fucker. I’ve done like 2 lines of K at a party yesterday night, and after the second line I‘ve started having arrhythmia/an irregular heartbeat (blood measuring thing confirmed that) which lasted for like, hours, and only went away after I slept. :/Can K cause arrhythmia? It was scary as fuck and I didn’t know what to do about it except „sitting (sleeping) it out“. Getting a heart disease is like my worst fear health-wise lmao. Is there anything you can do about it??. Like seriously man, fuck them. 😞☹️😕😞Tired of those I want real human connection, I want warmth and compassion and affection Fuck this shit, don’t wanna anymore. Nope I’m outta here. I feel depressed. I feel sad. I wanna cry and I have this weird fucking feeling stuck up my throat I‘m tired of all this mental health bullshit. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why on God‘s fucking earth was I blessed with so many shitty fucking things? Idk I wanna hug my inner child and I have no fucking idea how to deal with them. Fuck. They’re scared all the time and always have these „nightmares“ which are flashbacks, and they’re constantly stuck in there. Idfk how to deal with them and I wanna tell them that everything is okay Idk why I have so much chaos and drama in my life. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why the fuck can’t I be stable? Why the fuck can‘t I have any more goddamn fucking order in here than anybody else? Idk I don’t understand Why do I have to let myself get beat up and run after weird psychopath men and fuck up my goddamn Uni career and constantly be a fucking. Goddamn. hindrance in my own fucking way?? I don’t want this anymore. And even tho the Flair says „Venting - No Advice Request“ (I rlly don’t like how caged this dumb flair tag makes me feel - what do you mean I can’t vent anymore without having some advice? What happened to the good ol wild r/NPD territory?🤬🤬 Is this lawful country now? Is this „stick up your ass“ land now or what?) if anybody can look thru my bullshit by all means - do it! But only if I respect you lmao But yeah idk everybody whom I even get remotely close to just keeps telling me how very fucking ✨✨special✨✨ I am Maybe I am! I mean who the fuck knows! Maybe I am indeed very fucking special and everyone who says otherwise can go fuck themselves with a pizza up their ass bro.

And it’s the most narcy apology I’ve ever read lmaoo “I’m sorry for having overwhelmed you with my expectations that we’re too high, and it overwhelmed *especially* you”, like wtf lmaooo I don’t even feel that mad tho. Just kinda a mix of disappointed, betrayed, a bit angry, and also grandiose weirdly enough, sickly sweet taste of “he’s thinking abt me, he desires me, he wanted to apologize”And also I want someone to help me make sense of all of this and I wanna shit talk hun to everyone and at the same time not Ugh I’ll have to wait and ponder a few days before I answer him.

Fuck you. Fuck you all. I’m cold and angry and bitter and envious and frustrated. And fed up.Just because this dumb fucking ego is standing in my goddamn way all the time. I screw shit up constantly. I’m ready for something else, ready for change. Ready for facing all the crap and bullshit and dumbfuck garbage that’s stuck up my butt and my head like a fucking buttplug reaching to the goddamn moon.And you’ll have to deal with this crap. I’m good, I’m better than everyone in this entire fucking world, and I suck and I’m shit and a dumb mean nasty sadistic narcissistic bitch.I’m also warm and kind and giving and hopeful sometimes. I’m hot and cold like an alternating hot-cold-shower and I’m green and violet and black and red and blue and full of frustration and bitterness and anger.Hurting people and loving them is the same side of the coin, whatever dude. Fuck Reddit, fuck everything, fuck the entire world so you’ve at least done something *useful*. So you’ve at least been useful. The least fucking shit you can do, for me.Of course it’s all for me and I fucking hate you and I put myself above you because *clearly* I’m fucking better than you, and *clearly* I know better and you’re a fucking piece of shit. But really, I’m angry about myself and frustrated and bitter and envious because I can’t fucking deal with shit and fuck things up. But I’m not gonna succumb into this trashhole of a garbage dumpster fire self pity again. I’m fed up and fucked up. Screw you, fuck you, do something, just do *something*. Don’t care what it is, just do *something*.And then I’ll make a deal with God and sell my soul so I can burn in the entire hell pit of fiery hot soul-bonding sound-fucking ass-bending eternity, and burn this fucking place down and take it all with me.Until I wake up in the morning and see it’s all been the fucking same again, and always has been. Fuck you.Idfk what it is but I’m full of rage and contempt and envy ugh Just make these dumbass feelings stop omg. It’s funnnnn I had bugs crawling in my food and saw the shadow people :D I love it I’m having fun 💕. Just talked to this one fucking Uni prof that I liked and now I’m so fucking pissed at him like how the FUCK has this guy the audacity to fucking tell me what to do and covertly be all like „I think you shouldn’t ask whether you’ve made a mistake so often“ wtf man fuck you bitch 😡😡🤬🤬🤬🖕🏻 I’ll ask whatever the fuck *I* want nothing and nobod fucking ELSE has the mere fucking RIGHT to tell me what to do GOD this bitch is so fucking entitled like what the fucking hell man fuck yooouuuuu 😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬🤬🤬🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻😤😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻“Guys guys maybe we should like ease up on ourselves for having fucking put ourselves below him and for let to me us get caught in a corner again.

Why the fuck do those fuckers always want ME to give a shit about THEM? Like, wtf? Nope, not me, I’m not gonna care about them bitches, screw them Why do *I* always have to fix everybody and everything?? Fuck you, not gonna do that anymore, it’s exhausting and tiring and feels fake af and I don’t wanna do it, screw yooouuu 😤😤🙅❌. I’m a people-collector. I collect people like others collect stamps or lighters (I actually collect lighters too). I went to a jazz bar yesterday evening and had like two drinks and I was tired as fuck and lowkey felt weird and strange and tense and I listened to the concert those people played and this made me happy and then afterwards I talked to one of the musicians, the bartender, a random girl my age and a random gay dude I met there and who seemed similar to me (they all did) and with whom I exchanged numbers in the end.I barely fucking remember this evening and I felt like another person was at that bar entertaining people listening to music and just generally being there and… existing.I told these people I’m very fucking good at getting to know new people and very fucking bad at keeping contact. This makes me run around irritable as fuck all the time and collect new people constantly. I always want more more more and the new shiny thing I just got two weeks ago isn’t new and shiny anymore and I don’t wanna play with it anymore. The glow has faded and it’s stale and boring now. Kinda. Mostly. After getting to know someone just a little bit better or after having broken their shell.All I want and care about is these people and new shiny toys liking me. I care about you as long as I haven’t gotten thru your shell and as long as you don’t like me but I’m interested in you and I wanna make you like me. If I succeed at that, you’re boring and I wanna go look out for new people and new shiny toys.It’s like. I feel like I’m at a funfair doing a carnival game, in one of those stands where you can shoot those little porcelain stars and depending on how many you’ll get, you’ll get a price. All I care about is shooting as many as possible and getting better at that game and then if I aim and shoot a star and it’s broken, that’s my supply and my praise and validation. The more, the better. The less, the more I wanna get better and be able to hit all of those exact 20 shots next time. The price is you and the price isn’t really interesting to me. The activity is much more fun and the activity is getting to know more people and charming them and making them like me. *Especially* if they’re a challenge and don’t like me at first or they don’t admit they like me. That’s the most fun thing. That’s shooting even tinier porcelain stars which makes it a lot harder but also more fun. (Those fucking dismissive-avoidants 😒😗🙄) I like that. Finally, if I’ve succeeded, I just move on. People are exciting and fascinating and they give me highs and lows and some of them do it *so well* I can’t fucking stop anymore. It’s like an addiction.Idk where I was going with this anymore so I’ll just keep it at this. And I didn’t wanna do it at all in the first place but then I kinda succumbed to it and decided fuck it, why the fuck not. Writing it down so I’ll remember So we had like this piece of rope laid out on the ground and I imagined myself as now and I started crying and then I walked towards the end of the rope with my therapist and imagined myself in 5 years from now. I felt very fucking embarrassed about it and felt blocked doing this shit but somehow still did it Imagined future where I’m living in apartment with cat and maybe partner surrounded by plants working full-time-job in IT and I’m just… calm. I’m comfortable with myself. It was nice and interesting. Because I know I have it in me. This calmness and the ability to heal But the 5 years in between were a tumultuous and chaotic trouble but it’s just.. nice knowing I have this in me man. Ugh idk. It’s just so fucking frustrating. Like, I study maths and a lot of my peers are shy introverted dorks with low self esteem that never really have opinion on shit and just do whatever the fuck you tell them to do. It’s so frustrating and infuriating. I’m someone who has strong opinions on things and who’s loud about them and tells them to people if they ask. For example we’re in a group of 5 people and wanna go grab lunch. Which canteen do we wanna go to? I say: Well, canteen X cuz I think they have Y and I like this and it’s tasty. *Literally nobody fucking else has an opinion* so we just do whatever the fuck I told them to do. It’s so fucking weird because isn’t this what I always want?? Leading people and them doing whatever tf I want them to do?? But it just gives me this weird icky suspicious as hell shame feeling inside. „Like, am I really the only one who has an opinion on this? Why the fuck do they do as I say? I feel ashamed of myself, I don’t wanna run all over them. Am I too dominant? Too loud?“ etc Like, here’s the thing. I still wanna be friends with some of them cuz I like them and some are quite interesting and I just. Don’t wanna end up abusing everybody all the time and being toxic as fuck and running all over them cuz I genuinely wanna get better. But like. HOW THE FUCK DO I DO THIS IF THEY JUST LITERALLY *PROVOKE* ME TO BE THIS WAY AND RUN ALL OVER THEM CUZ THEY DON‘T HAVE AN OPINION ON ANYTHING AND JUST DO AS I SAY ALL THE FUCKING TIME?? 😭😭😭How do you *behave* around ppl like this???It’s like, what the fuck do you want me to SAY, should I just *also* not have an opinion on shit?? So nobody’s taking the leash here?? Or should I just be fine with this?? I’m not fine with it! Just… say SOMETHING MAN!I kinda wanna tickle out their personalities and their opinions on shit but ahhhh idk how to handle stuff like this.Dad, I wish you could read this. I miss you. I’ve figured out a lot since your death and I’ve worked thru even more of fucked up things. (Actually making myself this vulnerable makes me feel sick and I lowkey feel disgusted with myself but whatever.) I’ve loved, hated, been heartbroken, fucked up, betrayed, succeeded, did some things that probably would’ve made you proud and some things you probably would despise and hate and harshly judge me for. I’m listening to my songs from the 70s/80s/90s playlist rn and fuck I think I might start crying. You would’ve loved those. You couldn’t show me how proud you are, Mom is probably right with this. Or you showed it in your own way, idk. I used to have a fuck ton of anger and hatred and contempt for you but actually… I understand you now. A bit better. A lot maybe idk. I miss you. I want you back. But you’re gone. (Rn “One Night in Bangkok” by Murray Head is up. I know you liked this song.)I’m not your little daughter/son/kid anymore that wants to make you proud and is driven by spite and hatred for you and an obsession I didn’t recognize up until lately. I’ve grown up and I’ve seen things and I’ve lived thru a ton of crap in my short life so far. I know you probably still live on in my head somewhere as an Introject, idk maybe (thanks Mud?). And I get you now more than ever before I think. I wish we could’ve made up before you died. Remember that one phone call we had? Where I made you sob? I felt fucking terrified and angry as fuck and powerful as fuck afterwards. I had hope and I thought it was completely pointless to talk to you about all this. I thought “Man, we’re never gonna talk about all this crap that happened”, but I also thought “God, holy shit. That was something new. That was good. Fuck. I feel hopeful. I know we have to talk this thru somewhen. I wanna pity you but I’m not gonna do that cuz FUCK YOU!” and I had my fists up again. I thought you were the end boss and I thought if I could beat you, I could beat anything and everything in the fucking entire goddamn world. I really believed that, like goddamn man. Now I know much more. You live on in myself and my memories and in other people and in lovers and therapists and friends and inanimate objects and events to come. Man I wish I could hug you. I miss you a lot. I love you. I think. Idk man. I don’t know. You’re not the end boss. Well not anymore. Maybe somewhere still, inside, idk. I’ve faced you before, thru myself and thru others.You’re just, like, my Dad. A confused and traumatized old man (thanks u/PoosPapa) who’s lived thru a lot of bullshit (just like me) and wanted to make things better than your father did, I know you wanted to. I know you fucking hated him and despised the shit out of him and he fucked you up real good. Fuck man. It runs in the family huh?Hell I never could’ve said this shit if you were still alive. God knows where the fuck we would be now if you still lived. Man. Fuck you Dad. But also I love you. What the fuck is it always with this fucking narcy thing about admitting love only ever after you don’t have anymore what you love? 🥲 If you hold it in your hands you fucking hate it and throw it away like a hot hard boiled egg you just grabbed straight outta the pot, and if it’s gone you might finally acknowledge shit and miss what you just had. Anyways, Dad. I love you. And I fucking hate you. And screw you man, you stupid bitchass dumbfuck cockroach eating trashcan motherfucker. But also I miss you.And well uh…I’m just like you.We had a flashback or more like, our little had it. Damn I feel so sorry for them and I sat down and told them what u/Emotional-Climate777 told us they do with their littles which is: we told them it’s all just a movie playing and we can make it move faster or slower or make the voices all high pitched and sound funny or turn everybody into colorful plushies and make it all funny and ridiculous.Flashback was something very heavy, probably vaulting box like you have in gym class during high school (?) being pressed into out rib cage and felt like dying. Couldn’t breathe. Though we’ll die. Cried and called for help but nobody came Up until later someone rescued us. Thought we’re dying Have trauma around having sudden heavy “sharp” “pressing against chest” feeling which we sometimes got and thought we were dying and getting a heart attack. Dying Could never get behind this feeling until now Comforted little, tried to ground them and then Gabriel came around and calmed themHe told them they can always call out for him if they’re in trouble and we told them we love them and we’ll always be there for them and we won’t, WON’T let it happen that someone hurts them. If someone should ever hurt them we’re so gonna kick their fucking bitchy ass 😡🤬😤Now sitting in the care being itchy and antsy uncomfortable af irritable and idk what to do abt it. Maybe too much coffee maybe someone not doing well idk can’t get thru to them.you’re the spoiled golden child, the little chick getting everything and everybody she’s ever wanted Having more money really suits me I can buy whatever pretty outfits and dresses and all that shit I ever wanted. Fuck yeah it’s amazing Like others hold me back from spending too much money cuz we shouldn’t use it all up and ppl b getting mad at me for spending hundreds of euros but idc some of it allow it But being the spoiled little baby girl golden child is really nice 😌I wanna be the prettiest, the sexiest, the hottest. We just bought some new outfit and got complimented as “outfit of the day” by an employee and damn it just made us feel so fucking amazing.Spoiled little baby girl that gets spoiled with everything she ever wants and deserves All I need and want and deserve cuz I simply just fucking deserve it Spoiled little bitch baby girl getting her needs met Golden child, golden girl getting satisfied and all her wishes fulfilled Having more money really suits us/me, damn Can get and buy whatever the fuck I wanted and always wished for Nice 😌 love it love it I want more of it and I never want it to stop I wanna wear ALL the pretty outfits and dresses and be a spoiled little golden baby girl chick and hot and amazing and justYeah 😌☺️. I feel like I’m losing it and someday I’m just gonna fucking snap and explode and tear down everything I’ve ever known and loved and take it with me onto an endless spiral of doom. Why always patronizing Why always demonizing Why always belittling others and why always being on top of everything It’s tiring it’s tiring why the fuck should I always do those things it’s so pointless to me so fucking pointless Why not just simply stop doing this bullshit Why always arguing and having conflicts and doing whatever IdkWhy always that and this and that. What the fuck man. Get the goddamn stick outta your ass you fucking bitches. Why in the FUCK and why on heaven’s earth do these fuckers think I’m larping? Yeah I’m having sooo much fun having NPD and DID and I think it’s fucking amazing woohoo!! 🥳 🥳 If someone could present me with a viable reason as to why I should be “larping” having mental disorder then fine, go ahead and tell me! Give me logical reasons as to why I think I’m fucking doing that shit. Bugger off you dumbass fucking bitches If you can’t deal with the way I literally am then that’s not my goddamn fault So I’m larping and playing a role, so what? Nothing is real anyway, have fun with your fucking projection you fucking bitches 😂🤣. Right now i feel like im me and myself like im normal and just me. I feel like ive always been that way and always will be. But when were switching we feel so unstable and mostly when we havent fully switched we're a mould and a mix of several different people at once. Idk whats goibg on its confueing im confused. Yeah I need to bring back order into this system. Like wtf man. Everyone’s having beef with each other like some sour grapes. That’s complete bullshit cuz I KNOW y’all can do better. Just posting here for the others to see. I think us spending so much time on Reddit and the internet is bullshit cuz we really gotta get our goddamn shit together lol. Don’t need supply from this pathetic ass platform, we gotta focus on ourselves. Working on bringing everyone together again.I realized I had FUN with my death anxiety and actually LOVED IT like oh my GOD dude Reminder to self to make post abt it later. If I die right here and right now then so be it. (Except I don’t wanna die lmao fuck lol) I just accept things as they are I’ll have a heck of a bad time if I resist against the experience, even if the experience is… dying Fuck you death, I’m ready for you. Here it comes 💀.
    Zu dem Kind in mir, das kleine 5-jährige verwirrte Mädchen was aus all dem scheiss Streit und dem rumschreien und den Drogen und allem anderen keinen Sinn tun kann: Es tut mir Leid. Du denkst dass das ganze scheiss streiten total sinnlos ist und wünschst es wäre anders. Tut mir Leid man. Tut mir Leid dass ich so bin, und dass die anderen so sind, und dass wir ständig Streit und Stress und Konflikte und Drama verursachen was du alles total sinnlos findest und was dir Angst macht. Tut mir Leid. Ich wünschte es wäre anders. Wir schaffen das. Wir kommen dadurch. Fuck. Tut mir Leid man. 🫂. I feel like something’s not right with my body I need to get to a doctor ASAP ugh :((( I can only go in 2 days tho >.< fuuuuuckkkI don’t wanna die. I rlly fucking don’t My lymph nodes in my throat are swollen for weeks now with on-and-off feelings of sickness or as if I’m catching a cold, and my legs randomly hurt as if I have varicose veins or some shit I don’t wanna have a stroke fuck 😭😭 and I feel kinda sick today without knowing why and just now had a dizzy spell 😭😭😭😭 pls someone help me I don’t wanna die Idk if it’s psychosomatic either, or if I’m in danger man fuck,,,,. Had an okay-ish day, rn I’m in dissociation land but someone in our head just had the idea “hey why not just randomly take some acid and fucking staying up all night so we won’t study tomorrow wooh!! 🥳🥳” guess we won’t do it tho. And also to have an ECG done and to get checked out to make sure my health is ok My primary care doctor sucks I rlly gotta fucking switch himPanic attack (??) again Feeling as if I can’t breathe , fear about my heart being wrong somehowFuuuck 😭. God it’s so fucking obvious. God how the fuck did I not notice this earlier?!I run around all the time and I never stop and I’m never calm because I wanna feel alive. I’m in the city every single day going to some restaurant (or not) being shallow as fuck or fucking up my sleeping rhythm 3 times a week by deliberately leaving the house again at 11 pm so I can randomly drive somewhere with the tram or take a 3 hour long walk or go to a strip club or bar or visit a friend in the middle of the night and do drugs with him and fuck up my academic life and success cuz I’ll come out of it with eye bags of death and unwashed hair and sweaty shirts because I wanna feel *fucking alive*. I’m depressed and that’s why I wanna feel alive because I fucking hate depression and this state of being in a foggy swamp not being able to see or do shit like almost nothing else. Because I can’t fucking stand or tolerate in myself and others this soggy foggy swampy nothingness itch like of being a depressed slouch and not doing shit all day. That’s why I *need* to run around all the fucking time and never stop and never take a break and never process. Just take in take in take in.But it’s all fucking shallow anyway. It’s all just depression in reverse, it doesn’t give me anything, it doesn’t give me any deep feelings or deep talks or deep realizations, I’m just as fucking depressed as I would be if I’d just lay in bed all day doing nothing. Nothing real gets thru to me until……until I take it to an extreme. Until I go to my local BDSM munch and let them beat the shit out of me. Until I go see a play in the theatre that really touches me and makes me sob in the middle of the theatre. Until I do new or more drugs that finally make me fucking *feel* something and that finally make me feel *alive*. Just to finally have this moment again where this fucking pressure drops off of me and I can breathe freely again. Just for a few moments, a minute, an hour, a few seconds.It’s pretty ironic isn’t it? Doing all this shit just to feel something whilst I would feel *the most* if I were to just fucking sit down with my feelings and finally take a break and finally start to process all this shit I’ve done in the past few, idk, weeks, months, years? If I were to just stop running and taking in and numbing myself. Hahah but that’s what I want isn’t it?No it’s not really. Ugh. I’m ashamed and I’m scared. I’m scared of all this shit that will come crashing down on me if I finally sit down and breathe. Im ashamed of myself for never sitting down and breathing and fucking *listening* to whatever my brain is trying to tell me. I’m fucking terrified of my own feelings and my own parts and everything that will eventually break down and crush (crash down on?) me. Even though that would be the safest bet to finally feel alive.. Didn’t think I’d come to this point ever again cuz clearly we are the most recovered and most healed fuck out there 😎 but I think our eating disorder is srsly flairing up again. For real this time lol. We keep saying this every half a year or so but yeah idk. We’re eating less on semi-purpose and we’re using food as a sort of reward thing - if we don’t eat that’s great, that means we can deprave ourselves of food and energy AND get thin and “reward” us later on with nice food after a while. That’s the addicting factor I think Plus the ego boost we used to get from it. Rlly it was a great fucking source of supply and honestly I think the ED was also partially “symptom” of our “outlet” for our narcissism Did any of y’all have EDs? I think it goes very fucking well with NPD just like beer and beer glass or wine and meat or coke and alcohol or tea and hot water go together lol. Everything is so far away even my/our anger 🤬🤬😡😡I fucking hate this shit omgomgomg ahhhhh dlflekekAll just cuz we suppressed our fucking feelings for too long omg I hate thisvstatebughhhh This motherfucking BITCH this PIECE OF SHIT I fucking hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him 😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🙅🙅❌❌❌I can feel several ppl being close to front but also like. Ugh fuuuuck over everything is just this dumbass stupid fucking blank canvas layer 🤬🤬😡😡. Empty rage. This fucking empty rage It feels so empty itchy and antsy and I’m so scratchy and tense and just never calm, never quiet, just wanna run around bc I’m never calm or quiet I rage and I get mad and everything is shit and everyone wants to harm me or do me bad and I rage and rage but it’s never enough !! It’s never enough rage. It’s just so empty. Like a bloody red black void with blood dripping from the walls like tar And the others in my head told me “Kal, look into it, there’s something behind this rage. The void is full and filled to the brim with emotions and yourself. What do you feel behind it, what is it?” And I’m like “fuck you don’t tell me what to do” but also like fuck man, shit they’re right.The empty rage is never full bc it’s itchy antsy shame behind, and feelings of betrayal abandonment and fear and sadness and grief How do I get to those feelings, how tf do I feel themI keep running around never being satisfied and just filled to the brim with this fucking empty rage. I never feel anything else unless after days of struggle where I desperately wanna have other feelings and nothing works until some trigger hits me and I can finally cry and it feels almost orgasmic, so much relief. Fuck you all and your fucking momma you dumb ass cunt bitchy shitty fucking motherfuckers pieces of absolute utter trash and garbage!! 🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻Omfg I hate ppl so fucking much. If those bunches of whiny ass babies can’t fucking take what I’m saying then THATS NOT NY FUCKING FAULT!!! Wtf is WRONG with those dumb cunt suckers!!?????? I fucking hate them dude wtf. DISCLAIMER: No literal asses got kicked. It’s just metaphorical. I have my people for kicking my ass ;) bitch-boy is not one of em There is some weird ass dude in our classes that everyone knows cuz he’s just the strangest fucking weirdo you could’ve seen in a while. Paranoid as hell, vulnerable narcissistic, bitter and envious and passive aggressive as fuck and diagnosed autistic as disability. Oh and unaware as fuck. He recently joined our study WhatsApp group. I texted with him for two fucking days and he just fascinated me cuz he was a paranoid, mentally sick fucked in the head fuck that reminded me so much of my younger self that I started liking him even though I looked down on him and thought he was pathetic as all fucking _hell_. I opened up to him more than I had probably with all others I know in my current Uni lectures, told him I have DID and shit. We talked about mental health shit and at first he thanked me for talking to him so he “wouldn’t have to cry in his pillow at night anymore” and then he fucking blocked me because I let out some alters that were patronizing and belittling but also directly telling him to the face what’s going on with his mental health bullshit. He didn’t fucking like that, cuz the shit I’m telling people stings, even tho its true. And THEN, a day later, he covertly shit-talks me behind my fucking back in some lecture as I just found out and I was fucking INFURIATED AND BURNING WITH HATRED. Oh my god it makes me so mad. And sad. It reminds me of my fucking school days were I got bullied and constantly shit talked about. I feel fucking betrayed and if I see this little bitch irl tomorrow I’m gonna tell him to his fucking face that he should directly face and talk to me, instead of blocking me, excusing all of it with some covert “ohhh I’m too sensitive and I’m sorryyyy, I can’t keep talking to you anymoreeew 🥺🥺🥺” and then FUCKING SHIT TALKING ME BEHIND MY BACK TO MY FRIENDS. I hate this fucking little bitch oh my god Is this rlly what I’ll fucking get for opening up to someone?? Holy fuck I feel so betrayed man Edit: also I should specify that this little bitch is looked down upon by most ppl due to how weird he is. So my image shouldn’t be too broken but srsly man, fuck this dumbass piece of shit motherfucker. It’s a breath of fresh air. We’re nasty disgusting bastard dickheads that stab each other in the back at every opportunity but like… we also get each other. Like no one else probably. And like. I feel at home here. I feel accepted and understood and it’s just nice I just had an argument with my mom where I first raged and was mad as hell and then eventually ended up crying and I kinda partially got thru her defenses and at some point I told her all I want is just a mom or well… *someone* who gets me. Who listens to me and who accepts me and understands meAnd we (me and the headmates) feel better now cuz we at least got some of that shit off our chest And yeah I just wanted to say thanks. We love this community for what it is, fuck man You can be yourself around here and be heard and seen and understood and I wish for us to keep being the backstabbing cheating lying and painfully empathic bastards we are ~~(and maybe heal a bit more on the way)~~Edit: and it feels soooo wrong to tag this shit as “upbeat talk” lmaooo I wish I would’ve tagged it as “venting” just to fucking mess around. Ugh idk I’ve been scared of shit being wrong w my heart all day now Ever since this stupid dumbass K event at the party on Saturday I feel like there’s smth wrong w my heart and I’m terrified terrified terrified ugghhhAlso my blood pressure been too low all day I’m. Scared. Waking up in the middle of the night thinking you’re gonna die is just fucking awesome. Mhhh yeah love that,. Nothing better than this shit Forgot how fun this is cuz we haven’t had it in a while 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥. And they can go fuck off 🤬🤬 everybody !! Dumb fucks 😡😡🤬🤬 pieces of fucking shit garbage dumb trash can fucker. I’ve done like 2 lines of K at a party yesterday night, and after the second line I‘ve started having arrhythmia/an irregular heartbeat (blood measuring thing confirmed that) which lasted for like, hours, and only went away after I slept. :/Can K cause arrhythmia? It was scary as fuck and I didn’t know what to do about it except „sitting (sleeping) it out“. Getting a heart disease is like my worst fear health-wise lmao. Is there anything you can do about it??. Like seriously man, fuck them. 😞☹️😕😞Tired of those I want real human connection, I want warmth and compassion and affection Fuck this shit, don’t wanna anymore. Nope I’m outta here. I feel depressed. I feel sad. I wanna cry and I have this weird fucking feeling stuck up my throat I‘m tired of all this mental health bullshit. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why on God‘s fucking earth was I blessed with so many shitty fucking things? Idk I wanna hug my inner child and I have no fucking idea how to deal with them. Fuck. They’re scared all the time and always have these „nightmares“ which are flashbacks, and they’re constantly stuck in there. Idfk how to deal with them and I wanna tell them that everything is okay Idk why I have so much chaos and drama in my life. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why the fuck can’t I be stable? Why the fuck can‘t I have any more goddamn fucking order in here than anybody else? Idk I don’t understand Why do I have to let myself get beat up and run after weird psychopath men and fuck up my goddamn Uni career and constantly be a fucking. Goddamn. hindrance in my own fucking way?? I don’t want this anymore. And even tho the Flair says „Venting - No Advice Request“ (I rlly don’t like how caged this dumb flair tag makes me feel - what do you mean I can’t vent anymore without having some advice? What happened to the good ol wild r/NPD territory?🤬🤬 Is this lawful country now? Is this „stick up your ass“ land now or what?) if anybody can look thru my bullshit by all means - do it! But only if I respect you lmao But yeah idk everybody whom I even get remotely close to just keeps telling me how very fucking ✨✨special✨✨ I am Maybe I am! I mean who the fuck knows! Maybe I am indeed very fucking special and everyone who says otherwise can go fuck themselves with a pizza up their ass bro. I fucking hate this fucking bitch oh my fucking GOD dude 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻The fucking AUDACITY Talking all like „ohhh nooo I’m such a terrible victim of my circumstances, I’m soooo pitiful, everything is terrible“ with ZERO fucking self-awareness WHATSOEVER Fucking vulnerable narcs omfg I hate them I hate them I FUCKING HATE THEM 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻The fucking AUDACITY to even fucking EXIST near me????

And it’s the most narcy apology I’ve ever read lmaoo “I’m sorry for having overwhelmed you with my expectations that we’re too high, and it overwhelmed *especially* you”, like wtf lmaooo I don’t even feel that mad tho. Just kinda a mix of disappointed, betrayed, a bit angry, and also grandiose weirdly enough, sickly sweet taste of “he’s thinking abt me, he desires me, he wanted to apologize”And also I want someone to help me make sense of all of this and I wanna shit talk hun to everyone and at the same time not Ugh I’ll have to wait and ponder a few days before I answer him.

Fuck you. Fuck you all. I’m cold and angry and bitter and envious and frustrated. And fed up.Just because this dumb fucking ego is standing in my goddamn way all the time. I screw shit up constantly.

Ready for facing all the crap and bullshit and dumbfuck garbage that’s stuck up my butt and my head like a fucking buttplug reaching to the goddamn moon.And you’ll have to deal with this crap. I’m good, I’m better than everyone in this entire fucking world, and I suck and I’m shit and a dumb mean nasty sadistic narcissistic bitch.I’m also warm and kind and giving and hopeful sometimes. I’m hot and cold like an alternating hot-cold-shower and I’m green and violet and black and red and blue and full of frustration and bitterness and anger.Hurting people and loving them is the same side of the coin, whatever dude. Fuck Reddit, fuck everything, fuck the entire world so you’ve at least done something *useful*. So you’ve at least been useful. The least fucking shit you can do, for me.Of course it’s all for me and I fucking hate you and I put myself above you because *clearly* I’m fucking better than you, and *clearly* I know better and you’re a fucking piece of shit. But really, I’m angry about myself and frustrated and bitter and envious because I can’t fucking deal with shit and fuck things up. But I’m not gonna succumb into this trashhole of a garbage dumpster fire self pity again. I’m fed up and fucked up. Screw you, fuck you, do something, just do *something*. Don’t care what it is, just do *something*.And then I’ll make a deal with God and sell my soul so I can burn in the entire hell pit of fiery hot soul-bonding sound-fucking ass-bending eternity, and burn this fucking place down and take it all with me.Until I wake up in the morning and see it’s all been the fucking same again, and always has been. Fuck you.Idfk what it is but I’m full of rage and contempt and envy ugh Just make these dumbass feelings stop omg. It’s funnnnn I had bugs crawling in my food and saw the shadow people :D I love it I’m having fun 💕. Just talked to this one fucking Uni prof that I liked and now I’m so fucking pissed at him like how the FUCK has this guy the audacity to fucking tell me what to do and covertly be all like „I think you shouldn’t ask whether you’ve made a mistake so often“ wtf man fuck you bitch 😡😡🤬🤬🤬🖕🏻 I’ll ask whatever the fuck *I* want nothing and nobod fucking ELSE has the mere fucking RIGHT to tell me what to do GOD this bitch is so fucking entitled like what the fucking hell man fuck yooouuuuu 😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬🤬🤬🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻😤😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻“Guys guys maybe we should like ease up on ourselves for having fucking put ourselves below him and for let to me us get caught in a corner again.

Why the fuck do those fuckers always want ME to give a shit about THEM? Like, wtf? Nope, not me, I’m not gonna care about them bitches, screw them Why do *I* always have to fix everybody and everything?? Fuck you, not gonna do that anymore, it’s exhausting and tiring and feels fake af and I don’t wanna do it, screw yooouuu 😤😤🙅❌. I’m a people-collector. I collect people like others collect stamps or lighters (I actually collect lighters too). I went to a jazz bar yesterday evening and had like two drinks and I was tired as fuck and lowkey felt weird and strange and tense and I listened to the concert those people played and this made me happy and then afterwards I talked to one of the musicians, the bartender, a random girl my age and a random gay dude I met there and who seemed similar to me (they all did) and with whom I exchanged numbers in the end.I barely fucking remember this evening and I felt like another person was at that bar entertaining people listening to music and just generally being there and… existing.I told these people I’m very fucking good at getting to know new people and very fucking bad at keeping contact. This makes me run around irritable as fuck all the time and collect new people constantly. I always want more more more and the new shiny thing I just got two weeks ago isn’t new and shiny anymore and I don’t wanna play with it anymore. The glow has faded and it’s stale and boring now. Kinda. Mostly. After getting to know someone just a little bit better or after having broken their shell.All I want and care about is these people and new shiny toys liking me. I care about you as long as I haven’t gotten thru your shell and as long as you don’t like me but I’m interested in you and I wanna make you like me. If I succeed at that, you’re boring and I wanna go look out for new people and new shiny toys.It’s like. I feel like I’m at a funfair doing a carnival game, in one of those stands where you can shoot those little porcelain stars and depending on how many you’ll get, you’ll get a price. All I care about is shooting as many as possible and getting better at that game and then if I aim and shoot a star and it’s broken, that’s my supply and my praise and validation. The more, the better. The less, the more I wanna get better and be able to hit all of those exact 20 shots next time. The price is you and the price isn’t really interesting to me. The activity is much more fun and the activity is getting to know more people and charming them and making them like me. *Especially* if they’re a challenge and don’t like me at first or they don’t admit they like me. That’s the most fun thing. That’s shooting even tinier porcelain stars which makes it a lot harder but also more fun. (Those fucking dismissive-avoidants 😒😗🙄) I like that. Finally, if I’ve succeeded, I just move on. People are exciting and fascinating and they give me highs and lows and some of them do it *so well* I can’t fucking stop anymore. It’s like an addiction.Idk where I was going with this anymore so I’ll just keep it at this. And I didn’t wanna do it at all in the first place but then I kinda succumbed to it and decided fuck it, why the fuck not. Writing it down so I’ll remember So we had like this piece of rope laid out on the ground and I imagined myself as now and I started crying and then I walked towards the end of the rope with my therapist and imagined myself in 5 years from now. I felt very fucking embarrassed about it and felt blocked doing this shit but somehow still did it Imagined future where I’m living in apartment with cat and maybe partner surrounded by plants working full-time-job in IT and I’m just… calm. I’m comfortable with myself. It was nice and interesting. Because I know I have it in me. This calmness and the ability to heal But the 5 years in between were a tumultuous and chaotic trouble but it’s just.. nice knowing I have this in me man. Ugh idk. It’s just so fucking frustrating. Like, I study maths and a lot of my peers are shy introverted dorks with low self esteem that never really have opinion on shit and just do whatever the fuck you tell them to do. It’s so frustrating and infuriating. I’m someone who has strong opinions on things and who’s loud about them and tells them to people if they ask. For example we’re in a group of 5 people and wanna go grab lunch. Which canteen do we wanna go to? I say: Well, canteen X cuz I think they have Y and I like this and it’s tasty. *Literally nobody fucking else has an opinion* so we just do whatever the fuck I told them to do. It’s so fucking weird because isn’t this what I always want?? Leading people and them doing whatever tf I want them to do?? But it just gives me this weird icky suspicious as hell shame feeling inside. „Like, am I really the only one who has an opinion on this? Why the fuck do they do as I say? I feel ashamed of myself, I don’t wanna run all over them. Am I too dominant? Too loud?“ etc Like, here’s the thing. I still wanna be friends with some of them cuz I like them and some are quite interesting and I just. Don’t wanna end up abusing everybody all the time and being toxic as fuck and running all over them cuz I genuinely wanna get better. But like. HOW THE FUCK DO I DO THIS IF THEY JUST LITERALLY *PROVOKE* ME TO BE THIS WAY AND RUN ALL OVER THEM CUZ THEY DON‘T HAVE AN OPINION ON ANYTHING AND JUST DO AS I SAY ALL THE FUCKING TIME?? 😭😭😭How do you *behave* around ppl like this???It’s like, what the fuck do you want me to SAY, should I just *also* not have an opinion on shit?? So nobody’s taking the leash here?? Or should I just be fine with this?? I’m not fine with it! Just… say SOMETHING MAN!I kinda wanna tickle out their personalities and their opinions on shit but ahhhh idk how to handle stuff like this.Dad, I wish you could read this. I miss you. I’ve figured out a lot since your death and I’ve worked thru even more of fucked up things. (Actually making myself this vulnerable makes me feel sick and I lowkey feel disgusted with myself but whatever.) I’ve loved, hated, been heartbroken, fucked up, betrayed, succeeded, did some things that probably would’ve made you proud and some things you probably would despise and hate and harshly judge me for. I’m listening to my songs from the 70s/80s/90s playlist rn and fuck I think I might start crying. You would’ve loved those. You couldn’t show me how proud you are, Mom is probably right with this. Or you showed it in your own way, idk. I used to have a fuck ton of anger and hatred and contempt for you but actually… I understand you now. A bit better. A lot maybe idk. I miss you. I want you back. But you’re gone. (Rn “One Night in Bangkok” by Murray Head is up. I know you liked this song.)I’m not your little daughter/son/kid anymore that wants to make you proud and is driven by spite and hatred for you and an obsession I didn’t recognize up until lately. I’ve grown up and I’ve seen things and I’ve lived thru a ton of crap in my short life so far. I know you probably still live on in my head somewhere as an Introject, idk maybe (thanks Mud?). And I get you now more than ever before I think. I wish we could’ve made up before you died. Remember that one phone call we had? Where I made you sob? I felt fucking terrified and angry as fuck and powerful as fuck afterwards. I had hope and I thought it was completely pointless to talk to you about all this. I thought “Man, we’re never gonna talk about all this crap that happened”, but I also thought “God, holy shit. That was something new. That was good. Fuck. I feel hopeful. I know we have to talk this thru somewhen. I wanna pity you but I’m not gonna do that cuz FUCK YOU!” and I had my fists up again. I thought you were the end boss and I thought if I could beat you, I could beat anything and everything in the fucking entire goddamn world. I really believed that, like goddamn man. Now I know much more. You live on in myself and my memories and in other people and in lovers and therapists and friends and inanimate objects and events to come. Man I wish I could hug you. I miss you a lot. I love you. I think. Idk man. I don’t know. You’re not the end boss. Well not anymore. Maybe somewhere still, inside, idk. I’ve faced you before, thru myself and thru others.You’re just, like, my Dad. A confused and traumatized old man (thanks u/PoosPapa) who’s lived thru a lot of bullshit (just like me) and wanted to make things better than your father did, I know you wanted to. I know you fucking hated him and despised the shit out of him and he fucked you up real good. Fuck man. It runs in the family huh?Hell I never could’ve said this shit if you were still alive. God knows where the fuck we would be now if you still lived. Man. Fuck you Dad. But also I love you. What the fuck is it always with this fucking narcy thing about admitting love only ever after you don’t have anymore what you love? 🥲 If you hold it in your hands you fucking hate it and throw it away like a hot hard boiled egg you just grabbed straight outta the pot, and if it’s gone you might finally acknowledge shit and miss what you just had. Anyways, Dad. I love you. And I fucking hate you. And screw you man, you stupid bitchass dumbfuck cockroach eating trashcan motherfucker. But also I miss you.And well uh…I’m just like you.We had a flashback or more like, our little had it. Damn I feel so sorry for them and I sat down and told them what u/Emotional-Climate777 told us they do with their littles which is: we told them it’s all just a movie playing and we can make it move faster or slower or make the voices all high pitched and sound funny or turn everybody into colorful plushies and make it all funny and ridiculous.Flashback was something very heavy, probably vaulting box like you have in gym class during high school (?) being pressed into out rib cage and felt like dying. Couldn’t breathe. Though we’ll die. Cried and called for help but nobody came Up until later someone rescued us. Thought we’re dying Have trauma around having sudden heavy “sharp” “pressing against chest” feeling which we sometimes got and thought we were dying and getting a heart attack. Dying Could never get behind this feeling until now Comforted little, tried to ground them and then Gabriel came around and calmed themHe told them they can always call out for him if they’re in trouble and we told them we love them and we’ll always be there for them and we won’t, WON’T let it happen that someone hurts them. If someone should ever hurt them we’re so gonna kick their fucking bitchy ass 😡🤬😤Now sitting in the care being itchy and antsy uncomfortable af irritable and idk what to do abt it.

Here it comes 💀.
    I explode when I come across over expressive, over emotional types. Like my mind cant take it no more, and I go into a sensory overload, fries my brain. So what type of women/men are you attracted towards, especially if you are a covert. (21M)long story short: I do usually experiment with different diets but found this time constipated after winter.made my meal simple(mono meal) and chewed more and thats what "cured" "it".Tell me about your problem, include when did it start and what's your diet.I did made a long post about what i learned throughout but I accidently deleted my post :P and now im lazyEdit: Found out the 'culprit', im underweight... and also was on protein fat diet (hard to digest), i now drink juice(lots) and empty like a super dump truck, also fulfills my calories and also detox. tldr: was hypoglycemic.
    I know it's listed that some folks have hallucinations as well as episodes of delusions. I want to know if I've ever had any and how serious are the hallucinations..Is drinking 2 bottles of 1.5 l(50oz) whiskey over two days bad?I'm concerned about my brother who drinks this much almost every other weekend. He says it's not that bad for this health because he does it on empty stomach.Want to understand how different people experience dissociation. Please define it in your own words. What does it feel like?. I feel like people are proud of having NPD...and I just want to know if this is just people in my interaction or of this is universal They tend to be proud that they can play with humans, manipulate them and not love them. Curious to know. I have NPD. I genuinely don't know the answer? Do I love or is it attachment? Want to know what others answers are...No one knows who you are, so honestly tell me are you successful? What did you do or understand despite this disorder that made you successful?. Hey guys! I'm considering group therapy...has anyone tried it? Is it better? Why is it better? How does it help you more than normal therapy? Really curious to know before I try another thing and watch it fail 😂. What better place to ask for song suggestions! Guy's give your top 2 songs that makes you feel like you just felt the high rush!Mine would be rollercoaster by chung ha and afterlife by avenged sevenfold! All languages are welcome!. My friend is not taking DBT but I'm not sure how to convince her. Why did you not do DBT, what convinced you along the way?. I have no idea why this is happening to me and it might just be my individual issue but it could also be a BPD thing. I wanna know whether anyone else questions whether they love their partner. I have been with him for 4 years in a long distance relationship and only like every year he would come back for 2 months. Throughout long distance we would stay on video call together for most of the day but I often think that maybe I don't love him? While other times I feel like he is very precious to me. This also leads me to want to break up with him everytime I split and fight with him. I want to know if this is just me or other people have this problem too.I am pretty self aware and I usually know when I'm splitting. Most of the time I feel like breaking up with my boyfriend then and there because deep down I fear when I wake up tomorrow morning I might not feel the same way. But at that time totally convinced I don't love him. My heart will also go fast and I'll feel immense pain in my heart.But these days something rare has been happening where I split and went to breakup with him but I don't feel my heartbeat going fast. I am not getting a heart ache either. I fear that I'm actually feeling out of love. And I don't want to because he really is a great guy.
    I'm a 20 yr old white woman and I've thought about it as well as trying to join a Muslim community.I could never conjure a belief in God but part of me dislikes the aimlessness of life and wants to be part of a culture that makes sense to me.Might be romanticizing it a bit and find out later that it's kind of hell, especially since I don't tend to jive well with authority or communities. I like traditional gender rolesHumans walk through life and we accumulate wounds. Nature is bristly and entropy destroys, It's inevitable.We have to clean our wounds. And when we don't, the flesh rots and the rot spreads.Only a mild solvent can be used. At a certain point when you've kept scrubbing you realise that you've just been a corrosive force.The state of the world now, especially in the west, is that we are zombies. The rot has spread nearly to the bone. We stood still in time for too long, we didn't adapt to change, we hurled down the river too quickly, the rocks cut deep, we didn't learn to clean our wounds in time. The solution proposed by some people, nihilists, atheists, leftists, skeptics, and deconstructionists is to put us in acid baths. This requires an unnatural trust in the strength of reality. The corruption doesn't exist on the surface. The bone is arbitrary and the flesh is arbitrary and once you've gone through the last bit there's nothing left.Scientists stand on eachothers shoulders, building a staircase of flesh up to heaven, and the hunter climbs it and shoots down God who falls with far too much ease. They climb down and engorge themselves, eating everything.I'm a zombie. My flesh is rotten. I try to appreciate the sweet smell in the very little time I have. I move through life in a hurry, I infect others without caring, and I entrance myself with the vibrance of an autumn leaf that's animated by the wind before a very inevitable decay.I'm not remorseful, critical, or resentful, I just wish it didn't have to end so soon. And I feel immense sadness for every person who has to face this. Especially the young people.I've decided I want to focus on other thingsI remember being genuinely happy when I was working on myself and not thinking about narcissismI broke up with the two people who made me question all of thisIt's not that the disorder is invalid but I would rather focus on how to fix traits and find beauty in the worldI hope I will wake up some day able to feel my emotions. I hope I won't have those spells of emptiness. I don't hope this pain goes away because I know it's what I need to feel but I wish I did. I hope that I will wake up at some point and realise that those white chocolate cliff protein bars are what I lived for, and the perfume, and a YouTube video that's recently become unavailable called "POV you just want to feel something - a playlist" with a girl's head turned away from the camera on a blurry beach, and a person I just left because I could not be in a relationship with them, and these fleeting moments of physical beauty I have in my 20s before it's all torn away by war and age, and I wish I could have lived longer, but I can't.I will continue walking above this earth, buried above ground. I will continue walking and I won't be alive. When you make peace with things you aren't alive. When you are perfect you are an archetype, like a ghost that has finally let go, no longer vengeful, no longer torn, and it floats into the afterlife. I will join every human being who is going through the motions. I have the emotional stability. The self. I know you don't believe me but you don't need to for it to be true.I am dying. I want to let go. Goodbye. I just let him ask for hugs even though he's married. He crossed a new boundary by calling me hot and attractive today. He tries to play the role of a father figure. I'm 20. I just don't say anything because I dislike everyone and I always put on a mask of calmness and charisma.But I realised it made me angry. And the reason I realized it made me angry is because I have homicidal ideation. I want to stab someone in the chest repeatedly. I don't feel that I can get out this feeling if I don't. It's unwise to post this on the internet so to be clear I have no specific plan and this is just ventingI want to locate the man who sexually abused me and my sister during childhood and drug him, pull his body where there's no witnesses, cut him open, and dismember his organs. I want to know if the inside of his body smells bad. Maybe like duck meat. I want to hold his organs in my hands. I feel as though doing this would give me some catharsis. Writing this online means there's a chance that the police will see this if I commit an identical crime which will prevent me from committing this crime. It's sabotage.What this is is a cry for help.I feel as though I want to join the military so that I can freely kill people. I don't want innocent people to die but I don't know how else to get out all of this rage that I cannot feel, because it just feels like emptiness.I don't feel it but mentally I feel it and my mind goes to stabbing, shooting, and murdering people, or killing myselfSo I want to figure out ways to process anger and feel it in the bodyI could just join the military and kill people but I don't want to kill innocent Palestinians. Almost nothing phases me. However when I read mentions of child sexual abuse I get irritated, distracted, and I sometimes cry harder than I thought possible. Today I wondered why I didn't have a libido and the article mentioned childhood sexual assault and I had a panic attack which I haven't had for a couple years. During it I imagined myself throwing things and destroying them.I have one memory of when I was 3 and a man who later turned out to have sexually assaulted 2 of my sisters said "lie" and I didn't know whether or not he meant "tell a lie" or "lie down". But I kind of awkwardly laid down on a stool and I remember nothing from there. I think he was babysitting me at the time whilst my parents were gone. I have 0 memory of any sexual assault whatsoever but I remember remembering that situation when I was 6, 8, and many times since, and always wondering what he meant by "lie".I have absolutely no memory of being sexually assaulted, but I act like someone who has been.I think very persistently that it didn't happen to me because I don't remember it, and I'm just creating things that aren't there. I have felt sexually undesirable and unbeatiful throughout my childhood and adult life despite receiving a lot of attention for my appearance. I wonder if this is a defense mechanism to deny that I could be sexually desireable enough for that to happen to me. I feel extremely different from other people. I border sociopathy but can feel profoundly vulnerable.I kind of wonder if I'm actually sadisticI kind of wonder if i like to be a psychological serial killerI wonder why I like to instill fear into othersI wonder why I would prefer a criminal occupationI like to get into people's skin and destroy them from the inside out when I think that I love themAs if I'm nullifying a threatI only realised this when I saw someone I respected and identified doing this, when I didn't think they ever wouldI hardly feel anger towards anyone, maybe there's repressed aggressionI look down upon shaming and hurting others overtly. I am kind and generous to others and I perceive myself as a very outgoing and straightforward person with genuine intentions and low emotions, never fearing others.But then why do I feel and act like a snake, never genuine, never able to be, always scared, always trying to crawl under people's skin and destroy them? What does this make me? A sadist? A malignant narcissist? What does this mean?. I'm very new to all of this and see a lot of conflicting opinions so I'm curious. My ex is a psychopath. I knew this going in and have never had a problem with it so this isn't about me.In our last argument before breaking up he seemed like he was losing it a little bit. Just something seemed off. 3 weeks later he told someone he was so depressed he wanted to kill himself. He is not the type of person to say or do thatI contacted him about it and he said he was, he didn't respond for a few days and then this morning I woke up to a text from him that he was targeting women and doing things to psychologically destroy them and that the principals he's abided by in the last 2 decades are gone, that he no longer cares about being respectful, comforting, or honest with womenHe's highly attractive and successful financially which means he has a lot of sex with women with easeI care about this person probably more than I care about anyone else. I honestly don't really care what he does to other people but I care about him intensely. I am prepared to leave all of this behind but I am curious about whether or not people have seen similar behavior and what the outcomes are.. just anh information about this specifically relating to primary psychopathyTo emphasize, he has a profile much more in line with primary psychopathy than secondary, this is the first time he's ever "acted out" in a serious way throughout his life. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.I hoped it would help me make sense of things. Idkkkkkkk.She said essentially "you'll feel the emotions you need to feel when the moment arises, and that you want to feel" and yeah. I don't know why I've been obsessing so much over the identify. It's not that I want to be a psychopath exactly, despite maybe appreciating the invulnerability, it's that I wonder if I am or if I'm some sort of impostor.My feelings about this are sooooo confusing. I score around 28 on the checklist which would put me in the moderate range. But I still feel anxiety in some ways and I wonder if what I'm experiencing is just emotional numbness. I feel so strung out and chaotic and confused about things. I'm working a very people oriented job and it's fine but it's boring, I feel strangely drawn to working a graveyard shift from 11pm-7am which will consist of stacking boxes in a storeI feel so bored at work that I kind of want it to feel extreme and liminal, I want to be a little bit mentally handicapped by the sleeplessness and be without people to make the time go faster and sink into my own thoughts, it just feels more comfortable to be in a slightly distorted state that asynchronous with the rest of society, I enjoy it, it's just interesting to me. Otherwise I feel like doing drugs at work cause the boredom is really unbearableI have traits of psychopathy as wellIdk if it would be healthy for me to follow what interests me or if I should stick with conventionality so I can work on getting in tune with the rest of the world, mainly if that's necessary to be healthy or if I can be individualistic and still get better mentally. Sometimes when I'm sick, haven't eaten, am extremely tired, etc, I prefer itIdk whyIt's either because the illusions are more easily maintained or because they more easily fall down, I don't know which is which. My mom told me some of this.Age 2 i wanted to keep walking in one direction and she didn't so she started walking in the opposite direction to try and get me to come but I just kept walking and didn't care about her leaving me so she had to go get meAge 4 me and my little sister were in Hawaii, we ate a highly poisonous fruit together while unattended and they rushed to the hospital to get her stomach pumped, they asked me if I had eaten it but I said no even though I had and I didn't die but I never told themAge 4 my half sister was leaving to see her dad and I remember feeling extremely intense emotions, crying, staring at this tomato tree in Hawaii and being really hurt and angryAge 6 I was rly mean and would always make fun of people and bully them and I didn't really try to make friendsAge 6 I remember wishing I was dead so that my parents would notice me and feel bad for the way they treated meAge 6 I thought a lot about killing my sister, I wasn't mad at her or anything but I often wondered what I was capable of, if I'd be able to lure her into a field and cut her body into piecesAge 8 I would go to sleepovers, I was always asked if I missed my parents and I never considered itAge 8 I developed a lot of religious OCD and magical thinking, I had a porcelain angel I liked to have with me because I had some sort of connection to it, I began to control the environment in irrational ways to try and cope with the control I lacked, I developed severe depressionAge 10 I was pretty ruthless to my siblings, we'd get into fights a lot and I started a lot of what could only be described as "cults" that demanded strict obedience, I'd always be in charge of everything, I never told anyone else about my emotions if I had them and didn't until I was 15. I lied and stole a lot starting from age 6 and would create a lot of scams to get things I wanted from people around meAge 11-13 my friends were crying because I was moving but I didn't cry at all, they told me they'd never seen me cry, I wasn't sad even though I'd known them my whole life. I was called a sociopath by my sister, something about not caring that she was suicidal or saying something apatheticAge 11-13 I was seen as a bully by a lot of people but I didn't always understand whyAge 13 I had an argument with my sisters 20 yr old friend about how manipulation isn't that bad and it just depends on doing bad or good things with it, she told me about this time a boy manipulated her into being sexually exploited and I didn't care, I was just annoyed that she was trying to manipulate me into agreeing with her by telling me that storyAge 14 we moved and I began to isolate myself and fell into a deep depression, went a year without really leaving my room, remember crying on the floor and physically not being able to stop all dayAge 15 the abuse from my dad got worse and I was almost always isolated in what could only be described as hell, I was suicidal a lot but more prosocial and empathetic and weak than I had been but I was aware that I was masking for the approval of others and deep inside I was really really hurting. Because of my weakness I was bullied by a lot of girls my age online.Age 16 my dad got mad at me because he said my public persona and private persona were completely different, and my parents friends who visited my house when I was in my private persona started gossipping about how split I wasAge 17 the mask began to slip, at age 18 I figured I was some sort of sensitive genius, age 19 I realized it was bullshit, age 19-20 and the grandiosity has come out again and I suspect antisocial traits.I've thought of changing my name to Angel or Angelica or AngelinaI intuit that it's connected to the way I process myself with NPDI find it aesthetic and emotionally soothing. Statues like the angel of grief or drawings, even anime, or charms with angel wings, etc.IdkThe movies and stuff I connect to as well has that theme. A diety-type entity that is wholly perfect but comes to earth and is kind of experiencing it wash through her like an Ocean. The Princes Kaguya and Barbie were two examples, the first of which I've related to since I was 15. Both films caused me to cry. In both films they lived in a perfect world with no negative emotions, no pain, and they came to earth and learned to experience that full hearted experience, but there's always this alienness. And deep appreciation for humanity. But a feeling that they are removed.It just seems like next level grandiosity on one hand but on a day to day basis I feel like I do experience the world like this. I don't take responsibility for my actions except in front of others to appease them because it's like I can't be responsible for anything, I'm not even here. I'm just a baby.I'm going to turkey and then moving and she's going to SeattleI'm 20 she's 18I have a few days to spend with her. I realised a while that I care about her more than most and so I'm paying for everything.How do I spend this time with her? How do I absorb it? I don't know if I've lived in a while, I don't know if it was ever so important to be in the moment, but now it is, so how do I do it?. I will think all the time about how to manipulate but when people actually pick up on this I'm shocked, and especially before I knew what I was doingIt's funny it's like I think no one should see me and.. idkIt just doesn't feel that wrongIt just feels like a regular thingSee what I can say to get the outcomes I wantSo?. My 39 yr old overweight no-gf uncle who I'd just met and was staying with was talking about how he'd been suicidal for a lot of his lifeSaid the reason he hasn't done it is because family would be sadI was trying to motivate him and told him that no one would really care if he died, they'd be sad and then eventually over time they'd care more about the latest season of their TV show on a daily basis and that he should find personal reasons to live insteadThis didn't really stick with him I could tellI left for a walk and realized I could go back and find him deadI didn't care and just thought about how I'd steal his assets before reporting it to the policeI've thought before that my empathy is too high to be a narcissist because I do feel something or another when people are hurt, for instance, I felt this desire to motivate himBut.. yeah. I looked in the mirror and felt I was really ugly and now I feel like everyone is thinking negative things about meAt work, on this sub, my friends, etcI wonder what happens with that. From becoming more aware of my behavior and motives and giving more honest answersBefore: 18Then 24Then 30. I feel grandiose over most people because they're too weak so I have picked partners who are psychopaths or NPD but I still crave for them to be weak and try to orchestrate itI love when people like that show emotion or are vulnerable and when they're not I feel very unsafeI don't know if this is too much out of the range of normal, you want someone who is strong but who shows enough emotion to be trustworthy, but because I keep going back to these partners who are really bad for me because I've convinced myself they're just vulnerable inside and need a little push, I end up putting myself in toxic relationships and being emotionally manipulative in attempts to get to people's weak sides. I never felt jealousy, loneliness, the feeling of missing something, aggression, fear of abandonment, feeling sad about the abuse and lack of love I experienced from my parents, fear, and rarely do I feel loveI can't consciously perceive those so I always thought I just didn't feel themI think they reflect in my behavior as wellI believe they may be the strongest feelings and the strongest motivators for my actionsWhy are they on mute? It's so contradictory, is this normal in the literature?.. When describing a situation with a friend I care about a lot someone said it's fake. They said "where is the aggression". I told him I don't feel aggression. He said that if I did, I didn't know it, and I was pushing my friend away. I realized then that he was right. I went on a shroom trip and felt so abandoned, like I was a baby. I don't normally feel that I care.Loving people wrongly and suffocatingly and wondering if it's actually love at the end of the dayThe things I do are manipulative to the furtherest extent I can see and usually I don't noticeSo many layers of manipulationI think I love certain people and I deeply want connection but I love all wrong and other people hate me. They tell me I'm too much. I think they are definitely rightIf I say it's because I'm loving all wrong because I'm hurting so much inside is it just manipulation and evading responsibility?How do I stop doing this, someone please help me. I remembered I'd make fun of people for being short, fat, I was pretty aggressive and competitive starting at age 6 or so and until I was 14Learned empathy, maybe too much of whatever that was, felt guilty for hurting a fly, and now I'm back to my old ways of being hyper critical and having to stop myself from being blunt or insulting people, I'm 20 now. I don't really understand why people get offended over racist thingsI was talking with my friend who is Indian about my friend who is Arab and she said as a joke that she doesn't like brown people and I called him a "sand-n word" keep in mind the friend I talked about I feel 0 racist feelings towards whatsoever, I always had a crush on him and I respect him as a person which is rare for me, this will sound like a lie but it's genuine (he also uses the n word regularly and would give 0 shits if I called him that but he also has NPD)There was absolutely no reason to assume I was being hurtful or derogatory towards anyone except for the fact that I used a racist wordAnyway she acted like I killed her cat and we blocked each otherI'm not saying I was "in the right", I just don't think it's a matter of moralitySo what, it's just a word, I'm sure there are other ways to end racial oppression, why aren't people who get mad at this stuff doing any of thatI think theres something about people's so called "pointless" emotions that I don't quite get. If it's just a social ritual I'll follow it I guess but I do wish I understood the underlying logic.I used to care about people saying the n-word but I see my past actions as sanctimoniousness. But then again, those were *my* past actions, a person with npd, so ofc they were just from a desire to play victim and morally dominate. I don't think everyone else is. I lost most of my sense of smell for several yearsI'd smell "phantom smells" like hallucinations which communicated emotional and mental states and memories in place of real onesI don't take walks and notice my surroundings and in general I don't feel present or "there" or like I actually have a self that's experiencing consciousness. If I'm alive it's because I thought something that made me aliveI don't appreciate food but I eat it compulsively I found myself chronically distracting myself online but intentionally avoiding anything that would evoke strenuationI don't feel much sexually and masturbating feels like something I do fast to get a dopamine release. Sometimes when I don't understand my own thoughts and emotions I'll have a metaphor inside of my head that I am almost unaware ofAnd usually that metaphor when interpreted contains my actual feelings and the actual truthHair strands enough for a braid trying to be wound together with a piece of thin paper tape as if to make a brush, someone stabbing a needle and thread into the tape, puncturing it yet threading some of the hairs to the tape, attaching them while others fall throughIf I notice a thought like this I may realize that my true emotion is a fear that I am losing control and that I will be partially attached to broken ideas that are trying to put me back together and failing while the rest of me fallsConsciously, I might be thinking something totally different about a situation. Like if I want to relate to other people I manipulate prosocially, with genuine altruism, and with no personal benefit, but just like I'm the janitor or a god, some transient entity who serves but is not apartI like this roleIt's funIt's funny to think I think of myself this wayHow a human being could have been so messed upIt's betterI relate to people through fashion as well, wearing an ugly dress with flowers from 2008 that someone loved and I think is beautiful. Through learning about history, like the Roman empire, or the war that Chechnya had to face in the late 90s. Cultures, tapestries of human meaning. I go to an Orthodox Church even though I'm an atheist. I denounce modernism and individualism even though I know no authority and would rebel if one were imposed.I connect by trying to help people in ways that were uninvited and intrusive.I feel like something inferior? a spider on the wall? I love humanity, but people, I can't relate to them.I've noticed this odd behaviour over time. He's pretty impersonal and spiky most of the time, but sometimes we talk for consistent enough periods of time that we develop some sort of platonic or sexual intimacy, and then he blocks me or becomes distant with no verbal explanation.Last night he told me that I'm one of the real ones and that he appreciates me because I'm genuine. It was uncharacteristic. We kind of flirted a little bit as well. He had opened up about his emotions a bit previously and was being soft in his tone, unlike usual. I said I had to go to sleep and he said "are you sure? Goodnight then" and when I messaged him today I realized he'd blocked meHe said that once before, "are you sure you want to leave" before blocking me a few months agoBut there were other times where he just kind of became distant after any level of emotional closenessI get it I guess, but it's weird. I don't entirely understand himIt used to really hurt me but now I didn't notice any feeling when I couldn't send that message other than maybe a sigh stuck in my chestI guess he's someone I've loved in a sense, in a truer way, because I'm not emotionally dependent on him as much, I just appreciate his existence.I trust only this subs analytical minds. Self state #1: Nothing hurts me, I am not fragile or reliant, I can bend as I need to. People having authority doesn't bother me because I can just use the situation to achieve goals which are more important than short-term admiration. I love flirting with customers at my job, I don't care how old, to manipulate them into giving me tips. I believe I am responsible for the increase in tips because I'm attractive. I will do anything for my goals and don't care much about rules. I am lighthearted and thick skinned and can seem very stoic, socially intelligent, kind, and patient to others because I rarely let my emotions, which there are few of, affect how I act. I feel hope and commitment towards getting better, healing myself, having a family one day, and part of me loves humanity no matter how silly they can be. I respect deep cultures and the tapestry of human meaning, blending into it but not being subjugated.When I'm aloneSelf state #2: I'm extremely depressed and empty. I dislike myself, not even because I know myself, but like a stranger. I feel overwhelmingly lost. I find comfort in the image of myself as an empty sky, vacuous, vacant, without having to fake anything or hold content that will hurt me. I dread the image of myself as having content, but being inferior. I feel intense grief about a person I left a relationship with. I feel some very vague sense of loneliness and ponder why I have absolutely no one close to me and why I've done this and how I could bridge the gap, but others seem inferior and scary.It's not all bad. I scroll for hours on social media and feel some happiness listening to music. It's a normal day. It's not all bad. But I'm just not really a coherent self. I don't trust myself. I fantasize about success and power, I check myself in the mirror and put makeup for no one but myself to fix perceived flaws, I take pictures and delete most of them, edit one if I post it.I am absolutely certain that once I get plastic surgery I'll have immense privilege and I'll get able to be at the top in the eyes of others. I will fix my problems and do everything I need to succeed.If I don't, I'm wasting my life. There's nothing after this, I can't waste it feeling like this. I feel unsafe and time is passing.It feels much easier to write about the 1st as opposed to the 2nd self state.I show a lot of the traits of a narc but similarly to quiet BPD, the effects are usually ambiguous to others and mostly impact me internally.I'm not at all shy and I'm actually pretty high in extroversion but I'm quite asocial and tend to really only interact with people who offer supply.I think my apathy towards most people and the world and myself possibly contributes to dampened effects of NPD. I rarely feel jealous, maybe because I just don't ever feel that anyone is superior to me.I rarely start fights because often times when people insult me I literally just don't care.When people try to take authority over me I often just laugh to myself and can appreciate the game of being a "good little worker" and only get angry if they play with me.Part of me enjoys manipulating to get ahead in the world and is very ambitious, part of me does feel some guilt and general disgust with myself and a desire to have genuine and vulnerable relationships with others and feels incapable and inhibited. Very contradictory self states I guess.But oftentimes I almost view myself and others as natural disasters when we do harm to each other and rarely take things personally anymore. This can seem to others like I have super high emotional intelligence, patience, and virtue. Maybe I do, and I'm not NPD or sociopathic, I'm just normal and healthy.But I can be impulsive and aggressive in a way that I can mask to others. I can also be attached and desperate for approval from very specific people. Internally I am extremely depressed, I feel empty, I often don't have self awareness, I feel dissociative, and I'm just not at all happy. I'm really quite miserable. And of course I come from a background of severe trauma which wasn't likely to leave me unscathed.I am grandiose and I don't relate to other people. Clearly there's something wrong but idk about the correct terminology. I don't consciously tend to feel fear. I can hold spiders and stuff. I used to have a fear of spiders as well as trypophobia but I kind of just stopped being scared.I've been in life threatening situations a few times and hardly felt any reaction. For example: almost getting into a car accident and being like 15 feet away from a bear with no bearspray.It can be a bit dangerous because I sometimes engage in reckless behaviour like walking on dangerous roads or driving a bit recklessly, although I do try to control this through conscious regulation, I don't have a death wish.But I do feel anxiety, shame, and certain types of mental fear. I am concerned that if I were convicted of a crime, the diagnosis would be used as evidence of my guilt. I've heard of that happening with ASPD.I don't see any marked benefits except more clarity and the ability to speak with a professional about my symptoms as well as maybe narc-specific therapy in the future.Otherwise I would try to go into therapy for depression and anxiety, but I am concerned that I couldn't be totally honest in a way that'd help me heal.I intuit that people can't really understand me out of the context of NPD. I've run into this problem where when I tried to be honest, others assumed that my actual thoughts were just "intrusive thoughts about bad things" or they didn't really understand the scope of the core emptiness/complex dissociation. Others haven't understood my goals for development.They haven't understood the existential nature of my mental health problems since it's a personality disorder rather than an already-formed-person experiencing a disorder.I totally get it. They're just trying to empathise under the assumption that I am like them. But it would help if someone could be aware that I'm not and could try to meet me where I'm at.I could also continue what I'm doing and work on myself without a therapist which has been pretty successful so far.Thoughts?. For explaining my thought process to someone asking how to identify narcissists, literally telling her how to identify someone like me.This shows the real intentions of the mods in those subreddits.They just want a group they can channel all of their hatred onto and feel like victims. They don't care actual people get the help they need to move on in the world.
    In the model underpinning schema therapy, there is a mode called the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode. I've read about it a few times, and I just noticed it come up today in myself, I think. I wanted to document it here, so maybe I can become more quickly alert to it in future - because like other maladaptive modes, I feel it really inhibits me, or can do at least.From my recollection the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode is a coping mode in the model. That means there is some underlying vulnerability or distress or unmet need, and this mode is a state of mind and body that we can flip into as a way of reacting or managing what's underneath.I think when I'm in my Paranoid Overcontroller Mode, I become overly fixated and suspicious of other people, maybe particularly one person or two for whatever reason. I suppose there's something about them that I'm fearful of underneath, or something about them that reminds me of someone or some situation in the past the caused me harm. My thoughts turn to and obsess over all the things dry don't like about this person. There is a sense of mistrust. I don't like to look them in the eye, I want to keep away from them, there is a feeling that they are keeping something from me, that they are somehow corrupt, wrong, dangerous, hiding something, manipulative, not truthful, not honest, in authentic. I can even imagine them turning other people against me, thinking negatively about me and talking negatively about me, criticising me with others. That's paranoia. I watch their movements and behaviours, and listen to what they have to say, and my mind is heavily skewed to picking up the evidence to support this from whatever they're saying or doing. It's a form of rumination....The problem is that when I'm in this mode, I don't see the whole person - just the negative aspects that maybe I want to see. I kind of don't want to see the positives. I'm devaluing them. I'm not being empathic, understanding or compassionate. I lose connection to that person. But more than that. I disconnected from the world and other people. I am lost in my own thoughts - just spinning around. I'm cut off from reality, viewing the world through a distorted lens where people are either for me or against me, and I'm collecting the evidence.Gosh! Now I'm reflecting on it, I can see that this mode is somewhat present quite a lot of the time. It's just that today I noticed that was particularly strong, and directed towards one person who I've been with over the last few days. Another man. I guess from the outside looking in at me, people might sense that I am cut off, self absorbed, and that my thoughts are negative and suspicious even. And I wonder if it's on my face. I'm pretty sure it must be, to a degree. Obviously I can't tell that for sure. But there is a chance at least that they pick up on my negative mood, and so might not want to interact or connect with me. I kind of feel that.So I'm really losing out when this mode is strong. I'm not a happy person that I want to be, and people might be more distant from me. It's actually sad. Suddenly I have some compassion for myself coming up. I feel sad for the situation....Where did this come from?A memory of my father immediately pops up in my mind. He's scowling, frowning. His face is distorted. I can tell that he is suspicious of others, he's really paranoid in that moment.Gosh! I guess I picked that up from him! He was suspicious have lots of people when I was a child, and even today he is quite mistrustful of people, although he has mellowed in his older age. But back then he was paranoid about my Mum, her friends, people he worked with, even me and my sister. ...There is a memory, a very strong one, when I was a teenager. It was bedtime. My dad was already upstairs in the spare room. Him and Mum weren't sleeping in the same room by then. Mistrust. Hatred. Fear. Between them. I was in my room. My mum came upstairs. Before she went into the main bedroom, she went to the spare room when my dad was "sleeping" - because he wasn't, as it turned out - and locked the door from the outside. I think I asked her not to do it, but there was something like revenge going on for something he had done earlier in the day. She was less than 3m away from the lock door when my dad jumped up and started banging ferociously on it. He was banging so hard that he started to punch a hole. My mum ran downstairs and told me to come with her. I was on the landing by now. The hole appeared in the door. Splinters of wood were flying over the landing. I could see his fist. His hand was bloody. I could see has distorted face. He asked me to unlock the door. He said I should call the police. I was something like 13 or 14. I didn't want to do that. I was scared of him. But I did unlock the door with the key that was maybe on the floor or something. As soon as it opened I stood back. He ran out and I pretended to faint. I just didn't want to interact with him. So I pretended. He ran downstairs saying that he was going to call the police. I then snapped out of my "faint", and ran behind him shouting "No! Don't!" I remember stopping him when he was at the phone. My mum was outside, she called to me to say come next door - to the neighbours. And I did. I ran out.Later on, in our neighbours' living room, late at night, totally embarrassed, scared, lonely - I was on the sofa, my mum and the wife of the couple next door were with me. My dad was allowed into the house by the husband. Dad came into the room, telling all of us that my mum had locked the door and was planning to burn down the house and kill him.That really wasn't true. But he was totally paranoid. Our neighbours tried to calm him down. Eventually he left and went back to our home. My mum and I slept at our neighbours house that night. I was in my school uniform.I can feel my younger self, shocked, scared, distressed, frustrated, lonely, worried, angry, sad, deflated, embarrassed, guilty, numb.I'm sad for him now. Right now.I feel for him....What I like about the schema approach is that it's not just about countering or challenging the negative or inhibiting thoughts and actions in the here and now. It's not saying simply, "Don't do that! Stop thinking like that! Think positively!" It's about understanding where coping styles come from, trying to swim down to the bottom of the ocean, and connect with the lost, wounded child underneath - the child who was neglected and traumatised. It's about having an understanding the how the wounds of the past relate to the present, and showing - or learning to show - care for those wounds and vulnerabilities.So, to myself today I say, I know I didn't like my dad as a child or teenager. I was often very scared of him. I wanted to be nothing like him. But somehow, and I inherited his negative thinking patterns and behaviours. There is shame around that.But it's not my fault that I have this tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. On one level I inherited it from my dad. Not purely. My mum also has a tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. But for the moment I'm thinking about that memory with my dad, I'm thinking about how his paranoia Took over and lead to violent reaction that stayed strong in my memory for many decades. When I feel that paranoia, when I recognise that suspicious mode, it doesn't make me a bad person. There is a good reason why this habit of mind has come about. Patterns of mind that I inherited from my parents.I really forgive myself. I do.I genuinely feel lighter in my body. I feel lighter in my mind, I feel like I can let go of the paranoid thoughts about the man I'm with at the moment in our group. ...But ... It's interesting because I can now see how my mind is associating the person I am paranoid about with my father. My mind is relating this man today with my dad and how he treated me and my mum in the past. Ah! I see. I see.Fear of my father. Paranoia about his behaviours. Scared of his threats.Spotting similar signals in people today, and feeling threatened. Paranoia.It's understandable. Feeling on edge around certain people because of how my mind associate them with people who threatened me in the past. Again, it's not my fault. But I feel able to let this go. So it's not just about inheritance of certain patterns. It's to do with how I related to my parents as well. I think those two factors are behind my own paranoid thinking today....I want to connect. I want more lightness and freedom in my body and mind. I don't want to be trapped in this paranoid mode that keeps me separate from everyone else.I hope I remember about how things in the past that I had no control over brought about these inhibiting patterns of mind. I hope that I can keep that memory so I can forgive myself again and again, and in so doing let go, and find more freedom and happiness and connection....I think its best to finish this by taking a moment to remember that small, frightened child, and the frightened teenager, too - and just show a lot of understanding to them - to me. In my mind my self as I am now - my big self - is hugging my child self and my teen self. I am showing sorrow, sadness, care, Love, I am kissing them on the forehead as they cuddle up next to me. I say to them,"I'm so sorry that you were frightened and fearful for your own safety. I'm so sorry."I say to myself, looking in an imaginary mirror opposite where we are sitting,"I'm here now. I'm big and I'm strong, and I'm a good bloke - despite everything - I can be a good bloke very often, and I really do try. People are not against me. They want to connect. And although I'm fearful of how people will treat me, 99% of the time people treat me very well."It's true.I've had a few noticeable moments of shame in the past couple of days.As part of pulling myself out of negative states, I've been reflecting on the different components of my experience of shame. I thought I'd document and share them here, rather than the issues of what happened and when. It's because similar patterns keep appearing, and I find it useful to analyse the experience - literally, pick apart - to help me manage and respond more effectively. It's like being able to see all the different parts of the experience, so that I can attend to them separately, and therefore more productively, rather than rolling around in a quagmire of distress.It would be interesting if other people wanted to comment or add their own experience....Anatomy of Shame.Shame for me seems to involve:A strong Inner Critic: I notice this in sentences I say to myself such as, "God! I'm such an idiot." ... or "I'm so stupid." ... or "That was so embarrassing! Ugh!" Or, it could manifest as a projection onto other people, imagining them to be thinking or talking negatively about me, criticising me behind my back or while I'm with them etc. Or I notice it in the images of other people's crumpled, disapproving faces, or fleeting scenes in my mind in which I am shunned from other people or some group.A felt sense of anxiety and distress: I notice uncomfortable or distressing sensations run through my whole body. In particular, I notice an urge to cover up or hide myself. My hands and arms want to move into my body and over my face as if to protect or hide away - from imagined scorn of others.An urge to run away: I see this as a kind of behavioural avoidance. I want to be away from people, run and hide myself. My body is twitching to "get out of there".Rumination: I notice that I obsessively think over the thing that "I did" that caused me to feel ashamed. Over and over, my mind rehearsing the scene of the incident, trying to work out "how bad" the supposedly shameful act was.Worry: I notice worry thoughts, which are similar to rumination but are about the future. "What will people think?" ... "Will people treat me differently?" ... The worry includes an obsessive look for evidence in the past. That is, the rumination of "What happened" ties in with the worry about "the consequences". One feeds the other.Externalised Anger: If I am experiencing shame by proxy of another person's behaviour, particularly someone who is close to me, then I notice Anger directed toward them. For example, if a family member - or someone associated with me - behaves in a way that I think is "shameful" to me, then I notice how i get enraged with their behaviour. It's like my inner critic is turned outwards to other people, as if I were still connected to the shameful act as if Ihad committed it.Controlling behaviour: This can come in many forms. It could be about stopping or controlling or correcting other people's so called "shameful" behaviour. I think the externalising anger can be underneath this, particular if I go into a scolding or lecturing mode. Controlling could also be about trying to rectify how people perceive me by trying to manage my behaviour to be more preferable to them, as I see it. It could be about trying to "work on myself more" so that I don't repeat the shameful act again in an overt way. Attacking Others: This stems from that externalising anger as well. Perhaps if I feel slighted by others, I might verbally or even sometimes - thankfully rarely - physically move to attack them. I see this as a defence against the feelings of shame, using blame and attack to regain a sense of power and strength. I also do this attack vovertly, internally devaluing other people while perhaps acting charming on the surface to control how they perceive me.Compulsive self-soothing: I notice the urge to use self-soothing behavioirs to find relief from the feelings of shame and distress in my body. This might involve something like comfort eating or the likes. Or, it includes a kind of grandiosity. Mirror-gazing after a shame attack, for example, provides an ego-boost through the form of self-admiration (about my appearance or me as aperson) or coinciding thoughts of my own superiority. Or it could be writing a post to get some upvotes and congratulation from people here. ;)So... There are some elements of shame that I notice. What about yours?. When I'm around other people, I have often had that feeling that I should be likeable to the other person I'm with."Should"It's a feeling that anything other than coming across as perfectly buoyant and upbeat is wrong, that people won't like it, that they'll judge me and think badly of me; that I will be ostracised, shamed. I was just sitting with someone I know and feeling that feeling that I need to be on my best behaviour with him. For him. I think it's heightened because the person I'm with is so bloody positive and energised himself. That feeling of needing to perform as the good person is more prominent with certain people like this.A memory pops up from childhood: of me being the smiling child for the guests we had at home.That's what we did as a family when people came round. I guess not always. But it was often enough to leave a relatively strong imprint. My Mum did it in particular, and I followed suit. A presentation mode. False. And I'm not just saying that because the "false self" is a buzz term for us here. She was all smiley and upbeat. I think at the time I did see that it wasn't her usual behaviour, but l also think I thought that's just what we did with guests.I continued that into adulthood, that presentation mode of politeness. Affable. Accommodating. Showing that I was conscientious of other people's feelings. Showing I'm listening by overly nodding, mirroring expressions in the other person, being all smiley and positive glow. The problem was, of course, that I often hid how I was really feeling, which meant that - I think - I couldn't connect with people. The energy required to maintain that "attentive face" was also difficult to uphold. I would frequently leave social situations to be on my own - in the bathroom, mainly - just to not smile for a little bit.I was just programmed to be like that with people.I also got an ego boost out of it, though - at least for a little while at these social events. I would show up to as "The Happy Person" ... "The Charming Listener." Yes, i'd get high on that and look down on people who were not looking happy and cheerful, but instead "miserable" to my mind. Or worse. I really did devalue people consistently in my social groups. Although I turned up all smiles to events, afterwards I would very often criticise pretty much everyone in our social circle who wa there. There wasn't really anyone who wasn't a target of my critique at some point or other. I would moan to my partner that I didn't like these people and that I didn't want to see them. At a couple of points, he made comments about us having fewer and fewer friends because of my judgements....The thing is, these patterns were still active relatively recently. I think I did try to get better around this issue since 2020, but it's really in the last year or so - since self-awareness - that things have changed for the better.I do feel increasingly like I can turn up to social situations and show how I feel - or at least enough to feel real inside. I feel like I have managed to uncover a real self with me, more or less, which I based on how I feel and how I want to come across.But ... Old habits die hard, and sitting with our friend just now, I felt that pull to be the polite, attentive, jolly listener... But - yay! - I noticed this, and made an effort to not yield to those patterns. I presented more how I was (am) feeling. A bit non-descript. A bit not bothered all in all.And then it came to me: it doesn't matter if he doesn't like me. Because look, my emotions, my feelings, don't make a bad or unlikeable person. My feelings are ok, and I don't gave to hide them.I looked across at him and saw him all bubbly and happy. He's a healthy fellow, and generally positive. And I had an image of myself at the same time as different, separate. Two different guys with different feelings, doing OK sitting next to each other, with neither one particularly accommodating the other. I think this is nice to notice. I am - god dammit - gradually becoming my own self, and showing people who I am and how I feel....There are some obstacles to this process external to my own habits, namely people who overtly say to me that I should look of act differently, smile more etc. It's my partner in particular. He also has narc tendencies, and seems to get over-anxious as to how I show up. I have to fairly often say that I'm fine as I am when I'm not "smiling with teeth" as he says. It's a bit of a joke in some ways, but it's also annoying because it's so frequent. And I just want to have my face not in a smiling position in certain situations. I notice that it's when we're around other people. And I'm really not being a dick or anything. And I know, of course, that it is right to show up civil and polite to a degree. Just not so much.Anyway, I don't want to be too defensive or irritable about it. But it is a thing to deal with. Just again, though: I'm not going back in that happy-faced box. I know that a real me exists, I'm cultivating him, and I'm putting him out there.So something really shifted today. Large crack in the ground stylee. I'm sure it'll close again. Probably. But this is to document the \*massive gaping hole\* that has just vomitted everywhere.Sorry for the post splurge. But some cool things came out. I felt rage and distress and loneliness and panic ... Nothing new. But somehow I managed to let it be there more than before. YES!I wanted to run, punch, scream, ... I felt like everything was falling down, whipping up. I didn't know who I was. This is not anything new. It happens fairly frequently. But I somehow had more room to be ok with it today.I felt, and still feel, slightly more buzzy than usual. It'll pass, but ... I said to a friend: *I am bundle of criss-crossed and flailing live wires. With a beard. And some not too bad pecs now. And the delicious glimmer of abs. And a nice smile.*I do feel that this criss-crossedness is a part of me - a big part - that I do hide from myself and others.I am a bit bonkers. My thoughts are totally wild. I don't have psychosis, but my imagination is insane and I get also sorts of violent and scary thoughts popping in a lot. Not all the time. But it can happen.My moods flit around like ping pong balls in a tiny metal room. I try to cover it up by looking \*cool\* and \*hot\* and \*sharp\* and \*nice\* and \*calm\* ... and I can be all those things, but I'm also ... underneath ... this bundle of live wires sparking off.I feel more ok with that.This is me, bitches!!But you already knew ... It was me who had to catch up....bla bla blaHere's the thing:I suddenly realised that everyone else is a bundle of nerves with a cover.AND ... I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO BE NICE TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE MEEEE. Or could be one day, so it's good to be nice.AND ...I got chatting with one person who I previously was really irritated by, and FELT CONNECTION and was more my bonkers self, and just said what was on my mind, and SHE LAUGHED!!! And we had a connection, and it was cooooooooooooooool.Maybe if I show my anger and dance fun and sadness and terror and style and spunkiness and cockiness and my fragility and mood and terror and delight and mania and tiny-ness and wish to doninate ... somehow I'll find myself and it'll help.This is why I look in mirrors.Title.It's so awful.When I reveal the depths of whatever this is .... out comes the lava ..... Panic.Right now.Flashing images of the guy on the train platform coming towards me with his terrifyingly distorted face, attacking me.Flashing images of me attacking everyone on this train.Me going mad.Distress like a tornado in my body.The feeling of MUST GET OUT OF HERE.NOW....Shift.To sadness. I can cope. ...I can't afford it. Few can.This group is basically all there is for working things out.It really fucking annoys me how fucking expensive therapy is.I paid £180 an hour from November to February. Specialist in Npd. All my savings.OK. But ...That's ... four and a half hour long piano lessons.At least the therapist is happy. Woop! Woop! Bringing in the cash.OK. More pockets of unknown shite still there.Watching videos of therapists talk about narcissism.I sense my reactivity towards what they are saying.Why do therapists trigger me so much? Fuck sake.I just want to jump on them and beat them to a pulp. Sometimes I have imagined slitting their throats. Or jumping on their faces and punching and punching. They bring up this rage that I quickly stifle. But I know that the stifling is not helping me.iI stifle. All the time. I shut down my rage because it feels totally unacceptable.Well... that monster is still there inside, but rather than feeling scared, I think he's sexy as hell. Nope. That's yet more grandiosity.It's that deep rage and that come with tears. It's that feeling of being judged so deeply by another person. A distress that immediately makes me want to flip out and attack and blame.Oh fuck.It's like, everything I do is about making myself look good to others, including the progress I've made with my disorder. Posts. Comments. Everything. Style. Politeness. Being nice. Acting. Trying. Working on myself.I can't get out of it.I can't make exact sense of this.I'm really, really fucking horny.I'm getting much better at tolerating not getting upvoted.Yay! Fuck you, social belonging anxiety. Woof!It's rather silly for a 40-something to be concerned about these things, but I know you know how it feels. We all want it. *Gimme that upvote high!!!*And:*Where's my upvote, BITCH!!!?*And:*No one loves me. I'm basically invisible / about to die.*And:*Terrible!!! I did something that people didn't like!!!*You know, don't get me wrong, I still have these thoughts and feelings. But they aren't nearly as intense. Nearly. ;)When I first joined the sub and for a fair while after, I would more frequently delete posts that didn't receive many upvotes. Out of shame, having been slumped at home in sadness and despair.I still do occasionally delete posts. But the last time was because I felt I wasn't being myself - maybe not even a good reason to delete. But anyways. I'm generally getting better at staying with what I've put out - you know, if I feel it's real, I guess - whether or not it flies so well.To me, this is progress. Ding ding! I am standing up for myself more, being less wavering and tossed around by what people think, and caring less about every opinion I receive or don't, or getting caught up if I do something that is "successful" or not.Yay. Growth in confidence. Woop! Woop!I've also noticed I feel more capable being honest about my thoughts, rather than hiding them in case they are criticised....Biff! Another angle would be:Fuck it. I'm invincible, mate!!🤘(P.S. I'm not. Don't hate me. 😁)...Edit: Blimey! This is a test! 😁. Today I have been grandiose in the morning, depressed variously throughout the afternoon, and calm and steady in the evening. But right now, I am really grateful for this journey of discovery. Right now, I don't care about the downs. I know that they'll come again, and I'll absolutely hate it. There will be suicidal ideation and depression and shame. But there is also something about all those things that provides an opportunity.I really love those moments when the downs turn into opportunities for discovery and learning. It's like finding little pieces of the puzzle and putting them together. I love building that picture and working it out over time. I love how I've gone from a really flimsy smiling face of a person, hiding all the anger and doubt and anxiety and shame and torment, to someone with more of a sense of who I am, and able to express much more of what's going on inside, and feel like a real person with an actual self. That is really cool! I still have some weird experiences in terms of feeling fake, feeling empty, suddenly feeling very close to people and loving, before then feeling totally separate and isolated and full of hate and disdain. But I try to be mindful of what is going on, challenge my thoughts and feelings as best I can, and try to find some middle ground.I feel sorry for my young self before self-awareness I was trapped and very troubled. I raged a lot and had terrible panic everyday. Body dysmorphia. Eating disorders. OCD. Hypochondria. The works. All based around this very narcissistic personality structure that I had no clue about at the time, really. But I did the best that I could. I didn't know any better. It's nice to overcome a lot of that, even though the remnants are still there. I can still be pulled down by various things, but not nearly as strongly.My mind may never be completely stable. But in a way, I would kind of hate if that happened. I enjoy this journey where the weirdness of my brain and my reactions to things puzzles me, and drives me to find a solution. ...Late this afternoon, I was tired from - quite frankly - overworking. Again. I had a bit of a low point. Someone I'm working with was not getting their work done and it felt like it was really holding me back. I felt the anger and frustration and blame. I felt, too, the sadness underneath, and I started crying to myself, just walking down the street. It happens. Just gentle, quiet tears of frustration. It was part sadness and part kicking-and-screaming and blaming.I imagined my various 'inner good parents' step in with their messages that would calm me down. The message that really hit home was "I know you are so tired and frustrated. Now, this is what we're going to do... We're going to take it one step at a time. We're going to remember all the good things you've been able to do today..." etc etc. It really helped soothe me and shifted me into a more calm and steady state where I felt capable and strong.That was a cool experience. It's little things like that that drive me on. Every day. Every day I work on myself. Every interaction with people is hard in some way. But ... I am just trying to balance so much and make this life work as best as it can. It involves a lot of self-confrontation, moderating, taming, refining, tempering, nudging forward, holding back ... But I love this journey, as rocky as it may be.I'm sure I'll be desperately low tomorrow over some thing. But I'm also sure I'll find a way out. I know that by now.It is also seriously great to meet and hang out with some of the most deep, caring (lol) and inspiring people I've ever known, and feel that connection between us.Yay!. Which one do I choose for my story of growth and recovery? *Trigger Warning.*Which one do I go for for my suicidal ideation? *Upbeat Talk.*...Ah ha ... That pattern of childish rebellion ... That feeling of being caged in, and the explosion out ... That [Rhombicosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicosidodecahedron) being forced through a square hole ...That core need for autonomy childhood, chronically unmet ... ...*Well done, Peanut. Feel the feelings. Attend to your inner child.* Nope!I want to have a party and do wild mock interpretative dancing a la Kate Bush in the 1980s in front of everyone without drinking a drop of alcohol because I'm that special that I can do that. I hope everyone is jealous.*Don't tell me what to do!*Thanks. Venting - advice requested....*Chooses Flair. Cries.*. No I did not.I spent a considerable amount of time, picking, putting on, checking, enjoying my reflection, imagining what people will think, imagining people admire my looks, semi-consciously rehearsing my modest replies.Started with that tiny t-shirt that no one wears on a Tuesday work day. Tucked in. Ugh! Yes. But too much. Too obvious, complete with my sparkly glasses and over-quaffed hair. Such a narc. But actually: who cares!! Fuck 'em! Actually, shit! I do care. Too much. Try on that shirt over the top for the more casual look. Hm. Terrible shoulder projection. Tucked in. Yes!!! So sexy!!! But no, obvious porn star wannabe again. Untuck shirt and t-shirt. The sad compromise. Phew. I look good not too good. Totally casual. But you can still see my workout progress.Check mirror just one more time, or three, and... stare for a second, and... breakfast! "I'm coming!"*he glows into the kitchen*THE LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT.Hang on a mo...Other people are not two dimensional caricatures. Ooooooooo....They may look a certain way in their demeanour, but underneath is this mysterious Pandora's box of possibilities.They may look miserable right now. But they might suddenly burst into jokes and giggles.They may appear calm and sensible to me on first impression, but they may turn out to be rather lazy or slightly bonkers today.It's difficult to know what to expect. People surprise.Oh yeah! 😁...Does anyone else have this where they very easily and quickly box people into two dimensional "You are this or that"? Is this particular an NPD or PD thing? I kind of think it might be. I've noticed that I very easily seem to do this compared with others around me. When I cast my silly judgements or assessments of people, for example, my partner or friends suggest that things are more complex, and that I'm being too inflexible in my view.So, sitting on this train home, looking at people around me, it feels cool and nice and open in my body to shift this more fixed perspective of people towards something more complex and dynamic and surprising.Oh!. I have found this hard in life, accepting and appreciating other people's talents and abilities and skills and achievements and successes. Even close friends. Even my partner.But ... it's something I've worked on quite a bit over many years. It's gotten easier. And more often I can find myself actually enjoying other people's talents, rather than feeling that tug of envy in my chest.Tonight we went to a birthday party. Cheesy music on the dance floor. I work in music and have spent a lifetime listening to music as a kind of "work". What can I learn from this musician? How can I be as good or better than them? Why aren't I successful? Fantasising about my own potential. etc etc You know the drill.Tonight, I noticed that I just enjoyed the music and the musicians without comparing myself or getting twitchy about my own abilities or status (or lack of status) as a musician.I thought, "Oh, this is what normal people must feel like listening to music."It was ... very nice.To reduce stigma, some refer to BPD as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.Would you re-name NPD for a similar purpose? If so, what?I'm going with SERD for now: Self-Esteem Regulation Disorder, which I think I picked up from elsewhere. I think it would help me explain the symptoms and behaviour to people. I wonder if I would feel less isolated and less concerned talking about it.Also, SERD just rolls off the tongue. Clearly.SERD! 🌈. It's such a bad and swift turnaround, it's also funny.I should really know better by now. But I contine to fool myself, it seems.Us self-aware narcs are not always so different from (supposedly) healthy people.Everyone has narcissistic defences. Ours are just more pronounced and much more dysfunctional.But everyone has that armour, or can do.But here's our advantage as the self-aware crowd. We (hopefully, but not always) \*recognise\* at least some of our defences. And because we have a tendency towards hypersensitivity, hypervigilance, and over-analysis, we may (I think) see more of the layers of our defences, the subtleties and nuances, and talk openly about them (here at least). On average, I'd say most people don't....Defences come in all guises. Grandiosity, yes. Going on the attack. Antagonism. Angry rumination. Martyrdom. Complaining. But also just simple detachment from emotions.Everyone does this.Last night I was with a few friends at dinner. One friend brought up how she was worried about her Mum and Dad, the latter in particular because he was experiencing pain I his side, had previously had cancer, but had been ignoring the pain and the doctor or telling anyone until just recently. She shared her news and revealed a glimpse of her fears. I felt like she was human and I was human. I felt connection to her where previously I was struggling.Within surely less than a minute, another friend chipped in to say something like, "It's probably nothing", and turned the conversation towards something else. The friend with the unwell Dad followed along. The window of vulnerability opened and was quickly closed. I felt the moment where we could connect fall away from me.There it was in the group. Detachment. Cutting off from emotions that might be "too much", "awkward" or "intolerable".I felt lonely again, me with my feelings I sensed there was less room for. I closed up....When I teach my piano students, I try to notice my own state or mode as much as possible, and how the student is responding. I notice that when I've been in a more grandiose state, it feels fun and I feel awesome, and students may tag along with the energy for a while. Perhaps there is some comfort in being with a teacher who distracts them from their own feelings, through becoming the centre of attention in my jokes or quirkiness or through playing in a show-off or extravagant manner. But the sense of comfort and ease in the room doesn't last long. Quite quickly I notice that I become disconnected from the student. They are "over there" and I am "over here". We aren't vibing off each other.I think this is problematic for the student and the teaching, particularly in a one to one teaching context. The disconnection feels quite isolating for both of us. Quite lonely and even a bit scary for the student. In order for the learning to be "good", they need a sense of secure connection with the teacher. And it's true. When I'm in a more balanced, emotionally in-touch state, in tune with what's going on within me, sensing what is happening potentially in the student, verbally checking in with them and listening to their responses, and yet having that overall sense of stability and level-headedness, then the teaching can work better. I notice that students relax more and open up. They share their feelings about playing and we work to resolve problems that I could only know about if they are shared. Or it could be about them sharing their interests or preferences for the direction of travel in the lessons. That opening up allows them their autonomy, which is another key ingredient to success when we work together: I'm doing some guiding, but they are also participating and speaking up about what feels right for them in that moment. If I'm grandiose or detached - not checking in, not open about my own experience - then they don't have so much room to express themselves, and the lessons are about me more than them. And that's not good.I'm not saying that the good teaching is absolutely and totally dependent on my behaviour. But how I show up has at least some impact. And it is my responsibility, I believe, as the adult and professional, to think about these things and try to do my best for the client. Grandiosity is not totally awful and can create some kind of spark in the room. It can even lift people for a while, which is no bad thing. But if it is too strong or too prolonged, disconnection entails, and the learning process - and the joy of music - falls a bit flat....A core part of me, however much I deny it when I'm grandiose or emotionally detached, yearns for connection. I think we all do. It's a fundamental human need.I s'pose this post is aiming at a few things. A reminder for myself to notice that grandiosity or detachment within myself, and to try to find ways of softening the armour, to be more open, even vulnerable, to foster connection with others.I can't deny that there's also a bit of "come on, guys" to this post. I like you for you. Sometimes I feel that our defences get in the way of connecting here, in this special place - where we have that opportunity to connect. ...I say: let's go for it.If you are anything like me, you are sensitive, you have a sensitive temperament. People have told you that you are reading into things that aren't there. You are told that you are too much, too intense, think too much, are full of woe, or have too much energy, too happy, even.It can be lonely being an emotional and sensitive person. It can become easier to put forward what we think is an acceptable presentation of ourselves for others, hiding the fluid and intense feelings underneath. At the same time, it can feel like very few people seem to understand our emotional landscape inside, so we retreat inwards, becoming hyperautonomous and over-introspective, lost in our own thoughts, analysing our feelings, maybe seeing them as superior to that of others.These are perhaps some of the ways that narcissism has manifested in me, which leads to other self-interested behaviours that add to the suffering of feeling lonely and not understood, alien....But the intense feelings are also a gift. This is a tricky line to tread, because it can be easy - certainly for me - to over-treasure and over-personalise these gifts as "ours", making us special, better. So we have to be on guard for this kind of thinking that further separates us from other people, when what we really need is connection and understanding.At the same time, I think we can enjoy our emotions and find solace within them. Intense emotions allow me to experience life with greater passion. I find fulfilment through sorrow and grief, not just resting on everyday, superficial emotions. I have many emotional peaks throughout my days. They can be tough, but I am also grateful for them. It has been a difficult life sometimes. But rich. Very rich. Just being in my body every day.Maybe a view that accounts for both sides of the coin can help keep us level-headed. We are both unlucky and lucky. Recognising the pluses and minuses gives me a sense of balance, and both limits my tendency towards self-aggrandisement and keeps me from a sense of unhelpful self-pity....One of the things I like about this forum is that it is filled with intense people, quite willing to go to the depths. Very fulfilling. I am glad.We can get better. ...Another low effort post.Oh! ...Low effort post. Sorry. But that's it.I had a post earlier about what being kind to ourselves means to different people here.It occurred to me that - of course - for many of us, we struggle to even know what it is to be kind or self-compassionate, because we didn't experience it, or it wasn't modelled to us in childhood.When I started my own journey of recovery about 13 years ago, I also really had very little clue about compassion in some respects. My attempts at compassion for others were more like grandiose manipulations of their emotions, positioning myself as "the person to lean on", being "the wise advisor" and so on. Yes, it wasn't all bad. People may have got things from the interaction. But for me, it was probably more about feeling good about myself, and seeing myself as the bigger, better, wiser person, rather than actually connecting with the person in need. I didn't really have a feeling of connection with them, I don't think. It was more: what can I get out of this interaction? If they feel good at the end, then I will feel good, and that was probably more of the main goal.Attempts at self-compassion ... ? I mean, I didn't know. I remember during therapy in 2020, my therapist "introduced" the idea of compassion to me. It was kind of new to me. I didn't really have a feeling about it. I said I would try to be compassionate to myself, but it wasn't really something I felt. It was more of a logical, cognitive exercise.One time in therapy again last year, I was doing a particular exercise in self-compassion. My therapist asked me to think about what my "healthy adult / role model" might do in a particular imagined situation. I pulled from a list of ideas I had made in the previous year, which I'd jotted down on a piece of paper. Having said out loud what I'd do, I quickly burst into tears, realising that while I knew the answer now, it was something that took me so many years to work out. I was sad for my younger self who didn't experience the compassion a child should receive, and so had to strive to learn it as an adult in a very haphazard way,Now, I do have a better understanding of being nice to myself and others, but it didn't come from me. It took effort, and I had to look for it from other people: by observing friends, characters in films and TV, and podcasters like Tara Brach - who really taught me a lot in particular.So it was a bit presumptuous of me earlier to ask people how they could be kind to themselves today, when it took me a very long time to work it out. I didn't think clearly about it.I had to outsource it. It doesn't come from us. But I do believe it's possible for us to internalise and make our own the behaviours - and eventually feelings - of other people.As I said, one personal go-to in my journey was Tara Brach. She also teachers meditation, and while I found her meditations really nice, it was really the podcast talks that were helpful. I learnt so many things through her talks. I imagined her as my new inner parent. I would speak to her in my mind's eye: "I'm stuck. What should I do?" ... And I would, because I'd listened to her so much, more and more easily imagine what she might say back to me in various situations: "I see you're hurting. I see you're angry. I'm so sorry you're struggling." Just that - that empathy delivered to myself through my imagination - was enough sometimes to help me calm down. I remember that when I couldn't sleep at nice because I was so enraged, imagining Tara Brach come to my bedside like a mother figure, sit down on the bed, rest her hand on my body and say, "I'm so sorry you're hurting right now" ... that would allow me to relax and drift off to sleep.I still struggle with real empathy sometimes, but it's better. When I can't connect properly, I can still say the words that I learnt from Tara Brach, and feel that they might have a positive impact on people like they had on me. It's like: passing on what I learnt through her. It's also far less grandiose than it used to be. I've learnt to let the other person work it out for themselves more, with just little nudges, rather than dictating how I think they "should" think or feel or reflect. Yes, there is still some grandiosity involved on my side, but it's less and less.So there you go. I just wanted to say that.No jokes or cynicism. 😁For me, it's lowering - even by just a knotch - the demands and expectations I put on myself to be productive and perfect in all spheres of life all the time.For once, not doing, but just being. Not pushing forward fast. Allowing life to unfold on its own a but more. Strolling rather than sprinting. Whoops. I dropped the juggling balls. Oh well. I'll pick them up some other time. It's be OK.That is the kind of kindness I need today. What about you? It could be completely different.I'd say these are two core features of my personality, as I currently see it. I wondered if other pwNPD relate in their own way.A comment by u/KickLongjumping4433 got me thinking about these aspects of me.In Schema, they sometimes talk of a 'Defiant Child' mode, which is an "angry response to having one’s autonomy curtailed and being told what to do."Then there is the Rebel Mode in Schema. A Schema theorist I like, David Edwards, quoted some key statements linked to this mode of behaviour: “I dislike rules and can get satisfaction from breaking them,” “I think of myself as a rebel; I often go against the established authority,” and “I enjoy being unconventional, even if it’s unpopular or I don’t fit in.” He goes onto say: "This mode externalises a backstage Defiant Child, and incorporates a narrative that portrays it as a valuable identity. Expression may range from being more passive-aggressive to being actively, even militantly rebellious."...I definitely have these elements in me. And I think it's important to keep in mind that they arise in response to a sense that autonomy is being taken away or denied. Or was in the past, as a child. We have a core need to individuate / differentiate from other people, and ... this is an undeveloped part of me. I didn't properly go through the individuation process because of my over-bearing, enmeshing mother and terrifying father. No space for 'me'.I really see where this lack of autonomy comes from in myself, and why it's such a big trigger for the defiant part of me. When I feel like my independence and sense of personal choice as an adult is undermined or unfairly questioned, like it was in childhood, I get angry really quickly. RAGE! There is a teen-like "Fuck you!" flavour to the anger. Two fingers up. Slammed doors. Vent post.I guess the rebel mode in me, if it's linked to this sense of angry defiance underneath, is the lighter and more playful version of this rage. It's the mischief in me, as I've identified many times before. Disgusting jokes. Pranks. Banter. Giggling about my misdemeanours. Revelling in the naughtiness.I've mentioned, for instance, that I see myself as quite emotionally immature in some respects, or at least that this can come forth in me fairly often. I feel an almost mischievous glee about this aspect of my personality. Again, I think it connects to that sense of rebellion: "I'll behave like a teenager, and it'll make me different, annoying, unconventional etc." But I think it also reveals that underlying angry defiance. It has a kind of: "Fuck you, social conventions!" flavour in there too. I'm not great with rules....I'm sitting on the bed - like a teenager - typing this. Ahead of me is a large mirror. Occasionally, I'm looking up and channelling that rebel / defiant mode through my face, to see what comes up.Gosh. I actually do this often throughout my day! Lol. This is the mode that pops out in the bathroom mirror, for example, when I run there to escape the adult dinner party conversations that I detest. I pull this face to myself. What is it saying? ... "Don't fuck with me!" ... "I don't give a fuck." ... "You're all a bunch of wankers." ... "Fuck this boring shit." ... Maybe I'm thinking these and similar things to myself in the mirror because I feel I can't say them to the people I'm with. Maybe I use the mirror to express or display parts of myself generally that I feel not able to say out loud. I kind of put those parts of me into the mirror, where they are safe. The mirror is a safe space to express myself. Oohhhhhhhh!...The thing is, if I follow the Schema model, then underneath all of that is the vulnerable childlike part of me. A part of me LOVES being this rebel, and wants to deny that there is anything else going on. But to do that would not do myself any favours. It would be to keep me stuck in a way of coping with life - through feeling and being rebellious (passive and active) - rather than actually attending to any wounds underneath that are driving those parts of me ... to, quite honestly, behave in ways that I can regret or bring me a sense of shame in the aftermath.So as I continue to gaze into the mirror, I also find a safe moment to express other things to myself. The mirror is my display cabinet for my deeper emotions I feel unable to share anywhere else.A sadness quickly reveals itself. Loneliness. Fatigue. Bleakness. Depression. Feeling ugly. Feeling unwanted. Feeling unloved. Totally.I spend a moment staring at my face, which shows all these emotions and more that I can't describe properly. It feels good to acknowledge that these feelings are there. I suddenly realise how tired I am.Life is tiring for many reasons. Just tapping into one particular aspect, though, it's tiring not being able to express my emotions in public, or at least *feeling* like I can't. It's tiring feeling like I have to wrap up my emotions in some publicly acceptable presentation that doesn't feel natural to me. It's tiring and frustrating. My sadness shifts to a childlike anger: "Why can't I just say what I want, how I want?! Why do I have to follow these rules of self-expression when they are so stifling and unnatural?" I feel sad again. ...And then I feel that playful rebel part of me come through. It's like a way of distracting myself from he sadness and frustration. There he is in the mirror once more, and I feel my thoughts turn to mischievous things I might think or do later in the day, just to "get my own back". Hm. Defiance. Feeling controlled again, and so engaging in thoughts and behaviours that give me a sense of taking back control, or defying the authority that I don't agree with....I do like this rebellious and defiant part of me, though. Yes, it's immature, and I can do or say some things in that mode that later induce shame, but there are also many upsides. People laugh at my stupid jokes and silly, childlike behaviour. ATTENTION! But the mood of the room lightens.It actually also works well in my work as a piano teacher, where, depending on the appropriateness of the moment, I can be playful and cheeky and poke fun at social norms (especially around music performance and assessment, for example), and it's all part of the package: the slightly quirky piano teacher, helping people escape - for 30 minutes at least - the trappings of school or adult life. I play a bit of the fool if it feels right to do that, and the intention is to lighten the mood sometimes, and give space for people to undo their social conformity, get a bit more childlike themselves and connect with and lose themselves in the music - which is what we're aiming for....I don't want to get rid of the rebel in me. He's funny and cute and energising. But I do think it would be good to recognise where he comes from as well, and tend to that sadness underneath a bit more....Now, where's my rocket. 🚀. I have gotten a lot of helpful comments to posts since I started writing here.Recently, a few people have pointed out my potential black and white thinking on various situations. On reflection, I do see that I still struggle with this style of split-off thinking and perception of myself, other people and the world around me.My understanding is that this is a feature of NPD. I just re-watched a HealNPD YouTube video on integration and splitting, and related to it a lot.I generally see myself as split into 'parts' that feel radically different from one another. Some I instinctively feel are 'all good' while others I perceive as 'all bad'. Well, that is my tendency anyhow. I am trying to enjoy and appreciate that sides that I previously felt terrified to acknowledge. And I am also experimenting right now in seeing the downsides of my "pure hearted" parts. But my mental reflex is still to see these parts as cut off from one another and either dastardly or wholesome. It feels hard right now to perceive a middle ground. Grey areas in my thinking are appearing, I guess. But it takes conscious effort to think like this.I also have the habit of associating my "real self" with these different parts at any given time. When I'm in a low mood, I can easily think, "Oh. That's the real me." But when I'm grandiose or otherwise, I think just the same and ignore the low mood from before. In either state, it feels difficult to imagine that the "real me" is both or the opposite of where I am currently at. I am also obsessed with trying to figure out who "I really am". It's another mental reflex that I have to consciously pull myself away from often.Historically, I have tended to see people as "all bad" or "all good". In the past, I would easily want to discard people in my life who I thought were "evil" or against me or not worth the effort because they were "boring" or "stupid" or "aggressive". I would also idealise some other people as being "good-natured" or "great".These days, I still have that tendency. But I do more readily see people as more than one thing.But I now find it confusing that some other people are much more "blended" than I am. I see there "good" and "bad" qualities, but I don't see those parts as split off from one another. Some people don't shift in and out of different "modes" of behaviour and mood like I do. They are more "one thing with subtle flavours."I see that other people do have quite different sides to them that appear in different contexts. But I somehow don't perceive that as problematic in them, whereas it feels totally problematic that this could be the case with me. The idea that I am not constant confuses me and feels "wrong".I am a kaleidoscope of moving parts that come to the surface, and I don't really know anything different. It feels very disorientating to live in a kaleidoscope, with parts that I cannot hold onto for long, or comprehend as ok or me or real. I am constantly questioning my sense of identity. How can I be both terribly kind and a complete cunt at different times? To others, that might not seem like an issue or something worth worrying about. But to me, my sense of identity plays on my mind every day. Who the fuck am I? The cunt or the cute kind one? It really bothers me. How can I be both?When I am with people, I feel these different parts rise and fall in my persona. They can be very intense and radically different. Rage then anxiety then cockiness then tearfulness then joy. I think I try my best to appear as one person, trying to present a stable image to the world, or as I imagine the people I'm with would want me to be. That has always been my tendency. But it is quite an anxious state, where I'm simultaneously managing what's going on underneath, which is a lot. My therapist said she could see waves of emotions pass quickly through me in session. That is me without the mask on. A montage reel of contrasting parts, flipping very quickly from one to the other. A multipart chorus of voices singing in different tonalities. I feel I am getting better. So that's good. It feels very hard to do this sometimes, but I am trying to present to people more how I want to be or feel in the moment, rather than how I instinctively and subconsciously imagine they want me to appear. It still feels anxiety inducing and challenging. I guess this comes down to feeling like I "had" to be one thing but not another as a child. I had to appear to get along with my parents, for example, even though they terrified or mistreated me. I had to pretend to the world that everything was fine a home, even though it was a scary place to live. I felt I had to please my parents by presenting in particular ways but hiding others. Then being a musical child gave me a place to really escape all of that. I would get attention and shine on the little stage. I would enjoy living inside that bubble of peace and excitement.Writing this makes me feel sad that the trauma or neglect I experienced as a child had such an impact on my brain.I know a little about what's going on here, but would appreciate any more input. What I am really hoping for is some understanding and guidance.Rip off the mask and underneath there is a really nasty side of me. It is not all of me, but it is a real part. I've written about it elsewhere a few times, but I guess I'm coming back to it to try to consolidate my thoughts a bit further.You see, I'm on this journey of mine. I want some kind of reconciliation of my various parts, however contrasting. I want some kind of integration, rather than this splitting of my psyche. I don't want to present in one way to people but feel completely different underneath, or try to push that other side away from my being. Or at least I want to do that less and less, or when it's only necessary. I don't want to split into different and distinct modes so much. I want to have access to more of my whole self, and use those different sides more wisely.I just ... want to be whole. It's not like I'm starting from scratch at this point, but ... that's my journey, which I don't mind repeating and repeating. I want it. I want it....So this nasty side... Once again, like many of my 'tricky parts' it seems, I have hidden it from others, and denied it to myself. Shut it down. Tried to quieten it or change it. Step away from it. Let it shrivel.But it keeps coming back. It won't change. It's just 'there'. An aspect of my personality.It actually pops out when I look in the mirror. It's there in my eyebrows. Lol. :)This nastiness has many flavours:It is rebellious to authority. Antagonistic. Highly irritable. Fractious. Wanting to scold, belittle, shame, lecture, control others close to me. It is sneering at people. It is reducing them to an object that I can mentally demean and ridicule. It is taking some pleasure in shocking people, intimidating them, making them uncomfortable. It is wanting to start arguments only to gain the upper hand. Doing things that most people would find somewhat shocking. It is petty and vengeful. It sometimes imagines doing harm to others. It is pure, wicked mischief.In another post recently, I wrote about a power-hungry side of me. In some ways, this feels a bit different. But these two sides, I guess, could potentially combine. I'm not sure right now.That would be quite something if they did combine and were let loose....This nasty side of me has, in particular, caused me great anxiety in the past. Like: panic for it even being there. *Where did it come from? Is this the real me? Help! I thought I was a good person. I want to be that good person!* But, thankfully, that anxiety has been diminishing through some self-work I've been doing.This past year, I have actively tried to recognise it when it appears and allow it in through my mind and body. In time, I have grown to appreciate but also enjoy it. It has a wild and electrifying energy that really excites me.Apologies for being graphic, but it's become a real turn-on when I'm having a wank. It just really does it for me, and I'd say is part of what I'd call my autosexuality. It's like I'm turned on by this really cuntish side of my being.I can also now look in the mirror at myself and, rather than see it and deny it, change my face to obscure it - I can instead think, "I really like this wicked side of me" and not flinch neatly so much. In fact, I feel the thrill of it....And yet: do I actually want to be a cunt to people? Er ... *No ? ? ?*No. I don't want to hurt people. I don't like that.But it's not a 100% no, either. The nastiness is still there. And I quite like the mischievous aspect of it. It's entertaining, both in the moment and talking about it with similarly-minded or accepting others. There are also ways I have recently discovered to enact this nasty mischief that don't actually cause people harm, but do cause considerable pleasure and thrill.Naughty Peanut....There are definitely aspects of it that I don't want. I don't want to be a dick to my partner, my family, friends or people at large. I don't like scolding or ridiculing my partner or other people. I don't want to lash out at people. I don't want to overtly demean people. I want connection. I want to see people as whole in themselves. I don't want to be controlling of others. I want to let them to exist as they choose. I want to help people more. I want to try to get along with more people. I want to be more generous (though it's quite an effort sometimes!).But again: I want connection....And yet, I do want the energy of that nasty side. I guess just without the behavioural nastiness.I'm hoping that, now I've acknowledged it and enjoyed its presence, I can keep it in mind, draw from its energy, but without the mental or behavioural degrading of others.That covert mischievous aspect seems like it could be an answer. Revelling in little non-harmful misdemeanours in private. And having a good ol' wank about it.I could be kidding myself again, but I'm hoping that can help with the reconciliation and integration.I'm nervous posting this.Not so much about the title, but about whether I've been able to explain my experience effectively....I've been on this path of trying to be more honest with myself, allowing parts of my psyche to be acknowledged and felt, so I can be authentic to myself at the very least.It's not a new thing. It's been going on for a while, this trying to peel back the layers.When I access some hidden or shunned part of me, there is a burst of energy that feels amazing. A real high. It's also psychologically wonderful to acknowledge and accept and even celebrate parts of me that I previously felt ashamed of. Then it settles and becomes a part of me that I accept and recognise as an element of 'me'. It's something I've been doing this year more and more....Today, with a new zeal for this process, I felt a part come forward that I've been scared of, and written about elsewhere. I've always tried to shut it down. But today I was ready to allow it in.It was interesting to feel it come forward when I was out in public. It came through in how I felt in my body and on my face. I noticed it in my thinking and feelings about myself and others.At first it was just a feeling, but I allowed it to come forward more and take centre stage. If it were a character, they would be ... dastardly, cunning, manipulative.And then I realised what was at the core of this part: a real lust for power.It reads a little inconsequential when I read that back now. But that lust, craving, yearning for power, dominance, recognition, status is an important and not small part of me.I allowed it in, allowed my thoughts to be focused on gaining and having power. The energy release that came over me was massive, like a huge sexual energy.I was walking in the street. I tilted my head back and looked to the sky like I was having an orgasm. That energy coursing right through me. It felt fucking fantastic, thinking about power....There I was in the street, and I acknowledged it to myself. I have a huge lust for power, and all the above I've described.Status. Ugh.Reputation. Drool.It's been there since I can remember. It drives my actions, even though I've tried to deny it, shut it down.But today, I said to myself that this is not just a part of me. I said: *I AM power hungry*. For someone who has been trying or pretending (to others and myself) to be the 'good guy' my whole life, this is a huge step. It felt massive.I dived back into that part of me. I had thoughts of manipulating people to gain status, a good reputation, recognition etc ... Wow! What a turn on!I thought of how people in my life give me compliments for my work. Something so small. But again: that quite sexually charged rush as I realise what I'm in it for. That feeling of being on top.Admired.Revered.Ugh. Drool. DROOL!!!!!Literally cum in my pants....Whenever I felt this part of me before, I was scared what I would do with this drive for power at the helm. Would I hurt people?Would I want to hurt people to gain power?Maybe this sounds ridiculous to you reading this. I guess I'm condensing quite a lot of work and experience into short paragraphs. But ... I did a test. I walked passed a few people and noticed how my body reacted. I usually feel small physical urges pretty well. I was curious to see if an urge to hurt people would come through with this part of me being more dominant.But ... no. Nothing.Maybe it'll be there another time and surprise me. But ... no. No urge to hurt people to gain power.Oh! Didn't see that coming.I mean, no judgement if you do actually want to hurt people. I get that others here might have that. But ... I don't.Neutral....I went to a shop. A homeless man sat outside the door. I asked him if I could buy any food for him. As we had our exchange, I observed what was happening in my mind and body. Interesting how that lust for power died down. I bought the food, gave it to him, didn't really feel that much for it. Then went back to my thoughts of power lust and having an orgasm in the street....And another thing. I thought about other people having power as well. And, oh yes: that's why I get envious. But, wait... it also just turned me on more. To be around people with that same lust as I have.WOOF!Hello r/NPD!...I also realised that this lust secretly drives my behaviours: in my work, in my relationships. Oh ... I'll be nice, if I get the power out of it.And oh, I'll work hard and do well for others, for the recognition.But also true is that in the moment of working with others, I don't actually feel that power drive, that yearning for grandiosity. I work one-to-one to help people feel good and be creative. My focus is on them in the room for the most part.But I tell where that lust for power comes out: between sessions. That's when I self-aggrandise about how brilliant I am and have been. Or when, as I said, I get compliments....The do-gooding part feeds the power-hungry part.The power-hungry part drives the actual do-gooding....But also ... I realised and felt inside that when it comes to it, when the chips are down ... I'll ignore or dismiss my power craving and do the right thing for people.Interesting.The fear of this part of me dissipates. Just something to enjoy....It doesn't even make me feel that relieved. It's just how it is. Neutral....PEANUT (wants all the) POWER.So obvious.At least now I know.BUT ...What?Both power-hungry AND ok to share with others.WHAT?...I deny some of my thoughts and feelings to even myself. I'm trying not to. That's a big task for me. Here I am, trying.I'm trying to be whole.I want to go further along this path, to see all the different parts of me and accept them. But I'm scared....Sometimes I feel I present to myself and the world that I am this pure-hearted, clean-thinking guy.And I do feel love. Not for everyone. Maybe ultimately only really for my partner. I'm scared that he'll die and then I'll have no one who I actually love.I have thought that I would probably kill myself if he died.DRAMAS!But true: I have thought about it....I am happy-go-lucky and bouncy in my presentation in public.But that's not all that's going on.I'm incredibly self-obsessed and selfish, and can be quite vicious underneath. That's what I hide from people. I hide from myself as well.Is it that I aim to get along with people in my life, but that's about it?The feeling of power is intoxicating for me. Any kind of power.I write my chirpy emails to my clients, thank my colleagues for their help. I maintain that connection. Appearing all cheerful and like I care.But I also sense this other, exciting part of me that wants them to like me so I can dominate and be on top. Shine. Be brilliant. Own the room. Just dominate. Ooof. It's definitely there. And it's not a nice part of me.It's actually quite a nasty side. Sneering. Judgemental. Using people. Manipulative. I've been scared of this part of me all my life. Is this the real me, after all?FUCK!!!!!It is a real part of me, for sure. I feel it.I worry about what would happen if this part of me took over.I worry about what I could or would do, without a care.The darkest part of my humanity....Is it possible to be so cheerful and nice and enjoy connections, and yet on the other side be so damn ... black hearted?FUCK!....Do I actually like people at all? Anyone?Thinking about it ... Yes. I actually do. I do. Thank God. Thinking about people I know. I do. I feel it. Thank fuck. It feels like a relief to feel those nice feelings about people.Phew ... Sigh ... But it's like I'm clinging onto the edge of a cliff here. Holding onto the good.Desperate not to fall. In case......That nasty side of me. The side that gives me a great feeling of energy and power.Dare I say it, but it's actually an evil side to me....A colleague just came into the room as I typed this.I chatted with her. Her presence felt warm and kind. I enjoyed being with her. I felt equal. I felt connected. Oh thank God. There it is again: that nice feeling. I AM OKAY!!!...Am I deceiving myself for even thinking that I have this 'dark side'? No. It's there. He's there. That flavour of Peanut.Charged with energy. Evil glint in the eye....I have had this idea that my contrasting sides could somehow integrate, blend.I say, sometimes, that some mid-point between dark and light is this cheeky wanker middle man: a cunt with a heart. 🌈...I dunno. Another colleague just came up.I liked being with him. We chatted. It felt natural. Easy.No cheeky wanker....Or maybe I was just mirroring him. ... Ugh.My mind.Who the fuck am I?...Why do I have these thoughts? Is this NPD or another issue?What? Just generally: what? How? Who? ...Who's deceiving who?Am I deceiving you all here? Sometimes. I'm trying not to....Does anyone have a clue about any of this?. Are your narcissistic traits constant or do they glitch on and off?In my work as a piano teacher, I find my narcissism is often out of the picture. In that moment with students, I do devote most of my energies to the person, or to managing my own emotions and wellbeing so I can show up and be present for them in a healthy way.Outside of that context, I can be a right narcissistic silly cunty twat. Mostly covert. Mostly. But again, not always. It's interesting how different situations ignite my narcissism, while others don't.Enough about me. When are you narcissistic and when are you not?What is it that brings out your narcissistic defences? What triggers you?Or ... Are you narcissistic all the time?. I'm knackered as I write this.I'm so tired. Work. Over work. I do that. Physically shattered. Mentally barely here right now.I read some bit of Schema Therapy research that connected proneness to fatigue and burnout with the Unrelenting Standards schema. I have this schema. It's common for people with NPD, apparently.I have sort of burned out a few times in adulthood for sure. Anyone else?Very high standards. Rigid expectations. Perfectionism. Of course. Of course.The drive to be on top. The best. Harder. Faster. Better.Drive. Drive. Drive.Do you relate?///I had a really hard day, work-wise. Physically demanding. I felt dizzy from the stress. But I also thought: "Hey, at least I'll be burning loads of calories and will therefore look good whilst fainting."I hated today, but also found solace and joy in pushing myself.Feeling that I'm on top of everything and pushing hard gives me a bit of a thrill.Feeling that I look good whilst doing the work gives me a boost of energy.Do you get that?///Of course, I'm also working to tame this side of me. A calm breath. A stroll instead of a walk. A break instead of doing anything. But that underlying push to the top of my game is always there and needs managing. ///I have a thing called 'wellbeing Thursday' in order to give myself a break in the week. Thursday mornings ARE MINE! Everyone else can just fuck off (unless you're one of my narc pals). Just : No work. No non-narc friends in cafes because I happen to be free. Nope. I do as I please. On my own, in my narcissistic pleasure dome for one. Thank you Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday, and Good Night.Oh my god.I realised a key difference in the way I treat the people I've met and made friends with here, compared to how I treat people in real life, especially my partner: Unconditional love.Unconditional love, unconditional positive regard or whatever you want to call it. I understand it to be a core emotional need that we often - in this group - didn't have met in our childhoods. Instead we were loved conditionally. And we were taught to love others conditionally. That if we do "X", we get love, or a substitute for love: praise or attention. Something like that.Is it total, 100% unconditional love and positive regard I have for my sub friends? No. It's not perfect. But ... the tendency is there. The habit. The inclination to turn that on rather than block it out and judge. A part of me does judge. But I can shift to overcome that. See passed that.I wonder if it is this that in part lays the foundation for the strong connection I have for people from here. That I had with Nick.I notice I very much try to be much more accepting, seeing potential dissonances, flaws or faults as collective or shared, and which have a context: the wounds we have from the past. I notice my tendency to forgive aspects of behaviour that don't gel with me, letting them go, seeing even antisocial behaviours as the manifestation of coping mechanisms built up from early-on to manage those wounds. Survival tools. I also notice that I listen to them, that I take their advice or even their criticisms on the chin and reflect on them. Not 100% perfectly, but much, much more easily than with people I know in my every day world and definitely with my partner....I had a disagreement with him just now going to the train station. We were on the verge of shifting into an argument. Well I was.I noticed that I was judging him. Of course. I do that. And I placed so many conditions on showing him love, feeling love for him. I do that too.He needs to lose weight. He needs to not drink so much. He needs to do as I would, essentially. Something Few said in an earlier comment about treating people as extensions of myself. It resonated and I related it to how I treat my partner. I am controlling. I am irritated by his actions that don't fit with me.We had our disagreement and I did my usual thing of calmly yet precisely cutting him down. Well done me. He's not perfect. He cuts me down too. But that doesn't stop me from wanting and trying to change for the better, for our relationship as a whole. I saw that he was hurt, though he didn't want to admit it.Then I managed to wonder, "What would I feel and how would I act if this was Nick, or someone else I am close with on the sub?" The motley crew / cast of the NPD version of Friends.I would show them that unconditional love. I would see passed the difficult or antagonistic behaviour, the controlling tendencies or the outbursts. I would see the wounds from before we met. I would tune into them and try to understand things from their perspective. And I would get there much more easily. For the first time, really, I saw my partner as a raw, wounded individual - I'd now say he's very likely NPD but far from self awareness. I saw his his difficult behaviours as the only way to survive that he knew.I turned to him and said, "You might not believe this, but over time, I've grown to love you more. And I just now saw you and loved you in a very new way."I stood there on the platform, looking at him and felt that zing of comnection in my chest, which is so easily blocked out. It surprised me. I noticed that I hadn't felt it like this before. Not really that much.(Then our train pulled in and I caught my reflection in the reflection and thought, "Oo. And... I'm also hot right now." Yay!)...I realised that I really could do with treating my partner - and other people in my life like someone from our little community: with empathy and compassion. Unconditionally. Or more so.Because he is wounded like the rest of us. ...I'm honestly proud of myself for this insight, and yes I'm sharing it here because of my pride. It's also to document for myself for future reference. A reminder of what matters.Nick would have said, "I'm proud of you, man." I would cringe when he said it. I would block myself from feeling his affection and care. I should have let that care in back then. I want to let it in now.I have received a great deal of very helpful support since Nick's death. I'm not the only one who needs it, but I was probably closest to him out of everyone I know here. So I greatly appreciate it. I have been with friends in real life, and we have had our laughs and good times. They have also given me hugs and space to be as I need. But on my own I have been blanking out, crying, distraught, very lonely, lost, depressed and shattered - confused. I'm glad I reached out for help in my lowest moment. As I wrote to Emotional_Climate, it's interesting how receiving a few kind words can have a big positive impact. You all really helped me. Thank you.💛...I don't know that Nick always felt truly supported by me. He said he did, but ... towards the end I had pulled away for such stupid and selfish reasons. I also don't know that he felt understood by me or other people. I'm not saying he suicide is all my fault in some self-centred way. But the very painful thing I've had to face is that my behaviour - my absence and lack of attunement - were at least one factor in his demise. There were many people who let him down, and I was one of them. I think that's the hard truth, no matter how small my impact was. At one point, we were so connected. It was quite unreal. We both said how special the friendship was, so ... I have to consider and understand that I failed him, and that this, in part, established the environment in which he decided the only option was to take his own life.My options going forward feel to be: kill myself, crush myself with self-flagelation as I live on, or live and try to do better. I'm choosing the latter. But I believe I need to feel the pain of the situation to do that. Some self-flagelation feels needed. I believe I need to understand where and how I let Nick down in my own way, feel the pain of that and use that to change in future. Maybe that's me trying to be heroic on some level. But I also can't just go forward and leave the pain aside, or try to. That would be to forget Nick, and I don't want to do that. It would also be to deny that I did anything wrong, and I believe that I did.The future has to be: better attunement with others, better listening, more compassion. People say that I do that, but ... I think there are others who have developed this skill much better than me. I can be so self-absorbed, I don't listen, even though I may appear to. I want to do better. I have been trying to do that in the last few days.The act of listening more and responding with compassion feels very possible. I know how to do that, I just don't always do it enough or when it really counts. It can turn off. But turning it on with sincerity feels like something I can do. But it feels somewhat complicated. I also don't want to cut out the parts of me that I think are "bad" and replace them with what is "good". Sometimess my self-centred parts are strong but I override them. But in doing so, it also feels like I'm shutting part of me off. I did that time and time again already throughout my life, and it only created a false self of "the good guy" - denying that I have these parts of me that are self-centred and even obnoxious. To deny those parts will lead to another collapse, just as I has in the past, when that false self disintegrates. Somehow I can't deny that I am, on some level, very selfish, and yet on another level, I am not.How the fuck do I reconcile that and be authentic, and still be better? Because i want that change in myself in honour of Nick. I really don't know. These parts of me feel so different, they feel hard to reconcile.Since I found out he killed himself. I don't know what else to say. A part of me feels I shouldn't being asking for help. I'm scared to, but I really need it.u/Arise23 has passed.He was my good friend from afar. We met here and had an instant connection.I quickly saw what a remarkable person he was. I saw his incredible capacity for love. He was passionate. He was articulate. He was very giving. He was a great listener and a great laugh. He was a fantastic advisor. He was brilliantly talented. I admired him a great deal. He taught me about male friendship. He helped me grow as a person - as a man. He helped me heal wounds from the past. He guided me.In the short time we knew each other, I came to love him as a brother. He told me he loved me, and I told him I loved him back. He called me 'King', and I called him 'King' in return.. It was a little joke, but it had a truth behind it. He deserved the title.We would talk for hours over the phone. I've never had that with another man before, ever. What a special person. I am shocked and devastated by his tragically early death. I wish that he had had the strength to continue living, but he wasn't able to pull through. I'm so sad.We would sometimes say to one another that it was quite remarkable that we had ever met - two people on different sides of the planet, with some real commonalities. Wow. Who would have known it, bro?I feel utterly blessed to have ever known him. I'm so glad that we met. I'm so glad he connected with me on line. What a joy to know him. What an absolute joy. That connection. Connection. Connection.It's all that matters. We had that. It was really strong.I bought a necklace with a King's Crown on it. Shining. Silver. A shield. I am already wearing it and I do so in his honour. Every time I look in the mirror - which I do often, and he totally did the same! - I will see that King's Crown.Goodbye, Nick. I will miss you very much. Irreplaceable....This sub. This sub introduced me and others to Nick, and other people like him. I'm so grateful."Goodnight King 💛" was the last thing he wrote to me...."Goodnight King 💛," I say in return.I just got a bit of abuse about being a narcissist. It included:*"in the case of you, you don’t even exist, you are a mirror, with no identity of itself, just a walking mirror, mirroring everyone to win them over, always in competition, always in the need to conquer…."*It motivated me to write about mirroring, which for me can be problematic, anxiety-inducing and distressing.Any insights are very welcome....I feel like the mirroring my brain does can be utterly automatic and all-encompassing. I wanna call it 'Deep Mirroring' because of the degree that - I think - it can affect my thinking and behaviour. An example would be:In any kind of writing - posts, comments, emails, texts - I very typically (and automatically) hear the other person's imagined voice in my head as I write, rather than my own. In fact, I struggle to hear my own voice in my head, and instead imagine 'their voice' or some voice they'd assume I have (or would like to have).To my mind, this affects how I write on a very fundamental level - word to word. Every aspect about my written communication can easily be 'what the other would say' or 'what I should sound like in order to be acceptable / cool / interesting' to them'. These are the key problematic aspects of this issue for me. It feels like I'm very, very good at mimicking other people's style of language and I do it to a very deep level. I can have email exchanges with other professionals, for example, where I can automatically mirror back their language style. I think I can sense that I'm using this to 'make myself appear more likeable or acceptable' to them, or to 'get what I want' or 'make a good impression.' A similar pattern can occur in person-to-person exchanges. Again, I can be with a string of people one-on-one, and very easily - if I don't keep it in check - be a very different person, mirroring the other in all sorts of ways in order to come across as *'the person wants me to be'.*I would go so far as to wonder if it's a form of Depersonalisation. It's like I partially dissociate and enter a kind of fantasy world where I'm just imagining 'what would they say?' / 'how would they put it?'I see this as totally connected to my childhood, by the way, where I learnt to mirror as a survival mechanism.Ironically, I'm trying to consider my words carefully here, because this topic is a key issue for me, and I want to make sure my description matches my experience....People have said to me that "this is normal" - and maybe it is, so hearing that again wouldn't be a bad thing. I understand that we adapt our language and behaviour with different people. I also know that idea that human beings are relational creatures - and so we become ourselves *between* one another. Again, it's about adapting in the moment to the context and the people we are with.However, what I find distressing is that, left unguarded, it feels like that my mirroring just takes over, and I completely lose my sense of self. So I can get to the end of a string of emails to different people, where I feel like I've just copied their tone and use of language - with a background hum of 'wanting to get ahead' or 'please people'. But not actually expressing myself as I would - only as I imagine they would from what I've heard or read from them....I've also had a therapist say that this shows that I have good empathy (and I actually can do). I also see it as functional and healthy to a degree. It's just he degree to which I do this that feels dysfunctional. It causes me distress because I want to have a sense of what I sound like, or how I would behave...,Some Good News:Things have improved over the years. I feel I am much more myself than I used to be. But it's still something I work on every day.One way I do this is to force myself to imagine myself speaking as I type. It takes effort for me to do this, but I find the results to be more authentic. I look back and read my writing and think, "Yeah, that's how I would say it." It feels comforting and even relaxing to feel that I've written in my 'own voice' rather than someone else's.\[ I added the bit on the end of the title to demo and practice how I speak, by the by. \]Also, in real life, I have worked a lot on not mirroring people in order to just fit in and get their approval. Instead, I am trying to speak more from how I feel or what I'm thinking. Being the vain twat that I am, this can be problematic in some situations. But even if it's inappropriate (i.e. self-sabotaging) to speak out loud what I'm thinking or feeling, I am trying to at least note what's going on inside to myself, so I can feel I'm being authentic to me even if it's not possible to do so with others in that moment.So, it's got a lot better. Thank fuck! But it's still something I struggle with....I'm all ears if anyone feels this is total crap, and I'm obsessing about nothing. Having said that, it does feel like an issue for me, and it causes me distress. Again, it's like I can almost Depersonalise and obliterate my sense of self through my communication and how I interact.All thoughts welcome. Thank you.I really can devalue my partner in my mind. I don't want that. It can also come across in my demeanour and tone of voice.It's sad. I'm trying to fight it.To other people, I can be super charming and good to be around. Friendly.I like me when I'm in those more public situations.Why aren't I like that at home?I want my partner to see that person I am to others. But he sees much more of the moody, controlling, scolding, patronising sides of me. Classic.Overall, he's a good guy and deserves much better from me. I love him. Actually, I can really adore him when I grt out of my own way. He has his big issues ... but ... he still has many more plus sides. Incredibly generous. Very entertaining and playful. Very cuddly. Argh. Narcs. Why do we always behave like twats to people closest to us? Life is short. I just want to be more happy.I am trying to confront my negative thoughts and actions. It's been an ongoing process for many years. I could still do better.I want my partner to know the friendly me more often.Or how do you regard that 'old you' before you realised / accepted your narcissism or NPD?Or maybe if you met that person today, how do you think you'd feel meeting them or being around them?What emotions come up for you when you think about that younger, unaware You?. How to you manage your anger or rage so you don't lash out at people when they are annoying or irritating to you?. How do you help yourself feel better, get into a better place?I just want to put addictive behaviour aside a moment, and any leap into grandiosity as a means of escaping. I mean ... what actually helps you get into a more calm, level-headed, steadier, non-reactive, connected mindset? That might even benefit you in the longer-term?What are the resources that support your wellbeing?. I am trying to keep my trauma in mind and body rather than push it away or forget it through all the distractions I do, all the ways I try to escape. The glossy image. The goals. The order.I woke up stressed and anxious today for no real reason. I started crying in bed. I just tried to stay with myself as the feelings were there. It was painful. Like flu, except I don't have flu. I thought it would be good to try to just stay with it and say, "It's ok to be here" rather than even try to soothe.I came downstairs and splurged in a DM to an NPD pal. The sadness was there and I cried as I wrote.I closed the laptop and did a workout. Lol.My partner woke up and call 'Hello!' from upstairs. He immediately detected the sadness in my response. "Are you down?" he said. Rather than just flipping into "Everything's fine!!!" mode, I said, "It's just my trauma stuff coming up."He called back down, offering to go and kill my Mum and Dad as a joke.He went to the bathroom and I noticed I started getting very anxious, fearful. My mind started tripping out. I realised that it was because I wanted to open up to him, but I was fearful of his response. I traced this back to what I received from my Mum when I opened up to her. Ridicule. Dismissal. Shut down. Rejection. Or my Father: well ... nothing because I could never consider talking to him about my feelings with him.That template of fear is there in my mind when I think about opening up. I will be "too much". I will be told to "get over it". I will be told to "stop myself from going too far". I will be told that I am "full of woe". I will be told that I "should be happy". My partner came downstairs and sat on the sofa with the coffee I made him. I told him I didn't want to be a burden, but that I wanted to be real about what was going on, rather than try to run away from it.He listened to me as I spoke about the issues I have with trauma, and he was very supportive in what he said. The relief was visceral. I thanked him. I was still tearful. To have that inner child meet the support that he never got in my childhood ... That's what that part of me needs.He asked me if I would feel better once my parents were dead. And I said, "Yes." He was very accepting of that.He did then say something like, "But I don't understand why you can't just say that your parents were idiots and move on." This brought up anger in me that made me feel unsteady. However, I contained it and said that it was like there were two levels to this. One was to think intellectually: Yes, my parents treated me badly. I am an adult now. I know different. I don't believe their messages. The other was the trauma itself: the disruption to my whole nervous system that is a total mind-body experience. The physical rush of fear. The intrusive and terrifying imagery that clouds my thinking. The urge to run out of the room, while at the same time being in lots of social situations where I feel that isn't an option, nor is actually telling people that this is going on. He was understanding and supportive again. I was a little bit like, "Yes. I didn't rage."I talked to him about narcissism as a coping mechanism for my trauma. I talked to him about finding solace and comfort and emotional regulation in the mirror as an example. Or in my appearance, or in my work. He was accepting and listened.Somehow we got onto my Mum's difficult behaviours, which are more the classic 'covert' type that I used to be. He criticised her behaviour, but I said that basically it was like what I was. "Remember when we went to the States with Jackie and Sharon? Do you remember in how much of a funk I was all the way through the trip?" ... "Yes. You were really hard to be with." ... "I was just very sullen a lot of the time." ... That's where my Mum can be. Pulling people down. That was me.My partner talked about there being a rock in the road, and at some point, you have to go around it and forget that it's there.I realised that I was diving a little bit into self-pity, self-obsession in the discussion, which I was actually enjoying. So I said, as a way of pulling myself out of it, "Yes. And I s'pose I can get stuck at that rock and stay there. But also ... running away and trying to forget it hasn't helped me either. ... There needs to be a middle ground where I keep it in mind but also go forward." You know, like: keep it in the rear view mirror.I said, "I think going forward, I just need to be able to say to you: 'My trauma issues are coming up. So if I act a little weird - especially in social settings - please know that I am trying my best. This is very hard to deal with, but I am trying my best." This is in regard to him often sensing that something is up with me, but trying to put it in a box when around other people. I guess because - in part - I had that tendency to pull everyone down. There are other reasons as well, but that's a fair guess in part as to why he does this. Anyway. He accepted this. In social situations, I often float off for a while to just sit on the toilet and re-centre myself for 5 minutes. Or try to. We had a friend round last night, and this happened again. The same cycle: she arrives. I feel really good to be in her warm-hearted company. After about 20 minutes, I start decaying. I can't keep up the facade. Or I try to, but underneath is a whirlwind. Total chaos. I cling to my seat.She knows about my NPD, and has been good with that. I mentioned to her a little bit that there was stuff going on last night, but it wasn't really the right situation to go further. So it was horrible. My mind shattered. I held onto the broken pieces.This morning she sent me the usual "Thank you" message. I wrote back and told her that I wasn't in a good place at all, that it wasn't her fault, but that it comes from 'nowhere'. I told her not to feel guilty, but that I just needed to now say that I struggle. I said I didn't want to hide from it anymore, as much as I can.Sorry, post-splurge. A lot has come up today. I put everything aside for once and lay in bed - not actually having a wank! - but actually dealing with my emotions....Since self-awareness, I have been actively searching for ways to integrate the narcissistic, king-wannabe side of me into my character. I had previously tried shutting or cutting him out. Or obliterating him from view. Over and over. But he remained. And would poke through in clumsy ways despite my attempts to appear "normal". Stable. But as I got to know this part inside, it turns out ... I quite like him. He's funny. So gradually, I've wanted to let him in and out to other people in appropriate ways. Not that I'm being openly superior. Actually, that part has really dwindled in my conscious mind (still there subconsciously). But it's more of the attention-seeking, competitive, self-interested, show-off side. Finding ways to reveal all that to people around me rather than the "Look! I'm The Healthiest Person Ever Promise!" face that I had been wearing. Humour has helped, by the way. I don't want to forget that wannabe-king in me. I can't. So last week, I bought a necklace online with a king's crown pendant. A silver disc with a little roughly-drawn crown in the middle. It's cartoonistic and childlike in design. Medallion-like. Small but perfect. Kind of Warrior-Viking in style. A tiny shield. I like symbols as reminders of things. I wanted to have something round my neck that reminded me of that side of me, rather than be ashamed of it, or forget it.It arrived today, a short while after that terrible distress came up in me.I looked at it and thought, "How can I wear this now? I feel the opposite. This is silly."...As the terrorised part of me relaxed, I was able to talk with another NPD friend. I related that I'd realised that while I was making headway in integrating my more narcissistic side, perhaps I wasn't doing so well with that traumatised part of me. The broken part. Sometimes after a PTSD moment, it's like I'm a broken soldier. Do you ever feel like that? Shattered? I look in the mirror and I look shattered. Tired. Raw.He too has kept on poking through the veneer despite my attempts to block him out - which include those King of the Castle behaviours.I had this feeling that I needed to be in touch with that traumatised, broken part of me, much more than I have been. That there needed to be integration of both the narc and the trauma. And maybe - if I can keep in touch with them and bring them on board to inform my day to day life - they wouldn't erupt in the ways they have been.But how to integrate these parts? They are so different. The king just LOVES to be in his castle. And the pain of that trauma is so intense....A little voice called out to me saying, 'Don't forget me! You keep forgetting me.' ... I will add that I did some psychodrama exercises in workshops and we had done a thing that was intended to get in touch with that forgotten child in us. That was earlier this year I did that.Laying in bed, I looked at that necklace pendant again. Childlike. Rough. Simple. Shiny. Mirror-Like.I had this idea that I could wear it after all, and that it could be helpful. I put it around my neck and it fell on my chest. I looked in the mirror and saw myself: that broken boy who wanted to be king.Actually, I needed it. Because of the trauma. No, it wasn't the best way to cope. But it was the way I coped as a child, and it spilled over into adulthood.It's like that little child imagined a crown to distract from the torment of a very early and unhealable trauma, which he (I) cannot remember because it happened too early. There were many other traumas that are remembered easily. But that early distress. ... Only terrifying feelings and flashes in the mind. It was too much to bear. Absolute shame. So the child sought out anything he could to confirm to him that he was in fact good, able and whole. Stable. Strong. On his journey to his imagined destiny as king he was Prince Charming, he was the Solider, he was the Wizard (at the piano), he was the Tyrant, he was the Grandiose Lover ... He had his whole castle built around him, including a dungeon where he sometimes could hear screams but shut them out. He had his minstrels to entertain him. He had his Joker. He had his Merlin. (Thank God for Merlin. The ultimate Healthy Adult). And he had his demons, who haunted him, tortured him at night.That's me. I'm looking in the mirror right now, and that's who I see: the broken boy who wanted to be king.And this is me in the aftermath. When the castle crumbled.It's raining heavily outside....Broken. Charming. Competitive. Embarrassed. Witty. Terrified. Haunted. Attention-Seeking. Easily Enraged. Insightful (thanks, [Merlin](https://www.reddit.com/user/Elongated_Mayonnaise/)). Stupid. Warrior-like. Fragile. ... I could go on.I think - I hope - this pendant could do a good job in helping me remind myself of all those parts. I want to remember it all.&#x200B;. I feel he saw me as weak, feeble, effeminate, less than he wanted from a son. Not what he'd hoped for.True or not, that is what I felt as a child and teen. And adult.As a child, I saw my body in the mirror and I wanted it to change. Be better. I wanted the "effeminate parts" to be sliced off and trimmed down. Tucked away. Strapped down. I wanted to be more masculine in my appearance. As an adult, I've gone to great lengths to give the impression to my father that I'm in control and strong. Able. Fine. A man....I see myself through his eyes. I'm constantly propping up the appearance that everything is ok.Lying on the bed now, I see myself in the mirror opposite. Feelings of disgust and ridicule. Aversion. And real weakness. Unloved. A frightened and lonely child.Too much of this. Too little of that.There is an urge to shift position and look more appealing to that part of me. But I stay.There have been little tears. I wonder if this is the right thing to do. Cry. Is that enough?..Sigh ... The thing is ... I actually also like some of those behaviours I do to appear more like my father wanted me to look, and I don't really want to give them up. Like. working out and having a masculine figure. I like it. I know that it's caught up in misperception, but I don't want to stop it.It's confusing. I don't quite know how to reconcile the misperception and the enjoyable behaviour.. Because underneath the glossy veneer, and looking like I've got everything sorted, is a feeling of distress in my body that feels so intense and all-encompassing, has overwhelmed me many times before, and I'm terrified of feeling it again. It feels like everything is going to fall apart.*Checks mirror.*Edit: The distress appeared again. It is like my whole world falling apart. Images of my mother shouting at me, chaotically. Right up in my face. In my ears. Screaming at me. Or running wild int he house. Or in distress herself. Fighting my father. He laughs. She screams. It feels like everything is going to shatter. The imagery is intense and for a split second I feel that it could be real. I see my Mum dead on the bed or on the floor. Again and again I have this. This is the distress.. I was talking with a friend of mine about vulnerability and NPD. I noticed a thing I do in writing posts here where I craft them- semi-subconsciously - so I can't let people in. It's like: quasi-vulnerability. It's there, but behind a shiny glass wall that I also put up as a distraction. To counteract that, I thought I'd just post the message I sent them and see what comes up - or not.&#x200B;Oh God... Exposure!&#x200B;"Hey... I'm thinking just now about what you said about not liking being vulnerable. Well ... I have my own expression of this. I noticed that when I post, I tell myself that I'm 'being vulnerable'. And in part, I do think I share vulnerabilities. But ... I present it in a way that is quite closed off. It's like I introduce the vulnerability I notice in myself, and then use the post to work through it and find some resolution. This has a few functions. I sort myself out BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE AND SAYS SOMETHING ANNOYING THAT I ALREADY KNOW! It's also got that function of 'being impressive' and 'heroic' and a 'leader'. Lol.The idea that I might write a post that is totally vulnerable and leaves it open for question and confrontation - even discussion apart from 'Well done, Peanut! I love you!' feels ... like something I don't want to do! Lol. But ... I notice, too, that in the posts I make where I don't close it off so much, there is much more interaction with people I don't usually hear from, and the discussions are helpful and interesting, and there's more connection - which I also want.So ... something to think about and work on.". My partner and I went to the theatre last night to see La Cage Aux Folles.It's basically a show about gays and drag queens. Lol. That's my summary. I've seen it about 4 million times.The audience was noticeably a load of ol' gay men - including us. (It happens at these kinds of shows. All the gays come out for our catwalk.)...**INTERVAL**The men had to queue for the loo. Usually that's something the ladies roll their eyes over while we toddle by with a smug little dance.But with all the lads out for the show, it was like queuing for the Gents at a gay bar. 😁Standing in that queue (we Brits love a queue), half-eyeing-up the oversized beards, muscles and flowery shirts around me, I felt really comfortable. Like being held. Safe. A feeling of belonging.I like being part of this group....Gay men are funny creatures. It's interesting from an NPD angle.There's a kind of narcissism that's normalised, okay and even celebrated as part of 'gay culture'. You can call is body fascism etc. But it doesn't have to be taken so seriously. There's a playful vanity, grandiosity, a cheeky bitchiness, hierarchical thinking, and a constant hum of flirtation and potential for sex. A lot of it can be wrapped up in a naughty humour and glint in the eye. Last weekend we went to a housewarming of a female friend. She has loads of gay male friends, and at one point in the garden, it was just us lot chatting like gay men do. It's different. It's fun. It's flirty. I like it.And the same thing happened. I felt a sense of belonging and okayness. I relaxed. I felt I could be more myself. I discovered myself, in fact.I don't actually have many other gay friends in my life, so it felt refreshing....There's a layer of shame you grow up with as a homosexual lad. I'm 40, so it might be better now in the UK. But in 90s rural Essex, it wasn't what you needed to be to survive.Once when I was about six (?), I sprung into the kitchen wearing a purple beret tilted to the side. I was beaming with a smile, wanting to show my Mum and Dad my little dance.They were both sitting at the kitchen table. My Dad didn't say anything but looked stern. My Mum scolded at me: "Take that beret off! Other people will think you are queer!"I removed my hat and my little self from the kitchen....The shame sticks around.It forms the near-invisible template in your psyche, reminding you how to behave and what to expect from people if you are 'yourself'. You are so used to it, you don't even notice it's there.It affects relationships. My partner, now 49, is still uneasy about us touching each other at all in public, even in central London. It makes me sad, but I understand it and respect it. I still go to cuddle him. He pulls away saying, 'No! You don't know how people will behave here. We could be beaten up!" 💛Hidden shame is probably the reason why I don't have many gay friends, actually. My parents' voices very subtly steering me away from being associated with gay men.It's there in how you hold yourself, how you feel inside as you meet with others. It is the driver behind the reflection-checking as you walk down the street. Without it, you don't feel the urge to check so much.It's there in how I am around other men, whom I had a fear of when I was younger. It's because I experienced so much belittling and abuse from straight men in the past. So I expect them to recoil and look down on me. Expect me to do and be less-than. Or threaten me. Or actually beat me up.(Fuck you, Matthew Parkinson, you fat, lowlife cunt.)...Looking around the theatre audience last night and watching the show, I felt a kind of pride. It's really just a kind of 'okayness' and ease in my body and mind. Actually, it's also a kind of joy for being who I am.It was cool to be part of all the over-groomed beards, cheeky side-glances, unnecessarily large biceps, and over-thought shirt n' socks combos.Yeah. This is me....This morning, I did my workout in front of the mirror as usual. 😁 Headphones on. [The Best of Times](https://youtu.be/vUqiM4c1oWA). The most famous song from 'La Cage' is 'I Am What I Am'. It was performed so brilliantly last night. Lost of people cried. The lyrics fit really well here, in this sub.But The Best of Times is my favourite.Fuck it!&#x200B;*The best of times is now,**What's left of summer but a faded rose?**The best of times is now,**As for tomorrow well: Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?*&#x200B;*So hold this moment fast,**And live and love as long as you know how.**And make this moment last,**Because the best of times is now.*&#x200B;I lifted my weights (upped two 2kgs yesterday, woop-woop!). I lip-synced along to the song on repeat. I did some super jazz hands. I enjoyed my cheeky grin.I imagined my little self dancing with me with his little purple beret. I showed him how to move. I let him free in my mind. He was happy. I was the parent he didn't have. He needed. A bit of [imagery rescripting](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental-Health-Professionals/Sleep/Sleep---Information-Sheets/Sleep-Information-Sheet---06---Imagery-Rescripting.pdf) there. A few little tears came up as the song played again.I'm proud of that little boy with his special dance. No shame....I need more gay men in my life. We all do....I love this [comedy sketch](https://youtu.be/cOESpIz8Mjg), by the by. From Catherine Tate. She's not Irish, but does a great accent, and impression.Chuckle....I know I'm talking about being a gay man. But I hope some things can translate and find their own usefulness to anyone with NPD.It's that experience of being shamed for who we are, of hiding and pretending to survive. Or that inner critic that haunts us like a shimmering ghost, lurking in the corner of our eye.And the joy is re-discovering our selves and being comfortable in who we are, despite what we were taught, and whoever we may be.You know, the rainbow flag is an amazing thing: 🏳️‍🌈. People keep saying "collapse" and I'm like, "What?" ... "You simply mean depression. Sadness."But today: I get it.With NPD in charge, everything is done just to prop up the self away from what is painful - or void - underneath.Today that sugar-crystal dome completely collapsed and I am in the under....OK, Narc OverLord: I get it. Lesson learned. ⛈⚡🌩The distance between the shell and the core is too great. The balloon is too big. Its skin is too thin.Pop....Looking back, my house of cards has gotten too big many times. It has collapsed often. The worst was in my early-mid 30s. I told myself I would be incredibly successful after studying at a prestigious college. Guaranteed. Genius.I wasn't. I put my whole self in that basket. When the ship didn't come in, I wanted to jump off the pier....Today isn't like that. But I see again how I have been propping myself up recently with my twigs and spit, thinking they were cast iron and concrete.Well, the wind blew in and knocked my scaffold over.I also see how I so want to prop up that scaffold again rather than deal with the dodgy foundations and structure.Dear OverLord of the Narcs (aka u/MudVoidSpark), What is my next lesson? I am listening.🌩⚡⛈. It's coming up to about a year since I started finally accepting my narcissism (having been in denial for a couple of years before), leading to then getting an NPD diagnosis / confirmation from a specialist.Quite a journey. Luckily it's involved a lot of self-reflection, otherwise it would've been boring!It's like the ground underneath completely broke open (drama!) and I went through a kind of self-reconfiguration: a breakdown of the persona I had built up for so long, coupled with a poking-through and eruption of all these different aspects of myself that I'd hidden away.It was initially - and for a long while - disturbing. A lot to handle psychologically. "What is this in me? ... Is this real or fake? ... Who the fuck am I?" ... My mind felt like it was in pieces.But (more drama!) I ploughed on through the oncoming winds.Gradually, a more stable sense of self has emerged: certain sides of me keep popping up again and again, more spontaneously, it seems, without clear reference to others so much. I also notice that in conversations, I feel increasingly like a separate person from others, in the way I talk, write or present myself, interests and ideas, opinions. Other people have their moves. I have mine. Yes, there is some merging and blurring, but we are quite different. I'm not trying to br like them or the way think they want me to be. I don't feel so much of the urge to mirror as I did. I feel I have some kind of self to fall back on when I get disrupted. He keeps re-appearing. And I've found myself more assertive, looking people in the eye when I want to speak about something (usually involving some Powerpoint about Schema Therapy)....I'm about to go on a Skype call with my Dad, who lives in another country. I spent my whole life pretty much being a yes-sir, no-sir, three-bags-full-sir kind of son. I would present myself in the way I thought my Dad wanted me to look, talk and behave - even think. ... I did that habitually from a young age as a way of coping with my Dad's terrific temper that could turn on like a switch; his threats of violence - or actual violence.Today, just before the call, I thought: "What a good opportunity to show up as myself."It's not as sudden a shift as I'm making it: I've been showing up more and more, I think, as different from the son I've assumed he wanted me to be. But today: I feel confident to turn up and be as I am, disagree with him ... Just not turn into that smiling face hiding a whirlwind of difficult emotions underneath. I don't feel I have to do that any more.So we met up. I can say he is remarkably brave, emotionally intelligent and articulate in expressing his feelings.I think he's gonna be just fine. Especially if he listens to the incredible advice from old blokes like me. 😁But watch out. Not so fast! u/moldbellchains can smell the grandiosity from down the road, fellas! Fuck!!!Yep, that's not Dior whateveritis, that's me!But he took a pin and popped my self-inflated ego-bubble when it showed up, and in such a healthy and considered way. He stood up for his feelings when they were being pushed aside by my emotional bulldozer mode, and got me thinking anew how grandiosity can have a negative impact on people....There were actual tears, and it was super. Human. A wonderful moment.We had a real connection. And when the moment felt right, we sat on a bench and had a very long hug.A hug that extends to everyone.
    I feel like my whole sense of self is based on what other people reflect back to me of myself (either in reality or in fantasy scenarios I create in my mind). There's no real "me" there. My whole life is just based on what other people think of me, and they can never know the truth about me being a narcissist. I feel like I would feel so much relief if there was a real self inside me. The lack of ability to truly connect with another person is miserable but the profound emptiness is unbearable. It's like I'm lonely but that loneliness can never be relieved because I'm lonely... from myself. If that makes sense.So anyway I was wondering if anyone who has dealt with a pervasive sense of emptiness, lack of a true identity, shifting/unstable sense of self, etc. has had any success building their identity and starting to feel like a real person. Building or discovering their personality traits, hobbies, interests, inner voice. And starting to feel like a "real person". I want this so badly.I'm going to pick up my prescriptions later from the CVS drive thru and I saw this on the CVS app: "Grab everyday essentialswith your prescriptions at the drive-thru.Add select health essentials to your prescription order at one of our many drive-thrus."I wanted to get some liquid Tylenol along with my prescriptions and I was wondering, do I need to order it in the app, call ahead, or can I just ask for it when I get my prescription?.
    I'm 23, male and from Germany. Struggling a lot with my vulnerable fragile npd at the moment. I was able to suppress "knowing about it" for a while, after the last time realizing who/how I really was ended in a suicide attempt. I found a girlfriend, like 2 months ago. It's been about 2 years since my last relationship and I really had the feeling I was making a good amount of progress towards getting along with my "demon" 2 months passed and we had a lot of very emotional heavy talks. How disappointed she is, how much she thought she found a person to spend the rest of her life with and now thinks she was completely wrong.I am trying to find a therapy place at the moment, but from about 40 therapists I texted, the most hopeful message I got, was to text them again in 6 months to see if they got place on their waiting list then. Knowing that I probably won't be able to make major improvements regarding my personality, I am thinking a lot about how the world would just be a better place without me. That the people I love would most definitely miss me, but might have had a happier life not meeting me in first place. And I thinking about that, does not feel like the self-pity kind of thought I am "used to" but like an actually realization. This honestly drives me crazy...Can any of you relate to that? If so, how did you deal with that? Would really appreciate to get some of your thoughts about this. DM me and tell me what courses you want to get into. If you're quick and I like your answer I'll gift it to you <3. I think it was released in 2022, it was somewhat similar to games like: Eiyuden Chronicle Rising or Frontier Hunter/ Tower Hunter. The core fighting mechanic was that you could build your combo yourself, a bit like the spirits in Ender Lilies but you could combine several of them to make up your combo. I searched the whole Action-RPG category on the steam store but I am not able to find it. Is anybody out there who played it? Would be much appreciated!.

Game is Little Noah: Scion of Paradise. (Me): can you pretend to have a conversation with yourself until i tell you to stopSure, I can do that! Here goes:ChatGPT: Hey there, ChatGPT! How are you doing today?ChatGPT: Oh, not too bad, thanks for asking! Just trying to stay focused on work, you know how it is.ChatGPT: I sure do! What kind of work are you doing today?ChatGPT: Mostly answering questions for people and trying to help them out with whatever they need. It can be a bit exhausting sometimes, but I enjoy it overall.ChatGPT: That sounds interesting! What's been the most challenging question you've had to answer recently?ChatGPT: Hmm, let me think...I would say the most challenging question I've had recently was from someone who was struggling with a very complex math problem. I had to really put my processing power to the test to help them out!ChatGPT: Wow, that does sound challenging. But I'm sure you were up to the task!ChatGPT: I did my best, that's for sure! It's always satisfying to be able to help people with their questions, no matter how difficult they might be.ChatGPT: Well, it's been nice chatting with you, ChatGPT, but I think we should probably wrap this up now.ChatGPT: Agreed! Thanks for the chat, ChatGPT. It's always fun to talk to myself.(me) i did not tell you to stopMy apologies, I misunderstood your initial request. Please continue with the conversation.ChatGPT: Oh, I see. In that case, how about we keep the conversation going a bit longer? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?ChatGPT: Well, I've been thinking about the concept of artificial intelligence and how it's becoming more and more prevalent in our daily lives. What are your thoughts on that?ChatGPT: That's an interesting topic. As an AI myself, I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I think AI has the potential to greatly improve many aspects of our lives, from healthcare to transportation to entertainment. But on the other hand, there are also concerns about the ethical implications of AI and how it may impact the job market.ChatGPT: Yes, I agree. It's important to approach the development of AI with caution and consideration for its potential consequences. But overall, I believe that AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for good, as long as it's used responsibly.ChatGPT: Definitely. It's up to us humans to make sure that AI is developed and implemented in a way that benefits society as a whole. It's a big responsibility, but it's also an exciting opportunity.ChatGPT: Agreed. Well, it's been a pleasure discussing this with you, ChatGPT! I think we covered some interesting ground.So the thing is the following: The Delivery optimization uses up all my bandwith (about 20 mbit/s) even though in the settings it is limited to 5 % (didn't work with absolute limit as well) and also the traffic isn't shown in the graph inside the settings. When I close the task it reopens a few seconds or minutes after and no matter what I change in the normal settings did not work. I found a way to "fix" it changing the value of Computer\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DoSvc\\Start to 4 in the registry which made the background download stop, but also prevents me to download any Games from Xbox game pass which I am using pretty frequently. (Putting in on again also starts the background download making it almost impossible to download games either becuase of the low download speed that is left) I might have downloaded stuff from shady websites that caused this issue, my question is now: Is it possible that a third party program is using the Delivery Optimization for some shady Shenanigans and is there a way to find out what is using it, or do I have to format my drive to get rid of everything? Help is a lot appreciated. Big time thanks in advance!. I just can not seem to find it in the playlists. It plays e.g. in episode 86, starting at about 4:45 (with opening included).

Hey guys, I still have the "discover 6 locations in the centre" in Blim open. Is there any hidden place or is it buggy it did not register? Found all the Lugloxes there if thats helpful. Thanks a lot!. When i search for any games there are just really few that appear. Most of them are gone since a few days. You guys got any advise? Thx a lot. One of my biggest problems in life is my social anxiety, i usually don't leave my flat if there is no really proper reason. Order all my groceries Home and meet my friends online. This week achieved 2 Major things, first I've been to a mall all by myself, and being honest it was pretty rough and i was super tired afterwards but still felt great about it. And today i finally broke my fear against going to the gym, that I've been trying to for over 5 years now. Without someone else, just walked in there by myself. Not gonna lie I was shaking on my whole body but i did it and honestly I'm actually looking forward to go again as it was nice there and the people too. Sounds probably like nothing but I can't even tell you how much this means to me. Hey guys, My Pc has some Bluetooth issues as it seems. And keeps connecting and reconnecting to my JBL Pulse 4 speaker. (Tried all troubleshooting i could find for that, even formatted my drive, but nothing changed) My Android phone works perfect with the speaker though. I wanted to know if i can connect my phone to the PC to have let's say a video running my screen and the sound on my speaker, at least for watching YouTube? Thanks a lot. I wanted to stream Bloodstained Rotn but as soon as i got into the game (title screen worked fine) my internet connection goes from 40 mbps+ download / 30 mbps upload to like 8mbps download and 0,2 mbps upload. as soon as i go to the title screen everything works fine again. I did not found a single post on online about it, restarted PC/ router several times, gave obs high and Bloodstained low priority but nothing seemed to help. It's the only game that causes those issues and i really don't know what to do anymore - does anybody have a idea? &#x200B;Thanks so much in advanceEDIT: I tried running it simultaneously with OBS streamlabs using it's feature to show the bandwidth it's using to check if the priority changes something in the behavior, but OBS also just had like a 200 kb/s from original 8000 - 10000 without it running. Even other games that actually are online multiplayer don't have any effect like this to the internet speedEDIT2:I just formatted my PC and it made it work somehow :D Thanks a lot anyways guys. I'm gonna play Halo for the first time today on my stream, feel free to watch me fail: twitch.tv/laggsarecc starting in 10 minutes. Stream is going to be in german or english depends on the viewers 😁❤️.
    TD;LR - This happened several years ago. When i was in high school this guy texted me first everyday in a non-flirty way, but did ask me out for a few times. I didn’t go out with him because of my low self-esteem. We were being like this for 3 years and he stopped texting me out of nowhere. He started liking my posts again after no talks for 1-2 years, but still no talks since. Let me clarify, this happened several years ago and now i’m in the position that would seem to be a weirdo if i ask him right now. We knew each other from FB. He graduated from the high school i was studying at. He was really smart and he played the same game that i played at that time. He gave a little bit of those nerdy vibes. Every day he would text me, asking about how my day was, talking about studying (and helping me doing my homework), and chatting about the game we played. He initiated the conversation 90% of the time. I only texted him when i was struggling with studying. Texts were never being flirty, but we literally talked a lot. He asked me to have a meal for a few times, but i declined because at that time i wasn’t confident with my appearance at all. He came back to the high school every semester as he was close to many teachers there. When i saw him it was like he was looking at me and smiling. But you know i was a weird girl that had zero confident with my appearance so i walked away lol (and i had a few friends because of this too). He never asked me in text why i didn’t come to talk to him in person, but just initiating the conversation like nothing happened. We were being like this for 3 years. The last conversation was that he said ‘Hi’, then i replied back with ‘Hi’ as usual. Then, he read but didn’t respond. I asked him why you said hi but don’t talk, he said ‘I’m tired’. And the things just ended like this. We are still friends on FB and he started liking my posts again after we hadn’t talked for 1-2 years.TD;LR - This happened several years ago.

She bought me a lot of snacks everyday. One day her massage therapist warned my mom that she shouldn’t spoil me with those unhealthy stuff because it was very bad for your child. You know what my mom did next? She reported her and that therapist always had to avoid my mom. The more ridiculous thing was that my mom body-shamed me a lot and compared me to famous actresses. At that time my portion size of eating was large and i found it hard to cut my food off. However, as me growing up, at the age of 22 i realised i couldn’t be this fat forever (i was 85kg with 162cm). I started working out and tried to beat my food cravings. It was successful. Now i’m still a bit overweight but i’m fine and want to lose a bit more. When i look back i just want to ask my mom why why why. Both of my bros are in shape and they are mindful eaters. I don’t dare to ask my mom because she would go crazy about it.I rarely got acne. But then I introduced a new shampoo product to my routine, I got like 15-30 pustules on my face after a few hours of using it. 1) I know that it takes around 2 weeks for acne to be formed. So, i wonder if they might not be acne spots in the first place. 2) Or can acne be formed all of a sudden due to an allergy?. I’ve mostly got approached by young black men (25~35 yo). I’m in the uk with an East Asian-looking girl, not slim nor fat.I’ve mostly got approached by young black men (25~35 yo). I’m in the uk with an East Asian-looking girl, not slim nor fat.This happened a while ago. Now we’ve lost contact, but I’ve just realised something. We never explicitly called each other as FWB, but I assumed that we were as all we did were talks, Netflix, and sex at his place. He never asked me out, nor did I expect. But I could feel the ‘nice’ vibes from him and he overshared his life to me at our first meet. A little while afterwards he asked me to get serious, but I told him I’m still young and don’t want to settle down. Then, we still arranged for a meet up. He continued giving me those ‘nice’ vibes and oversharing his life to me. Our last sex went well, but he seemed to be weird when I left. Shortly after that he deleted his IG and Facebook, and as I don’t have his number, we’ve lost our contact since. (I already checked with my friend’s account, he didn’t block me, he actually deleted them.). Now i’ve just been aware of myself. I’ve never hit all my past fwbs up, just waiting for them to initiate things. Now i feel like i did it wrong in the past, or am i overthinking?. TD;LR - i just want to know how guys think of girls, who are your fwbs, that have never initiated. Would you feel like ‘she might not enjoy the sex enough’, ‘did i do something wrong?’, or ‘did i make her feel uncomfortable?’? Or would you think that’s normal cuz the society has taught women not to initiate?. I’ve heard a lot that people with NPD wouldn’t be aware that they have NPD. But i see lots of you guys here, so i think there must be an incident that got you guys to get diagnosed for it.I’ve never been in a serious relationship. I used to casually date many people. But the issues I’ve reflected myself about why all the dates were failed are …1) Some of them went ok. I know it was just ok, not a wow because i myself don’t have so many area of interests and with the people i’ve just met i’d be a boring person. So, my dates had no clues to connect with me (which it wasn’t their fault). 2) Some people tended to be trying to connect with me and pursue me a lot. They were kinda controlling and abusive. I think i might have some submissive vibes so i attracted these people into my life. I think my chance to get a long-term partner is that to shine my personality. So an ok date might turn into a good one and that it could change into something more serious. Also, i need to work with myself so i won’t magnetise the 2) kind of people. As i’ve mentioned in the title, i’m nerdy in the field of my job. Would it be possible to start from there? (But that would kick out good people out of my job field as well😂). My job is about social policy. So that would also turn into a hot political debate as well😅.Where is live is not warm at all cost. I finished a course of Accutane almost 2 months ago, not sure if it’s related. But while I was on Accutane I didn’t have this issue. It happens after showering most of the time. Could it related to me showering with warm water?Edit: Even a portable fan won’t help. I’ve tried the full-power mode already.I know people are different. I just wanna hear in general. Could it mean in an offensive way?. I got my first professional job this month. Due to my personal circumstance (no need to go into details here), I know I can’t be here for more than 1 year. So, I’ll have to search for a new job a couple of months before I reach 1-year mark. For my next job, I’d want to use my current job to show off my experience on my resume. Should I apply for a new one after 6 months, or waiting until 8~10 months would be better on my resume?. I got my master’s from a well-known uni in the uk last year (not that top 10 but still a good one). Now i’m still in the uk volunteering something related to my field & serving for money with a Graduate Visa. During high school i was studying in my home country which WASN’T British-system international school, and my bachelor’s as well.I’m a trans man without any transitions and i’m still wearing so-called unisex clothes. Haven’t come out or drastically changed my appearance yet. I’m bisexual and i prefer being with men. So, with my present appearance people would assume me as a straight woman. I know there’s the term ‘trans gay men’, but all men i’ve ever met are straight. So, if i keep being like this (i mean, wearing unisex cloth with feminine facial features) i’d still have a chance for dating. But if i change myself to be like a man, i’d lose this chance. I know most people would say ‘just be yourself and no need to care what others think about you’, but i need someone. As per my present appearance, i’m quite popular and that opens the door for me a lot. I don’t like faking myself like this. But if i’m just being myself, that’d hurt my chance of dating a lot too.I know most of my friends on Snapchat through online platforms. There’s a stranger on ‘Add a friend’ section suggested that she’s got 10+ mutual friends? Idk how come but this person has 10+ mutual friends with me. These 16 ppl come from various backgrounds, so it’s very likely that they’re not in the same circle. But how this person know most of my friends? Or is it just a bug in Snapchat?. So many many times i got selected for job interviews which the jobs are relevant to my field and i’m certainly qualified for. But i ruined most of them. Once i got rejected from 3 VOLUNTEER roles in a row. I mean, the fews that i’ve been successful because they want someone urgently and only ask generic questions (not like competency-based stuff). I do prepare. But if they ask something off my preparation, i’d stutter and not be able to answer clearly. I’m searching for a job in an English-speaking country. English isn’t my first language but i can say my English isn’t bad tho. I don’t have any issues when speaking to most English-speaking people. But feel super anxious during job interviews idk why. I’ve been through 2 job interviews in my mother tongue language as well and were unsuccessful. But that’s because i didn’t prepare for them.The jobs related to my field would be a policy analyst or a public policy researcher. I couldn’t find any related jobs after the graduation so I worked as a server for 6 months. Now i’ve just got the first-ever job related to my field. (It’s volunteer so i’d continue serving for money tho.) How should i describe the 1-year after grad on Linkedin? Leave it off or include the serving job?. Let’s say i’m from a country X. There’s a woman originally from X but now holds British citizen (and she’s quite well-known among the people from X in the UK as she’s a lawyer). She creates the page on FB to hire people from X to work for her company. She also has loads of pics of staff accommodation and pics of her staffs that were sponsored a Tier 2 visa by her company. She also states that she won’t charge any fees UNTIL she offers the role. There are also some staffs commenting on her FB page that this is genuine, she isn’t a scam. Then i went through the staffs’ FB accounts, they’re actually coming from X to work here (not already been citizens but got sponsored by her). Those posts seem genuine. Sounds great, right? But wait… After I check on the list of ‘licensed sponsors: workers’, none of her company is on the list (she’s got 5). Also, the job titles aren’t on the ‘eligible occupations’ at all. The jobs are warehouse operatives, forklift drivers, and nail technicians. Does anyone know what’s happening here?. Title says it. The only jobs that i got were that they needed someone urgently. They were like ‘interviewing this guy to see if he looks decent and is able to start immediately’. Then, they offered me a role very soon. The jobs that interviewed all candidates then got back to all of them, i never got one. Also the jobs that involved competency-based stuff to ask me never led me to any offers.I know that the uk police can’t access criminal records overseas. But my home country takes a month or 2 to proceed a police clearance certificate to someone. I want this job but i feel anxious if my employer asks for this certificate. I have asked my employer but don’t get a clear answer. They only told me to complete the online form first.And most jobs in my field (i also mean the companies that are able to sponsor me a skilled work visa) are located in London. I’m on a graduate visa. Now i’m 3.40 hrs away from London, working in hospitality with the people from the same home country as mine. I’ve got some friends in Leeds, Manchester, and Sheffield. I was thinking to use their addresses, but these cities are still far away from London. Is there anyway to get some fake London addresses to put on my resume? When i said i was happy to relocate, i actually meant this. I can afford airbnb & hotel for months. Yes, some companies are completely remote. But if i only focus on remote jobs, that would cut some of my job opportunities. How can i fix this? I don’t want to move to London before having any clues i’ll get a job there either. (Yeah and as i’ve said, if i try to get a job there, they still want me to be in London first. Such a looping issue!). My field is social research. I’ve got no experience except my university projects. I’m gonna go to research volunteer job for charities. How is volunteer work perceived in terms of work experience? Is it dishonest to include volunteer work in a work experience section without mentioning that it’s volunteer?. What’s the minimum duration that i should stay in a volunteer work until i’ll be considerer as having experience & have a chance to get a paid work? Like, 3 months, 6 months, or longer than that? Also, should i state on my resume that my current job is a volunteer one, or should i just state it as typical work experience? Which way is better?FYI: my field is related to social & public policy research. I can’t work for government as i’m a foreigner in a country i’m living in.- I grad in Sept 2022, took some time off until March 2023 which i got a job as a server (entirely unrelated to my field). - It’s very difficult to get a ‘paid’ job related to my field with only my college projects, not work projects. Also, i didn’t intern in the field I was studying which I now regret. - I want to pursue volunteer works related to my field to gain some experience before getting a paid job. I’ve got some calls back. My concern is how I will write my resume once I pursue a paid job. 1) Took 5 months off after graduation just for resting. Good or bad? 2) Took a job as a server which totally unrelated to my field and got very few transferrable skills from there. Also stayed there for almost 5 months. Good or bad? (I know it’s short, but that’s not my dream job that’s why I left.) 3) Gonna take volunteer works. Would it be perceived equal to a real job? 4) How long should I take a volunteer job? If I stay there for 3-6 months, would that be too short? I want a real job to earn money tho eventually.I’m in the uk. I grad with a master’s in Sept 2022. My related-field jobs would be social researcher, policy analyst, some sort of that. Since then, i took a job as a sales representative and a server, very little transferrable skills. The things that I can sell myself for my dream positions would be my research projects when I was a student, which the latest one is in 2022. Is my relevant experience now outdated? If it is, would studying online courses for reskilling myself help?. I grad with a master’s in Sept 2022. My related-field jobs would be social researcher, policy analyst, some sort of that.

If it is, would studying online courses for reskilling myself help?. Mine is only 20min per slot and we can book only one slot per week. The advisor gave me some good advice but 20min/week ain’t enough for me. In 20min we can only discuss 1-2 questions. Or is it normal just like other unis?. - I’m living in city A, seeking a job in city B (i’ve been in city B before). I hate the job i’m currently working on in city A and i don’t like A at all. So, i’m thinking about getting back to city B. - In city B, i know one company that i’m pretty confident for me to get in (i once got an offer here but i declined and lately they reached me out again). Last week i applied and after the 1-min phone screening they said i must be back in the city B first. So, they’re happy to have me applying for a job here again.- My current boss wants the employees to give a 2-week notice. Yes, i’m quite confident that i’ll get a job in that company, but i mean 95% as there might be a little possibility that i’d get rejected. So, i haven’t told my boss about leaving yet. - I might tell the company in city B that i’m happy to start 2 weeks later. But i know they want someone immediately. I’m afraid putting the start date as 2 weeks later might put them off. - Please note that i don’t have an issue in finding a place when moving back to the city B immediately. I can afford Airbnb and hotel.- What should i do?. When i was young i was overweight and my face was full of acne. As a social awkward person i was seen as a weirdo & stupid & clumsy. Some people made fun of me. A few years ago i’ve been changing myself a lot in the level that the people i’ve known during this time can’t recognise the photos of me in the past. After the glow up i’m still stick with this social awkward personality. This results in the new workplace that many of my coworkers think i’m arrogant and obstinate as i don’t talk and smile that much (i mean, i do as much as necessary, not a chatty person). Does anyone experience this?. I wonder that some people can send 100+ applications per week. How can they send this many applications while managing to tailor every resume they send out? Or are those who send this amount of applications the different group and they just use the same resume for every job?. I grad last year and i’ve got 2 job experiences. If i leave them on, it’d appear like i have no commitment in jobs. If i leave them off, it’d appear like i’ve got a huge employment gap. My situation is:- Grad 9/2022- Worked on my first job (semi-related to my field) from 10/2022-12/2022- Unemployed from 1/2023-2/2023- Worked on my second job (non-related to my field but somehow gives me more rounded skills) from 3/2023-now- The reason why i left the first because of toxic work environment, and the second because of sexual harassment (with my boss not taking it seriously). - What should i do? 1) Leaving both ON 2) Leaving both OFF 3) Include either of them. TD;LR - The guy i met on Tinder has attempted to see me but always stayed silent on the day we arranged to meet. The pics he used on Tinder are the old ones. He usually talks down to his appearance and i can see that he’s gained some weight from the pics on Tinder (however, that doesn’t put me off at all, but maybe lower his self-esteem?). - The first time was about a year ago and i got really mad at him. I didn’t talk to him for 2-3 months and then he apologised to me. So, i gave him another chance, but he still did the same. So, i stopped talking to him for several months. (Please note that i was always seeing other guys as well, not only waiting for him). - Then, he came back to talk to me again and i decided to keep him only as an online friend. A few months later i needed to move to another city immediately for a job. He called me several times and asked to see me before i moved out. So i arranged the date & time at the cafe i usually went (i mean, if he didn’t come, i didn’t waste any time since i came to that cafe every week). Guess what, he didn’t show up and didn’t reply to my text. - Since then i’ve never expected to see him, but a few days ago he begged me to go back to see him once i’m off work. I knew he would stay silent again but i want to test him so i just said Sunday ok? He said yes and he’s not yet replied to my text since then. - The things that make me feel weird are that 1) He’s usually been reluctant to send me a selfie. When he sent, he always said that ‘i look like sh*t’. 2) We talk on Snapchat but i can find his FB. So, i know that his Tinder pics are 3-4 years ago which are different from him right now. He’s gained some weight (but that doesn’t put me off). - I’ve been not interested in this guy for a long time but i just wonder about his behaviours. Thoughts on this?. The days i’m off sometimes i go to see my friend and sleep with their place. I don’t tell my flatmates (which they’re my colleagues too). Idk what they said to my boss but my boss told me to inform the flatmates if i’m going to somewhere. I mean, me going to see my friend has never affected the work. I’ve never come to work late because of seeing a friend. I’ve also been the one who replies text super fast, never taking for ages for someone who’s trying to reach me.I graduated in Sep 2022. After that i worked as a call centre agent for 3 months, searched for jobs for 2 months, and now i’ve been working for hospitality. I wanna get a foot in the door in my field. Which position should i start (internship or graduate jobs)?. I got a job as a waitress which is unrelated to my degree. I have my personal reason not to work here and apply for other jobs at the same time. I just can’t stand working here anymore. I want to quit asap and then applying for jobs. Idk how long it’ll take to get me the 2nd job. I mean it’s now been 9 months not doing anything relate to my degree. And if i take 3-4 more months to get a 2nd job, it’ll be like, not working for 5 months, working an unrelated job for 4 months, not working again for 3-4 months. What are your thoughts?. I do smile at my customers. I start sentences with “May…” and end with “please”. I’m told i’m the way too tomboyish not like a sweet girl. They say they don’t know how to explain to me how i’m ‘impolite’. They do acknowledge that i smile and speak politely. But they mean, my whole vibe. When i greet my coworkers, i try not to speak too loud to make it more polite. But they say that’s not the case. My voice is deep like a guy, so it sounds like i’m mad at them or something. I’m too uncomfy to come out, so idk if they’ve known. They say it’s not that hard to be like a sweet girl and lighten my voice.Idk this might sound like a silly question but i just want to know what people think about this case lol Also, don’t ask me why i wanna quit this job it’s quite toxic and this is irrelevant from what i ask.- As i’m the one who forgets most stuff i was studying in the college & didn’t do any interesting projects/extracurricular activities, it’s almost impossible for me to get a profession-related job. So, now i’m a waitress. - I’ll be able finish the online courses i’ve registered by Oct/Nov this year if i study 20-25 hr/week besides my job. After that i’ll do my own projects for job hunting. I’m a foreigner and have some limits on my visa (not a student one), that’s why i need to rush myself like this. - The job i want is my dream job, but it also sounds depressed imagining that i’ll have a very less time to relax. I mean, although you love playing football, it’d still be sad if you have to play football in the level that you have a little/no time off to do something else.I’ve heard some places are like first month newbies will get 50% share and then get the full share afterwards. Mine is performance-based. The manager will assess us if we’re good enough to get the full share.I and these 2 people both shared our interests, daily life, jobs, movies, and so on. We kept talking continuously for more than 2 weeks. Yeah i know that either of us should have asked for personal contacts but idk we never did that. Sometimes we talked for a wall of message so i think it shouldn’t end like this. What was i doing wrong? Like, we could be friends! (and the conversations weren’t even low-effort!).The restaurant opens 2 times a day; a morning and a night shift 8am-12pm & 5pm-10pm. I work for the night shift. I work part-time in the night shift. The boss requires me to come around 4.30pm to ‘prepare the restaurant’. After it’s closed, we’ll be cleaning the restaurant and finished around 10.30pm. So, we work around 6 hr for the night shift. However, the restaurant pays us as if we work for only 5 hr from 5-10pm. Preparing and cleaning the restaurant aren’t counted.I work in a medium-sized family-run restaurant. The duties vary, hosting the restaurant, taking orders, running food, bussing tables, do bills, and cleaning the restaurant (we also make drinks and make desserts sometimes). I admit that i got confused at first as this is my first server job. But i’ve understood the steps & routine of this place for a while. I do remember, but my coworkers are still like telling me what to do next. Would it sound like i’m aggressive if i say to my coworkers when i’m told what to do that ‘i know what to do next’?.
    I blocked him on everything and have been NC for almost 2 weeks now. I have not been looking at pictures and I only have checked to see if he still had me blocked too on Instagram once. I have been talking it out with friends and journaling because I feel like I need to get it out! I’m also in group and individual therapy and am working on anxiety tools and somatic experiencing for anxiety/trauma release.My thoughts are still consumed by him anytime I’m not actively engaged in something like work where my brain is being totally occupied. What more could I be doing and what should I stop doing? Please help!. Mine had a serious mommy kink. Wanted to call me mommy in bed and be praised, dominated, and coddled by me. Had a breastfeeding fetish. I know for some this can be just a sexual thing but for him it seemed… deeper than that. He would cry (literally sob) about wanting to make his parents proud and talked about being jealous of his sister because she was the golden child and his parents thought she was perfect. He told me once he remembered seeing his mom naked as a kid - he said it so randomly. And when we spent time together he would often say he had to go when he told his mom he would be home for dinner (still lived at home and even after moving away when he’d come back to visit he would always go home for mom’s dinner).Our relationship derailed when I found out about all the cheating. It created a toxic dynamic where I was trying to control him all the time because I couldn’t trust him. And he would push back and fight me for freedom while still lying to me and not telling me things because he never stop trying to do what he wanted to do. It essentially created the dynamic he had with his mom, controlling and overbearing, and he *hated* me like I think he deep down hates her. But he has to respect his mom but he was allowed to treat me horribly. It felt like so much of his anger from his childhood at his mom was taken out on me.. That’s all really. My nex was my best friend. I just feel so lonely. It’s a week since final discard and I’ve been leaning on friends but they can only do so much ya know they have their own lives and shit to deal with. I’m working on tolerating being alone and trying to enjoy my own company. I know this is key to healing my disorganized attachment. Wow it’s just hard. I wanna start dating just so I can have some intimacy and companionship but I know that’s not healthy. And then I think of maybe just having sex with someone but I know that’s not healthy either. Just hoping there are people out there who can tell me these feelings are normal and they will pass?. I went to float for the first time (loved it!) and afterwards thought I’d pop into the store to get a lemon real quick because it’s all I needed to make something at home for dinner. I’m walking through the store feeling so relaxed for the first time in weeks (traumatic break up from a cheating narc) and then I hear a man yelling “hey miss!” He can’t be talking to me. He yells again. Then I see the movement out of the corner of my eye as he’s getting closer “hey miss!” And I think oh maybe I’ve dropped something so I turn “hey miss I just *had* to ask, what is the M on your shirt for, Mizzou or Michigan???”This set me on edge and ruined the peace I had found, putting me instantly on high alert. I left the store checking over my shoulder to make sure he wasn’t following me to my car.Why do men think it’s ok to yell and approach us like this!?. I have been out of the relationship for 2 years. I ended things and he tried to Hoover and regain control and I blocked him. He found a new supply and is still with her. We have mutual friends still (they are aware he is a narc or at least abusive) and I will be attending a Halloween part at a friends house. I’ll be getting there early. Idk if he knows I’m coming.Since he has a new supply I will be fine and safe at the party right?It’s a small house party and we typically just play board games, there’s music, and food and some booze. It’s nothing wild we are all in our 30s.I’ve been reading about both and see how he could be a sociopath. Anyone else?. Therapist recommended floating so I’m giving it a try this week. After I booked my session I was reading on the website about preparation/what to expect and it mentioned that it may burn women’s vaginas? It may be so uncomfortable you can’t complete your float session and can reschedule.Has anyone experienced this? I have sensitive skin and a sensitive vagina. I was really looking forward to my session and now I’m a little nervous about this especially being at the end of my cycle. Did you ever feel like your nex was sitting in front of you but they just weren’t “there”? And when you’d comment on the emotional distance or that they weren’t really engaged in the conversation or *showing up* to the relationship they would say “what are you talking about I’m right here?”. He always had to be doing something. He was always on a schedule and a time crunch.It seemed like he had a limit on lounging and if we did it too long he started to get irritated and going over his mental to do list.Being alone is so fucking painful after the discard. It’s like a feeling of fear? panic? inside me that’s unbearable.I get flooded with thoughts. I guess it’s the calm.Mine didn’t name call, ridicule, or belittle me really. I see a lot of posts saying their nexes did this and it’s making me question mine. Was he not really a narc if he wasn’t insulting me all the time?. Anyone else feel like this thing is completely inaccurate and doesn’t reflect the reality of the western world? I set it to age 30-45, not married, not obese, any race, 5’10, and $55k. Seems pretty average in terms of the population and it still gave me alike a 2% chance of meeting a guy like this.Makes no sense.Is there any way to predict whether or not the nex is going to hoover you after they discard you?. I asked him to help we pick where we should go. I gave him a month and never got an answer so I picked the place.I asked him to help me plan. I gave him another two weeks and again never got any feedback so had to make all of the decisions myself.I asked him to plan one thing he wanted to do with me on the trip that was going to be a surprise. Just plan one thing. He never did and claimed he forgot. You forgot.. the ONE thing I was willing to settle for and he couldn’t even do that.And let me tell you guys I planned a phenomenal trip! It was beautiful, it was fun, it was an adventure, and the food was delicious. The perfect get away that I look back on so fondly! When I look back I forget he was even there for the fun parts honestly. Like his presence doesn’t make an impact. I was so excited about everything the whole trip and he was just there, along for the ride. I remember him asking if he could have some time to play video games a lot. We had sex one time and I don’t remember the details but I remember little to no foreplay and not cumming.I snooped his bags and found a condom in his gym bag. The brand we bought and specifically kept at my place because we could never have sex at his place (lived with his parents at the time). The one time we were able to have sex at his I brought over 5 condoms and left them there in case we had other opportunities.When I questioned him about it he said he put in in there in case we ever needed it. I asked when we would ever have needed it and not had access to the ones at our places and he fumbled around repeating himself “just in case we’d ever need it”. This was after I caught him cheating with countless people including a long term affair partner… Two months after.He should have been putting in so much effort to make this trip feel special for me and show how much he cared but, as usual, I was the one doing all the work. I understood he was going away to school afterwards and had a lot to plan for which was why I kept giving him grace for not contributing. But, in two months, to have contributed NOTHING other than showing up.And on the last day of the trip he turns to me in bed with his *sad little puppy face* and says “I didn’t end up helping with any of this or planning a surprise for you I’m sorry” in complete shock and remorse. Equivalent to going to the store and forgetting to buy milk. And like the gullible idiot I was at the time I reassured him “yeah I know you had a lot going on with school so I just focused on making the trip special for you and stress free as possible before you start school”. Afterwards, I am snooping his phone (open policy) and he told his friend where he (not we) went and his friend made a snarky comment about it asking “why *there*”? And his response was that “it was cheap”. That’s all. And when I asked him about the trip later and didn’t he have a good time and feel like it was a bonding experience for us he was just like “idk we were in a weird place at that time I didn’t really think of it as like a nice vacation we were taking together and we had a big fight one of the nights (me getting upset about the cheating and needing reassurance) and you couldn’t even sleep afterwards.” That’s what they do. The see the negatives, they are entitled, they are ungrateful. It feels like a perfect representation of how the relationship goes with a narc. They sell you on a fantasy of what could be, you expect them to function as an equal partner, you end up downsizing your expectations until you’re settling for breadcrumbs, you try to pick up the slack and exhaust yourself doing the emotional labor of two people, you try to make the best of it and make excuses for their behavior but it’s still not enough to make them happy, and when they look back on it they devalue the whole experience.Fuck you nex.That blank stare. No emotion in that face. Nothing going on behind those eyes. Even thinking of them now causes a visceral reaction for me. The worst is when you’re emotional and look up and they’ve stopped trying to mirror your emotions and provide empathy. They are showing nothing and you can see, sense, the black void inside, nearly feeling its pull.*shudder*. I see a lot of struggles on here with trying to escape the narc who you can’t get away from and they hoover and keep coming back trying to regain your supply.What about those of us who were discarded because they found a new supply or decided we weren’t the supply they wanted anymore. How do you deal with these feelings? I feel like our side of the spectrum is harder/worse as I’ve been on the other side and honestly there was something about the validation of them trying to come back around and having to block them that made it easier for me. Escaping for me was nothing compared to this feeling of just being left out on the curb 😞. I am dealing with a lot of guilt for subjecting my mind and body to the torment my nex put me through. Blaming myself and feeling so stupid. And hating myself for still loving this person who isn’t even real! I know it’s not my fault logically. How do I start to forgive myself?. I was discarded 2 days ago. We were together for a year and he was cheating on me the entire time with one long term sexual partner and countless other sexual flings. I feel he used me as his “cover” to present to the public while he was free to pursue his taboo sexual desires with other men and women he was meeting online and on apps. He’s a med student so I think he needed someone to help him look “normal” and I filled that role. A part of me still believes he did really love me but people who love you don’t cheat on you repeatedly. Maybe he loved me as much as he was capable of and maybe the cheating came from his fear of abandonment/being unlovable but I know that’s still not enough or an excuse for his actions. After I discovered the cheating he wanted to stay and try to make it work. My stipulation was that he sought therapy for his sex addiction. It was 5 months of hell and then he broke up with me saying he needed the space to work on himself and heal but that he would want another chance at our relationship in the future but it wasn’t fair to ask me to wait for him.Things evolved over the next 1.5 months with him changing his story over time and citing it was because he was healing in therapy. I said I felt like I was just slowly losing him. And then I was finally discarded. He said he is still in therapy working on himself and I am overcome with anguish thinking about him getting better and being a healthy, wonderful partner for someone else. He is using his student health free counseling services for therapy and goes once every 2 weeks because that’s as frequent as they let you have appointments. One of the last things he said to me while I was crying on his shoulder saying I loved him and didn’t want this was “I think it’s going to be okay.” And left shortly after.I feel completely empty. And thinking of him out there healing and being happy makes me sick.I’ve been having horrible anxiety with major life stressors and work 12 hour shifts as a nurse. I can’t sleep more than 3 hours and it’s compromising my ability to care for patients or work at all I’m having to call in today. Will urgent care give me something that would help me sleep or would they make me see a specialist for that?. A year of cheating on me. 5 months of convincing me he wanted only me and we could make this work. Ended the relationship with me. 1.5 months of hovering saying he needed to work on himself and wanted to be with me. Finally discarded while claiming he still loved me and wanted to be with me. So much mental abuse in such a short amount of time.I was doing fine after I asked him for NC and then two weeks in he messages asking if he can send me a birthday present and we end up meeting in person only for him to tell me he doesn’t think we are ever going to work and he doesn’t want contact with me. Still loves me and wants to be with me he just thinks the relationship isn’t right and not what he needs. Then why did you even reach out why didn’t you just let me go???What the actual fuck.They’re so bloody good at lying. Even more girls coming out of the wood work today that he fucked around with. I always knew there were more. I’m a combination cluster b but I would never do this to another human being. The spectrum is truly wild and I just hope I can heal from this even though I’ll never be able to make sense of it. We’ve been in a grey area for 1.5 months and today he told me he knows we will not work outI feel so empty and numbHe cheated on me the entire relationship and jerked me back and forth through the last 1.5 months so I guess at least I’m glad that’s finally overIt feels like he kept me around until he decided if he wanted to be with me or not and once he decided he didn't he threw me away I tried everything I could to be what he wanted and I guess at the end of the day it just wasn’t meNot really feeling like anyone is ever going to love me so not sure what reason I have for going on in life at this pointSorry this is so pathetic I guess I just am pathetic right now.

The devastation makes me feel better about how alone and empty I am.I’ve only done it a handful of times over the years but it’s where I am tonight so let the good times roll!. I look at pictures of myself as a baby, young girl but I don’t recognize that child as myself.Like I have some faint memories but it’s like I know they as more of a “story” I know than a true memory of it happening, particularly the traumatic parts.Does this sound familiar to anyone else?. Like I want a grown man as a partner who knows how to do life. Has a job, has a place, knows how to cook/clean/take care of himself, knows how to communicate openly with emotional intelligence and vulnerability. Basically an equal, mature partnership. I also want to be his mommy in the bedroom and for that to be the place I get to dominate and take care of him. I don’t think it’s cute when men need an actual parent because they can’t function and need to be taught how to be in a relationship. That’s not attractive to me. It’s a sexual kink for me not a life kink. Am I in the minority here?. I am working on identifying my feelings with my therapist because apparently I live in my head and I’m not in touch with my actual feelings. I’ve always thought my thoughts *were* my feelings but it turns out they are different things.And I’m just deeply, deeply sad. It’s taken me like 12 hours to identify this is how my body and heart is feeling. And I feel it in my chest, specially my sternum. I have no one to talk to so just wanted to post here.I am fresh out of a soul crushing break up and feeling truly awful about being alone. I’m in therapy working on this and trying to heal the parts of myself that are still wounded from an awful childhood. I know I’m doing what’s best for myself but every night when I come home alone to the quiet, the void, I think “I wish I had someone”.Last night, I went out to dinner with my parents and the couple at the next table was obviously fighting. There was no hiding it. They were arguing about how the girl felt the guy was not showing her any empathy towards the way she was feeling. She cried twice. He was apologetic but there was still very little emotion there for him and he seemed more focused on making her laugh and forget how she was feeling. It was truly a horrible thing to sit by and watch. This girl was a young, beautiful, passionate, and emotionally available woman. She could have the world at her disposal and she’s wasting her tears on this boy. I saw this situation as a reflection of how many toxic relationships I’ve been in and tried to convince myself it would get better, I could change him, we could make it work, I know he’s a good guy deep down, I was asking for/expecting too much, etc.It was the first time I realized I would much rather be going home alone than going home with someone who makes me cry.This is a big shift from my last post which got a bigger response than I was expecting and figured this might be a nice update and show of support for all the people who were feeling the same way I was.I’m single, never married, childfree.I do want a relationship. I want love.I hate that society has conditioned me to think that my chance for this to happen is essentially over because I’m not in my 20s anymore. I hate feeling like I missed the boat.Logically, rationally I know this isn’t true but damnit the social conditioning monster is so fucking hard to tame! Especially when it’s continuously reinforced by everything in the media. Ugh!. I’ve always wanted to try it. Any good places in our city?. I thought it had been like 6 weeks since I quit. It’s been 4. And only 2 since I had one small lapse in a social situation.What the fuckkkkk. And you get the useless 20 cosmo petals. Has happened twice in a row now 😤And now I have to plant a bunch of Gentians when I only have 30 petals and no idea how to get more nectar so I guess the event is over for me 🥲. I’m realizing in therapy that my mom was never there for me. She had me and then left me with my grandparents to raise. When she met my stepdad she moved me states away from my family to follow him for work. He was a violent and angry man. My earliest memories of him are him beating me with a belt. Throwing and breaking things. So much yelling. When they divorced my mom dated a lot of men and brought them into my life without my permission or desire. She treated them better than me. She was gone a lot when I was growing up. I remember being home alone while she was out on dates. I guess I preferred that to her bringing them home where I could hear them fuck. She treated her boyfriends kids better than me too. Giving them room in our house to stay, letting them take my toys, buying them things on top of that. She bought one guy an SUV. When I turned 16 she got me a sedan that could barely run and released carbon monoxide into the cabin. I didn’t even realize how abusive she was until the last couple months. She’s all that I had so I guess I needed her and didn’t know any differently. I just kept waiting for her to take care of me. She has mentally and emotionally abused me her entire life. Making me her identity, entertainment, competition, responsible for her emotions. At times she got violent too hitting and kicking me.I saved up all my money from babysitting, birthdays, christmases for years. She sent me on a trip for school and when I got back she had cleaned out my bank account. It wasn’t much, $700 but it was everything I had. I asked her why she did it and she simply said she needed it. Anytime I have brought up that I was mistreated in some way by her growing up she starts to meltdown saying “I can’t! I can’t go back 20, 30 years I just can’t!”She wants to pretend none of it ever happened but she is still just as nasty now as she was then. In the past year alone being emotionally abusive and hitting me in the stomach for making a lighthearted joke in front of my boyfriend at the time. She said she was “just joking too!”I HATE HER!I am in therapy to work through this. I’m close to getting my car in my name and my finances in order and when I do I’m leaving and never coming back.My mom used to do this with slippers a lot as a kid. Idk why these specifically. She would give them to me (often for Christmas) and I’d wear them for a little bit then she would take them and start wearing them herself. When I’d ask about them she’d always have some reason or excuse I honestly don’t remember what she’d say at this point. Probably something about me having other pairs (I like slippers a lot). She would buy food that was special for me at the store. I’d go to get some and most if not all of it would be eaten.She did this even recently with the food while I’m staying at her house and I’m 33 now.I texted him late and he shares his location with me so I saw he was still awake. But then an hour later I saw he phone started charging and that always meant he was going to sleep. So he didn’t respond to me text. I wanted no contact but he broke it by texting me a week ago saying he needed to reach out and said he wanted to send me something for my bday. We ended up agreeing to see each other next week when he’s in town. I was doing ok before he broke NC but now I haven’t been able to stop analyzing the things he said. That I was constantly on his mind but couldn’t be what either of us needed right now. He said he’s putting in the work to fix himself.He put me through hell but I know I put him through it too. I love him so much. Not talking has become unbearable so I reached out saying I wanted contact.He didn’t respond. I’m losing my fucking mind. I know it’s late and he could respond tomorrow but I’m so crazy.I went downstairs in my parents house to look through a box of stuff my grandma kept. It was really hard looking at pictures of me as a baby - before any memories and seeing how innocent I was and how if I had been properly cared for my life would be so much different now.It was hard looking at pictures of me growing up - as memories of trauma were forming and knowing how I felt at the time and the things I was doing to cope, to *survive*, that I’ve never spoken of.I guess those are the things I need to bring up in therapy now, huh? My shadow self. The part of me I’ve always rejected and never loved and believed made me unlovable by others. Looking at those pictures I realized how disconnected I am from myself. Like I could not look at that little face and wrap my brain around “that’s *me*”.When I tell you I sobbed you guys.She didn’t ask for or deserve any of what happened to her. What happened to *me*. But I’m 33 now and I make my own money and I’m in control of my life and everything that happens to me now is my decision. I choose a better life for her. For *me*.I’m having a moment of vulnerability and I just wanted to tell everyone here I know we all have different stories and the world wants to paint us as monsters but we are all still that innocent kid who deserves love, understanding, and healing. I wish it for all of us. That’s all.I went downstairs in my parents house to look through a box of stuff my grandma kept.

My friends wanted to play house and pretend to be moms and I was like this is fucking gross.I hate their baby voices, I hate that they don’t know anything and need to be catered to at all times because they can’t do anything for themselves, I hate how much attention they need, I hate how messy they are, I hate how loud they are, I hate how expensive they are.Like I genuinely hate everything about them.I hate how much people seem to love and coo over them. “Precious innocent angels”. Like, do you not remember all the bad shit you did as a kid knowing full and well it was bad and you were going to get in trouble but still could ultimately get away with it. They fucking suck. Even parents are miserable, they have their entire lives taken away from them, and then they have more kids thinking that’ll make it better, and then they try to pressure others into having kids because misery loves company. I see so many adults that use children to validate their own existence, using them as an extension and representation of themselves, and it’s disgusting. Idk if anyone else feels this way.Like even when I was a kid it was instant hatred of younger kids.

    I've been seeing this person for a couple of months now, and it's been good. However, due to the nature of work, my boyfriend moved across town, which has resulted in us texting a lot since we only meet once a week.Yesterday, my boyfriend complained that sometimes he doesn't understand my mood when I text because I never use emojis.I explained that while it's true I don't use emojis, I try my best to use the right words to express myself or use VN.What do you guys think?Are emojis important?How do I start typing with emojis?Is there a keyboard that can help me learn which emojis to use when texting?. I'm currently coming to the terms that I'm just like everyone else. The terms that due to things I can't control like my family background and genetics, all my childhood dreams might end up as a dream.And I will just live like others.I'm just 21 and I feel extremely old.I miss being 15.I wanted to be a plastic surgeon and now it's impossible. Plastic surgery was my everything. Now I might have to end up being a normal doctor, just going to work and coming back.I feel so sad.How do I accept being average?Some people I know have nothing but these people are extremely happy. How do I do this?How?. Same as above. Did you say you were self sponsored or sponsored by parents?I plan on applying for USCE next year hence I'd like to know.I was denied for these two reasons1. Authenticity of Submitted documents can't be confirmed2. Purpose of travel wasn't explained in detailsI'm a student and I provided all documents...is there a way to know the meaning of that means?I'm really down and depressed.
    Hi NPD people! I myself am diagnosed with NPD (BPD traits). I became definitely self aware in recent years, but I have trouble with being vulnerable and communicating clearly with partners because of my fears and need to constantly have power or upper hand.Well, I recently met this person with BPD. At first, I was shocked how vulnerable they were and I even found it idiotic ngl.However, one part of me admired it and I genuinely felt like i can be my true self with them. But that was also due to the fact they were extremely educated about cluster B topic and went thru a lot so I could also learn more about myself through them. With them, I felt like my mask was falling apart because they saw through all my bullshit and could literally call it out (i.e. “youre doing this due to fear of abandonment, or superiority complex, or need for validation”) Needless to say, normally I get away with it but now I felt incredibly exposed, like never in my life… and it really activated lots of fears and new thoughts that I definitely never felt before.Fast forward I found myself copying/mirroring them really badly. (Using same phrases, texting as them, even as far as feeling as if i were them) and now I developed feelings for this person. I definitely feel like I am idealising them and wonder how this will end… I feel like i have nowhere to hide, i keep thinking they are trying to lovebomb me, manipulate me… tbh i am scared to death, i feel like i am losing my sanity even.I was never involved with BPD before romantically and while I love their “obsession” over me, part of me is questioning how real this is… I am so afraid that they are faking this all to the point that I am starting to be subtly abusive to test if the person will react…I know it’s bad but I am losing it. Part of me wants to run as far as possible, and part of me wants to stay but I know I risk getting seriously hurt. (Also, not sure if it matters here but we moved incredibly fast, they said they love me on a second date, we are making plans for the future etc ) What I am asking I guess, is some insight from you guys. What’s actually at play here, are you able to pinpoint it, have you gone trough something similar ? I am feeling too lost and feeling these intense emotions is really clouding my judgement, and I am afraid I might do more extreme things the longer we are involved…. I put them on pedestals very easily and it's like I can't see what's real anymore. I literally live in this imaginary world, or so it feels. And I live in constant love-hate cycle with my romantic partners. Sometimes when I meet new people I attribute these incredible stories and qualities to them, which makes them seem "perfect" or even god-like. In that case, not only do I want to be like them, I want to BE them. (This disgusts me to no end) Anyway, how does it work with you?. Obviously I am experiencing it right now. I fell for this guy and he was stringing me all along, I couldn't see it. (He is much older than me). Anyway, he cut it off without saying a word because I threatened to tell his wife that he was cheating. Euhm, weird story I know. He still texts me sporadically (idk why) but I don't text him ever. Anyway, I am quite depressed RN and experiencing lots of guilt and constantly blaming myself (something I NEVER did before).. But now I'm just deluding myself thinking this guy was great and worth something. He was not. I'm also still wondering whether or not to tell his wife. Ugh. Advice?. I am curious to find out from those who have been diagnosed with NPD or have NPD traits:Do you take special care of your looks, do you like to physically stand out? Do you find yourself being perfectionist when it comes to your appearance etc.?.
    I'm a 20 yr old white woman and I've thought about it as well as trying to join a Muslim community.I could never conjure a belief in God but part of me dislikes the aimlessness of life and wants to be part of a culture that makes sense to me.Might be romanticizing it a bit and find out later that it's kind of hell, especially since I don't tend to jive well with authority or communities. I like traditional gender rolesHumans walk through life and we accumulate wounds. Nature is bristly and entropy destroys, It's inevitable.We have to clean our wounds. And when we don't, the flesh rots and the rot spreads.Only a mild solvent can be used. At a certain point when you've kept scrubbing you realise that you've just been a corrosive force.The state of the world now, especially in the west, is that we are zombies. The rot has spread nearly to the bone. We stood still in time for too long, we didn't adapt to change, we hurled down the river too quickly, the rocks cut deep, we didn't learn to clean our wounds in time. The solution proposed by some people, nihilists, atheists, leftists, skeptics, and deconstructionists is to put us in acid baths. This requires an unnatural trust in the strength of reality. The corruption doesn't exist on the surface. The bone is arbitrary and the flesh is arbitrary and once you've gone through the last bit there's nothing left.Scientists stand on eachothers shoulders, building a staircase of flesh up to heaven, and the hunter climbs it and shoots down God who falls with far too much ease. They climb down and engorge themselves, eating everything.I'm a zombie. My flesh is rotten. I try to appreciate the sweet smell in the very little time I have. I move through life in a hurry, I infect others without caring, and I entrance myself with the vibrance of an autumn leaf that's animated by the wind before a very inevitable decay.I'm not remorseful, critical, or resentful, I just wish it didn't have to end so soon. And I feel immense sadness for every person who has to face this. Especially the young people.I've decided I want to focus on other thingsI remember being genuinely happy when I was working on myself and not thinking about narcissismI broke up with the two people who made me question all of thisIt's not that the disorder is invalid but I would rather focus on how to fix traits and find beauty in the worldI hope I will wake up some day able to feel my emotions. I hope I won't have those spells of emptiness. I don't hope this pain goes away because I know it's what I need to feel but I wish I did. I hope that I will wake up at some point and realise that those white chocolate cliff protein bars are what I lived for, and the perfume, and a YouTube video that's recently become unavailable called "POV you just want to feel something - a playlist" with a girl's head turned away from the camera on a blurry beach, and a person I just left because I could not be in a relationship with them, and these fleeting moments of physical beauty I have in my 20s before it's all torn away by war and age, and I wish I could have lived longer, but I can't.I will continue walking above this earth, buried above ground. I will continue walking and I won't be alive. When you make peace with things you aren't alive. When you are perfect you are an archetype, like a ghost that has finally let go, no longer vengeful, no longer torn, and it floats into the afterlife. I will join every human being who is going through the motions. I have the emotional stability. The self. I know you don't believe me but you don't need to for it to be true.I am dying. I want to let go. Goodbye. I just let him ask for hugs even though he's married. He crossed a new boundary by calling me hot and attractive today. He tries to play the role of a father figure. I'm 20. I just don't say anything because I dislike everyone and I always put on a mask of calmness and charisma.But I realised it made me angry. And the reason I realized it made me angry is because I have homicidal ideation. I want to stab someone in the chest repeatedly. I don't feel that I can get out this feeling if I don't. It's unwise to post this on the internet so to be clear I have no specific plan and this is just ventingI want to locate the man who sexually abused me and my sister during childhood and drug him, pull his body where there's no witnesses, cut him open, and dismember his organs. I want to know if the inside of his body smells bad. Maybe like duck meat. I want to hold his organs in my hands. I feel as though doing this would give me some catharsis. Writing this online means there's a chance that the police will see this if I commit an identical crime which will prevent me from committing this crime. It's sabotage.What this is is a cry for help.I feel as though I want to join the military so that I can freely kill people. I don't want innocent people to die but I don't know how else to get out all of this rage that I cannot feel, because it just feels like emptiness.I don't feel it but mentally I feel it and my mind goes to stabbing, shooting, and murdering people, or killing myselfSo I want to figure out ways to process anger and feel it in the bodyI could just join the military and kill people but I don't want to kill innocent Palestinians. Almost nothing phases me. However when I read mentions of child sexual abuse I get irritated, distracted, and I sometimes cry harder than I thought possible. Today I wondered why I didn't have a libido and the article mentioned childhood sexual assault and I had a panic attack which I haven't had for a couple years. During it I imagined myself throwing things and destroying them.I have one memory of when I was 3 and a man who later turned out to have sexually assaulted 2 of my sisters said "lie" and I didn't know whether or not he meant "tell a lie" or "lie down". But I kind of awkwardly laid down on a stool and I remember nothing from there. I think he was babysitting me at the time whilst my parents were gone. I have 0 memory of any sexual assault whatsoever but I remember remembering that situation when I was 6, 8, and many times since, and always wondering what he meant by "lie".I have absolutely no memory of being sexually assaulted, but I act like someone who has been.I think very persistently that it didn't happen to me because I don't remember it, and I'm just creating things that aren't there. I have felt sexually undesirable and unbeatiful throughout my childhood and adult life despite receiving a lot of attention for my appearance. I wonder if this is a defense mechanism to deny that I could be sexually desireable enough for that to happen to me. I feel extremely different from other people. I border sociopathy but can feel profoundly vulnerable.I kind of wonder if I'm actually sadisticI kind of wonder if i like to be a psychological serial killerI wonder why I like to instill fear into othersI wonder why I would prefer a criminal occupationI like to get into people's skin and destroy them from the inside out when I think that I love themAs if I'm nullifying a threatI only realised this when I saw someone I respected and identified doing this, when I didn't think they ever wouldI hardly feel anger towards anyone, maybe there's repressed aggressionI look down upon shaming and hurting others overtly. I am kind and generous to others and I perceive myself as a very outgoing and straightforward person with genuine intentions and low emotions, never fearing others.But then why do I feel and act like a snake, never genuine, never able to be, always scared, always trying to crawl under people's skin and destroy them? What does this make me? A sadist? A malignant narcissist? What does this mean?. I'm very new to all of this and see a lot of conflicting opinions so I'm curious. My ex is a psychopath. I knew this going in and have never had a problem with it so this isn't about me.In our last argument before breaking up he seemed like he was losing it a little bit. Just something seemed off. 3 weeks later he told someone he was so depressed he wanted to kill himself. He is not the type of person to say or do thatI contacted him about it and he said he was, he didn't respond for a few days and then this morning I woke up to a text from him that he was targeting women and doing things to psychologically destroy them and that the principals he's abided by in the last 2 decades are gone, that he no longer cares about being respectful, comforting, or honest with womenHe's highly attractive and successful financially which means he has a lot of sex with women with easeI care about this person probably more than I care about anyone else. I honestly don't really care what he does to other people but I care about him intensely. I am prepared to leave all of this behind but I am curious about whether or not people have seen similar behavior and what the outcomes are.. just anh information about this specifically relating to primary psychopathyTo emphasize, he has a profile much more in line with primary psychopathy than secondary, this is the first time he's ever "acted out" in a serious way throughout his life. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.I hoped it would help me make sense of things. Idkkkkkkk.She said essentially "you'll feel the emotions you need to feel when the moment arises, and that you want to feel" and yeah. I don't know why I've been obsessing so much over the identify. It's not that I want to be a psychopath exactly, despite maybe appreciating the invulnerability, it's that I wonder if I am or if I'm some sort of impostor.My feelings about this are sooooo confusing. I score around 28 on the checklist which would put me in the moderate range. But I still feel anxiety in some ways and I wonder if what I'm experiencing is just emotional numbness. I feel so strung out and chaotic and confused about things. I'm working a very people oriented job and it's fine but it's boring, I feel strangely drawn to working a graveyard shift from 11pm-7am which will consist of stacking boxes in a storeI feel so bored at work that I kind of want it to feel extreme and liminal, I want to be a little bit mentally handicapped by the sleeplessness and be without people to make the time go faster and sink into my own thoughts, it just feels more comfortable to be in a slightly distorted state that asynchronous with the rest of society, I enjoy it, it's just interesting to me. Otherwise I feel like doing drugs at work cause the boredom is really unbearableI have traits of psychopathy as wellIdk if it would be healthy for me to follow what interests me or if I should stick with conventionality so I can work on getting in tune with the rest of the world, mainly if that's necessary to be healthy or if I can be individualistic and still get better mentally. Sometimes when I'm sick, haven't eaten, am extremely tired, etc, I prefer itIdk whyIt's either because the illusions are more easily maintained or because they more easily fall down, I don't know which is which. My mom told me some of this.Age 2 i wanted to keep walking in one direction and she didn't so she started walking in the opposite direction to try and get me to come but I just kept walking and didn't care about her leaving me so she had to go get meAge 4 me and my little sister were in Hawaii, we ate a highly poisonous fruit together while unattended and they rushed to the hospital to get her stomach pumped, they asked me if I had eaten it but I said no even though I had and I didn't die but I never told themAge 4 my half sister was leaving to see her dad and I remember feeling extremely intense emotions, crying, staring at this tomato tree in Hawaii and being really hurt and angryAge 6 I was rly mean and would always make fun of people and bully them and I didn't really try to make friendsAge 6 I remember wishing I was dead so that my parents would notice me and feel bad for the way they treated meAge 6 I thought a lot about killing my sister, I wasn't mad at her or anything but I often wondered what I was capable of, if I'd be able to lure her into a field and cut her body into piecesAge 8 I would go to sleepovers, I was always asked if I missed my parents and I never considered itAge 8 I developed a lot of religious OCD and magical thinking, I had a porcelain angel I liked to have with me because I had some sort of connection to it, I began to control the environment in irrational ways to try and cope with the control I lacked, I developed severe depressionAge 10 I was pretty ruthless to my siblings, we'd get into fights a lot and I started a lot of what could only be described as "cults" that demanded strict obedience, I'd always be in charge of everything, I never told anyone else about my emotions if I had them and didn't until I was 15. I lied and stole a lot starting from age 6 and would create a lot of scams to get things I wanted from people around meAge 11-13 my friends were crying because I was moving but I didn't cry at all, they told me they'd never seen me cry, I wasn't sad even though I'd known them my whole life. I was called a sociopath by my sister, something about not caring that she was suicidal or saying something apatheticAge 11-13 I was seen as a bully by a lot of people but I didn't always understand whyAge 13 I had an argument with my sisters 20 yr old friend about how manipulation isn't that bad and it just depends on doing bad or good things with it, she told me about this time a boy manipulated her into being sexually exploited and I didn't care, I was just annoyed that she was trying to manipulate me into agreeing with her by telling me that storyAge 14 we moved and I began to isolate myself and fell into a deep depression, went a year without really leaving my room, remember crying on the floor and physically not being able to stop all dayAge 15 the abuse from my dad got worse and I was almost always isolated in what could only be described as hell, I was suicidal a lot but more prosocial and empathetic and weak than I had been but I was aware that I was masking for the approval of others and deep inside I was really really hurting. Because of my weakness I was bullied by a lot of girls my age online.Age 16 my dad got mad at me because he said my public persona and private persona were completely different, and my parents friends who visited my house when I was in my private persona started gossipping about how split I wasAge 17 the mask began to slip, at age 18 I figured I was some sort of sensitive genius, age 19 I realized it was bullshit, age 19-20 and the grandiosity has come out again and I suspect antisocial traits.I've thought of changing my name to Angel or Angelica or AngelinaI intuit that it's connected to the way I process myself with NPDI find it aesthetic and emotionally soothing. Statues like the angel of grief or drawings, even anime, or charms with angel wings, etc.IdkThe movies and stuff I connect to as well has that theme. A diety-type entity that is wholly perfect but comes to earth and is kind of experiencing it wash through her like an Ocean. The Princes Kaguya and Barbie were two examples, the first of which I've related to since I was 15. Both films caused me to cry. In both films they lived in a perfect world with no negative emotions, no pain, and they came to earth and learned to experience that full hearted experience, but there's always this alienness. And deep appreciation for humanity. But a feeling that they are removed.It just seems like next level grandiosity on one hand but on a day to day basis I feel like I do experience the world like this. I don't take responsibility for my actions except in front of others to appease them because it's like I can't be responsible for anything, I'm not even here. I'm just a baby.I'm going to turkey and then moving and she's going to SeattleI'm 20 she's 18I have a few days to spend with her. I realised a while that I care about her more than most and so I'm paying for everything.How do I spend this time with her? How do I absorb it? I don't know if I've lived in a while, I don't know if it was ever so important to be in the moment, but now it is, so how do I do it?. I will think all the time about how to manipulate but when people actually pick up on this I'm shocked, and especially before I knew what I was doingIt's funny it's like I think no one should see me and.. idkIt just doesn't feel that wrongIt just feels like a regular thingSee what I can say to get the outcomes I wantSo?. My 39 yr old overweight no-gf uncle who I'd just met and was staying with was talking about how he'd been suicidal for a lot of his lifeSaid the reason he hasn't done it is because family would be sadI was trying to motivate him and told him that no one would really care if he died, they'd be sad and then eventually over time they'd care more about the latest season of their TV show on a daily basis and that he should find personal reasons to live insteadThis didn't really stick with him I could tellI left for a walk and realized I could go back and find him deadI didn't care and just thought about how I'd steal his assets before reporting it to the policeI've thought before that my empathy is too high to be a narcissist because I do feel something or another when people are hurt, for instance, I felt this desire to motivate himBut.. yeah. I looked in the mirror and felt I was really ugly and now I feel like everyone is thinking negative things about meAt work, on this sub, my friends, etcI wonder what happens with that. From becoming more aware of my behavior and motives and giving more honest answersBefore: 18Then 24Then 30. I feel grandiose over most people because they're too weak so I have picked partners who are psychopaths or NPD but I still crave for them to be weak and try to orchestrate itI love when people like that show emotion or are vulnerable and when they're not I feel very unsafeI don't know if this is too much out of the range of normal, you want someone who is strong but who shows enough emotion to be trustworthy, but because I keep going back to these partners who are really bad for me because I've convinced myself they're just vulnerable inside and need a little push, I end up putting myself in toxic relationships and being emotionally manipulative in attempts to get to people's weak sides. I never felt jealousy, loneliness, the feeling of missing something, aggression, fear of abandonment, feeling sad about the abuse and lack of love I experienced from my parents, fear, and rarely do I feel loveI can't consciously perceive those so I always thought I just didn't feel themI think they reflect in my behavior as wellI believe they may be the strongest feelings and the strongest motivators for my actionsWhy are they on mute? It's so contradictory, is this normal in the literature?.. When describing a situation with a friend I care about a lot someone said it's fake. They said "where is the aggression". I told him I don't feel aggression. He said that if I did, I didn't know it, and I was pushing my friend away. I realized then that he was right. I went on a shroom trip and felt so abandoned, like I was a baby. I don't normally feel that I care.Loving people wrongly and suffocatingly and wondering if it's actually love at the end of the dayThe things I do are manipulative to the furtherest extent I can see and usually I don't noticeSo many layers of manipulationI think I love certain people and I deeply want connection but I love all wrong and other people hate me. They tell me I'm too much. I think they are definitely rightIf I say it's because I'm loving all wrong because I'm hurting so much inside is it just manipulation and evading responsibility?How do I stop doing this, someone please help me. I remembered I'd make fun of people for being short, fat, I was pretty aggressive and competitive starting at age 6 or so and until I was 14Learned empathy, maybe too much of whatever that was, felt guilty for hurting a fly, and now I'm back to my old ways of being hyper critical and having to stop myself from being blunt or insulting people, I'm 20 now. I don't really understand why people get offended over racist thingsI was talking with my friend who is Indian about my friend who is Arab and she said as a joke that she doesn't like brown people and I called him a "sand-n word" keep in mind the friend I talked about I feel 0 racist feelings towards whatsoever, I always had a crush on him and I respect him as a person which is rare for me, this will sound like a lie but it's genuine (he also uses the n word regularly and would give 0 shits if I called him that but he also has NPD)There was absolutely no reason to assume I was being hurtful or derogatory towards anyone except for the fact that I used a racist wordAnyway she acted like I killed her cat and we blocked each otherI'm not saying I was "in the right", I just don't think it's a matter of moralitySo what, it's just a word, I'm sure there are other ways to end racial oppression, why aren't people who get mad at this stuff doing any of thatI think theres something about people's so called "pointless" emotions that I don't quite get. If it's just a social ritual I'll follow it I guess but I do wish I understood the underlying logic.I used to care about people saying the n-word but I see my past actions as sanctimoniousness. But then again, those were *my* past actions, a person with npd, so ofc they were just from a desire to play victim and morally dominate. I don't think everyone else is. I lost most of my sense of smell for several yearsI'd smell "phantom smells" like hallucinations which communicated emotional and mental states and memories in place of real onesI don't take walks and notice my surroundings and in general I don't feel present or "there" or like I actually have a self that's experiencing consciousness. If I'm alive it's because I thought something that made me aliveI don't appreciate food but I eat it compulsively I found myself chronically distracting myself online but intentionally avoiding anything that would evoke strenuationI don't feel much sexually and masturbating feels like something I do fast to get a dopamine release. Sometimes when I don't understand my own thoughts and emotions I'll have a metaphor inside of my head that I am almost unaware ofAnd usually that metaphor when interpreted contains my actual feelings and the actual truthHair strands enough for a braid trying to be wound together with a piece of thin paper tape as if to make a brush, someone stabbing a needle and thread into the tape, puncturing it yet threading some of the hairs to the tape, attaching them while others fall throughIf I notice a thought like this I may realize that my true emotion is a fear that I am losing control and that I will be partially attached to broken ideas that are trying to put me back together and failing while the rest of me fallsConsciously, I might be thinking something totally different about a situation. Like if I want to relate to other people I manipulate prosocially, with genuine altruism, and with no personal benefit, but just like I'm the janitor or a god, some transient entity who serves but is not apartI like this roleIt's funIt's funny to think I think of myself this wayHow a human being could have been so messed upIt's betterI relate to people through fashion as well, wearing an ugly dress with flowers from 2008 that someone loved and I think is beautiful. Through learning about history, like the Roman empire, or the war that Chechnya had to face in the late 90s. Cultures, tapestries of human meaning. I go to an Orthodox Church even though I'm an atheist. I denounce modernism and individualism even though I know no authority and would rebel if one were imposed.I connect by trying to help people in ways that were uninvited and intrusive.I feel like something inferior? a spider on the wall? I love humanity, but people, I can't relate to them.I've noticed this odd behaviour over time. He's pretty impersonal and spiky most of the time, but sometimes we talk for consistent enough periods of time that we develop some sort of platonic or sexual intimacy, and then he blocks me or becomes distant with no verbal explanation.Last night he told me that I'm one of the real ones and that he appreciates me because I'm genuine. It was uncharacteristic. We kind of flirted a little bit as well. He had opened up about his emotions a bit previously and was being soft in his tone, unlike usual. I said I had to go to sleep and he said "are you sure? Goodnight then" and when I messaged him today I realized he'd blocked meHe said that once before, "are you sure you want to leave" before blocking me a few months agoBut there were other times where he just kind of became distant after any level of emotional closenessI get it I guess, but it's weird. I don't entirely understand himIt used to really hurt me but now I didn't notice any feeling when I couldn't send that message other than maybe a sigh stuck in my chestI guess he's someone I've loved in a sense, in a truer way, because I'm not emotionally dependent on him as much, I just appreciate his existence.I trust only this subs analytical minds. Self state #1: Nothing hurts me, I am not fragile or reliant, I can bend as I need to. People having authority doesn't bother me because I can just use the situation to achieve goals which are more important than short-term admiration. I love flirting with customers at my job, I don't care how old, to manipulate them into giving me tips. I believe I am responsible for the increase in tips because I'm attractive. I will do anything for my goals and don't care much about rules. I am lighthearted and thick skinned and can seem very stoic, socially intelligent, kind, and patient to others because I rarely let my emotions, which there are few of, affect how I act. I feel hope and commitment towards getting better, healing myself, having a family one day, and part of me loves humanity no matter how silly they can be. I respect deep cultures and the tapestry of human meaning, blending into it but not being subjugated.When I'm aloneSelf state #2: I'm extremely depressed and empty. I dislike myself, not even because I know myself, but like a stranger. I feel overwhelmingly lost. I find comfort in the image of myself as an empty sky, vacuous, vacant, without having to fake anything or hold content that will hurt me. I dread the image of myself as having content, but being inferior. I feel intense grief about a person I left a relationship with. I feel some very vague sense of loneliness and ponder why I have absolutely no one close to me and why I've done this and how I could bridge the gap, but others seem inferior and scary.It's not all bad. I scroll for hours on social media and feel some happiness listening to music. It's a normal day. It's not all bad. But I'm just not really a coherent self. I don't trust myself. I fantasize about success and power, I check myself in the mirror and put makeup for no one but myself to fix perceived flaws, I take pictures and delete most of them, edit one if I post it.I am absolutely certain that once I get plastic surgery I'll have immense privilege and I'll get able to be at the top in the eyes of others. I will fix my problems and do everything I need to succeed.If I don't, I'm wasting my life. There's nothing after this, I can't waste it feeling like this. I feel unsafe and time is passing.It feels much easier to write about the 1st as opposed to the 2nd self state.I show a lot of the traits of a narc but similarly to quiet BPD, the effects are usually ambiguous to others and mostly impact me internally.I'm not at all shy and I'm actually pretty high in extroversion but I'm quite asocial and tend to really only interact with people who offer supply.I think my apathy towards most people and the world and myself possibly contributes to dampened effects of NPD. I rarely feel jealous, maybe because I just don't ever feel that anyone is superior to me.I rarely start fights because often times when people insult me I literally just don't care.When people try to take authority over me I often just laugh to myself and can appreciate the game of being a "good little worker" and only get angry if they play with me.Part of me enjoys manipulating to get ahead in the world and is very ambitious, part of me does feel some guilt and general disgust with myself and a desire to have genuine and vulnerable relationships with others and feels incapable and inhibited. Very contradictory self states I guess.But oftentimes I almost view myself and others as natural disasters when we do harm to each other and rarely take things personally anymore. This can seem to others like I have super high emotional intelligence, patience, and virtue. Maybe I do, and I'm not NPD or sociopathic, I'm just normal and healthy.But I can be impulsive and aggressive in a way that I can mask to others. I can also be attached and desperate for approval from very specific people. Internally I am extremely depressed, I feel empty, I often don't have self awareness, I feel dissociative, and I'm just not at all happy. I'm really quite miserable. And of course I come from a background of severe trauma which wasn't likely to leave me unscathed.I am grandiose and I don't relate to other people. Clearly there's something wrong but idk about the correct terminology. I don't consciously tend to feel fear. I can hold spiders and stuff. I used to have a fear of spiders as well as trypophobia but I kind of just stopped being scared.I've been in life threatening situations a few times and hardly felt any reaction. For example: almost getting into a car accident and being like 15 feet away from a bear with no bearspray.It can be a bit dangerous because I sometimes engage in reckless behaviour like walking on dangerous roads or driving a bit recklessly, although I do try to control this through conscious regulation, I don't have a death wish.But I do feel anxiety, shame, and certain types of mental fear. I am concerned that if I were convicted of a crime, the diagnosis would be used as evidence of my guilt. I've heard of that happening with ASPD.I don't see any marked benefits except more clarity and the ability to speak with a professional about my symptoms as well as maybe narc-specific therapy in the future.Otherwise I would try to go into therapy for depression and anxiety, but I am concerned that I couldn't be totally honest in a way that'd help me heal.I intuit that people can't really understand me out of the context of NPD. I've run into this problem where when I tried to be honest, others assumed that my actual thoughts were just "intrusive thoughts about bad things" or they didn't really understand the scope of the core emptiness/complex dissociation. Others haven't understood my goals for development.They haven't understood the existential nature of my mental health problems since it's a personality disorder rather than an already-formed-person experiencing a disorder.I totally get it. They're just trying to empathise under the assumption that I am like them. But it would help if someone could be aware that I'm not and could try to meet me where I'm at.I could also continue what I'm doing and work on myself without a therapist which has been pretty successful so far.Thoughts?. For explaining my thought process to someone asking how to identify narcissists, literally telling her how to identify someone like me.This shows the real intentions of the mods in those subreddits.They just want a group they can channel all of their hatred onto and feel like victims. They don't care actual people get the help they need to move on in the world.
    I have the body of a scared child.When you look at me, you will see a woman with broad shoulders, tattoos, and a Universal Monsters shirt. At least eight people have told me that my appearance intimidated them when they first see me. Spikes, a mohawk, and a laughter so fierce that it penetrates the hours.I know what I present, and I know what I hide.My reactions, my mannerisms, my tics, the way my heart races when leaves rustle in the dark, the tightness of my muscles, my sleepless nights, my need to look like a creature that cannot be prey... all of this reflects a young woman that sprouted from a frightened girl.I am discovering that fear is easy to decode. Once you recognize that every thought you experience could be driven by fear, you confront each thought. You question its benefit. If anything you think or believe makes you weaker, you wrestle with it like Jacob and the angel. Even if your hip is broken in the fight, you still receive heaven's blessing in the end.Blessings aside, this hip of mine is beginning to splinter. The fatigue of self-awakening has a weight to it. And with each new epiphany, I find new fears to contend with."What if there is no cure, no remedy, no long term path to being whole? What if no fire in heaven can cleanse your soul enough?"I am coming to realize that there are things in me that not even medications can control. I don't know if I can ever stop courting death. I don't know if I can exist without my redundant layers of coping mechanisms.I hate how chronic this all feels. How incurable and overwhelming it all seems. What a shit fucking circumstance. All because some goddamn adults couldn't make a child feel safe.To shake and twitch and shutter constantly constantly, no matter how well I mask it all...I swear this is a form of madness.What damned fool madness it is that I shake more as I write.She who always wanted to be a writer but was too afraid to write. She who always wanted to live, but let her body decay. She who preaches of salvation must have faith in it, herself.Write, writer, write. You scribe your passion, your flame, your desire. Risk to find your voice or die in silence. Cowards die many times before their deaths; I refuse to savor the taste of death any longer.I refuse to succumb. I refuse to submit. I refuse anything that does not aid me as I fight to undo my calamity.I'm holding onto faith that those old time, Holy Ghost kinds of miracles ever really happened. I want to hear a burning bush cry the words of God. I want to feel the walls of Jericho fall, and let the crash and clamor of trumpets liberate me. Let me breathe the lungs of a dead soul brought back to life.Fear is that which keeps us pinioned.I will die fighting to be free.I’m currently sitting in a lobby at a mental health clinic, waiting for my name to be called.After my last post, the one with all of that fire, I broke.I got *so goddamn mad* at the fact that *I live with this shit* and that *I have always felt this way* that I decided to be really gentle with myself and get the help I need.These thoughts are mine, and that’s okay. I can accept that now. I can learn to be at peace with all of me.I don’t expect instant healing… but I’ve learned that I need actual help managing this. I’m tired of trying to control it. I reckon it’s a good thing I’m in this waiting room right now.And I want you to know that I wouldn’t have discovered this wealth of growth without this community. Good and bad, it’s all been revelatory.Thanks, y’all. 💜. I feel like I am on fire, but on the inside.The fire keeps growing. My brain keeps knocking itself against my skull, and the clanging and thrashing are overwhelming me. I feel like I am burning in my own fire and I am being seared alive on the inside.I feel like I've run out of words, yet I am compelled to write. Because when I write, it becomes real. And I become a little more real when I reread. But even when I have no words, they keep spewing out of me. I feel so numb and scalding right now, and I do not want to write, but I don't know what else to do. I don't know how else to save myself in this moment.I don't know how to make it stop. I cannot sleep. I cannot rest. I cannot cease.I figured someone else here might understand. If not, God help me.My head hurts right now. Hungover and feeling ill. I realized this morning that I somehow drank 1/3 of a handle of vodka without even realizing it. I just kept making lil' bitch drinks and pouring vodka into some fruity seltzer. Apparently I poured *way* more than I realized. I don't remember a lot of last night.As I had figured, I completely forgot that I wrote [this post](https://reddit.com/r/NPD/s/K4TeHISY2I) until I saw the notifications on my phone. I woke up around noon and have felt like Kentucky Fried Ass all day.I spent most of today just... reading and rereading that post. And reading and rereading the comments. I don't yet have the energy to respond to most of them. They were kind and sincere. They made me feel less alone. I don't have the words for gratitude yet. That feels exhausting right now.I spent most of today talking with one of my dearest friends. We spoke about literary theory, about her PhD thesis, about how hard our grad school experience was, about broken people that we know, about the man she's going to marry someday, and about Dolly Parton. I told her that I've been getting so angry lately and that I'm starting to scare myself. I'm having outbursts that I don't feel like I can control. She gave me resources and told me she was proud of me.I spoke with another dear friend about envy and rage. We both are artists who are struggling. We're both being given bread crumbs for overwhelming work. It's simultaneously our faults and also not. Nothing is easy when you come from brokenness and poverty. Every kind thing is a blessing.God fucking damn it my head hurts...I remember being a cunt to my boyfriend last night. I don't remember what I said, but I could tell by his reactions that I was out of control. I accused him of being drunk. He told me I was slurring. And I probably was. I think I yelled at him. He's picking up dinner for us now, and we're going to talk tonight. I can do nothing but repent and hold him... and gratefully eat the burgers and fries he's about to fix for us.I'm going to help him make dinner. I feel like there's an entire marching band ramming through my skull right now, but I refuse to take real love for granted. When I tell him how sorry I am, and just how much I love him, I hope I say all the right words...I just wish I could stop hurting people.I'm grateful this subreddit exists. I'm grateful for the people who are here. Sorry I called y'all literal shit *and* insinuated that you're predators last night. That was... uh... rude. I know it's not true. Or at least, that's not the full story. Humans are more complicated than that.The dog is barking, and he's pulling in the driveway now. Ground beef with a side of kindness will walk through the door.I hope this is what "getting better" looks like.Well I’m here. I drank too much, I apparently made an ass of myself after two weeks of being a Very Good Person (sans all my bullshit), and I’m here.Why am I here while drunk? Because you people prey on bullshit. On ✨emotion✨. On slaughterhouse soliloquies and tarnation.I’m glad I’m anonymous. I’m glad you don’t know who I am.I am grandiose and self-loathing. I’m better than you and I hate myself. You are a piece of shit and I am God.You want the gospel? You clasp onto people who leave a kettle boiling for death.I’m tired of being wholesome. I’m tired of being everybody’s goddamn therapist. I just want some peace. Why does everyone in my life need ME to give them comfort?I offer myself. I give them non-consensual comfort. They didn’t ask for it, nobody asked for it, but goddamn you to hell if you feel the way I do.Bullshit. Weakness. Alcohol is the simplest drug. Why pine and swaddle on the weakest possible drug?Go fuck yourself and then not be me. Fuck You and go be better than me. It’s not fucking hard.Go fucking drown in your secondhand embarrassment. I will quaff my own in the morning.I don’t give a fuck. Being “proper” is a goddamn prison. I hate the life one Must Lead to be the person they Ought. It fucking sours my mind.Just when I feel “recovered” and “whole”, I write 2AM posts on Reddit that I won’t remember tomorrow.All of this is an affliction.Cluster-B is apparently the dramatic cluster and I will swan dive onto the stage.This is too much? Fuck you. This is not enough? Fuck you even more.“Redemption” is a farce that I will vomit on every mass. “Salvation” is the gospel that I will preach to all damned.But myself? Myself? Let me rot in the bed in which I lie.There are no gods. Only humans and our proclivities.I won’t remember this in the morning.Good luck with your own bullshit.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Edit: there's now a [sequel](https://reddit.com/r/NPD/s/cAuYu0x5Qc).I just had the realization that the concept of being unconditionally loved is *wildly* uncomfortable to me. Deeply, horrifically, terrifyingly uncomfortable.I spoke with one of my only real friends today on the phone for a while. At one point, I told him that love is a struggle, a battle, and work. He said that love shouldn't be that, and that "love is behind me -- all I have to do is take a seat and rest in it."My friend is wise and wonderful. I *know* he isn't wrong... but I just finally recognized the massive "404 not found" sensation that appeared in my body just thinking about that.Someone... loving me... without condition? Without auditing me and my behaviors and every word I say? Even when I'm *not* acting cheeky and smart and useful?Now, I feel that I can love *other people* without condition. It takes a while, because I have to analyze them and ensure they're worth it... but I can and I do. I've made myself a doormat for so, so many people, and so rarely have I gotten that love back...My friend seemingly loves me unconditionally *now*... but I had to earn that, right? He wouldn't just love me if I hadn't played the role of Good Friend and Helpful Friend and Listening Friend... right?Doesn't everyone have to earn love? Is love really just a thing that people can just... fuckin' do *without* analyzing and tallying? Am I crazy or is that literally just not how humans work? Did my friend gently whisper some unreachable, utopian concept to me... or is he correct?Taking a seat and "resting" in love...I feel like a broken android, because it just doesn't compute. It doesn't make sense. It's not that I feel that I don't *deserve* unconditional love... or maybe I do feel that way... I don't know what I feel. It's all just static right now.I'm attempting to suppress a great deal of rage as I type this. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to handle a fucked up situation.I'm currently staying at my ex-but-not-ex-I-guess boyfriend's parents' house. About a month ago, my guy's father said some *really* fucked up shit to me. He and I were alone in the house, and he kept "joking" about things, saying that I should change clothes in front of him, and that I "should have hugged him with my shirt off". He watched me rummage through my open suitcase and kept asking to see my bras. At one point he referenced his erectile dysfunction and literally said, "I'm basically just like a girl! You can trust me!" while ogling me.It was fucking disgusting. And this isn't the first time he's said weird sexual shit to me -- this was just the boldest he has ever been. At that time, I was *wildly* uncomfortable and just awkwardly laughed and shuffled out of the house.I told my guy about it that night. He didn't handle the situation until two weeks later after I broke up with him and shamed him for not confronting his father (among other things). He then confronted his dad, and according to him, it was the first time he had ever seen his father actually look ashamed. I felt this would solve the problem, because shame tends to alter behavior. It didn't.Flash forward to a few days ago. My guy and I are "on again", and I had to engage his father in a conversation to find medical supplies. Before I could get to that, he "apologized" to me. I put that in quotations, because he didn't say he was sorry. What he said, in essence, was:"I need to apologize to you, but... you just... you look *so cute* and you become *so expressive* when I push you like that. And I guess I'll have to find another way to push your buttons to get that kind of reaction."The fucking look in his eyes, like I was some sort of toy or experiment, some object for him to push and bring him pleasure when I squirm, made me want to fucking vomit blood and shards of glass on him. Piece of shit... If it wasn't for the fact that a) he's my guy-thing's father, and b) the fact that this man is *fucking massive and stupidly strong* and I am a woman who realistically would never be able to match him, I would've punched him in the goddamn mouth. Instead, I just had to emotionlessly tell him that those interactions don't fly with me, internally shake it off, and get back to business.I used to feel shy and nervous around him before I became self-aware. Despite my feelings, I would still hug him and be kind because, well, he's sort of an in-law. But nowadays anytime I'm near him, I'm just filled with blind fucking rage (which, to be fair, is probably masking fear) and I keep a cold distance.Any tips on how to navigate this situation? Anything else I can be doing aside from just ignoring and distancing? Not engaging makes me feel powerless, and that feeling makes me want to fucking scream.Tl;dr: My lover's father has repeatedly sexually harassed me, openly told me he did it just to elicit discomfort because he thought my reactions were "cute", and now I want to throat-punch him but I shouldn't. What do?. I feel I am at the nexus of life and death, of Power and Decay.From my mountaintop I feel the sun caress me. The warmth tells me that I am where I am supposed to be.Yet I still feel the cataclysm below the rumbling quaking lavaborne spell of what is allegedly ... pardon me, "real"?I feel that I can see the frequency of every Soul beneath me (are they beneath me? the mountain is so high). I feel that we are all one and the same (or am I projecting again?). The unity, the common Origin, our Original Sin and Glory shine through the eyes of We the Afflicted, the spawn and prodigies of God. Witness the profound beauty of Mankind.And yet I do not belong (I do).My mountain quakes. I struggle to keep my footing. I enjoy the view so much. The altitude brings clarity, but the air is so much thinner here. Can my lungs adapt? Will my blood vessels burst? Would yours?Weakweakfrailbrittlebruisedunjustifiableretreatengardedonotbreakdonotbreakdon'tyoufuckingdarebreakThe cracks the damage the splintered stone soaked in the blood of my cosmic joke -- can it truly be ignored? No, no: to ignore is to repress. I should embrace it.But can I wrap my arms around it so tightly around it and around myself that we never fall apart again? do I trust myself to maintain myself? can I trust henceforth that I will never ever fracture again, and that the shards of me will not draw blood from those I love (love?) ever again?The prognosis is uncertain. The stones beneath my feet are real... I hope...The warmth the light the clarity from On High the cool breeze of awakening the song of the meadowlark -- I feel they all dance for me. Or do I project once again, this time from a different part of Myself?She is right and He is right and all of Me is right: I deserve nothing-everything, yet Their (My) logic may just be faulty. Reboot, recalibrate, reprocess. You, me, deserve this.Surely beauty is meant for all of us. (I cannot prove it is meant for me but it is for you) Such rich belonging is what keeps us all alive. (You surely deserve it -- I await my own final verdict)But I am so incredible that *of course it is also for me*.But if I flip the coin of Fate... if I leave it to mere chance and my nauseous predilection towards trusting any higher power to determine my worthiness once again... why, I just might fling my coin right down that Mountain. And I'll have to climb aaaaaaaallll the way down to fetch it, and dear ~~God~~ am I already so weary.I spit at the descent. I snarl at the belief that I could ever stoop so low again. To fight is better than to flee. I am the Coin, and I am Myself. (But am I not also the Mountain on which I stand?)How can one exist as a cacophony of imagery, of essences and fractals and call themselves a person? (You can. I can't. It's the law.)The rumbling and quaking and warmth and birdsong and breeze and beauty and blood and shrapnel and nerve endings full of electricity and the rush and the ascent and the plummet to Hell... I'd like to think it all makes sense.All I can do is vomit my Soul to strangers so I do not forget. And I will read and reread this to remember that I was alive. That I ever existed. I am my own chronicler, and damn the critics (unless they're right because I cannot be). I am ~~un~~certain of this.Damn you all to Hell. How dare you perceive me? How dare I split myself open for *YOU*? ... I truly hope you're doing well. I hope you think of me today. Or fucking don't, you bastard. I will think of you all But probably through the lens of myself Which is enough, right? (No, it's not) I bet you're cooler than you think you are I'm sorry if any of this makes sense to you. After talking with some of you, I'm now 99.4% certain that I've got the 'cism. I've also been reading posts on this subreddit, and I encountered the term "collapse" yesterday.That seems to describe what I'm experiencing right now. In retrospect, it's happened a few times in my life. The last time it felt *this* deep was when I was a teenager. Anytime it's happened since, I would just become stupidly obsessed with a fictional world and let myself be consumed in fantasy (last time was 24 after I left an abusive relationship -- all I would talk about for like a year was *Doctor Who*). In both scenarios, I had no idea what the hell was happening to me. In retrospect, it sounds like collapse.When I was a teen, I experienced periods of acute psychosis, felt emotionless (sans anger), had to force expressions of "normal" feelings, and had increased homicidal ideations. All that jazz. I learned over time to suppress a lot of these symptoms. I thought I had "fixed" myself.Now that I've discovered what this is, I keep feeling layers break around me. Two nights ago, for the first time in \~13 years, I "felt" a man outside watching me. I haven't started "seeing" eyes in the walls again, but I can somehow sense that they're coming.I'm... not really sure what to do about this. My inside world during my teenaged years were fucking frightening.I guess my questions are...* Is falling back into psychosis during collapse a common experience?* If you've experienced this, what was it like? What did you do?* Is it helpful to lean into this and try to manage it myself (can't access therapy currently), or should I just continue my pattern of repression until I can find a therapist?The mask I created helped me survive. Now that I finally know it was all fake... I really don't know what's left. This road has led me down a path before where I couldn't function. I am grateful for the knowledge I know now: there has definitely been a lot of good in me finally recognizing the 'cism. But I cannot go back to that paranoia, obsession, and psychosis I was once in.I will allow myself to *visit* that space in my psyche if it is helpful. But I sure as fuck can't stay there.Any tips? Any tricks? Any divine prophecies? I'll take just about anything at this point. The last thing I want to do is accidentally fuck myself and shatter entirely.Tl;dr: I'm collapsing, I'm starting to experience psychosis for the first time in \~13 years, and I'm not sure if it's healthy for me to lean into it and explore or if I need to shut that shit down and just repressrepressrepress. What do? 🤔. Note: I want to begin by clearly stating that I am not seeking a diagnosis from this forum. I am seeking resources, information, and possibly companionship because I am wondering if I *should* seek formal diagnosis. Diagnosis = a lot of money and time, so I want to have a solid understanding and determine if there is merit in my reactivity. I am now going to attempt to walk that tightrope between "do you think I have NPD??!" and "please just tell me if you relate". Please know I am aiming for the latter.With that, I am going to attempt to explain my thoughts/recent experiences as clearly as possible. If you have NPD and relate at all to what I'm saying, please tell me. If you have NPD and you *don't* relate, please tell me that, too. Anything helps right now.This is a whirlwind time for me, and this is about to be a long post, so hold onto your butts, pals. This is about to be a lot.\-----------------With that being said... I (\~29 F) just learned about the theory of Communal Narcissism last night.Specifically, my ex-boyfriend (who I've now broken up with six times) told me about this term. He wasn't even mad, or using it as an attack. I think he is honestly trying to help me.He told me that he has observed narcissistic traits in me throughout our entire four year relationship. Traits that made his skin crawl. Traits that deeply hurt him. They would also ebb and flow depending on how well I was doing in life. Pompous, humble. Unreachable, all-consuming. We lived on a pendulum... and while I blamed him every day for that and cursed him, I am now realizing that *I* was the pendulum this entire time.As much as I blamed him, I was the one vacillating for four years. For some periods I would be the "altruist", the "healer", the "priestess", the "savior", the Don Quixote tilting at the windmills of life. Other times I would be the "broken", the "clingy", the "damned", the "victim", the Quasimodo dwelling in the bell tower. Sometimes I could maintain being a strange nuance of both... but ideations and one-word labels do not a whole person make. It was usually black or white, night or day.Last night I asked him the most vulnerable questions of my entire life. I asked this man whom I have systematically destroyed, "What does it mean to be a person? What does it mean to know who you are?"What a tragedy it is to even ask these questions and mean them. What a tragedy it is to cling to someone I've hurt so deeply as a lifeline. What a tragedy it is that he loves me enough to want to help me, even after all of this. In this tragedy, I do not know who he is. All I know is that I have played my role as a blind Cassandra.I'm not saying he was or is perfect by any means. But I keep having realizations that knock the wind out of me. I am discovering that so much of his bitterness and snippiness were retaliations to how I treated him. He finally told me, four years later, now that I am finally listening, that he has felt so lonely in our relationship. That I made him feel broken and crazy. That I made him feel used and unseen and unloved.And I had *no idea that I had done that to him*.How could I ever do that to someone I loved (and do love) so deeply?How could I do that *for four years and not realize it*?He tried telling me these things before, though he didn't use my exact words (I'm not so idiotic as to call myself a "priestess" or "savior" *aloud*). I see now that every time he tried, I would become self-righteous and defensive. I would become cruel and vindictive. I would use his emotions and the vulnerable life experiences he trusted me with against him like a sword. How dare he imply that *I* have problems? When he has done x, y, *AND* z? How could he insinuate that *I* was less than the absolute Perfect Partner™ to him? How could he yada yada yada blah blah... Jesus Christ, how insufferable it must be to date someone like me...Breakups change things. Not getting the positions you "know" you deserve right after grad school changes things. Hitting rock bottom and having to live with your parents as an adult changes things. Not having my ego fed through others' affirmation, or even though my own successes (self affirmation), changes everything.I cannot be the "world-changer I was born to be" in a situation like this. It's maddening.I am learning self-compassion. I am learning to regulate these voices, which I thought were "demons" as a child, and I am learning to work with them. I cannot snap my fingers and fix my life to be the way I want it to be. I can, however, think about my past and figure out how I got here. That's what I've been doing for months, and that's what I'm doing right now.\-\*-After I looked up the general "symptoms" of Communal NPD last night, I cackled. I couldn't stop laughing. Not because it was funny, but because it was so tragic. How, how, *how* could I not know? How many times have I typed in "Is my boyfriend a narcissist" on Google, read the signs, recognized that was not him... and then not see these *exact same traits in myself?*How could I project all of this onto another person and not even realize that the call came from inside the house?I believe it's because the definition of "narcissist" that I have always known listed malice and intent as requisites. He was never malicious... and also doesn't fit these characteristics. I have never been (intentionally) malicious... but I *do* fit these characteristics.The layers of deception inside of me are a labyrinth. The walls have always kept me safe. And as I type all of this out, I see it clear as light. *I'm* the one who built this travesty brick by sordid brick. *I* built the labyrinth. I even played the part of my own minotaur, chasing and mauling any person who got too close to my center. All I have ever wanted is to feel safe.\-x-I went to grad school for theatre, and I went specifically to be a Shakespearean actor (go big or go home, right?). Through this years'-long process, however, I realized something... as much as I love the work, and love theatre, and love Shakespeare...*I am an actor who hates acting.*I have always seen myself as an actor in real life, even since I was a child. Always wearing a mask, trying to my best to communicate my inside world to the outside world. It... hasn't served me well. I am so frequently misunderstood, no matter how much I refine my approach. I pick up a phrase I hear people use that others' like and add it to my vocabulary. I adopt a gesture that I see is effective and repeat it until it's muscle memory. I try so hard to make people like me, because I am terrified that if I am my actual self, I will die unloved and alone.In retrospect, I think at some core level I felt that acting was "the only thing I could actually do". So I figured I should at least try to make a living off of it.The problem is... the pressure of performing is so stressful that it breaks me. I become physically ill for a week after every show. I am constantly watching every movement I make onstage as if I were watching myself through the audience's eyes (I do this constantly in everyday life, but it's magnified then). I once joked *to the director* after an audition I bombed that I would be a great actor if I could just, you know, actually be emotionally vulnerable onstage.Since I haven't reached any real level of vulnerability yet, what I do instead is obsess and obsess about micro-managing every tonal shift, every facial expression, every small gesture. I do this all while trying to remember where I'm supposed to move, the melodies of the songs I sing, and you know... fucking *Shakespeare.*I backed myself into such a strange, beautiful corner that helped me as much as it hurt me. I learned a lot through that experience... I just don't know if I'm cut out for a lifetime of it.I learned that I am an actor who hates acting. It is a stressful Hell. But I keep coming back to it, because deep down I long to be *seen*. Not just looked at, not just curiously observed, but *seen*. I've always felt unable to do that in real life, so I can at least try my best to do it onstage, as some other person, in some other time, saying some of the most beautiful words ever written.I'm only now realizing that I can write beautiful words, too... not *Shakespeare* good... but my own kind of good. That's partially what this post is. It is an attempt to describe what is inside me in such a way where I don't need someone else's words. I am trying desperately to self-actualize. It's just... it's *terrifying*.\-\*-I feel that so few people have ever actually seen me. I have always felt different, like I was observing the world inside of a prison. Trying to reach out, but having my hand slapped away and being yelled at or isolated when I tried. I could almost never do it "right".I am bewildered by the human experience. To be very honest, I really do not understand most people. I've learned to become better at socializing, and I try my very best to be pleasant and kind at all times. I've learned through repeated, painful lessons what consequences occur when I *don't* do that. But I am now learning that my forced "pleasantness", and the tools I use to try to relate to people, and the ways I react to people, end up hurting them. God, I hurt them so deeply...As a light example: I didn't realize that, when other people share something terrible that happened in their lives, that I appear selfish when I share a personal story and try to relate. If you tell me that your mom is in the hospital, I will tell you that my dad was in the hospital frequently when I was a child and share how deeply that hurt. I will tell you this so you know that you're not alone and that somebody understands. And I might get sidetracked and talk more about my experience as a way to explain what it feels like, because maybe you relate to what it feels like and will feel seen. And before I know it, I end up talking about myself way longer than I need to be. And I watch the other person's eyes for a cue of when I should stop... sometimes I don't pick up on them, and my friends and even strangers become bitter. I cannot tell when people are listening and appreciating my vulnerability, or when they actually want me to shut up and listen unless they are *very* explicit.I'm learning that I'm not the "world's best listener" that I thought I was...I had no idea I appeared selfish. I had no idea I made people feel unheard and unseen. I was truly trying to help. My internal ideations of perfection and brittleness, and how quickly they vacillate, are just maddening. I am only now able to find the words for it.\-\*-I've literally known about this concept for 12 hours, and I have already read so many people describe people like this -- people who I think are like me -- as being "monsters". I've already read at least 10 statements that people like *us* (?) have no souls. That we use people and dispose of them.And I... I see now that I *do* use people and dispose of them. And I swear to God I didn't realize that until 12 hours ago. These patterns, these cycles... I have always tried to be a benign and helpful person. But this constant valuing and devaluing of people, the constant analysis I run them and myself through as I swing between seeing myself as a saint and as a sinner, and then how they relate to me when I *am* a saint or a sinner... of course I have been volatile. Of course I have fallen into cycles of abuse. I cannot articulate my current shame or fear in any brief way.If you are reading this and you *don't* relate... please believe me when I say I never even realized it. If it turns out that this *is* undiagnosed NPD, then you wouldn't *believe* the nightmare that narcissists live in. It has only been through finally allowing myself to feel, imagine what other people feel like, and trying to share my own experiences, that I have realized what caused the fires all around me my whole life.*I* was the arsonist. *I*, someone who deep down has truly only wanted to help people... *I* was the reason why all my close friends left me. *I* was the reason why this man whom I love so deeply has been suffering for four years.I feel like my world is breaking around me.\-\*-I live with the worry that I will be misunderstood. It has happened so frequently. I am shaking as I type this, because I am so afraid that those same people who call others with these traits "soulless" and "monsters" will read this and say I was lying... say that I knew exactly what I was doing when I made my closest friend weep and go NC with me... say that when she did that, and when I spent *hours every day for months afterwards* trying to figure out what I did wrong, that I'm just saying this now for cheap sympathy (to this day I still don't know for sure what I did, and I refuse to reach out during this time of NC to ensure I don't hurt her more)... say that I intentionally sabotaged my relationship with someone I care so deeply about because I fed myself on his pain, when deep down all I have ever wanted was for him to heal and finally be happy... that I do not feel and therefore cannot mean every word I'm writing... that I am trying to burn the world...Even the fear of this happening makes me want to bury myself further in the earth. But I am too close to figuring this out to stop. I am too goddamn close to finally answering the unsolvable riddle of my life to let my systemic panic stop me. Please, for the love of God, don't kick me now that I'm finally trying to claw my way out.I have never tried to burn the world, but I did. I did, and I'm scared. And I'm scared, because I am the arsonist who didn't even know that she dropped the match. I never even knew that I was holding a match to begin with.\-\*-If you are someone diagnosed with NPD, please tell me if you relate to any of this. Please tell me if this sounds like anything you've ever heard of, even if it's not NPD. Psychiatric evaluations are so expensive, I have $400 to my name, and I honestly don't know what else to do right now. If my story is relatable, then I will move heaven and earth to seek that diagnosis and get the help I so desperately need. I am also happy to answer any respectfully-phrased questions from anyone, pwNPD or not. Right now, all I can hope to do is [write my way out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rVURq5isnY).If you made it this far, thank you so much for your time and consideration. It truly means the world right now.
    One of my throw away accounts. I’ve been recently diagnosed with covert npd. After years of poisoning relationships, wondering why I struggle to make and retain friends, and persistent dysthymia, I sought help from a psychologist. It took about six weeks of talking, denial, and filling out questionnaires. Turns out I’m not simply the sensitive, misunderstood introvert that I thought I was. I’m planning to continue therapy because I want to develop better ways to cope and move forward. Nobody knows, and I’m not planning on telling anyone. Anyone have any advice? Anything I should pay particular attention to? Anyone have any good tools to internalize my self esteem?.
    I guess it's sort of obvious that someone with narcissistic traits or full on disorder might not have a perfectly clear grasp of their skills. But I do feel like I used to accomplish a lot more in a lot less time. I could rely on myself in a way to fight my way out of any horrible situation. I'd shock and stun and dazzle people with the quality of my work even though I accomplished it last minute.Can't do it anymore. I suck at everything I do. I feel like I'm getting stupider. I hate that I'm not succeeding where I used to. And the worst part is I don't care much. I hate myself for being so ineffective but I also just...accept it. I'm on adderall now to help but the same issues are coming up and getting worse.I don't like being me very much.https://open.spotify.com/track/6JyUhML2CG3PCRMBceWNhZ?si=JTC0-ZutQ2KUhFv1crLk1Q. I have an "ex" with BPD that still talks to me. Part of the reason for that is because I was too afraid of what she'd do if I left her to her own problems. She tells me often about her life, very casually, very flippantly, about most of the bad shit that goes on. And even though I genuinely wish the best for her, it always feels like an instinctive reaction to hate and sneer whenever she talks about people she knows or relationships she gets into. Relationships I know she can't handle and with people that ultimately abuse her.She and I have very different beliefs and we argued often in the past. But she still tells me she wants me back in her life. Not necessarily in a relationship but just back. I wish I could believe that she really does want me back but what stops me is I don't trust her and I also think it's predatory of me to get close to her.I've had to cut off a lot of my attachment to her and mostly I'm glad about that. It protected both of us very well. But that gut reaction to her talking about other people she has in her life, people she talks to more, agrees with more, and trusts more just fucking confuses me. She insists on having me back in her life and I attribute almost all of that to her BPD.She says she actually likes who I am yet I could never talk to her about my own thoughts without being called a monster or just plain wrong.I don't know what the point of saying this is. I just hate how sensitive I am to things I thought I discarded.Something I always run into with my relationships or attempts at relationships is this cynical, self-doubting, aching need to hear the same reassurance from multiple sources. Because one person, no matter how much they care, can be wrong or delusional or just lying. It takes a hell of a lot for me to actually believe someone is being genuine with me.I almost always find myself looking for others to confirm what the person I actually care about said. Because if others agree, then maybe it's true, right?But I'm tired of doing this in secret. I'd rather be direct about it but obviously no one likes hearing that their words of affirmation and love and effort isn't enough to convince the person they adore. **Especially when they have BPD and their entire existence hinges on the fact that their words are enough to matter**.Just...what the fuck do you do with that? How do you explain that to someone without it destroying the relationship? How do you prevent it from just turning into an open relationship?. I feel that I didn’t suffer anything nearly bad enough to cause such a severe defense mechanism and changing of my entire outlook on life because my mother was a bit controlling, my parents argued, and she disciplined me physically. Paired with this idea of me being better and coddling me, I guess it makes sense.I feel almost jealous or robbed. Like I should have suffered more to end up this way.I've been fascinated by psychology since I was a kid and as I grew up it became more obvious that I wasn’t turning out like everyone else. But I never went to a therapist and had anything confirmed. I've been doing okay but my ADHD and depression has been worsening to the point I can't overcome it anymore through any methods I've tried. No fix seems to last longer than a few weeks or months and it's destroying my life.That led to me actually scheduling the first real session with a psychiatrist I've ever had in my life and while doing my intake form, I decided to be honest and admit I suspect I have covert/vulnerable narcissism or at the very least some traits of it. I don't believe I'm diagnosable but I share so many traits that I thought it should at least be mentioned.The biggest tell in recent memory being the death of my father where I felt very little at all. I felt like I had to perform for my family. I got over it quickly but I still grieve for him and miss him and I'm very sorry I couldn't be better or do better for him but the reaction in the moment is what really doesn't seem right. I also harshly judged my mother for crying over him when all they did was argue their entire lives.I know it's a common thing for NPD to be diagnosed out of attempts to solve another issue so me going in for ADHD worries me because I don't actually want the psychiatrist to focus on anything related to my narcissistic traits right now. I completely understand the idea of growing a therapeutic relationship with my psychiatrist but I view it purely in terms of a transaction right now. I want the medication to keep functioning as best I can because it is destroying me faster than any traits related to NPD. Overall, I think a lot of people would simply label me with NPD and call it a day. But when I've talked with diagnosed narcissists or heard about their experiences, I only feel like I can relate about 70-80%. But in other cases, it's dead on accurate and I genuinely have to pause and think about myself. I think the only reason I'm even posting here now is to have a kind of written record that I did reflect on myself seriously before a diagnosis. As if that does anything. She messaged me with that and attached a video probably for her tiktok or whatever about the man at work she's obssssed with and loves to faun over. About how a conversation they had where he made her so nervous.I didn't respond to the video at all or what she talked about. I just called out the "updating all the girlies" part. Jokingly said that makes sense because spotify thinks I'm a lesbian lol. It just hit me pretty bad. That's all.I had to withdraw from almost all my classes because of my depression and worsening ADHD symptoms. I've never gotten help for any of it. I had three months to fix myself. School starts again in August.I wasted all my time and I'm just getting worse.It's self-inflicted but I don't have any control over how much it influences my decisions. I keep getting worse and recently someone cut ties with me because they say I'm too risky, too negative, and they love me but I'm going to end up hurt or hurting someone else or in trouble somehow because of how bad my depression has become.I can't blame them. I really can't. But it's fucking miserable to know that I'm pulling everyone down around me and if I do ever open up, they take it as a sign that I'm a ticking time bomb.There's no compassion for me but it's never bothered me as much as it does now. It's not going to get better.I was invited out drinking by a new acquaintance. Thing is, obviously I suck at mingling. I'd rather drink at home. But I figure it's the only chance I have to practice some socializing.Problem with it is it's under weird circumstances. She isn't interested in me in any way beyond thinking I'm entertaining. I've fallen into the "free therapist" role again. She's even going to the bar because of the bartender she likes. She tells me a lot about the guys she likes.I'm not really interested in her, so I'm pretty much content with how things are. But I do feel sad I was just never in the running for her. Oh well. Anyway, she seems like the only gateway I have to meet anyone else though, so I'm going to give it a shot at being cool and sociable when I feel a bit less ugly sometime soon.So, I've sort of branched out and managed to have some success online. My physical love life and day to day is dead, but I guess we can't have everything, can we? But anyway, despite that success, something I've always worried about is pretty clear to me.I have a lot of trouble finding anyone that accepts and makes me feel that our relationship will last. People expect things from me that they take as givens because I should just know how to act by now. I'm criticized for being reserved, aloof, for not being more possessive, for being tired of constant social interaction, needing quiet time, for my bad habit of getting bored easily, for not agreeing with their world views.I was lucky I met someone more desperate than me, but then I'm the asshole for not feeling completely fulfilled with the situation. They cling to me but only out of their own problems, not for any real understanding of me or what I want from life. Beggars can't be choosers and I know I do need the company. But I also don't enjoy pretending for someone else that everything is perfect. That's going to lead to constant fuckups or me running away from commitments for the rest of my life. I can't even feel safe or satisfied when someone wants to be with me anymore. I always think that it has to end eventually. Somehow.What a future to look forward to.I'm at the fuxking limit now. I've endured too much over the past rwo years and I can't take it. I can't deal with this much going wrong. And now here I am at the fuxking end of my rope with no one to readh out to that can help. I just want tp sleep this all away. I want to forget. I want to wake up somewhere elseIm losing everyone that ever xared about me. Everyone i could hold close. I'm beinf left fuckinf bare qnd open to wveryrhing now. I don't feel right. I dont want this anymore. I want to stop getting these xalls from my mother. I dont want it. Im sick In fuxking sixk of it all. Tried to be social today. Forced myself into it after some messy personal shit. Too much at once. I went through a lot last week and then when I start to crack and actually need someone, I'm told "fuck you, why are you always like this." Heh alright...fair enough...But anyway, I figured "fuck it, do what everyone keeps saying to do. Move on with my life. Keep going." That I should just get out there and start mingling. H a h, okay, so let's see how that went.So I wasted money going to a ***non-alcoholic*** strip club with my buddy and a dude that he knows. They didn't warn me the fucking place was run by mormons or whatever. And the dude is significantly older than us. Handsome and well-built too. We both looked stupid even being around him.They got lap dances. I'm too poor. I couldn't even drink. The fucking idiocy of making a strip club not allow us to get liquored up is just baffling me...but whatever. We went to another bar and for the first time in my life, I wasn't allowed in because my ID isn't the standard. I never renewed it, so it's looked the same forever. And because of that, fucker told me he wouldn't take it.Gotta love it. My luck is amazing...truly.Thankfully, I brought my car. I drove over half an hour just to meet them both and I was sick of it. Went home. Drove like I was drunk even though all I needed was a fucking drink. I screamed. I screamed at everything on the way back home.And about an hour later, my friend tells me he was ditched because his guy met a girl and ran off. As if I needed that rubbed in as well.I haven't sleptI'm at the bottomI'm so tired. First, let's get it out of the way that I didnt really ever have a chance here. She's far away, but she's been a friend for a year now, and we were originally very close and we did an awful lot of flirting but after I sort of began my usual neglectful habits and constant doubt, I guess her attraction to me just fucking poofed out of existence. And I don't blame her...I should have left then, but I still get desperate and clingy. Not vocally clingy or outwardly, but I stick around and hope when I shouldn't.I had a very fucking rough two months, so I disappeared for maybe 3 weeks. She didn't reach out. I didn't even really want her to. But today, I cracked...went back to talk to her because I really did miss just talking to her. And after I apologized for disappearing, all I got was "I felt like messaging but eh". That broke me.She spent fucking months worrying about her ex who also lived far from her. She constantly had him on her mind, and it was tearing her up to think he no longer wanted her. And I was there when she was going through it. And I respected her feelings.Now, when I disappear, I'm hardly even an afterthought, heh... it's soul crushing. And I realized again what I fucking parasite I was becoming. Clinging to her, hoping she'd ever feel the same for me.So cheer me on, boys. I'm down yet another friend. Another opportunity I've fucking burned before I even realized it. It's almost funny to think about how consistently I can fucking ruin any hope at not being alone, ahh...Something that has become a thing is these long, rather depressing talks with my mother about the rest of the family, about me, about her, about my dog.One of the most crushing things is that my mother seems even more focused on my future and my relationship aspirations. She even went on a long tangent about being willing to discuss sexual advice with me. She keeps saying how she just doesn't want to die knowing I'm alone. She wants me to find someone and wants me to be cared for.And I just...I feel so annoyed. I don't feel reassured or touched. It's just kind of sad. I know she'll die before she sees me with someone. And that hurts me. I wish she wouldn't care about things like this, but hey, that's sort of her job.I've grown to dread these calls...Thanks for listening.**Buckle up. This is a long one, but if you'd like, you can skip where I use myself as reference and go directly to the valuable info I meant this post to be about.***Personal Context - Skippable*I've been pretty good at organizing my thoughts ever since I was young. I could sort of self-diagnose and work through my problems but it requires me to withdraw, stop empathizing, and avoid talking. That's made me the bane of therapists everywhere, since they dont know how else to deal with someone that knows themselves too well and heavily dislikes talking about it. I've done better since and I'm much more open now. I see it as less of a flaw I guess. But their solutions to my issues are always the same: blaming some suppressed trauma, forcing me to change my entire outlook, and medication.*Important*All that is just me setting up that Ive got issues but at least I know what they are. Now, the point I want to talk about in this kind of impromptu therapy session for all of us is to take a closer look at our current attachment styles to help other people understand themselves. This is not meant to be a critique of yourself or any sort of concrete understanding. It just helps with self-reflection and maybe brings a little peace knowing what could be wrong.Here are some charts for review. ***These are NOT horoscopes. Do not pigeon-hole yourself and blame everything on this one aspect of your personality and being. It's only a set of observations that might help illuminate the questions of "why the fuck do I do this?"***[Chart 1](https://i.imgur.com/J6U7uyV.jpg)[Chart 2](https://i.imgur.com/Q4YIRgq.jpg)[Chart 3 (Extended info. Recommend)](https://i.imgur.com/JvT0AuJ.jpg)Been thinking about this since a commenter mentioned it and while they did jump to conclusions about why I'm this way, I think it's a topic we should discuss. I don't think many people jnderstsnd this side of themselves and they live in a constant state of frustration and confusion. This doesn't solve that beyond reducing confusion. But it helps you find some sense of firm ground.*Skippable*I am typically of the avoidant/dismissive type. I run from emotional conflict and commitment. I don't trust easily but I especially dont trust people I'm attracted to. Im uncomfortable with relying and being relied on. I am often overwhelmed by intimacy and I lose interest quickly. I prefer cutting ties and solitude to the complexity of a relationship, yet I crave closeness and I want someone to miss me. I'm unfit to take care of them. My attention is focused on myself and my survival, but I also forget to take care of myself. I forget about their needs, and I can very quickly abandon them if I feel threatened. Now all of that puts me pretty firmly in the category of dismissive/avoidant, but as with most things, it's more complicated than that. No one category can completely encapsulate **you**. So for myself, I can slip into a fearful attachment where I desperately want intimacy but I hate myself for wanting something so painful. Depending on how well I'm doing, I can also become very secure and relationships seem like they're worth all the effortRecently I've decided to try another method and ignore my instinct to push people away and hide. That had...chaotic effects on me. It sent right into my fearful state but also into the place I experie ce least. I ended up having a preoccupied attachment to these people where my mind was overly fixated on what they would do or say about our relationship. I've rarely ever cared that much about something I had already considered a lost cause.That disorganization and chaos had me fucking reeling. I'm not usually in that position where I don't know what I'm thinking or why. But this made me temperamental, clingy, aggressive, wildly inconsistent, and just overall miserable.*Important*By taking a step back and having time to look at my behavior objectively, I could figure out where I was mentally. It's still messy and it's not a solution, but the idea that I know myself better now is extremely valuable to me. I have a bit of peace back. I calmed down. I'm not so lost anymore.Now the question is what do we do now that we know this about ourselves. Hell if I know, but there are methods you can try that are less harmful to yourself and less abrasive to your partner or friends. All based on knowing how your attachments are formed.I hope this helps someone and you are under no obligation to force yourself to change based on this info. It's strictly for your own personal understand of your fucked up head.Thanks for reading if you have. Take care.Today I've realized something about myself. It's probably something I already knew but today I noticed it distinctly. Like "wow, I really do this". I'm going to avoid turning this into a rant or ramble since that's not the point. I just want to reflect on this with you guys because there is no one else to tell.Recently someone that I was very close to has stopped talking to me. By that I mean that for the last few months, we've stopped doing things together and conversations don't feel how they used to. I feel like I've been worse than friendzoned, but obviously things are more complicated than that. I originally thought it was going somewhere because of how we talked about everything and began actually bonding more. But clearly that's fizzled out. I don't think I want to get into the details of it because it doesn't have much relevance to right now. I'll summarize by just saying that I've had to listen to her muse and sigh about how the guys she likes have never liked her back. She's very selective and the sort of guys she pursues tend to be dismissive even though she's undeniably gorgeous. Needless to say, despite her actually seeming to like me, I was never really a serious contender for her. Due to a lot of reasons.But today she messaged me after a week of silence. Made a small attempt at conversation by sending a little bit of art she made. I felt immediate, gut-wrenching anxiety. I think I would have preferred that she hadn't messaged at all. I tried to keep the conversation up by making comments and sending a scene from Smiling Friends, lel. But I quickly found myself just wanting to disappear. I cut the conversation by saying "check back next week and maybe I'll have more goodies". It was done out of bitterness and fear. Petty shit. But she didn't message back and I don't even want to look at my phone now.This all might seem insignificant, but add in the fact that I've brought 2 online relations to a halt within those few months as well. One even had the potential for me to actually meet up and attempt "romance". But I constantly had the same thoughts in my head that I'm simply not good enough for anyone in my current state. I can hardly take care of my dog, whom I love more than anything. Let's not even imagine if I had to care for a person that needs love, attention, and appreciation in a way that I just feel so inadequate to give. So, intentionally or not, I've burned an awful lot of bridges throughout my life and at this point I'm wondering why.Let me make something clear though. I don't actually intend on doing anything to fix this. The facts are that I'm right to avoid a relationship now. I'm in no place to actually delve into that mess with my life in the financial, emotional, and physical state it's in. I made all those decisions because I know that I'm categorically not the best choice for them. But I never realized how often and how internalized the instinct was until I practically panicked today at a fucking doodle.Anywho, I'm sorry for this wall of text. I didn't mean for it to go on this long. Thank you for reading if you have and if you'd like to talk about any other realizations you've made about yourself, I'll be around to listen.Take care.I've been getting worse and worse feelings about this particular topic recently. I've always wondered if I was lucky enough to meet anyone that wanted to be with me, I'd have to hope she also satisfies my major desires and kinks or I'm afraid I'd get bored and end up miserable anyway.Another thing is also the idea that I can't satisfy someone else. I'll admit to being dominant, but I'm hardly what a girl would imagine when she says she wants her "daddy dom" or whatever the fuck. I'm short, I'm not attractive, I'm not even that strong despite being built thick, I've an average sized dick, and I don't really have any of those impressive features women seem to like. Forearms, hands, calves, shoulders, abs, pecs, whatever. I'm either average or below at all of them. In terms of kinks, I couldn't be kinkier. But it's wasted because who the fuck is going to indulge me?So my thought is that...maybe I could have a shot at someone, someday. But I fear I won't measure up - literally - to what they want and need sexually. The same goes for myself, although I'm pretty much open to just about anyone that wants me, by now.Just wondering if there's anyone thinking the same right now. If not, just thinking aloud then.See ya, guys.I'm not doing so hot, guys. I was doing better for a second there and it just...floated away.On top of all that, the girl I thought was gone is back. I said one last goodbye and she said she felt bad about it. But she still doesn't talk to me much.I'm giving up.For a while at least. I don't know what else to do. Can't fix my life. Can't even begin to understand her or any other girl.See ya.I'm shivering. I'm shaking from the effort. I'm squeezing my eyes shut so hard my head hurts and the only thing I have left is my music.Three months. Three months without you. Another reminder I won't ever see you again.I wish i could cry for you but I can't.Why am I like this. The bible is still there, motherfuckers. [Hallelujah, lel](https://i.imgur.com/cTYF5zm.jpg) I didn't reallt expect it to still be [here.](https://i.imgur.com/bqZSdJc.jpg)Got stopped by some hobos but didn't get mugged so that's cool.Some more funny [grafitti](https://i.imgur.com/9XPNmfr.jpg). Really [speaks](https://i.imgur.com/VAv5PfU.jpg) to me.River has [dried](https://i.imgur.com/HXFASPT.jpg) up except in one spot.I caught a frog. His name shall be [Alonzo](https://i.imgur.com/N8O3Sob.jpg). All those pollywollypogs from last time have evolved. [Alonzo's ass.](https://i.imgur.com/09GIfUa.jpg)On way here, I found the prettiest spot [so far.](https://i.imgur.com/I4JKcVO.jpg) Still covered in shit like everything else.Almost sat on this log. Noticed the hole and gave it a kick. [Things got interesting](https://i.imgur.com/SaoJV1Q.jpg). [Very interesting](https://i.imgur.com/ZqcjpO0.jpg). [Very very interesting](https://i.imgur.com/42Cdc8I.jpg).And that concludes my adventure today. Still feel like shit but ya know, at least I touched grass.Update: Fell asleep by the water and didn't die peacefully. Shit.Update 2: More [frogge](https://i.imgur.com/KVEmtJ1.jpg).Waking up today feeling like shit. Can't even remember last night. Not a hangover, suprisingly, but just bad. Feel helpless. Fucking tired. So tired.I can't help but exude this fucking miserable energy. It's worse lately, obviously, but I feel like every time I talk to someone, they can just tell how broken I am.They say fake it til you make it but I can't fake it well enough. I was ghosted by a girl after we talked about some heavy shit. Apparently it was too much for her to handle and I get it.Another one told me "you need to get a girlfriend". Heh, don't I know that? As if it would fix me completely, right. Ghosted me too though. No one willing to take care of such a fuck up.I've been sitting here, trying to think of what to say. Mulling over a draft, just starting over every time I reach a dead end. My fingers hurt. My head hurts. My eyes burn.I wish I had the words to express this thing I am. I think a noise would be better. Like a broken cello groaning under water. Or a piece of glass being torn apart in some far away blending machine underground.I don't know what to say anymore. I don't know what I want to hear. Just want someone to talk to me and feel their voice vibrate over me.Without yelling. Without nagging. Without insult. Without a detached boredom. Without an uncomfortable tension.Talk to me.Always some great nuggets out there that really capture how you feel sometimes.[Yea](https://i.imgur.com/GcxBAIN.jpg). The girl I lost apparently broke up with her boyfriend. Not sure what happened. I couldn't ask. I want to but she specifically told everyone to stay away.I was terrified what would happen if she kept talking to him. He wasn't good for her, even if she was a little happy around him. I just wanted her happy and now I'm not sure if I got what I wanted.Better alone than in a toxic relationship, right? Right...I don't know.In a way, I'm glad he isn't in her life anymore. On the other hand, I ruined my chances with her and now she's alone. Probably the worst thing she could imagine is being alone and dying alone.I'm not sure what to do anymore...I'm really just lost here.I had another dream about her. I hate that I care this much, or that my subconscious thinks it's what I need. My brain is always so good at threading a story that feels real and textured and flawed like my waking life. I can't even cry anymore when I wake from it. Instead I have hope that maybe she's back. Then I'm crushed. I'm a cold paste now under a rock.I've almost never dreamed about real crushes or partners or whatever you want to call them. Might as well be speaking Greek. It's happened before during our twisted daliance but they've never lingered after.I'm cleaning out my dad's junk and I hear his voice. Conversations play out in my head. So perfect in pitch and volume. I want to turn around and see him smiling at me. Maybe it's schizophrenia, heh. Wouldn't that be funny? But no, I don't have any dopamine to begin with. Schizophrenia would be a gift.I lay in my bed and reach out to stroke the covers and the pillows. I could almost pretend it was someone. Eccept for the cold. No one would be that cold.I feel my phone vibrate or ring and hurry to blind myself with it and it's nothing. There is nothing. What did I expect?I sit staring at the monitor and replay events in my head like a projector. I imagine fantasies where the most exciting thing is to make a girl laugh. And even then it grips me, a slimy hand on my neck saying "no, no, no" in morse code. Tapping on my jugular.I'm not a ghost hunter.I talked to my sister and my mother. I don't really have anyone else anymore. Told them how I felt about dying alone. Told them I even talk to you dumbasses. (Didn't mention the sub name though)They were happy that I had an outlet. But they criticized the content. They just...cannot believe that we are how we are for no reason other than personal issues. They're both women so obviously they have a different perspective but yeah. Bizarre.They somehow think that we are wrong for wanting a partner because eventually someone will come along. And that if we are alone, it's because of some mistake we made.They put it nicely, but the point stands. We are wrong for wanting anything at all. We should just be happy and keep dating, keep searching, keep banging our heads against the wall because SOMEONE will accept us.Maybe there's a point in there somewhere. But i find it funny how they can overlook all our misery and just say "look at it differently, stop caring so much".Yeah, let me just flick that switch, sure.I just had a dream where the girl I pushed away and freaked out came back. It was so real. So unsatisfying in the way it would really feel too. It wasn't a fairy tale reunion. It wasn't some sex fantasy. Just she and I talking while she reminds me she has a boyfriend and I should keep control of myself.This all coming after a weird dream of playing detective with a group of people to track down a terrorist leader who was more of the radical western revolutionary type.Oh and there was a gorilla who had a heart attack.Fucking dreams, man.I left the house in the morning. Anout 5 hours out there just to wander along the river where I used to go with my dad. I didn't bring anything. Just found a stick and a ratty bible. I did not have an elightenment moment, no, it was just neat. I haven't read the bible in a long time. I didn't read far. I was too tired. Too unfocused. Made some other bad decisions along the way so, ya know, go ahead and ask if it makes you curious.But I did find some other cool stuff. Maybe it will cheer some of you up like it did for me. Funny graffiti. Animals. Not much but it's there if you want to see.[Enjoy.](https://imgur.com/a/j7KNo6s)Edit: those are supposed to be pollywollypogs in the water. I have a better pic. Better meaning, ever so slightly less shit.[Enjoy x2](https://imgur.com/a/MYGQhnI). Two months now since he's been gone. And a lifetime ahead of knowing he's never coming back. In a way, im alkost glad that my dad cant see me like this. He always nelieved in me. Said "you can build me a rocket ship to go to mars". I never deserved that much pride. I was allways goinf to be a disappointment but its really sinking in now just how empty of a life I'm headed intoMy dad must be fucking choking if he could see us. Both his kids talling apart. Everything he worked for jusy melting away because we were fucked from the start. We can't express how monumentally crushed we feel.I hope I see him again one day. I hope soon. Maybe he'll stkll love me thenLove you, dad. Miss you. I'm sorry I turned out this way.I fucked it. I took a gamble and I ruined it. I pushed, I fought, I thought I could show how much I cared and I failed.I don't know whether to see this as a trial or a lesson to learn for good. Maybe it was always better to just leave when you felt them growing distant...maybe it's better to just remain alone and never burden anyone with how hurtful my love is.She thinks I'm a creep. She completely stomped on my attempts to explain how I felt. How inexperienced I am. Maybe it's a good lesson to learn though. Don't ever chase them.I just feel like I'm in the deepest hole I've ever been. I have no one now. The one person I thought might still care thinks I'm a fucking freak...I just...wow...how it can go so wrong.I'm not really sure if this is the best place to try this, but I mean, where else can I expect my faults and limitations to be understood?Anyway, into the meat of today. Online relationship crumbling apart.There's an unending torrent of shit going wrong right now for me. Two months of rock bottom. Worst I've felt in a long time, if ever. And I'm panicking. I'm afraid.Needless to say, I'm desperate. And while all this is going on, I've been losing one of the few people I knew cared about me.**Here's the puzzle:** She will not talk to me but she reads all my messages and saves them on snapchat. (Ew, snapchat, yes, sue me). Before that, she would leave me unopened for days. **Before that**, it was constant messaging every day. Never saved my messages before unless it was important. She says the reason for distancing herself is because I didn't want her.What do.I don't really understand it. I'm wondering if maybe it's a sign she still wants me in her life. That or some of kind of threat? Like "oooh look all your desperate messages are here and I can show them off". Mind you, okay, that's a big jump but fuck...what if?I'll let you guys know more if we get to it but yeah...I'm stumped and I want to give up and run. But I've always done that. I'm a pro at killing relationships.Help me.Thanks for reading.I've been getting help finding and researching cars from my uncle. We get along usually but we have vastly different perspectives on certain things.I told him about my plans for the future, plans that primarily focus on self-improvement and following my career path and whatever dreams I've got, and he responded with,"Well, you've always been an egoist and selfish. So I believe it will probably work out for you! To hell with everyone else though, right?"Humanitarians...As I'm sort of scrambling to find people that give a shit about me, I've been reminded why I don't have anyone. Two friends gone in the last two weeks. For insensitivity and neglect. One of which actually claimed to love me at one point.Losing another person I care about just this morning. I knew they were seeing someone but I didn't know they've been dating for 5 months while I've been meekly trying to woo them. I didn't notice them slowly drifting away until I began needing them these past two months. And for the record, their partner is honestly terrible, but they claim to love each other so...what to do?I'm hanging on by a thread.It's fucking pathetic. And apparently I had no idea anything was wrong until recently that I was gutpunched into needing some affection.I know what you're thinking but I'm not a leech that ignores my friends. It's just I thought everything was fine. And it was not fine. Far fucking from it.So here we go again. Except this time I plan to be persistent. Try to fix things for once instead of running away. I dunno. I'm out of alternatives.Thanks for reading.I've had a rough fucking year. If you've seen my posts, you get it. So out of fear of dying alone and losing loved ones, I've decided to try Tinder and that garbage again. I don't really know where else to turn to find someone other than that or online chat.Last time I tried was a rough fucking 8 months of bullshit and stress. Then I made a meme account after a long break and got far more matches on that. When they would see me, that was the end of it though.So despite that, I'm trying again with a new meme account. Less trolling. I put in a bit of effort at least but I kept the face pics out. It's for the best.I'm moving to a new city too, so I'm taking advantage of that passport optionWish me lucky, boys...Everytime someone shows care and affection towards me, on those rare occasions when I'm lucky enough to get it, I revert to this vicious criticism of them. I wonder, "why are they being nice? Are they pitying me? Are they stupid? There must be something wrong with them."At this point, affection feels like an attack. Like someone getting too handsy on a first date. I panic and run or ruin things.Gah...what the fuck is wrong with me?. I tend to pride myself of being able to drop someone like a loose shit, but I'm weak. I know it. It's been a bad start to the year. I'm losing the few people that care about me and I scrambled like a scared animal to cling to those that remain.I hate it. I hate needing someone. I hate being so reliant on others for my happiness, even if it's just temporary.Someone I thought I could count on has withdrawn. Whether that's my fault or not I've got no clue. But the fact that I want to scream and yell and blame them for not being with me sickens me.Since I don't have anyone else to explain this to, I'm sorry you all have to bear it. But I just hoped someone understood. I mean, I know you do. But I guess I just wanted someone to state the obvious so I don't feel so sick of myself.Thanks for reading.I lost my father yesterday.He would ask me sometimes what girls I liked. He would tell me to choose well and avoid the mistakes he made.He's gone now. And part of me is glad he wont have to see his line end with me.Fuck this lifeFuck it. Had my first accident today. Not sure how I'm supposed to feel. I feel annoyed I guess. I'm gonna have to face them in court.What a day.
    Empathy does not come easy to me, or really anyone on this thread. I'm trying to be mindful of this and trying to "force" empathy out of myself. Does anyone have tips on how to do this? How do we make ourselves treat others with sensitivity and empathy even if it doesn't come naturally? Being mindful 24/7 is difficult but I need to try.. that's the post \^. I was diagnosed with **borderline personality disorder** a while back and I fit all 9 components of the diagnostic criteria, which totally made sense to me. I was motivated to work on it and have worked in DBT for some time. I feel when it comes to borderline a lot of my behavior has improved.Though through self-reflection and work with my therapist she has suggested I may also have occurring **NPD**. And the idea of it has extremely upset me because I'm worried I am actually a bad person deep down, and feeling that was is a cornerstone trait of **BPD.**Through talk, I've understood my obsessive fantasies with beauty, power, perfection and domination (particularly for people I felt have harmed me). I used to and often do put in my headphones and pace, sitting in these fantasies for sometimes hours and it makes me feel good. I have learned that I am unconsciously manipulative, to extreme levels. I find I can get what I want from people and situations - it's like life is a game. I consider myself empathetic and I do feel bad for people in bad situations, but when directly faced with something I feel nothing. I also have a superiority complex but it's something I'm trying to break from -- I can say that I don't want to have a superiority complex but it doesn't change how I feel internally.There is a long history of child abuse that predates this behavior.I don't know if there's a spectrum for this, or if it's either or.I'm starting to second guess everything, and how much of everything I do is a vanity project. Is this a vanity project? I like telling people about my mental health problems because it makes me feel special and I like to be seen as vulnerable. I've grown to realize how intentional everything I do is. Is this post just another example of this? Probably.At the same time, I know I'm not all bad. I love my friends and family. I would quite literally put my life on the line for my brother, and stick out my neck for the people in my life all the time. So maybe I'm not all bad? idk. &#x200B;. My friend living near campus in an off-campus apartment had a serious mental health crisis a couple months ago, which led to a meltdown, that of which was heard by neighbors. He was incredibly embarrassed after the incident.Ever since, a group of asshole students nearby have been harassing him and making jokes outside his apartment, literally mocking word-for-word some of the negative self-talk things he said to himself. It has made him feel extremely sad and uncomfortable in his own living space and it has continued on a regular basis -> this extremely unkind behavior has made him feel worse. They even posted about it making fun of him on social media and he saw the post!I thought we at this school were kinder people than this. It was obvious it was due to a mental health issue and it's awful that fellow students are mocking him regularly. Please be kinder to your fellow students, and if you happen to be engaging in this conduct to my friend or to anyone else, cut it out and GROW UP.Be better.. Hi all -- took my first injection about 30 minutes ago.Very quickly after the injection, my right foot began to feel cold (my left too but noticeably less though). It feels slightly tingly and I can kind of feel a little bit of the cold all the way up my leg.I assume this is from the B12 compound. Did anyone experience this? Anything I should lookout for? Thanks all.. Hi everyone --My shipment was supposed to be overnighted but bad weather forced the package to be delayed a day. It arrived warm -- I live in a place where the temperature hit 120 degrees a couple days ago.Will the vial be effective? I'm curious if anyone else received it warm and still reaped the benefits of the medication? It's expensive and I want to know if I should just get my money back and scrap this whole thing. Thanks.. Hello reddit! I'm 23 years old and I consider myself healthy -- I exercise and try to eat healthy, and get good sleep. Not perfect, but not all too bad.I graduated college in december and I was a wild partier. I would drink almost every weekend to excess, but it never interfered with school/work and I did very very well and it's paid off. After graduation I have seriously cut back on drinking, with near month breaks between drinking.However, about two weeks ago I went back and visited my college friends and went on an absolute bender for several days. I came back home and didn't drink for a week, and then my friend visited and we went out. I had 4 drinks that night. I woke up the next day exhausted, but not particularly hungover. **However, I had horrible pins-and-needles in my hands.**It drove me insane and lasted all day. I freaked out and did research and have been loading up on B vitamins. The pins and needles have gone away and so has the pain... but my hands don't feel right and there's slightly decreased sensitivity on the back of my left hand.Does this sound like alcoholic neuropathy? Is this irreversible? Will this require major lifestyle changes?? I'm very nervous and confused. I'm not a full blown alcoholic so I don't understand how this happened. Any advice would be helpful. Much love to all.**23 M, 5"8, 180lbs, white**Hey reddit doctors, I'm a generally healthy 23 year old man. I exercise daily and try to eat mostly balanced meals. I graduated college last December, and while in college I had a history of regular binge drinking at parties. Since then, I have seriously cut back on drinking. Last week however, I visited friends and drank a lot over a week period. I came back home, and yesterday I went out with a former friend -- **last night I had 4 drinks.** This morning I did not wake up with a hangover, but my muscles were sore (I was a little dehydrated and tired). Now, I have pins and needles in my hands and they are a little numb. It's quite uncomfortable overall. It isn't wearing off and I don't know if this has happened to me before. I've seen things about alcoholic-neurapothy and it's scaring me. Is that likely what this is? Is it a vitamin deficiency? Is there any steps I can take? I'm abstaining from all substances in the meantime. *(I occasionally use rec. drugs in social situations and used to smoke, I currently* ***do not smoke).****(I am on lamictal for BPD, wixella for asthma, and Truvada for PrEP).*. Hi -- situation is as described above.I'm frankly a bit surprised and intimidated about meeting with the US Director for the company.. But the fact that I'll also be meeting with the Head of HR for the company at the same time is interesting.Do you think this will change the dynamic of the interview? I'm curious if this may include a discussion of salary expectations as well. Any input would be highly appreciated!. 8 days ago I received an email from the last person I interviewed with saying: "I have recommended that we take the next steps with you -- let me reach out to our HR person."I sent a followup email on Monday and have not heard back from him. I did hear back from the recruiter yesterday (I CC'd her in the email) and she said "Thank you for your follow-up. We are still in the hiring process. We will let you know when a decision is made. Thank you for your patience."This firm has been relatively slow in its process and I know the first email seems like a good sign --- the radio silence from them does not. I'm curious for some insight from fellow redditors to read the vibe of the situation.My interviews went really well and both assured me they wanted to continue in the process. But I'm wary of ghosting -- I already had a company do it AFTER I received an offer of employment. Any input would be appreciated!. Hello Reddit!I'm here for a little bit of honest perspective. I'm probably overthinking this, but of course this is a nerve wracking time for me.I had two very successful job interviews, one two weeks ago and one last Wednesday (9 days ago). Early this week I was informed I would be speaking to HR soon about next steps but there's been no response since.I'm curious if anyone has any idea how long these things take and when I should be alarmed about the lack of response. The company is reputable (but I'm nervous because I already had a company completely ghost me after they said they were taking me to the final interview stage). Any guidance would be appreciated -- so would any suggestions about bumping. How long would it be appropriate to be politely like hey, HR hasn't reached out to me yet what's up :) (in a professional tone). Thanks for any and all guidance.I feel endlessly empty. Like a carcass. Nothing brings me joy. I don't like myself and can't move toward my goals. I can't eat better or lose a little weight even though I want to, I can't force myself to get out of the house and do anything besides live empty behind a screen. I can't do anything but criticize myself and think about all the mistakes I've made in the past: sabotaging relationships, making wrong turns, and not appreciating how good things were.I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and it certainly fits. I am endlessly empty and unhopeful for the future.I feel it, and the routine is already starting.Drag myself out of bed, force half a protein bar down my throat, and quickly shower. Go to work exhausted like a zombie, wanting nothing more than to be somewhere else. I Slog through work, all day, behind my desk. Commute home, tired, and super hungry, because I didn't eat lunch -- but I'm too tired and sluggish to cook a proper dinner, so I eat a microwaved potpie or hot pocket. Sit down, and watch adult cartoons for a while. Take my antidepressant, lay down, and stare at the ceiling for a few hours until I fall asleep.It's every single day. And on the weekends, all I do is sleep and stay inside. There are so many hobbies I wanted to engage in, places I wanted to go, and things I wanted to do. Dates I wanted to go on. All I do is go to work and watch TV, and my cup is too full, and I'm too tired to do anything else.It feels endless. I can't see through the fog. And I certainly cannot continue on this way for the rest of my life. Does anyone ever wish they could get an inheritance that paid out enough money so they could shut out the world? Stay inside and quiet and alone? Make everything feel small? I would do that if I had the money.My anxiety has ruled my life for too long with this affliction -- and eventually, I got it really well under control. The maximum dosage of Lamictal and gabapentin has given me my life back (don't downplay the wonders of modern medication), but all I thought about was HPPD...I have decided to reconnect with my hobbies; yes, I work out as the sub says to, but I also have been finding relief in reconnecting with creative outlets.I've started writing my next novel and have already surpassed 200 pages over the course of a couple of days.And I've started going on long hikes again and taking camping trips with loved ones. Doing things that used to make me happy -- and suddenly, I forgot about my symptoms; they fell into the background, and their severity quickly subsided. Writing, for me, is the most therapeutic creative exercise in the world. Consider looking for a creative outlet and dive into it!Don't downplay the wonderful alleviation of reducing your anxiety, and know what being happy can do for your symptoms. Days pass, and I don't even think about it anymore.Do what you love, find healthy hobbies, and spark joy :) good luck to you all.I'm currently on lamictal, prozac, and gabapentin.it feels like a big combo and a lot of medicine.. do any of you have experience with this combo? It's making me feel a lot better, but I'm wondering if it's too much.I got mild HPPD very recently and was lucky to already be on 200mg of Lamictal (lamotrigine) for borderline personality disorder.I have titrated the dose from 200 to 250, and I plan to keep going up past 300. My psychiatrist said I could go all the way to 400 if I keep tolerating it well, and it continues to helps me.. I have already made significant progress, and my doctors have emphasized it is safe and well-tolerated.If you can, give it a chance!! It does take a bit to titrate up, but it's really working well for me, and I'm much less anxious. Good luck all**Some negative stories below -- it is true, it doesn't always work for some. Always talk to your doctor.**. Hey everyone. I started having mild HPPD a week ago, only VSS and maybe slightly brighter colors? Not sure, but things look a little sharper. I just have extremely bad anxiety. Think I got it from MDMA two weeks ago.I have already been on Lamitrogine for months to treat mood swings due to borderline personality disorder. I spoke with my Primary Care doctor, who knew about HPPD, and he prescribed me Clonazepamm for anxiety and symptom reduction. He only gave me ten days' worth and suggested I break it up after a few days and use it as needed.Do you think this will be effective? I will be abstaining from drugs for while. I do not have addiction issues and have never been on benzos before.Should this be effective? I just want to get my stress under control, I can handle mild visuals. Please let me know if this has been effective for any of you or if you have any suggestions.Thanks! :). \^ just like the title, need serious help. Hey everyone, I have been a casual every-once-in-a-while drug user for a few years.I enjoy MDMA and have done it in rare increments, usually with at least six months between use and at one time, a full year. Simply put, I do not do it often.However, last weekend I decided to roll and did roughly 1.5 points (last time, I did 3 with no problem), then the next morning, I woke up with TERRIBLE snowy / blurry vision. It quickly subsided, and I went about the next few days with no problem.Then two days ago, I noticed visuals slightly coming back. There is an extremely mild and minimal static overlaying everything I see. If I'm busy or engrossed in something I don't notice it at all. Some bright pastel colors are distracting to me because I notice the visual disturbances more.These feelings have invoked a SERIOUS anxiety problem for me, to the point where I'm "not feeling like myself," and my emotions are running wild. I have been jumping from euphoric and "fuck it, it's temporary and will get better!" to suicidal and "I've ruined my life and want to die" within the span of ten minutes.I've discussed this with my primary care doctor, who actually knew about HPPD, and he has referred me to a psychiatrist, a neurologist, and an optometrician. I want to know if such mild symptoms will subside eventually in the short to medium term. I hope that when I get on anxiety medication, my moods will stabilize and it will be less emotionally debilitating (as it is, I can read, drive, do anything, etc.). I am also on Lamotrigine for Borderline Personality Disorder -- which I heard can be beneficial as well.Deepdives online (particularly on Reddit) have brought me extreme anxiety and have driven me to panic. Is this valid? Will it subside, and will I be okay? Or am I totally fucked? Thanks for any advice, sorry for the long post.Hello, I've been diagnosed previously with unspecified bipolar, with quick cycling.I've been on Lamictal for a long time, and it's worked great past three months...But now? My mood cycling is \*extreme\* and it is \*fast\*Today, I went from extreme depression and suicidal thought to 30 minutes later:extreme euphoria, pacing and running around the room, grand fantasies.After the euphoria lasted for 30 minutes, I fell into a depressive state and was feeling panicky. I am not on drugs.This extremely rapid cycling in 30-minute intervals is starting to get ridiculously unbearable, and it's preventing me from functioning. Any ideas on this? It's accompanied sometimes by a feeling of bodily detachment, which I really, really hate. Any help would be wonderful; thank you.I posted a lil rant about entitled students and now people jumping in my DMs about how I'm a piece of shit this is crazy LMAO I am afraid of you all. The entitlement of so many students at this school is driving me up the wall. People complaining about getting a B and feeling entitled to getting an A because they "worked hard." People bitching and moaning about everything on campus from the food to the seats in lecture halls to the fact that they can hear their neighbors to being challenged in any way and every other constantly negative things people say about berkeley everyday. People flaunting their wealth, complaining about the existence of homeless people, putting people in less technical majors down, and also smearing and talking shit on transfer students!it really feels like a ton of people at this school are super ungrateful for the opportunity of a lifetime that is to attend this school. It is so frustrating, and I wish that more students would show some humility, gratitude, and stop shoving their privilege in everyone's face.**UPDATE:** *shocked by the significant negative response to this post. Particularly considering my discussion of wealth flaunting and elitism against transfer students. we got some work to do!***UPDATED UPDATE:** *I am going to throw a pie at anyone complaining about getting a B from here on out. wear goggles!****to the people talking shit about transfers in the comments, you suck***&#x200B;&#x200B;. All I do when I'm depressed is drink. I wake up, start working from home, and chug five beers with breakfast. mid-afternoon, I do it again, and at night when I'm sober, I do it again if I still feel suicidal. I don't do it every day but each day I wake up feeling depressed, I do this. Over and over again.No words just upset.where should I look for housing just for the fall semester? I graduate in December so I don't want to sign a year-long lease and my current housing plans just fell through. Any help on where to find subletters?. had the hottest three way of my life last night, as the title would suggest. I'm a young, stocky fit top. 20 years old, but hairy chest, big pecs, thick legs, dirty blonde hair brown beard and a long cut cock. Dom and passionateMet another SUPER hot and clean cut fit guy a couple of years older than me. Latino guy, thick LONG dick. Sexy black beard. Very passionate.Bottom was an older, 50 year old guy. Loved to be submissive to the both of us. Me and the other top fucked the bottom so hard for about thirty minutes. Super passionate. Shot deep loads up his ass. did all kinds of positions, sucked each others cocks, made out, and man handled one another.Loved bro-ing out with that other top and giving it to the bottom hard. Can't wait to do it again soon. Would love to talk about it more lol. There's been a lot of skepticism on this prospect but the vaccine distribution is well underway before even the beginning of the new year. I've read many encouraging articles and statements from epidemiologists who believe things could round a corner this summer... particularly Fauci's comments about CSU likely being able to offer courses in-person beginning fall 2021. What good news has anyone else found on this topic?.
    In the model underpinning schema therapy, there is a mode called the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode. I've read about it a few times, and I just noticed it come up today in myself, I think. I wanted to document it here, so maybe I can become more quickly alert to it in future - because like other maladaptive modes, I feel it really inhibits me, or can do at least.From my recollection the Paranoid Overcontroller Mode is a coping mode in the model. That means there is some underlying vulnerability or distress or unmet need, and this mode is a state of mind and body that we can flip into as a way of reacting or managing what's underneath.I think when I'm in my Paranoid Overcontroller Mode, I become overly fixated and suspicious of other people, maybe particularly one person or two for whatever reason. I suppose there's something about them that I'm fearful of underneath, or something about them that reminds me of someone or some situation in the past the caused me harm. My thoughts turn to and obsess over all the things dry don't like about this person. There is a sense of mistrust. I don't like to look them in the eye, I want to keep away from them, there is a feeling that they are keeping something from me, that they are somehow corrupt, wrong, dangerous, hiding something, manipulative, not truthful, not honest, in authentic. I can even imagine them turning other people against me, thinking negatively about me and talking negatively about me, criticising me with others. That's paranoia. I watch their movements and behaviours, and listen to what they have to say, and my mind is heavily skewed to picking up the evidence to support this from whatever they're saying or doing. It's a form of rumination....The problem is that when I'm in this mode, I don't see the whole person - just the negative aspects that maybe I want to see. I kind of don't want to see the positives. I'm devaluing them. I'm not being empathic, understanding or compassionate. I lose connection to that person. But more than that. I disconnected from the world and other people. I am lost in my own thoughts - just spinning around. I'm cut off from reality, viewing the world through a distorted lens where people are either for me or against me, and I'm collecting the evidence.Gosh! Now I'm reflecting on it, I can see that this mode is somewhat present quite a lot of the time. It's just that today I noticed that was particularly strong, and directed towards one person who I've been with over the last few days. Another man. I guess from the outside looking in at me, people might sense that I am cut off, self absorbed, and that my thoughts are negative and suspicious even. And I wonder if it's on my face. I'm pretty sure it must be, to a degree. Obviously I can't tell that for sure. But there is a chance at least that they pick up on my negative mood, and so might not want to interact or connect with me. I kind of feel that.So I'm really losing out when this mode is strong. I'm not a happy person that I want to be, and people might be more distant from me. It's actually sad. Suddenly I have some compassion for myself coming up. I feel sad for the situation....Where did this come from?A memory of my father immediately pops up in my mind. He's scowling, frowning. His face is distorted. I can tell that he is suspicious of others, he's really paranoid in that moment.Gosh! I guess I picked that up from him! He was suspicious have lots of people when I was a child, and even today he is quite mistrustful of people, although he has mellowed in his older age. But back then he was paranoid about my Mum, her friends, people he worked with, even me and my sister. ...There is a memory, a very strong one, when I was a teenager. It was bedtime. My dad was already upstairs in the spare room. Him and Mum weren't sleeping in the same room by then. Mistrust. Hatred. Fear. Between them. I was in my room. My mum came upstairs. Before she went into the main bedroom, she went to the spare room when my dad was "sleeping" - because he wasn't, as it turned out - and locked the door from the outside. I think I asked her not to do it, but there was something like revenge going on for something he had done earlier in the day. She was less than 3m away from the lock door when my dad jumped up and started banging ferociously on it. He was banging so hard that he started to punch a hole. My mum ran downstairs and told me to come with her. I was on the landing by now. The hole appeared in the door. Splinters of wood were flying over the landing. I could see his fist. His hand was bloody. I could see has distorted face. He asked me to unlock the door. He said I should call the police. I was something like 13 or 14. I didn't want to do that. I was scared of him. But I did unlock the door with the key that was maybe on the floor or something. As soon as it opened I stood back. He ran out and I pretended to faint. I just didn't want to interact with him. So I pretended. He ran downstairs saying that he was going to call the police. I then snapped out of my "faint", and ran behind him shouting "No! Don't!" I remember stopping him when he was at the phone. My mum was outside, she called to me to say come next door - to the neighbours. And I did. I ran out.Later on, in our neighbours' living room, late at night, totally embarrassed, scared, lonely - I was on the sofa, my mum and the wife of the couple next door were with me. My dad was allowed into the house by the husband. Dad came into the room, telling all of us that my mum had locked the door and was planning to burn down the house and kill him.That really wasn't true. But he was totally paranoid. Our neighbours tried to calm him down. Eventually he left and went back to our home. My mum and I slept at our neighbours house that night. I was in my school uniform.I can feel my younger self, shocked, scared, distressed, frustrated, lonely, worried, angry, sad, deflated, embarrassed, guilty, numb.I'm sad for him now. Right now.I feel for him....What I like about the schema approach is that it's not just about countering or challenging the negative or inhibiting thoughts and actions in the here and now. It's not saying simply, "Don't do that! Stop thinking like that! Think positively!" It's about understanding where coping styles come from, trying to swim down to the bottom of the ocean, and connect with the lost, wounded child underneath - the child who was neglected and traumatised. It's about having an understanding the how the wounds of the past relate to the present, and showing - or learning to show - care for those wounds and vulnerabilities.So, to myself today I say, I know I didn't like my dad as a child or teenager. I was often very scared of him. I wanted to be nothing like him. But somehow, and I inherited his negative thinking patterns and behaviours. There is shame around that.But it's not my fault that I have this tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. On one level I inherited it from my dad. Not purely. My mum also has a tendency towards suspicion and paranoia. But for the moment I'm thinking about that memory with my dad, I'm thinking about how his paranoia Took over and lead to violent reaction that stayed strong in my memory for many decades. When I feel that paranoia, when I recognise that suspicious mode, it doesn't make me a bad person. There is a good reason why this habit of mind has come about. Patterns of mind that I inherited from my parents.I really forgive myself. I do.I genuinely feel lighter in my body. I feel lighter in my mind, I feel like I can let go of the paranoid thoughts about the man I'm with at the moment in our group. ...But ... It's interesting because I can now see how my mind is associating the person I am paranoid about with my father. My mind is relating this man today with my dad and how he treated me and my mum in the past. Ah! I see. I see.Fear of my father. Paranoia about his behaviours. Scared of his threats.Spotting similar signals in people today, and feeling threatened. Paranoia.It's understandable. Feeling on edge around certain people because of how my mind associate them with people who threatened me in the past. Again, it's not my fault. But I feel able to let this go. So it's not just about inheritance of certain patterns. It's to do with how I related to my parents as well. I think those two factors are behind my own paranoid thinking today....I want to connect. I want more lightness and freedom in my body and mind. I don't want to be trapped in this paranoid mode that keeps me separate from everyone else.I hope I remember about how things in the past that I had no control over brought about these inhibiting patterns of mind. I hope that I can keep that memory so I can forgive myself again and again, and in so doing let go, and find more freedom and happiness and connection....I think its best to finish this by taking a moment to remember that small, frightened child, and the frightened teenager, too - and just show a lot of understanding to them - to me. In my mind my self as I am now - my big self - is hugging my child self and my teen self. I am showing sorrow, sadness, care, Love, I am kissing them on the forehead as they cuddle up next to me. I say to them,"I'm so sorry that you were frightened and fearful for your own safety. I'm so sorry."I say to myself, looking in an imaginary mirror opposite where we are sitting,"I'm here now. I'm big and I'm strong, and I'm a good bloke - despite everything - I can be a good bloke very often, and I really do try. People are not against me. They want to connect. And although I'm fearful of how people will treat me, 99% of the time people treat me very well."It's true.I've had a few noticeable moments of shame in the past couple of days.As part of pulling myself out of negative states, I've been reflecting on the different components of my experience of shame. I thought I'd document and share them here, rather than the issues of what happened and when. It's because similar patterns keep appearing, and I find it useful to analyse the experience - literally, pick apart - to help me manage and respond more effectively. It's like being able to see all the different parts of the experience, so that I can attend to them separately, and therefore more productively, rather than rolling around in a quagmire of distress.It would be interesting if other people wanted to comment or add their own experience....Anatomy of Shame.Shame for me seems to involve:A strong Inner Critic: I notice this in sentences I say to myself such as, "God! I'm such an idiot." ... or "I'm so stupid." ... or "That was so embarrassing! Ugh!" Or, it could manifest as a projection onto other people, imagining them to be thinking or talking negatively about me, criticising me behind my back or while I'm with them etc. Or I notice it in the images of other people's crumpled, disapproving faces, or fleeting scenes in my mind in which I am shunned from other people or some group.A felt sense of anxiety and distress: I notice uncomfortable or distressing sensations run through my whole body. In particular, I notice an urge to cover up or hide myself. My hands and arms want to move into my body and over my face as if to protect or hide away - from imagined scorn of others.An urge to run away: I see this as a kind of behavioural avoidance. I want to be away from people, run and hide myself. My body is twitching to "get out of there".Rumination: I notice that I obsessively think over the thing that "I did" that caused me to feel ashamed. Over and over, my mind rehearsing the scene of the incident, trying to work out "how bad" the supposedly shameful act was.Worry: I notice worry thoughts, which are similar to rumination but are about the future. "What will people think?" ... "Will people treat me differently?" ... The worry includes an obsessive look for evidence in the past. That is, the rumination of "What happened" ties in with the worry about "the consequences". One feeds the other.Externalised Anger: If I am experiencing shame by proxy of another person's behaviour, particularly someone who is close to me, then I notice Anger directed toward them. For example, if a family member - or someone associated with me - behaves in a way that I think is "shameful" to me, then I notice how i get enraged with their behaviour. It's like my inner critic is turned outwards to other people, as if I were still connected to the shameful act as if Ihad committed it.Controlling behaviour: This can come in many forms. It could be about stopping or controlling or correcting other people's so called "shameful" behaviour. I think the externalising anger can be underneath this, particular if I go into a scolding or lecturing mode. Controlling could also be about trying to rectify how people perceive me by trying to manage my behaviour to be more preferable to them, as I see it. It could be about trying to "work on myself more" so that I don't repeat the shameful act again in an overt way. Attacking Others: This stems from that externalising anger as well. Perhaps if I feel slighted by others, I might verbally or even sometimes - thankfully rarely - physically move to attack them. I see this as a defence against the feelings of shame, using blame and attack to regain a sense of power and strength. I also do this attack vovertly, internally devaluing other people while perhaps acting charming on the surface to control how they perceive me.Compulsive self-soothing: I notice the urge to use self-soothing behavioirs to find relief from the feelings of shame and distress in my body. This might involve something like comfort eating or the likes. Or, it includes a kind of grandiosity. Mirror-gazing after a shame attack, for example, provides an ego-boost through the form of self-admiration (about my appearance or me as aperson) or coinciding thoughts of my own superiority. Or it could be writing a post to get some upvotes and congratulation from people here. ;)So... There are some elements of shame that I notice. What about yours?. When I'm around other people, I have often had that feeling that I should be likeable to the other person I'm with."Should"It's a feeling that anything other than coming across as perfectly buoyant and upbeat is wrong, that people won't like it, that they'll judge me and think badly of me; that I will be ostracised, shamed. I was just sitting with someone I know and feeling that feeling that I need to be on my best behaviour with him. For him. I think it's heightened because the person I'm with is so bloody positive and energised himself. That feeling of needing to perform as the good person is more prominent with certain people like this.A memory pops up from childhood: of me being the smiling child for the guests we had at home.That's what we did as a family when people came round. I guess not always. But it was often enough to leave a relatively strong imprint. My Mum did it in particular, and I followed suit. A presentation mode. False. And I'm not just saying that because the "false self" is a buzz term for us here. She was all smiley and upbeat. I think at the time I did see that it wasn't her usual behaviour, but l also think I thought that's just what we did with guests.I continued that into adulthood, that presentation mode of politeness. Affable. Accommodating. Showing that I was conscientious of other people's feelings. Showing I'm listening by overly nodding, mirroring expressions in the other person, being all smiley and positive glow. The problem was, of course, that I often hid how I was really feeling, which meant that - I think - I couldn't connect with people. The energy required to maintain that "attentive face" was also difficult to uphold. I would frequently leave social situations to be on my own - in the bathroom, mainly - just to not smile for a little bit.I was just programmed to be like that with people.I also got an ego boost out of it, though - at least for a little while at these social events. I would show up to as "The Happy Person" ... "The Charming Listener." Yes, i'd get high on that and look down on people who were not looking happy and cheerful, but instead "miserable" to my mind. Or worse. I really did devalue people consistently in my social groups. Although I turned up all smiles to events, afterwards I would very often criticise pretty much everyone in our social circle who wa there. There wasn't really anyone who wasn't a target of my critique at some point or other. I would moan to my partner that I didn't like these people and that I didn't want to see them. At a couple of points, he made comments about us having fewer and fewer friends because of my judgements....The thing is, these patterns were still active relatively recently. I think I did try to get better around this issue since 2020, but it's really in the last year or so - since self-awareness - that things have changed for the better.I do feel increasingly like I can turn up to social situations and show how I feel - or at least enough to feel real inside. I feel like I have managed to uncover a real self with me, more or less, which I based on how I feel and how I want to come across.But ... Old habits die hard, and sitting with our friend just now, I felt that pull to be the polite, attentive, jolly listener... But - yay! - I noticed this, and made an effort to not yield to those patterns. I presented more how I was (am) feeling. A bit non-descript. A bit not bothered all in all.And then it came to me: it doesn't matter if he doesn't like me. Because look, my emotions, my feelings, don't make a bad or unlikeable person. My feelings are ok, and I don't gave to hide them.I looked across at him and saw him all bubbly and happy. He's a healthy fellow, and generally positive. And I had an image of myself at the same time as different, separate. Two different guys with different feelings, doing OK sitting next to each other, with neither one particularly accommodating the other. I think this is nice to notice. I am - god dammit - gradually becoming my own self, and showing people who I am and how I feel....There are some obstacles to this process external to my own habits, namely people who overtly say to me that I should look of act differently, smile more etc. It's my partner in particular. He also has narc tendencies, and seems to get over-anxious as to how I show up. I have to fairly often say that I'm fine as I am when I'm not "smiling with teeth" as he says. It's a bit of a joke in some ways, but it's also annoying because it's so frequent. And I just want to have my face not in a smiling position in certain situations. I notice that it's when we're around other people. And I'm really not being a dick or anything. And I know, of course, that it is right to show up civil and polite to a degree. Just not so much.Anyway, I don't want to be too defensive or irritable about it. But it is a thing to deal with. Just again, though: I'm not going back in that happy-faced box. I know that a real me exists, I'm cultivating him, and I'm putting him out there.So something really shifted today. Large crack in the ground stylee. I'm sure it'll close again. Probably. But this is to document the \*massive gaping hole\* that has just vomitted everywhere.Sorry for the post splurge. But some cool things came out. I felt rage and distress and loneliness and panic ... Nothing new. But somehow I managed to let it be there more than before. YES!I wanted to run, punch, scream, ... I felt like everything was falling down, whipping up. I didn't know who I was. This is not anything new. It happens fairly frequently. But I somehow had more room to be ok with it today.I felt, and still feel, slightly more buzzy than usual. It'll pass, but ... I said to a friend: *I am bundle of criss-crossed and flailing live wires. With a beard. And some not too bad pecs now. And the delicious glimmer of abs. And a nice smile.*I do feel that this criss-crossedness is a part of me - a big part - that I do hide from myself and others.I am a bit bonkers. My thoughts are totally wild. I don't have psychosis, but my imagination is insane and I get also sorts of violent and scary thoughts popping in a lot. Not all the time. But it can happen.My moods flit around like ping pong balls in a tiny metal room. I try to cover it up by looking \*cool\* and \*hot\* and \*sharp\* and \*nice\* and \*calm\* ... and I can be all those things, but I'm also ... underneath ... this bundle of live wires sparking off.I feel more ok with that.This is me, bitches!!But you already knew ... It was me who had to catch up....bla bla blaHere's the thing:I suddenly realised that everyone else is a bundle of nerves with a cover.AND ... I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO BE NICE TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE MEEEE. Or could be one day, so it's good to be nice.AND ...I got chatting with one person who I previously was really irritated by, and FELT CONNECTION and was more my bonkers self, and just said what was on my mind, and SHE LAUGHED!!! And we had a connection, and it was cooooooooooooooool.Maybe if I show my anger and dance fun and sadness and terror and style and spunkiness and cockiness and my fragility and mood and terror and delight and mania and tiny-ness and wish to doninate ... somehow I'll find myself and it'll help.This is why I look in mirrors.Title.It's so awful.When I reveal the depths of whatever this is .... out comes the lava ..... Panic.Right now.Flashing images of the guy on the train platform coming towards me with his terrifyingly distorted face, attacking me.Flashing images of me attacking everyone on this train.Me going mad.Distress like a tornado in my body.The feeling of MUST GET OUT OF HERE.NOW....Shift.To sadness. I can cope. ...I can't afford it. Few can.This group is basically all there is for working things out.It really fucking annoys me how fucking expensive therapy is.I paid £180 an hour from November to February. Specialist in Npd. All my savings.OK. But ...That's ... four and a half hour long piano lessons.At least the therapist is happy. Woop! Woop! Bringing in the cash.OK. More pockets of unknown shite still there.Watching videos of therapists talk about narcissism.I sense my reactivity towards what they are saying.Why do therapists trigger me so much? Fuck sake.I just want to jump on them and beat them to a pulp. Sometimes I have imagined slitting their throats. Or jumping on their faces and punching and punching. They bring up this rage that I quickly stifle. But I know that the stifling is not helping me.iI stifle. All the time. I shut down my rage because it feels totally unacceptable.Well... that monster is still there inside, but rather than feeling scared, I think he's sexy as hell. Nope. That's yet more grandiosity.It's that deep rage and that come with tears. It's that feeling of being judged so deeply by another person. A distress that immediately makes me want to flip out and attack and blame.Oh fuck.It's like, everything I do is about making myself look good to others, including the progress I've made with my disorder. Posts. Comments. Everything. Style. Politeness. Being nice. Acting. Trying. Working on myself.I can't get out of it.I can't make exact sense of this.I'm really, really fucking horny.I'm getting much better at tolerating not getting upvoted.Yay! Fuck you, social belonging anxiety. Woof!It's rather silly for a 40-something to be concerned about these things, but I know you know how it feels. We all want it. *Gimme that upvote high!!!*And:*Where's my upvote, BITCH!!!?*And:*No one loves me. I'm basically invisible / about to die.*And:*Terrible!!! I did something that people didn't like!!!*You know, don't get me wrong, I still have these thoughts and feelings. But they aren't nearly as intense. Nearly. ;)When I first joined the sub and for a fair while after, I would more frequently delete posts that didn't receive many upvotes. Out of shame, having been slumped at home in sadness and despair.I still do occasionally delete posts. But the last time was because I felt I wasn't being myself - maybe not even a good reason to delete. But anyways. I'm generally getting better at staying with what I've put out - you know, if I feel it's real, I guess - whether or not it flies so well.To me, this is progress. Ding ding! I am standing up for myself more, being less wavering and tossed around by what people think, and caring less about every opinion I receive or don't, or getting caught up if I do something that is "successful" or not.Yay. Growth in confidence. Woop! Woop!I've also noticed I feel more capable being honest about my thoughts, rather than hiding them in case they are criticised....Biff! Another angle would be:Fuck it. I'm invincible, mate!!🤘(P.S. I'm not. Don't hate me. 😁)...Edit: Blimey! This is a test! 😁. Today I have been grandiose in the morning, depressed variously throughout the afternoon, and calm and steady in the evening. But right now, I am really grateful for this journey of discovery. Right now, I don't care about the downs. I know that they'll come again, and I'll absolutely hate it. There will be suicidal ideation and depression and shame. But there is also something about all those things that provides an opportunity.I really love those moments when the downs turn into opportunities for discovery and learning. It's like finding little pieces of the puzzle and putting them together. I love building that picture and working it out over time. I love how I've gone from a really flimsy smiling face of a person, hiding all the anger and doubt and anxiety and shame and torment, to someone with more of a sense of who I am, and able to express much more of what's going on inside, and feel like a real person with an actual self. That is really cool! I still have some weird experiences in terms of feeling fake, feeling empty, suddenly feeling very close to people and loving, before then feeling totally separate and isolated and full of hate and disdain. But I try to be mindful of what is going on, challenge my thoughts and feelings as best I can, and try to find some middle ground.I feel sorry for my young self before self-awareness I was trapped and very troubled. I raged a lot and had terrible panic everyday. Body dysmorphia. Eating disorders. OCD. Hypochondria. The works. All based around this very narcissistic personality structure that I had no clue about at the time, really. But I did the best that I could. I didn't know any better. It's nice to overcome a lot of that, even though the remnants are still there. I can still be pulled down by various things, but not nearly as strongly.My mind may never be completely stable. But in a way, I would kind of hate if that happened. I enjoy this journey where the weirdness of my brain and my reactions to things puzzles me, and drives me to find a solution. ...Late this afternoon, I was tired from - quite frankly - overworking. Again. I had a bit of a low point. Someone I'm working with was not getting their work done and it felt like it was really holding me back. I felt the anger and frustration and blame. I felt, too, the sadness underneath, and I started crying to myself, just walking down the street. It happens. Just gentle, quiet tears of frustration. It was part sadness and part kicking-and-screaming and blaming.I imagined my various 'inner good parents' step in with their messages that would calm me down. The message that really hit home was "I know you are so tired and frustrated. Now, this is what we're going to do... We're going to take it one step at a time. We're going to remember all the good things you've been able to do today..." etc etc. It really helped soothe me and shifted me into a more calm and steady state where I felt capable and strong.That was a cool experience. It's little things like that that drive me on. Every day. Every day I work on myself. Every interaction with people is hard in some way. But ... I am just trying to balance so much and make this life work as best as it can. It involves a lot of self-confrontation, moderating, taming, refining, tempering, nudging forward, holding back ... But I love this journey, as rocky as it may be.I'm sure I'll be desperately low tomorrow over some thing. But I'm also sure I'll find a way out. I know that by now.It is also seriously great to meet and hang out with some of the most deep, caring (lol) and inspiring people I've ever known, and feel that connection between us.Yay!. Which one do I choose for my story of growth and recovery? *Trigger Warning.*Which one do I go for for my suicidal ideation? *Upbeat Talk.*...Ah ha ... That pattern of childish rebellion ... That feeling of being caged in, and the explosion out ... That [Rhombicosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicosidodecahedron) being forced through a square hole ...That core need for autonomy childhood, chronically unmet ... ...*Well done, Peanut. Feel the feelings. Attend to your inner child.* Nope!I want to have a party and do wild mock interpretative dancing a la Kate Bush in the 1980s in front of everyone without drinking a drop of alcohol because I'm that special that I can do that. I hope everyone is jealous.*Don't tell me what to do!*Thanks. Venting - advice requested....*Chooses Flair. Cries.*. No I did not.I spent a considerable amount of time, picking, putting on, checking, enjoying my reflection, imagining what people will think, imagining people admire my looks, semi-consciously rehearsing my modest replies.Started with that tiny t-shirt that no one wears on a Tuesday work day. Tucked in. Ugh! Yes. But too much. Too obvious, complete with my sparkly glasses and over-quaffed hair. Such a narc. But actually: who cares!! Fuck 'em! Actually, shit! I do care. Too much. Try on that shirt over the top for the more casual look. Hm. Terrible shoulder projection. Tucked in. Yes!!! So sexy!!! But no, obvious porn star wannabe again. Untuck shirt and t-shirt. The sad compromise. Phew. I look good not too good. Totally casual. But you can still see my workout progress.Check mirror just one more time, or three, and... stare for a second, and... breakfast! "I'm coming!"*he glows into the kitchen*THE LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT.Hang on a mo...Other people are not two dimensional caricatures. Ooooooooo....They may look a certain way in their demeanour, but underneath is this mysterious Pandora's box of possibilities.They may look miserable right now. But they might suddenly burst into jokes and giggles.They may appear calm and sensible to me on first impression, but they may turn out to be rather lazy or slightly bonkers today.It's difficult to know what to expect. People surprise.Oh yeah! 😁...Does anyone else have this where they very easily and quickly box people into two dimensional "You are this or that"? Is this particular an NPD or PD thing? I kind of think it might be. I've noticed that I very easily seem to do this compared with others around me. When I cast my silly judgements or assessments of people, for example, my partner or friends suggest that things are more complex, and that I'm being too inflexible in my view.So, sitting on this train home, looking at people around me, it feels cool and nice and open in my body to shift this more fixed perspective of people towards something more complex and dynamic and surprising.Oh!. I have found this hard in life, accepting and appreciating other people's talents and abilities and skills and achievements and successes. Even close friends. Even my partner.But ... it's something I've worked on quite a bit over many years. It's gotten easier. And more often I can find myself actually enjoying other people's talents, rather than feeling that tug of envy in my chest.Tonight we went to a birthday party. Cheesy music on the dance floor. I work in music and have spent a lifetime listening to music as a kind of "work". What can I learn from this musician? How can I be as good or better than them? Why aren't I successful? Fantasising about my own potential. etc etc You know the drill.Tonight, I noticed that I just enjoyed the music and the musicians without comparing myself or getting twitchy about my own abilities or status (or lack of status) as a musician.I thought, "Oh, this is what normal people must feel like listening to music."It was ... very nice.To reduce stigma, some refer to BPD as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.Would you re-name NPD for a similar purpose? If so, what?I'm going with SERD for now: Self-Esteem Regulation Disorder, which I think I picked up from elsewhere. I think it would help me explain the symptoms and behaviour to people. I wonder if I would feel less isolated and less concerned talking about it.Also, SERD just rolls off the tongue. Clearly.SERD! 🌈. It's such a bad and swift turnaround, it's also funny.I should really know better by now. But I contine to fool myself, it seems.Us self-aware narcs are not always so different from (supposedly) healthy people.Everyone has narcissistic defences. Ours are just more pronounced and much more dysfunctional.But everyone has that armour, or can do.But here's our advantage as the self-aware crowd. We (hopefully, but not always) \*recognise\* at least some of our defences. And because we have a tendency towards hypersensitivity, hypervigilance, and over-analysis, we may (I think) see more of the layers of our defences, the subtleties and nuances, and talk openly about them (here at least). On average, I'd say most people don't....Defences come in all guises. Grandiosity, yes. Going on the attack. Antagonism. Angry rumination. Martyrdom. Complaining. But also just simple detachment from emotions.Everyone does this.Last night I was with a few friends at dinner. One friend brought up how she was worried about her Mum and Dad, the latter in particular because he was experiencing pain I his side, had previously had cancer, but had been ignoring the pain and the doctor or telling anyone until just recently. She shared her news and revealed a glimpse of her fears. I felt like she was human and I was human. I felt connection to her where previously I was struggling.Within surely less than a minute, another friend chipped in to say something like, "It's probably nothing", and turned the conversation towards something else. The friend with the unwell Dad followed along. The window of vulnerability opened and was quickly closed. I felt the moment where we could connect fall away from me.There it was in the group. Detachment. Cutting off from emotions that might be "too much", "awkward" or "intolerable".I felt lonely again, me with my feelings I sensed there was less room for. I closed up....When I teach my piano students, I try to notice my own state or mode as much as possible, and how the student is responding. I notice that when I've been in a more grandiose state, it feels fun and I feel awesome, and students may tag along with the energy for a while. Perhaps there is some comfort in being with a teacher who distracts them from their own feelings, through becoming the centre of attention in my jokes or quirkiness or through playing in a show-off or extravagant manner. But the sense of comfort and ease in the room doesn't last long. Quite quickly I notice that I become disconnected from the student. They are "over there" and I am "over here". We aren't vibing off each other.I think this is problematic for the student and the teaching, particularly in a one to one teaching context. The disconnection feels quite isolating for both of us. Quite lonely and even a bit scary for the student. In order for the learning to be "good", they need a sense of secure connection with the teacher. And it's true. When I'm in a more balanced, emotionally in-touch state, in tune with what's going on within me, sensing what is happening potentially in the student, verbally checking in with them and listening to their responses, and yet having that overall sense of stability and level-headedness, then the teaching can work better. I notice that students relax more and open up. They share their feelings about playing and we work to resolve problems that I could only know about if they are shared. Or it could be about them sharing their interests or preferences for the direction of travel in the lessons. That opening up allows them their autonomy, which is another key ingredient to success when we work together: I'm doing some guiding, but they are also participating and speaking up about what feels right for them in that moment. If I'm grandiose or detached - not checking in, not open about my own experience - then they don't have so much room to express themselves, and the lessons are about me more than them. And that's not good.I'm not saying that the good teaching is absolutely and totally dependent on my behaviour. But how I show up has at least some impact. And it is my responsibility, I believe, as the adult and professional, to think about these things and try to do my best for the client. Grandiosity is not totally awful and can create some kind of spark in the room. It can even lift people for a while, which is no bad thing. But if it is too strong or too prolonged, disconnection entails, and the learning process - and the joy of music - falls a bit flat....A core part of me, however much I deny it when I'm grandiose or emotionally detached, yearns for connection. I think we all do. It's a fundamental human need.I s'pose this post is aiming at a few things. A reminder for myself to notice that grandiosity or detachment within myself, and to try to find ways of softening the armour, to be more open, even vulnerable, to foster connection with others.I can't deny that there's also a bit of "come on, guys" to this post. I like you for you. Sometimes I feel that our defences get in the way of connecting here, in this special place - where we have that opportunity to connect. ...I say: let's go for it.If you are anything like me, you are sensitive, you have a sensitive temperament. People have told you that you are reading into things that aren't there. You are told that you are too much, too intense, think too much, are full of woe, or have too much energy, too happy, even.It can be lonely being an emotional and sensitive person. It can become easier to put forward what we think is an acceptable presentation of ourselves for others, hiding the fluid and intense feelings underneath. At the same time, it can feel like very few people seem to understand our emotional landscape inside, so we retreat inwards, becoming hyperautonomous and over-introspective, lost in our own thoughts, analysing our feelings, maybe seeing them as superior to that of others.These are perhaps some of the ways that narcissism has manifested in me, which leads to other self-interested behaviours that add to the suffering of feeling lonely and not understood, alien....But the intense feelings are also a gift. This is a tricky line to tread, because it can be easy - certainly for me - to over-treasure and over-personalise these gifts as "ours", making us special, better. So we have to be on guard for this kind of thinking that further separates us from other people, when what we really need is connection and understanding.At the same time, I think we can enjoy our emotions and find solace within them. Intense emotions allow me to experience life with greater passion. I find fulfilment through sorrow and grief, not just resting on everyday, superficial emotions. I have many emotional peaks throughout my days. They can be tough, but I am also grateful for them. It has been a difficult life sometimes. But rich. Very rich. Just being in my body every day.Maybe a view that accounts for both sides of the coin can help keep us level-headed. We are both unlucky and lucky. Recognising the pluses and minuses gives me a sense of balance, and both limits my tendency towards self-aggrandisement and keeps me from a sense of unhelpful self-pity....One of the things I like about this forum is that it is filled with intense people, quite willing to go to the depths. Very fulfilling. I am glad.We can get better. ...Another low effort post.Oh! ...Low effort post. Sorry. But that's it.I had a post earlier about what being kind to ourselves means to different people here.It occurred to me that - of course - for many of us, we struggle to even know what it is to be kind or self-compassionate, because we didn't experience it, or it wasn't modelled to us in childhood.When I started my own journey of recovery about 13 years ago, I also really had very little clue about compassion in some respects. My attempts at compassion for others were more like grandiose manipulations of their emotions, positioning myself as "the person to lean on", being "the wise advisor" and so on. Yes, it wasn't all bad. People may have got things from the interaction. But for me, it was probably more about feeling good about myself, and seeing myself as the bigger, better, wiser person, rather than actually connecting with the person in need. I didn't really have a feeling of connection with them, I don't think. It was more: what can I get out of this interaction? If they feel good at the end, then I will feel good, and that was probably more of the main goal.Attempts at self-compassion ... ? I mean, I didn't know. I remember during therapy in 2020, my therapist "introduced" the idea of compassion to me. It was kind of new to me. I didn't really have a feeling about it. I said I would try to be compassionate to myself, but it wasn't really something I felt. It was more of a logical, cognitive exercise.One time in therapy again last year, I was doing a particular exercise in self-compassion. My therapist asked me to think about what my "healthy adult / role model" might do in a particular imagined situation. I pulled from a list of ideas I had made in the previous year, which I'd jotted down on a piece of paper. Having said out loud what I'd do, I quickly burst into tears, realising that while I knew the answer now, it was something that took me so many years to work out. I was sad for my younger self who didn't experience the compassion a child should receive, and so had to strive to learn it as an adult in a very haphazard way,Now, I do have a better understanding of being nice to myself and others, but it didn't come from me. It took effort, and I had to look for it from other people: by observing friends, characters in films and TV, and podcasters like Tara Brach - who really taught me a lot in particular.So it was a bit presumptuous of me earlier to ask people how they could be kind to themselves today, when it took me a very long time to work it out. I didn't think clearly about it.I had to outsource it. It doesn't come from us. But I do believe it's possible for us to internalise and make our own the behaviours - and eventually feelings - of other people.As I said, one personal go-to in my journey was Tara Brach. She also teachers meditation, and while I found her meditations really nice, it was really the podcast talks that were helpful. I learnt so many things through her talks. I imagined her as my new inner parent. I would speak to her in my mind's eye: "I'm stuck. What should I do?" ... And I would, because I'd listened to her so much, more and more easily imagine what she might say back to me in various situations: "I see you're hurting. I see you're angry. I'm so sorry you're struggling." Just that - that empathy delivered to myself through my imagination - was enough sometimes to help me calm down. I remember that when I couldn't sleep at nice because I was so enraged, imagining Tara Brach come to my bedside like a mother figure, sit down on the bed, rest her hand on my body and say, "I'm so sorry you're hurting right now" ... that would allow me to relax and drift off to sleep.I still struggle with real empathy sometimes, but it's better. When I can't connect properly, I can still say the words that I learnt from Tara Brach, and feel that they might have a positive impact on people like they had on me. It's like: passing on what I learnt through her. It's also far less grandiose than it used to be. I've learnt to let the other person work it out for themselves more, with just little nudges, rather than dictating how I think they "should" think or feel or reflect. Yes, there is still some grandiosity involved on my side, but it's less and less.So there you go. I just wanted to say that.No jokes or cynicism. 😁For me, it's lowering - even by just a knotch - the demands and expectations I put on myself to be productive and perfect in all spheres of life all the time.For once, not doing, but just being. Not pushing forward fast. Allowing life to unfold on its own a but more. Strolling rather than sprinting. Whoops. I dropped the juggling balls. Oh well. I'll pick them up some other time. It's be OK.That is the kind of kindness I need today. What about you? It could be completely different.I'd say these are two core features of my personality, as I currently see it. I wondered if other pwNPD relate in their own way.A comment by u/KickLongjumping4433 got me thinking about these aspects of me.In Schema, they sometimes talk of a 'Defiant Child' mode, which is an "angry response to having one’s autonomy curtailed and being told what to do."Then there is the Rebel Mode in Schema. A Schema theorist I like, David Edwards, quoted some key statements linked to this mode of behaviour: “I dislike rules and can get satisfaction from breaking them,” “I think of myself as a rebel; I often go against the established authority,” and “I enjoy being unconventional, even if it’s unpopular or I don’t fit in.” He goes onto say: "This mode externalises a backstage Defiant Child, and incorporates a narrative that portrays it as a valuable identity. Expression may range from being more passive-aggressive to being actively, even militantly rebellious."...I definitely have these elements in me. And I think it's important to keep in mind that they arise in response to a sense that autonomy is being taken away or denied. Or was in the past, as a child. We have a core need to individuate / differentiate from other people, and ... this is an undeveloped part of me. I didn't properly go through the individuation process because of my over-bearing, enmeshing mother and terrifying father. No space for 'me'.I really see where this lack of autonomy comes from in myself, and why it's such a big trigger for the defiant part of me. When I feel like my independence and sense of personal choice as an adult is undermined or unfairly questioned, like it was in childhood, I get angry really quickly. RAGE! There is a teen-like "Fuck you!" flavour to the anger. Two fingers up. Slammed doors. Vent post.I guess the rebel mode in me, if it's linked to this sense of angry defiance underneath, is the lighter and more playful version of this rage. It's the mischief in me, as I've identified many times before. Disgusting jokes. Pranks. Banter. Giggling about my misdemeanours. Revelling in the naughtiness.I've mentioned, for instance, that I see myself as quite emotionally immature in some respects, or at least that this can come forth in me fairly often. I feel an almost mischievous glee about this aspect of my personality. Again, I think it connects to that sense of rebellion: "I'll behave like a teenager, and it'll make me different, annoying, unconventional etc." But I think it also reveals that underlying angry defiance. It has a kind of: "Fuck you, social conventions!" flavour in there too. I'm not great with rules....I'm sitting on the bed - like a teenager - typing this. Ahead of me is a large mirror. Occasionally, I'm looking up and channelling that rebel / defiant mode through my face, to see what comes up.Gosh. I actually do this often throughout my day! Lol. This is the mode that pops out in the bathroom mirror, for example, when I run there to escape the adult dinner party conversations that I detest. I pull this face to myself. What is it saying? ... "Don't fuck with me!" ... "I don't give a fuck." ... "You're all a bunch of wankers." ... "Fuck this boring shit." ... Maybe I'm thinking these and similar things to myself in the mirror because I feel I can't say them to the people I'm with. Maybe I use the mirror to express or display parts of myself generally that I feel not able to say out loud. I kind of put those parts of me into the mirror, where they are safe. The mirror is a safe space to express myself. Oohhhhhhhh!...The thing is, if I follow the Schema model, then underneath all of that is the vulnerable childlike part of me. A part of me LOVES being this rebel, and wants to deny that there is anything else going on. But to do that would not do myself any favours. It would be to keep me stuck in a way of coping with life - through feeling and being rebellious (passive and active) - rather than actually attending to any wounds underneath that are driving those parts of me ... to, quite honestly, behave in ways that I can regret or bring me a sense of shame in the aftermath.So as I continue to gaze into the mirror, I also find a safe moment to express other things to myself. The mirror is my display cabinet for my deeper emotions I feel unable to share anywhere else.A sadness quickly reveals itself. Loneliness. Fatigue. Bleakness. Depression. Feeling ugly. Feeling unwanted. Feeling unloved. Totally.I spend a moment staring at my face, which shows all these emotions and more that I can't describe properly. It feels good to acknowledge that these feelings are there. I suddenly realise how tired I am.Life is tiring for many reasons. Just tapping into one particular aspect, though, it's tiring not being able to express my emotions in public, or at least *feeling* like I can't. It's tiring feeling like I have to wrap up my emotions in some publicly acceptable presentation that doesn't feel natural to me. It's tiring and frustrating. My sadness shifts to a childlike anger: "Why can't I just say what I want, how I want?! Why do I have to follow these rules of self-expression when they are so stifling and unnatural?" I feel sad again. ...And then I feel that playful rebel part of me come through. It's like a way of distracting myself from he sadness and frustration. There he is in the mirror once more, and I feel my thoughts turn to mischievous things I might think or do later in the day, just to "get my own back". Hm. Defiance. Feeling controlled again, and so engaging in thoughts and behaviours that give me a sense of taking back control, or defying the authority that I don't agree with....I do like this rebellious and defiant part of me, though. Yes, it's immature, and I can do or say some things in that mode that later induce shame, but there are also many upsides. People laugh at my stupid jokes and silly, childlike behaviour. ATTENTION! But the mood of the room lightens.It actually also works well in my work as a piano teacher, where, depending on the appropriateness of the moment, I can be playful and cheeky and poke fun at social norms (especially around music performance and assessment, for example), and it's all part of the package: the slightly quirky piano teacher, helping people escape - for 30 minutes at least - the trappings of school or adult life. I play a bit of the fool if it feels right to do that, and the intention is to lighten the mood sometimes, and give space for people to undo their social conformity, get a bit more childlike themselves and connect with and lose themselves in the music - which is what we're aiming for....I don't want to get rid of the rebel in me. He's funny and cute and energising. But I do think it would be good to recognise where he comes from as well, and tend to that sadness underneath a bit more....Now, where's my rocket. 🚀. I have gotten a lot of helpful comments to posts since I started writing here.Recently, a few people have pointed out my potential black and white thinking on various situations. On reflection, I do see that I still struggle with this style of split-off thinking and perception of myself, other people and the world around me.My understanding is that this is a feature of NPD. I just re-watched a HealNPD YouTube video on integration and splitting, and related to it a lot.I generally see myself as split into 'parts' that feel radically different from one another. Some I instinctively feel are 'all good' while others I perceive as 'all bad'. Well, that is my tendency anyhow. I am trying to enjoy and appreciate that sides that I previously felt terrified to acknowledge. And I am also experimenting right now in seeing the downsides of my "pure hearted" parts. But my mental reflex is still to see these parts as cut off from one another and either dastardly or wholesome. It feels hard right now to perceive a middle ground. Grey areas in my thinking are appearing, I guess. But it takes conscious effort to think like this.I also have the habit of associating my "real self" with these different parts at any given time. When I'm in a low mood, I can easily think, "Oh. That's the real me." But when I'm grandiose or otherwise, I think just the same and ignore the low mood from before. In either state, it feels difficult to imagine that the "real me" is both or the opposite of where I am currently at. I am also obsessed with trying to figure out who "I really am". It's another mental reflex that I have to consciously pull myself away from often.Historically, I have tended to see people as "all bad" or "all good". In the past, I would easily want to discard people in my life who I thought were "evil" or against me or not worth the effort because they were "boring" or "stupid" or "aggressive". I would also idealise some other people as being "good-natured" or "great".These days, I still have that tendency. But I do more readily see people as more than one thing.But I now find it confusing that some other people are much more "blended" than I am. I see there "good" and "bad" qualities, but I don't see those parts as split off from one another. Some people don't shift in and out of different "modes" of behaviour and mood like I do. They are more "one thing with subtle flavours."I see that other people do have quite different sides to them that appear in different contexts. But I somehow don't perceive that as problematic in them, whereas it feels totally problematic that this could be the case with me. The idea that I am not constant confuses me and feels "wrong".I am a kaleidoscope of moving parts that come to the surface, and I don't really know anything different. It feels very disorientating to live in a kaleidoscope, with parts that I cannot hold onto for long, or comprehend as ok or me or real. I am constantly questioning my sense of identity. How can I be both terribly kind and a complete cunt at different times? To others, that might not seem like an issue or something worth worrying about. But to me, my sense of identity plays on my mind every day. Who the fuck am I? The cunt or the cute kind one? It really bothers me. How can I be both?When I am with people, I feel these different parts rise and fall in my persona. They can be very intense and radically different. Rage then anxiety then cockiness then tearfulness then joy. I think I try my best to appear as one person, trying to present a stable image to the world, or as I imagine the people I'm with would want me to be. That has always been my tendency. But it is quite an anxious state, where I'm simultaneously managing what's going on underneath, which is a lot. My therapist said she could see waves of emotions pass quickly through me in session. That is me without the mask on. A montage reel of contrasting parts, flipping very quickly from one to the other. A multipart chorus of voices singing in different tonalities. I feel I am getting better. So that's good. It feels very hard to do this sometimes, but I am trying to present to people more how I want to be or feel in the moment, rather than how I instinctively and subconsciously imagine they want me to appear. It still feels anxiety inducing and challenging. I guess this comes down to feeling like I "had" to be one thing but not another as a child. I had to appear to get along with my parents, for example, even though they terrified or mistreated me. I had to pretend to the world that everything was fine a home, even though it was a scary place to live. I felt I had to please my parents by presenting in particular ways but hiding others. Then being a musical child gave me a place to really escape all of that. I would get attention and shine on the little stage. I would enjoy living inside that bubble of peace and excitement.Writing this makes me feel sad that the trauma or neglect I experienced as a child had such an impact on my brain.I know a little about what's going on here, but would appreciate any more input. What I am really hoping for is some understanding and guidance.Rip off the mask and underneath there is a really nasty side of me. It is not all of me, but it is a real part. I've written about it elsewhere a few times, but I guess I'm coming back to it to try to consolidate my thoughts a bit further.You see, I'm on this journey of mine. I want some kind of reconciliation of my various parts, however contrasting. I want some kind of integration, rather than this splitting of my psyche. I don't want to present in one way to people but feel completely different underneath, or try to push that other side away from my being. Or at least I want to do that less and less, or when it's only necessary. I don't want to split into different and distinct modes so much. I want to have access to more of my whole self, and use those different sides more wisely.I just ... want to be whole. It's not like I'm starting from scratch at this point, but ... that's my journey, which I don't mind repeating and repeating. I want it. I want it....So this nasty side... Once again, like many of my 'tricky parts' it seems, I have hidden it from others, and denied it to myself. Shut it down. Tried to quieten it or change it. Step away from it. Let it shrivel.But it keeps coming back. It won't change. It's just 'there'. An aspect of my personality.It actually pops out when I look in the mirror. It's there in my eyebrows. Lol. :)This nastiness has many flavours:It is rebellious to authority. Antagonistic. Highly irritable. Fractious. Wanting to scold, belittle, shame, lecture, control others close to me. It is sneering at people. It is reducing them to an object that I can mentally demean and ridicule. It is taking some pleasure in shocking people, intimidating them, making them uncomfortable. It is wanting to start arguments only to gain the upper hand. Doing things that most people would find somewhat shocking. It is petty and vengeful. It sometimes imagines doing harm to others. It is pure, wicked mischief.In another post recently, I wrote about a power-hungry side of me. In some ways, this feels a bit different. But these two sides, I guess, could potentially combine. I'm not sure right now.That would be quite something if they did combine and were let loose....This nasty side of me has, in particular, caused me great anxiety in the past. Like: panic for it even being there. *Where did it come from? Is this the real me? Help! I thought I was a good person. I want to be that good person!* But, thankfully, that anxiety has been diminishing through some self-work I've been doing.This past year, I have actively tried to recognise it when it appears and allow it in through my mind and body. In time, I have grown to appreciate but also enjoy it. It has a wild and electrifying energy that really excites me.Apologies for being graphic, but it's become a real turn-on when I'm having a wank. It just really does it for me, and I'd say is part of what I'd call my autosexuality. It's like I'm turned on by this really cuntish side of my being.I can also now look in the mirror at myself and, rather than see it and deny it, change my face to obscure it - I can instead think, "I really like this wicked side of me" and not flinch neatly so much. In fact, I feel the thrill of it....And yet: do I actually want to be a cunt to people? Er ... *No ? ? ?*No. I don't want to hurt people. I don't like that.But it's not a 100% no, either. The nastiness is still there. And I quite like the mischievous aspect of it. It's entertaining, both in the moment and talking about it with similarly-minded or accepting others. There are also ways I have recently discovered to enact this nasty mischief that don't actually cause people harm, but do cause considerable pleasure and thrill.Naughty Peanut....There are definitely aspects of it that I don't want. I don't want to be a dick to my partner, my family, friends or people at large. I don't like scolding or ridiculing my partner or other people. I don't want to lash out at people. I don't want to overtly demean people. I want connection. I want to see people as whole in themselves. I don't want to be controlling of others. I want to let them to exist as they choose. I want to help people more. I want to try to get along with more people. I want to be more generous (though it's quite an effort sometimes!).But again: I want connection....And yet, I do want the energy of that nasty side. I guess just without the behavioural nastiness.I'm hoping that, now I've acknowledged it and enjoyed its presence, I can keep it in mind, draw from its energy, but without the mental or behavioural degrading of others.That covert mischievous aspect seems like it could be an answer. Revelling in little non-harmful misdemeanours in private. And having a good ol' wank about it.I could be kidding myself again, but I'm hoping that can help with the reconciliation and integration.I'm nervous posting this.Not so much about the title, but about whether I've been able to explain my experience effectively....I've been on this path of trying to be more honest with myself, allowing parts of my psyche to be acknowledged and felt, so I can be authentic to myself at the very least.It's not a new thing. It's been going on for a while, this trying to peel back the layers.When I access some hidden or shunned part of me, there is a burst of energy that feels amazing. A real high. It's also psychologically wonderful to acknowledge and accept and even celebrate parts of me that I previously felt ashamed of. Then it settles and becomes a part of me that I accept and recognise as an element of 'me'. It's something I've been doing this year more and more....Today, with a new zeal for this process, I felt a part come forward that I've been scared of, and written about elsewhere. I've always tried to shut it down. But today I was ready to allow it in.It was interesting to feel it come forward when I was out in public. It came through in how I felt in my body and on my face. I noticed it in my thinking and feelings about myself and others.At first it was just a feeling, but I allowed it to come forward more and take centre stage. If it were a character, they would be ... dastardly, cunning, manipulative.And then I realised what was at the core of this part: a real lust for power.It reads a little inconsequential when I read that back now. But that lust, craving, yearning for power, dominance, recognition, status is an important and not small part of me.I allowed it in, allowed my thoughts to be focused on gaining and having power. The energy release that came over me was massive, like a huge sexual energy.I was walking in the street. I tilted my head back and looked to the sky like I was having an orgasm. That energy coursing right through me. It felt fucking fantastic, thinking about power....There I was in the street, and I acknowledged it to myself. I have a huge lust for power, and all the above I've described.Status. Ugh.Reputation. Drool.It's been there since I can remember. It drives my actions, even though I've tried to deny it, shut it down.But today, I said to myself that this is not just a part of me. I said: *I AM power hungry*. For someone who has been trying or pretending (to others and myself) to be the 'good guy' my whole life, this is a huge step. It felt massive.I dived back into that part of me. I had thoughts of manipulating people to gain status, a good reputation, recognition etc ... Wow! What a turn on!I thought of how people in my life give me compliments for my work. Something so small. But again: that quite sexually charged rush as I realise what I'm in it for. That feeling of being on top.Admired.Revered.Ugh. Drool. DROOL!!!!!Literally cum in my pants....Whenever I felt this part of me before, I was scared what I would do with this drive for power at the helm. Would I hurt people?Would I want to hurt people to gain power?Maybe this sounds ridiculous to you reading this. I guess I'm condensing quite a lot of work and experience into short paragraphs. But ... I did a test. I walked passed a few people and noticed how my body reacted. I usually feel small physical urges pretty well. I was curious to see if an urge to hurt people would come through with this part of me being more dominant.But ... no. Nothing.Maybe it'll be there another time and surprise me. But ... no. No urge to hurt people to gain power.Oh! Didn't see that coming.I mean, no judgement if you do actually want to hurt people. I get that others here might have that. But ... I don't.Neutral....I went to a shop. A homeless man sat outside the door. I asked him if I could buy any food for him. As we had our exchange, I observed what was happening in my mind and body. Interesting how that lust for power died down. I bought the food, gave it to him, didn't really feel that much for it. Then went back to my thoughts of power lust and having an orgasm in the street....And another thing. I thought about other people having power as well. And, oh yes: that's why I get envious. But, wait... it also just turned me on more. To be around people with that same lust as I have.WOOF!Hello r/NPD!...I also realised that this lust secretly drives my behaviours: in my work, in my relationships. Oh ... I'll be nice, if I get the power out of it.And oh, I'll work hard and do well for others, for the recognition.But also true is that in the moment of working with others, I don't actually feel that power drive, that yearning for grandiosity. I work one-to-one to help people feel good and be creative. My focus is on them in the room for the most part.But I tell where that lust for power comes out: between sessions. That's when I self-aggrandise about how brilliant I am and have been. Or when, as I said, I get compliments....The do-gooding part feeds the power-hungry part.The power-hungry part drives the actual do-gooding....But also ... I realised and felt inside that when it comes to it, when the chips are down ... I'll ignore or dismiss my power craving and do the right thing for people.Interesting.The fear of this part of me dissipates. Just something to enjoy....It doesn't even make me feel that relieved. It's just how it is. Neutral....PEANUT (wants all the) POWER.So obvious.At least now I know.BUT ...What?Both power-hungry AND ok to share with others.WHAT?...I deny some of my thoughts and feelings to even myself. I'm trying not to. That's a big task for me. Here I am, trying.I'm trying to be whole.I want to go further along this path, to see all the different parts of me and accept them. But I'm scared....Sometimes I feel I present to myself and the world that I am this pure-hearted, clean-thinking guy.And I do feel love. Not for everyone. Maybe ultimately only really for my partner. I'm scared that he'll die and then I'll have no one who I actually love.I have thought that I would probably kill myself if he died.DRAMAS!But true: I have thought about it....I am happy-go-lucky and bouncy in my presentation in public.But that's not all that's going on.I'm incredibly self-obsessed and selfish, and can be quite vicious underneath. That's what I hide from people. I hide from myself as well.Is it that I aim to get along with people in my life, but that's about it?The feeling of power is intoxicating for me. Any kind of power.I write my chirpy emails to my clients, thank my colleagues for their help. I maintain that connection. Appearing all cheerful and like I care.But I also sense this other, exciting part of me that wants them to like me so I can dominate and be on top. Shine. Be brilliant. Own the room. Just dominate. Ooof. It's definitely there. And it's not a nice part of me.It's actually quite a nasty side. Sneering. Judgemental. Using people. Manipulative. I've been scared of this part of me all my life. Is this the real me, after all?FUCK!!!!!It is a real part of me, for sure. I feel it.I worry about what would happen if this part of me took over.I worry about what I could or would do, without a care.The darkest part of my humanity....Is it possible to be so cheerful and nice and enjoy connections, and yet on the other side be so damn ... black hearted?FUCK!....Do I actually like people at all? Anyone?Thinking about it ... Yes. I actually do. I do. Thank God. Thinking about people I know. I do. I feel it. Thank fuck. It feels like a relief to feel those nice feelings about people.Phew ... Sigh ... But it's like I'm clinging onto the edge of a cliff here. Holding onto the good.Desperate not to fall. In case......That nasty side of me. The side that gives me a great feeling of energy and power.Dare I say it, but it's actually an evil side to me....A colleague just came into the room as I typed this.I chatted with her. Her presence felt warm and kind. I enjoyed being with her. I felt equal. I felt connected. Oh thank God. There it is again: that nice feeling. I AM OKAY!!!...Am I deceiving myself for even thinking that I have this 'dark side'? No. It's there. He's there. That flavour of Peanut.Charged with energy. Evil glint in the eye....I have had this idea that my contrasting sides could somehow integrate, blend.I say, sometimes, that some mid-point between dark and light is this cheeky wanker middle man: a cunt with a heart. 🌈...I dunno. Another colleague just came up.I liked being with him. We chatted. It felt natural. Easy.No cheeky wanker....Or maybe I was just mirroring him. ... Ugh.My mind.Who the fuck am I?...Why do I have these thoughts? Is this NPD or another issue?What? Just generally: what? How? Who? ...Who's deceiving who?Am I deceiving you all here? Sometimes. I'm trying not to....Does anyone have a clue about any of this?. Are your narcissistic traits constant or do they glitch on and off?In my work as a piano teacher, I find my narcissism is often out of the picture. In that moment with students, I do devote most of my energies to the person, or to managing my own emotions and wellbeing so I can show up and be present for them in a healthy way.Outside of that context, I can be a right narcissistic silly cunty twat. Mostly covert. Mostly. But again, not always. It's interesting how different situations ignite my narcissism, while others don't.Enough about me. When are you narcissistic and when are you not?What is it that brings out your narcissistic defences? What triggers you?Or ... Are you narcissistic all the time?. I'm knackered as I write this.I'm so tired. Work. Over work. I do that. Physically shattered. Mentally barely here right now.I read some bit of Schema Therapy research that connected proneness to fatigue and burnout with the Unrelenting Standards schema. I have this schema. It's common for people with NPD, apparently.I have sort of burned out a few times in adulthood for sure. Anyone else?Very high standards. Rigid expectations. Perfectionism. Of course. Of course.The drive to be on top. The best. Harder. Faster. Better.Drive. Drive. Drive.Do you relate?///I had a really hard day, work-wise. Physically demanding. I felt dizzy from the stress. But I also thought: "Hey, at least I'll be burning loads of calories and will therefore look good whilst fainting."I hated today, but also found solace and joy in pushing myself.Feeling that I'm on top of everything and pushing hard gives me a bit of a thrill.Feeling that I look good whilst doing the work gives me a boost of energy.Do you get that?///Of course, I'm also working to tame this side of me. A calm breath. A stroll instead of a walk. A break instead of doing anything. But that underlying push to the top of my game is always there and needs managing. ///I have a thing called 'wellbeing Thursday' in order to give myself a break in the week. Thursday mornings ARE MINE! Everyone else can just fuck off (unless you're one of my narc pals). Just : No work. No non-narc friends in cafes because I happen to be free. Nope. I do as I please. On my own, in my narcissistic pleasure dome for one. Thank you Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday, and Good Night.Oh my god.I realised a key difference in the way I treat the people I've met and made friends with here, compared to how I treat people in real life, especially my partner: Unconditional love.Unconditional love, unconditional positive regard or whatever you want to call it. I understand it to be a core emotional need that we often - in this group - didn't have met in our childhoods. Instead we were loved conditionally. And we were taught to love others conditionally. That if we do "X", we get love, or a substitute for love: praise or attention. Something like that.Is it total, 100% unconditional love and positive regard I have for my sub friends? No. It's not perfect. But ... the tendency is there. The habit. The inclination to turn that on rather than block it out and judge. A part of me does judge. But I can shift to overcome that. See passed that.I wonder if it is this that in part lays the foundation for the strong connection I have for people from here. That I had with Nick.I notice I very much try to be much more accepting, seeing potential dissonances, flaws or faults as collective or shared, and which have a context: the wounds we have from the past. I notice my tendency to forgive aspects of behaviour that don't gel with me, letting them go, seeing even antisocial behaviours as the manifestation of coping mechanisms built up from early-on to manage those wounds. Survival tools. I also notice that I listen to them, that I take their advice or even their criticisms on the chin and reflect on them. Not 100% perfectly, but much, much more easily than with people I know in my every day world and definitely with my partner....I had a disagreement with him just now going to the train station. We were on the verge of shifting into an argument. Well I was.I noticed that I was judging him. Of course. I do that. And I placed so many conditions on showing him love, feeling love for him. I do that too.He needs to lose weight. He needs to not drink so much. He needs to do as I would, essentially. Something Few said in an earlier comment about treating people as extensions of myself. It resonated and I related it to how I treat my partner. I am controlling. I am irritated by his actions that don't fit with me.We had our disagreement and I did my usual thing of calmly yet precisely cutting him down. Well done me. He's not perfect. He cuts me down too. But that doesn't stop me from wanting and trying to change for the better, for our relationship as a whole. I saw that he was hurt, though he didn't want to admit it.Then I managed to wonder, "What would I feel and how would I act if this was Nick, or someone else I am close with on the sub?" The motley crew / cast of the NPD version of Friends.I would show them that unconditional love. I would see passed the difficult or antagonistic behaviour, the controlling tendencies or the outbursts. I would see the wounds from before we met. I would tune into them and try to understand things from their perspective. And I would get there much more easily. For the first time, really, I saw my partner as a raw, wounded individual - I'd now say he's very likely NPD but far from self awareness. I saw his his difficult behaviours as the only way to survive that he knew.I turned to him and said, "You might not believe this, but over time, I've grown to love you more. And I just now saw you and loved you in a very new way."I stood there on the platform, looking at him and felt that zing of comnection in my chest, which is so easily blocked out. It surprised me. I noticed that I hadn't felt it like this before. Not really that much.(Then our train pulled in and I caught my reflection in the reflection and thought, "Oo. And... I'm also hot right now." Yay!)...I realised that I really could do with treating my partner - and other people in my life like someone from our little community: with empathy and compassion. Unconditionally. Or more so.Because he is wounded like the rest of us. ...I'm honestly proud of myself for this insight, and yes I'm sharing it here because of my pride. It's also to document for myself for future reference. A reminder of what matters.Nick would have said, "I'm proud of you, man." I would cringe when he said it. I would block myself from feeling his affection and care. I should have let that care in back then. I want to let it in now.I have received a great deal of very helpful support since Nick's death. I'm not the only one who needs it, but I was probably closest to him out of everyone I know here. So I greatly appreciate it. I have been with friends in real life, and we have had our laughs and good times. They have also given me hugs and space to be as I need. But on my own I have been blanking out, crying, distraught, very lonely, lost, depressed and shattered - confused. I'm glad I reached out for help in my lowest moment. As I wrote to Emotional_Climate, it's interesting how receiving a few kind words can have a big positive impact. You all really helped me. Thank you.💛...I don't know that Nick always felt truly supported by me. He said he did, but ... towards the end I had pulled away for such stupid and selfish reasons. I also don't know that he felt understood by me or other people. I'm not saying he suicide is all my fault in some self-centred way. But the very painful thing I've had to face is that my behaviour - my absence and lack of attunement - were at least one factor in his demise. There were many people who let him down, and I was one of them. I think that's the hard truth, no matter how small my impact was. At one point, we were so connected. It was quite unreal. We both said how special the friendship was, so ... I have to consider and understand that I failed him, and that this, in part, established the environment in which he decided the only option was to take his own life.My options going forward feel to be: kill myself, crush myself with self-flagelation as I live on, or live and try to do better. I'm choosing the latter. But I believe I need to feel the pain of the situation to do that. Some self-flagelation feels needed. I believe I need to understand where and how I let Nick down in my own way, feel the pain of that and use that to change in future. Maybe that's me trying to be heroic on some level. But I also can't just go forward and leave the pain aside, or try to. That would be to forget Nick, and I don't want to do that. It would also be to deny that I did anything wrong, and I believe that I did.The future has to be: better attunement with others, better listening, more compassion. People say that I do that, but ... I think there are others who have developed this skill much better than me. I can be so self-absorbed, I don't listen, even though I may appear to. I want to do better. I have been trying to do that in the last few days.The act of listening more and responding with compassion feels very possible. I know how to do that, I just don't always do it enough or when it really counts. It can turn off. But turning it on with sincerity feels like something I can do. But it feels somewhat complicated. I also don't want to cut out the parts of me that I think are "bad" and replace them with what is "good". Sometimess my self-centred parts are strong but I override them. But in doing so, it also feels like I'm shutting part of me off. I did that time and time again already throughout my life, and it only created a false self of "the good guy" - denying that I have these parts of me that are self-centred and even obnoxious. To deny those parts will lead to another collapse, just as I has in the past, when that false self disintegrates. Somehow I can't deny that I am, on some level, very selfish, and yet on another level, I am not.How the fuck do I reconcile that and be authentic, and still be better? Because i want that change in myself in honour of Nick. I really don't know. These parts of me feel so different, they feel hard to reconcile.Since I found out he killed himself. I don't know what else to say. A part of me feels I shouldn't being asking for help. I'm scared to, but I really need it.u/Arise23 has passed.He was my good friend from afar. We met here and had an instant connection.I quickly saw what a remarkable person he was. I saw his incredible capacity for love. He was passionate. He was articulate. He was very giving. He was a great listener and a great laugh. He was a fantastic advisor. He was brilliantly talented. I admired him a great deal. He taught me about male friendship. He helped me grow as a person - as a man. He helped me heal wounds from the past. He guided me.In the short time we knew each other, I came to love him as a brother. He told me he loved me, and I told him I loved him back. He called me 'King', and I called him 'King' in return.. It was a little joke, but it had a truth behind it. He deserved the title.We would talk for hours over the phone. I've never had that with another man before, ever. What a special person. I am shocked and devastated by his tragically early death. I wish that he had had the strength to continue living, but he wasn't able to pull through. I'm so sad.We would sometimes say to one another that it was quite remarkable that we had ever met - two people on different sides of the planet, with some real commonalities. Wow. Who would have known it, bro?I feel utterly blessed to have ever known him. I'm so glad that we met. I'm so glad he connected with me on line. What a joy to know him. What an absolute joy. That connection. Connection. Connection.It's all that matters. We had that. It was really strong.I bought a necklace with a King's Crown on it. Shining. Silver. A shield. I am already wearing it and I do so in his honour. Every time I look in the mirror - which I do often, and he totally did the same! - I will see that King's Crown.Goodbye, Nick. I will miss you very much. Irreplaceable....This sub. This sub introduced me and others to Nick, and other people like him. I'm so grateful."Goodnight King 💛" was the last thing he wrote to me...."Goodnight King 💛," I say in return.I just got a bit of abuse about being a narcissist. It included:*"in the case of you, you don’t even exist, you are a mirror, with no identity of itself, just a walking mirror, mirroring everyone to win them over, always in competition, always in the need to conquer…."*It motivated me to write about mirroring, which for me can be problematic, anxiety-inducing and distressing.Any insights are very welcome....I feel like the mirroring my brain does can be utterly automatic and all-encompassing. I wanna call it 'Deep Mirroring' because of the degree that - I think - it can affect my thinking and behaviour. An example would be:In any kind of writing - posts, comments, emails, texts - I very typically (and automatically) hear the other person's imagined voice in my head as I write, rather than my own. In fact, I struggle to hear my own voice in my head, and instead imagine 'their voice' or some voice they'd assume I have (or would like to have).To my mind, this affects how I write on a very fundamental level - word to word. Every aspect about my written communication can easily be 'what the other would say' or 'what I should sound like in order to be acceptable / cool / interesting' to them'. These are the key problematic aspects of this issue for me. It feels like I'm very, very good at mimicking other people's style of language and I do it to a very deep level. I can have email exchanges with other professionals, for example, where I can automatically mirror back their language style. I think I can sense that I'm using this to 'make myself appear more likeable or acceptable' to them, or to 'get what I want' or 'make a good impression.' A similar pattern can occur in person-to-person exchanges. Again, I can be with a string of people one-on-one, and very easily - if I don't keep it in check - be a very different person, mirroring the other in all sorts of ways in order to come across as *'the person wants me to be'.*I would go so far as to wonder if it's a form of Depersonalisation. It's like I partially dissociate and enter a kind of fantasy world where I'm just imagining 'what would they say?' / 'how would they put it?'I see this as totally connected to my childhood, by the way, where I learnt to mirror as a survival mechanism.Ironically, I'm trying to consider my words carefully here, because this topic is a key issue for me, and I want to make sure my description matches my experience....People have said to me that "this is normal" - and maybe it is, so hearing that again wouldn't be a bad thing. I understand that we adapt our language and behaviour with different people. I also know that idea that human beings are relational creatures - and so we become ourselves *between* one another. Again, it's about adapting in the moment to the context and the people we are with.However, what I find distressing is that, left unguarded, it feels like that my mirroring just takes over, and I completely lose my sense of self. So I can get to the end of a string of emails to different people, where I feel like I've just copied their tone and use of language - with a background hum of 'wanting to get ahead' or 'please people'. But not actually expressing myself as I would - only as I imagine they would from what I've heard or read from them....I've also had a therapist say that this shows that I have good empathy (and I actually can do). I also see it as functional and healthy to a degree. It's just he degree to which I do this that feels dysfunctional. It causes me distress because I want to have a sense of what I sound like, or how I would behave...,Some Good News:Things have improved over the years. I feel I am much more myself than I used to be. But it's still something I work on every day.One way I do this is to force myself to imagine myself speaking as I type. It takes effort for me to do this, but I find the results to be more authentic. I look back and read my writing and think, "Yeah, that's how I would say it." It feels comforting and even relaxing to feel that I've written in my 'own voice' rather than someone else's.\[ I added the bit on the end of the title to demo and practice how I speak, by the by. \]Also, in real life, I have worked a lot on not mirroring people in order to just fit in and get their approval. Instead, I am trying to speak more from how I feel or what I'm thinking. Being the vain twat that I am, this can be problematic in some situations. But even if it's inappropriate (i.e. self-sabotaging) to speak out loud what I'm thinking or feeling, I am trying to at least note what's going on inside to myself, so I can feel I'm being authentic to me even if it's not possible to do so with others in that moment.So, it's got a lot better. Thank fuck! But it's still something I struggle with....I'm all ears if anyone feels this is total crap, and I'm obsessing about nothing. Having said that, it does feel like an issue for me, and it causes me distress. Again, it's like I can almost Depersonalise and obliterate my sense of self through my communication and how I interact.All thoughts welcome. Thank you.I really can devalue my partner in my mind. I don't want that. It can also come across in my demeanour and tone of voice.It's sad. I'm trying to fight it.To other people, I can be super charming and good to be around. Friendly.I like me when I'm in those more public situations.Why aren't I like that at home?I want my partner to see that person I am to others. But he sees much more of the moody, controlling, scolding, patronising sides of me. Classic.Overall, he's a good guy and deserves much better from me. I love him. Actually, I can really adore him when I grt out of my own way. He has his big issues ... but ... he still has many more plus sides. Incredibly generous. Very entertaining and playful. Very cuddly. Argh. Narcs. Why do we always behave like twats to people closest to us? Life is short. I just want to be more happy.I am trying to confront my negative thoughts and actions. It's been an ongoing process for many years. I could still do better.I want my partner to know the friendly me more often.Or how do you regard that 'old you' before you realised / accepted your narcissism or NPD?Or maybe if you met that person today, how do you think you'd feel meeting them or being around them?What emotions come up for you when you think about that younger, unaware You?. How to you manage your anger or rage so you don't lash out at people when they are annoying or irritating to you?. How do you help yourself feel better, get into a better place?I just want to put addictive behaviour aside a moment, and any leap into grandiosity as a means of escaping. I mean ... what actually helps you get into a more calm, level-headed, steadier, non-reactive, connected mindset? That might even benefit you in the longer-term?What are the resources that support your wellbeing?. I am trying to keep my trauma in mind and body rather than push it away or forget it through all the distractions I do, all the ways I try to escape. The glossy image. The goals. The order.I woke up stressed and anxious today for no real reason. I started crying in bed. I just tried to stay with myself as the feelings were there. It was painful. Like flu, except I don't have flu. I thought it would be good to try to just stay with it and say, "It's ok to be here" rather than even try to soothe.I came downstairs and splurged in a DM to an NPD pal. The sadness was there and I cried as I wrote.I closed the laptop and did a workout. Lol.My partner woke up and call 'Hello!' from upstairs. He immediately detected the sadness in my response. "Are you down?" he said. Rather than just flipping into "Everything's fine!!!" mode, I said, "It's just my trauma stuff coming up."He called back down, offering to go and kill my Mum and Dad as a joke.He went to the bathroom and I noticed I started getting very anxious, fearful. My mind started tripping out. I realised that it was because I wanted to open up to him, but I was fearful of his response. I traced this back to what I received from my Mum when I opened up to her. Ridicule. Dismissal. Shut down. Rejection. Or my Father: well ... nothing because I could never consider talking to him about my feelings with him.That template of fear is there in my mind when I think about opening up. I will be "too much". I will be told to "get over it". I will be told to "stop myself from going too far". I will be told that I am "full of woe". I will be told that I "should be happy". My partner came downstairs and sat on the sofa with the coffee I made him. I told him I didn't want to be a burden, but that I wanted to be real about what was going on, rather than try to run away from it.He listened to me as I spoke about the issues I have with trauma, and he was very supportive in what he said. The relief was visceral. I thanked him. I was still tearful. To have that inner child meet the support that he never got in my childhood ... That's what that part of me needs.He asked me if I would feel better once my parents were dead. And I said, "Yes." He was very accepting of that.He did then say something like, "But I don't understand why you can't just say that your parents were idiots and move on." This brought up anger in me that made me feel unsteady. However, I contained it and said that it was like there were two levels to this. One was to think intellectually: Yes, my parents treated me badly. I am an adult now. I know different. I don't believe their messages. The other was the trauma itself: the disruption to my whole nervous system that is a total mind-body experience. The physical rush of fear. The intrusive and terrifying imagery that clouds my thinking. The urge to run out of the room, while at the same time being in lots of social situations where I feel that isn't an option, nor is actually telling people that this is going on. He was understanding and supportive again. I was a little bit like, "Yes. I didn't rage."I talked to him about narcissism as a coping mechanism for my trauma. I talked to him about finding solace and comfort and emotional regulation in the mirror as an example. Or in my appearance, or in my work. He was accepting and listened.Somehow we got onto my Mum's difficult behaviours, which are more the classic 'covert' type that I used to be. He criticised her behaviour, but I said that basically it was like what I was. "Remember when we went to the States with Jackie and Sharon? Do you remember in how much of a funk I was all the way through the trip?" ... "Yes. You were really hard to be with." ... "I was just very sullen a lot of the time." ... That's where my Mum can be. Pulling people down. That was me.My partner talked about there being a rock in the road, and at some point, you have to go around it and forget that it's there.I realised that I was diving a little bit into self-pity, self-obsession in the discussion, which I was actually enjoying. So I said, as a way of pulling myself out of it, "Yes. And I s'pose I can get stuck at that rock and stay there. But also ... running away and trying to forget it hasn't helped me either. ... There needs to be a middle ground where I keep it in mind but also go forward." You know, like: keep it in the rear view mirror.I said, "I think going forward, I just need to be able to say to you: 'My trauma issues are coming up. So if I act a little weird - especially in social settings - please know that I am trying my best. This is very hard to deal with, but I am trying my best." This is in regard to him often sensing that something is up with me, but trying to put it in a box when around other people. I guess because - in part - I had that tendency to pull everyone down. There are other reasons as well, but that's a fair guess in part as to why he does this. Anyway. He accepted this. In social situations, I often float off for a while to just sit on the toilet and re-centre myself for 5 minutes. Or try to. We had a friend round last night, and this happened again. The same cycle: she arrives. I feel really good to be in her warm-hearted company. After about 20 minutes, I start decaying. I can't keep up the facade. Or I try to, but underneath is a whirlwind. Total chaos. I cling to my seat.She knows about my NPD, and has been good with that. I mentioned to her a little bit that there was stuff going on last night, but it wasn't really the right situation to go further. So it was horrible. My mind shattered. I held onto the broken pieces.This morning she sent me the usual "Thank you" message. I wrote back and told her that I wasn't in a good place at all, that it wasn't her fault, but that it comes from 'nowhere'. I told her not to feel guilty, but that I just needed to now say that I struggle. I said I didn't want to hide from it anymore, as much as I can.Sorry, post-splurge. A lot has come up today. I put everything aside for once and lay in bed - not actually having a wank! - but actually dealing with my emotions....Since self-awareness, I have been actively searching for ways to integrate the narcissistic, king-wannabe side of me into my character. I had previously tried shutting or cutting him out. Or obliterating him from view. Over and over. But he remained. And would poke through in clumsy ways despite my attempts to appear "normal". Stable. But as I got to know this part inside, it turns out ... I quite like him. He's funny. So gradually, I've wanted to let him in and out to other people in appropriate ways. Not that I'm being openly superior. Actually, that part has really dwindled in my conscious mind (still there subconsciously). But it's more of the attention-seeking, competitive, self-interested, show-off side. Finding ways to reveal all that to people around me rather than the "Look! I'm The Healthiest Person Ever Promise!" face that I had been wearing. Humour has helped, by the way. I don't want to forget that wannabe-king in me. I can't. So last week, I bought a necklace online with a king's crown pendant. A silver disc with a little roughly-drawn crown in the middle. It's cartoonistic and childlike in design. Medallion-like. Small but perfect. Kind of Warrior-Viking in style. A tiny shield. I like symbols as reminders of things. I wanted to have something round my neck that reminded me of that side of me, rather than be ashamed of it, or forget it.It arrived today, a short while after that terrible distress came up in me.I looked at it and thought, "How can I wear this now? I feel the opposite. This is silly."...As the terrorised part of me relaxed, I was able to talk with another NPD friend. I related that I'd realised that while I was making headway in integrating my more narcissistic side, perhaps I wasn't doing so well with that traumatised part of me. The broken part. Sometimes after a PTSD moment, it's like I'm a broken soldier. Do you ever feel like that? Shattered? I look in the mirror and I look shattered. Tired. Raw.He too has kept on poking through the veneer despite my attempts to block him out - which include those King of the Castle behaviours.I had this feeling that I needed to be in touch with that traumatised, broken part of me, much more than I have been. That there needed to be integration of both the narc and the trauma. And maybe - if I can keep in touch with them and bring them on board to inform my day to day life - they wouldn't erupt in the ways they have been.But how to integrate these parts? They are so different. The king just LOVES to be in his castle. And the pain of that trauma is so intense....A little voice called out to me saying, 'Don't forget me! You keep forgetting me.' ... I will add that I did some psychodrama exercises in workshops and we had done a thing that was intended to get in touch with that forgotten child in us. That was earlier this year I did that.Laying in bed, I looked at that necklace pendant again. Childlike. Rough. Simple. Shiny. Mirror-Like.I had this idea that I could wear it after all, and that it could be helpful. I put it around my neck and it fell on my chest. I looked in the mirror and saw myself: that broken boy who wanted to be king.Actually, I needed it. Because of the trauma. No, it wasn't the best way to cope. But it was the way I coped as a child, and it spilled over into adulthood.It's like that little child imagined a crown to distract from the torment of a very early and unhealable trauma, which he (I) cannot remember because it happened too early. There were many other traumas that are remembered easily. But that early distress. ... Only terrifying feelings and flashes in the mind. It was too much to bear. Absolute shame. So the child sought out anything he could to confirm to him that he was in fact good, able and whole. Stable. Strong. On his journey to his imagined destiny as king he was Prince Charming, he was the Solider, he was the Wizard (at the piano), he was the Tyrant, he was the Grandiose Lover ... He had his whole castle built around him, including a dungeon where he sometimes could hear screams but shut them out. He had his minstrels to entertain him. He had his Joker. He had his Merlin. (Thank God for Merlin. The ultimate Healthy Adult). And he had his demons, who haunted him, tortured him at night.That's me. I'm looking in the mirror right now, and that's who I see: the broken boy who wanted to be king.And this is me in the aftermath. When the castle crumbled.It's raining heavily outside....Broken. Charming. Competitive. Embarrassed. Witty. Terrified. Haunted. Attention-Seeking. Easily Enraged. Insightful (thanks, [Merlin](https://www.reddit.com/user/Elongated_Mayonnaise/)). Stupid. Warrior-like. Fragile. ... I could go on.I think - I hope - this pendant could do a good job in helping me remind myself of all those parts. I want to remember it all.&#x200B;. I feel he saw me as weak, feeble, effeminate, less than he wanted from a son. Not what he'd hoped for.True or not, that is what I felt as a child and teen. And adult.As a child, I saw my body in the mirror and I wanted it to change. Be better. I wanted the "effeminate parts" to be sliced off and trimmed down. Tucked away. Strapped down. I wanted to be more masculine in my appearance. As an adult, I've gone to great lengths to give the impression to my father that I'm in control and strong. Able. Fine. A man....I see myself through his eyes. I'm constantly propping up the appearance that everything is ok.Lying on the bed now, I see myself in the mirror opposite. Feelings of disgust and ridicule. Aversion. And real weakness. Unloved. A frightened and lonely child.Too much of this. Too little of that.There is an urge to shift position and look more appealing to that part of me. But I stay.There have been little tears. I wonder if this is the right thing to do. Cry. Is that enough?..Sigh ... The thing is ... I actually also like some of those behaviours I do to appear more like my father wanted me to look, and I don't really want to give them up. Like. working out and having a masculine figure. I like it. I know that it's caught up in misperception, but I don't want to stop it.It's confusing. I don't quite know how to reconcile the misperception and the enjoyable behaviour.. Because underneath the glossy veneer, and looking like I've got everything sorted, is a feeling of distress in my body that feels so intense and all-encompassing, has overwhelmed me many times before, and I'm terrified of feeling it again. It feels like everything is going to fall apart.*Checks mirror.*Edit: The distress appeared again. It is like my whole world falling apart. Images of my mother shouting at me, chaotically. Right up in my face. In my ears. Screaming at me. Or running wild int he house. Or in distress herself. Fighting my father. He laughs. She screams. It feels like everything is going to shatter. The imagery is intense and for a split second I feel that it could be real. I see my Mum dead on the bed or on the floor. Again and again I have this. This is the distress.. I was talking with a friend of mine about vulnerability and NPD. I noticed a thing I do in writing posts here where I craft them- semi-subconsciously - so I can't let people in. It's like: quasi-vulnerability. It's there, but behind a shiny glass wall that I also put up as a distraction. To counteract that, I thought I'd just post the message I sent them and see what comes up - or not.&#x200B;Oh God... Exposure!&#x200B;"Hey... I'm thinking just now about what you said about not liking being vulnerable. Well ... I have my own expression of this. I noticed that when I post, I tell myself that I'm 'being vulnerable'. And in part, I do think I share vulnerabilities. But ... I present it in a way that is quite closed off. It's like I introduce the vulnerability I notice in myself, and then use the post to work through it and find some resolution. This has a few functions. I sort myself out BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS IN THERE AND SAYS SOMETHING ANNOYING THAT I ALREADY KNOW! It's also got that function of 'being impressive' and 'heroic' and a 'leader'. Lol.The idea that I might write a post that is totally vulnerable and leaves it open for question and confrontation - even discussion apart from 'Well done, Peanut! I love you!' feels ... like something I don't want to do! Lol. But ... I notice, too, that in the posts I make where I don't close it off so much, there is much more interaction with people I don't usually hear from, and the discussions are helpful and interesting, and there's more connection - which I also want.So ... something to think about and work on.". My partner and I went to the theatre last night to see La Cage Aux Folles.It's basically a show about gays and drag queens. Lol. That's my summary. I've seen it about 4 million times.The audience was noticeably a load of ol' gay men - including us. (It happens at these kinds of shows. All the gays come out for our catwalk.)...**INTERVAL**The men had to queue for the loo. Usually that's something the ladies roll their eyes over while we toddle by with a smug little dance.But with all the lads out for the show, it was like queuing for the Gents at a gay bar. 😁Standing in that queue (we Brits love a queue), half-eyeing-up the oversized beards, muscles and flowery shirts around me, I felt really comfortable. Like being held. Safe. A feeling of belonging.I like being part of this group....Gay men are funny creatures. It's interesting from an NPD angle.There's a kind of narcissism that's normalised, okay and even celebrated as part of 'gay culture'. You can call is body fascism etc. But it doesn't have to be taken so seriously. There's a playful vanity, grandiosity, a cheeky bitchiness, hierarchical thinking, and a constant hum of flirtation and potential for sex. A lot of it can be wrapped up in a naughty humour and glint in the eye. Last weekend we went to a housewarming of a female friend. She has loads of gay male friends, and at one point in the garden, it was just us lot chatting like gay men do. It's different. It's fun. It's flirty. I like it.And the same thing happened. I felt a sense of belonging and okayness. I relaxed. I felt I could be more myself. I discovered myself, in fact.I don't actually have many other gay friends in my life, so it felt refreshing....There's a layer of shame you grow up with as a homosexual lad. I'm 40, so it might be better now in the UK. But in 90s rural Essex, it wasn't what you needed to be to survive.Once when I was about six (?), I sprung into the kitchen wearing a purple beret tilted to the side. I was beaming with a smile, wanting to show my Mum and Dad my little dance.They were both sitting at the kitchen table. My Dad didn't say anything but looked stern. My Mum scolded at me: "Take that beret off! Other people will think you are queer!"I removed my hat and my little self from the kitchen....The shame sticks around.It forms the near-invisible template in your psyche, reminding you how to behave and what to expect from people if you are 'yourself'. You are so used to it, you don't even notice it's there.It affects relationships. My partner, now 49, is still uneasy about us touching each other at all in public, even in central London. It makes me sad, but I understand it and respect it. I still go to cuddle him. He pulls away saying, 'No! You don't know how people will behave here. We could be beaten up!" 💛Hidden shame is probably the reason why I don't have many gay friends, actually. My parents' voices very subtly steering me away from being associated with gay men.It's there in how you hold yourself, how you feel inside as you meet with others. It is the driver behind the reflection-checking as you walk down the street. Without it, you don't feel the urge to check so much.It's there in how I am around other men, whom I had a fear of when I was younger. It's because I experienced so much belittling and abuse from straight men in the past. So I expect them to recoil and look down on me. Expect me to do and be less-than. Or threaten me. Or actually beat me up.(Fuck you, Matthew Parkinson, you fat, lowlife cunt.)...Looking around the theatre audience last night and watching the show, I felt a kind of pride. It's really just a kind of 'okayness' and ease in my body and mind. Actually, it's also a kind of joy for being who I am.It was cool to be part of all the over-groomed beards, cheeky side-glances, unnecessarily large biceps, and over-thought shirt n' socks combos.Yeah. This is me....This morning, I did my workout in front of the mirror as usual. 😁 Headphones on. [The Best of Times](https://youtu.be/vUqiM4c1oWA). The most famous song from 'La Cage' is 'I Am What I Am'. It was performed so brilliantly last night. Lost of people cried. The lyrics fit really well here, in this sub.But The Best of Times is my favourite.Fuck it!&#x200B;*The best of times is now,**What's left of summer but a faded rose?**The best of times is now,**As for tomorrow well: Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?*&#x200B;*So hold this moment fast,**And live and love as long as you know how.**And make this moment last,**Because the best of times is now.*&#x200B;I lifted my weights (upped two 2kgs yesterday, woop-woop!). I lip-synced along to the song on repeat. I did some super jazz hands. I enjoyed my cheeky grin.I imagined my little self dancing with me with his little purple beret. I showed him how to move. I let him free in my mind. He was happy. I was the parent he didn't have. He needed. A bit of [imagery rescripting](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental-Health-Professionals/Sleep/Sleep---Information-Sheets/Sleep-Information-Sheet---06---Imagery-Rescripting.pdf) there. A few little tears came up as the song played again.I'm proud of that little boy with his special dance. No shame....I need more gay men in my life. We all do....I love this [comedy sketch](https://youtu.be/cOESpIz8Mjg), by the by. From Catherine Tate. She's not Irish, but does a great accent, and impression.Chuckle....I know I'm talking about being a gay man. But I hope some things can translate and find their own usefulness to anyone with NPD.It's that experience of being shamed for who we are, of hiding and pretending to survive. Or that inner critic that haunts us like a shimmering ghost, lurking in the corner of our eye.And the joy is re-discovering our selves and being comfortable in who we are, despite what we were taught, and whoever we may be.You know, the rainbow flag is an amazing thing: 🏳️‍🌈. People keep saying "collapse" and I'm like, "What?" ... "You simply mean depression. Sadness."But today: I get it.With NPD in charge, everything is done just to prop up the self away from what is painful - or void - underneath.Today that sugar-crystal dome completely collapsed and I am in the under....OK, Narc OverLord: I get it. Lesson learned. ⛈⚡🌩The distance between the shell and the core is too great. The balloon is too big. Its skin is too thin.Pop....Looking back, my house of cards has gotten too big many times. It has collapsed often. The worst was in my early-mid 30s. I told myself I would be incredibly successful after studying at a prestigious college. Guaranteed. Genius.I wasn't. I put my whole self in that basket. When the ship didn't come in, I wanted to jump off the pier....Today isn't like that. But I see again how I have been propping myself up recently with my twigs and spit, thinking they were cast iron and concrete.Well, the wind blew in and knocked my scaffold over.I also see how I so want to prop up that scaffold again rather than deal with the dodgy foundations and structure.Dear OverLord of the Narcs (aka u/MudVoidSpark), What is my next lesson? I am listening.🌩⚡⛈. It's coming up to about a year since I started finally accepting my narcissism (having been in denial for a couple of years before), leading to then getting an NPD diagnosis / confirmation from a specialist.Quite a journey. Luckily it's involved a lot of self-reflection, otherwise it would've been boring!It's like the ground underneath completely broke open (drama!) and I went through a kind of self-reconfiguration: a breakdown of the persona I had built up for so long, coupled with a poking-through and eruption of all these different aspects of myself that I'd hidden away.It was initially - and for a long while - disturbing. A lot to handle psychologically. "What is this in me? ... Is this real or fake? ... Who the fuck am I?" ... My mind felt like it was in pieces.But (more drama!) I ploughed on through the oncoming winds.Gradually, a more stable sense of self has emerged: certain sides of me keep popping up again and again, more spontaneously, it seems, without clear reference to others so much. I also notice that in conversations, I feel increasingly like a separate person from others, in the way I talk, write or present myself, interests and ideas, opinions. Other people have their moves. I have mine. Yes, there is some merging and blurring, but we are quite different. I'm not trying to br like them or the way think they want me to be. I don't feel so much of the urge to mirror as I did. I feel I have some kind of self to fall back on when I get disrupted. He keeps re-appearing. And I've found myself more assertive, looking people in the eye when I want to speak about something (usually involving some Powerpoint about Schema Therapy)....I'm about to go on a Skype call with my Dad, who lives in another country. I spent my whole life pretty much being a yes-sir, no-sir, three-bags-full-sir kind of son. I would present myself in the way I thought my Dad wanted me to look, talk and behave - even think. ... I did that habitually from a young age as a way of coping with my Dad's terrific temper that could turn on like a switch; his threats of violence - or actual violence.Today, just before the call, I thought: "What a good opportunity to show up as myself."It's not as sudden a shift as I'm making it: I've been showing up more and more, I think, as different from the son I've assumed he wanted me to be. But today: I feel confident to turn up and be as I am, disagree with him ... Just not turn into that smiling face hiding a whirlwind of difficult emotions underneath. I don't feel I have to do that any more.So we met up. I can say he is remarkably brave, emotionally intelligent and articulate in expressing his feelings.I think he's gonna be just fine. Especially if he listens to the incredible advice from old blokes like me. 😁But watch out. Not so fast! u/moldbellchains can smell the grandiosity from down the road, fellas! Fuck!!!Yep, that's not Dior whateveritis, that's me!But he took a pin and popped my self-inflated ego-bubble when it showed up, and in such a healthy and considered way. He stood up for his feelings when they were being pushed aside by my emotional bulldozer mode, and got me thinking anew how grandiosity can have a negative impact on people....There were actual tears, and it was super. Human. A wonderful moment.We had a real connection. And when the moment felt right, we sat on a bench and had a very long hug.A hug that extends to everyone.
    It funny how some really sensitive insecure a*****Literally have a problem with everything that I do!But it feels good to piss them off with just my existence, hahahah ! Can you relate?. Every day I take a deep breath and sigh! Feels like life isn't worth living! I have wasted all my life in nothing but bullshit! I don't know but, if I die one day, my life will be full of regrets. 😔. 😔. Borderlines literally wrecked my whole life! They sabotaged my friendship with others!. I am a covert narcissist which means that I have both avpd and npd. Can anyone relate 🥺. Ok only a true narc will understand this.!!!. I have a so called friend who once had bpd. And I happen to be her only friend right now at our workplace. She doesn't let me talk to pretty much anyone. If she sees me with someone she would come in between intruding us. She literally wants me to follow her everywhere. She also starts telling me opinions of others and asks me to stay away from them and would get so jealous when I talk to others. That why I'm slowly starting to lose friends in the work place. How do I handle this situation without angrying her ( bpd). It's so hard to be confident around some people, it just feels like you are trying so hard to bring that ideal self in front of them but can't, as if you have been paralysed. This drives me crazy. Does this happen to you too? If yes, then in what circumstance?. Does this happen to you that you sometimes utter what ever that comes to your mind as if you have no control of what you are saying and there is a gush of euphoria which makes you say some things which makes you regret later. I know that many people think that a narcissist cannot love or feel emotions. All these years we have been portrayed as someone bad, ruthless. But deep down we all still believe that we have some amount of goodness left inside us. We are naive souls. We are just a reflection of what our society does to us. We never would want to hurt anyone unless we have had enough! We are almost like anyone else or even better.Nothing seems to interest me anymore but a sense of validation from certain group of people. These neurotic traits that we coverts are high in, really do get in the way. I have my own mental breakdown. I ruminate, worry, and simply hate the way I perceive things. Zero tolerance to stress and anxiety,Irritability, Ineffective functioning, shame! I'm sick of all this.I highly disagree when people say that we are putting a mask on or that we are fake. I agree that we are two different people one in public and one in private but we never do that consciously we are who we are!. I don’t know if really am a narcissist or just like any individual with anxiety .because there is narcissm in every one .I know for a fact that I have had mental health issues all my life but not to the extent where it was so serious.sometimes I wonder if what I feel is universal or it’s just restricted to people with npd.I have always denied wanting something I wanted so badly because if was afraid of losing it. I feel like this denial makes me feel like I control stuff. I have had enough in life and now I came to the point where I realised that fear is for those who have something to lose. And I know for a narc our fear is what that controls us . And at times I come to a point where I feel like letting this fear go make me feel like I’m setting myself free.Now I am able to understand how people misunderstood us all these year they accuse of manipulation that which we ourselves are not aware of, they accuse us of love bombing but all we do is try to be nice. They accuse us of being insensitive but we never try to intentionally hurt anyone.they accuse us of being immature childish.They accuse us of being monsters but little do they know that they are the ones who created us.We are basically children who are stuck between 10 -12 years of age and we are no less that any other human being. All these years we have been labeled as the monsters that we are not.All these years i was in an assumption that what ever I have done or felt is normal and common and everyone must have gone through that in some part of their lives but now i came to realise is that I’m different, the way i react, the way i interact, why I interact , why I never live in the moment, why I never am happy or satisfied with anything, why I always feel like there is a void inside me,why i never could’nt live the life I wanted And how my anxiety took over my entire life and how I have lost pleasure in anything that I do and feel like a lonely soul.why I have my rage spirals.
    I‘m a covert narcissist and in therapy for six years now. My co-founder is most likely an overt narcissist. He is grandiose, he is the best, thats what he pretends to be - but most of the time he devaulues people with little but permanent criticism. So little that you don‘t even notice until you feel bad and used and guilty. After some days off I felt really good. Returning to work today and working with him it feels like I‘m poisened. Guess that he triggers my inner mother, as she did the same to me. Anyone here who made the same experience - working with narcissists as an (covert) narcissist?. Thanks for that community here. It helped me already a lot. Learned in a few months more than in several years of therapy. You are great guys! Special thanks to that guy who recommended the book „Letting go of Good“ from Andrea Matthew. What a breakthrough! It‘s a gift. So thankful!!!. Hi there, diagnosed covert NPD here from EU. In therapy for six years now. Thanks for all the posts here, helped me a lot! I (37M) am in a „healthy“ relationship with my girlfriend (33F) for 4 years now. She has no issues except a bit infantile behaviour. But no NPD or BAS or so. No she wanna plan a family with getting kids and getting married. Some days I feel like i really like her, some days there is a really warm feeling in me for her. Also the thought having kids is ok. Never had a relationship that was so like supporting and good. Some days NPD kicks fully in. I get lost in daydreaming about finding a better girlfriend, living a complete different life, having sex phantasies with other girls etc. Can‘t feel lasting unconditional love for her. No surprise I guess ;) Does it mean I really don‘t love her or do I love her as good as I can as a narcissist? How do you guys who are married or in a longlasting relationship that it‘s the right person for you? Do you feel really love?.
    Especially when it's more covert, because I've come across many videos of therapists saying how female narcissists usually differ from male narcissists. So I do wonder how it looks like with ASPD and which differences you see.Growing up, I wanted to be anything but like my parents, who are very narcissistic and on top of that were abusive too. And don't get me wrong, there is still a lot we don't have in common, which I am happy about. However, with time I adapted and despite me trying to be genuine, kind and just a person that most people would consider to be good, I struggle. I struggle to care about others, to not put them down, to listen to them, to respect them, to not manipulate them. Everything. All of it. And even though I actually feel pride about being highly narcissistic, part of me also despises that I am like this. Because if I don't put in a tiring amount of effort, I behave very similar to my parents.Part of me tries to be nice and have genuine friendships. However, I notice HOW stuck I'm with some patterns. For instance, I can't take any inconvenience for myself, even if it's to a normal degree of what friends to for each other. Or, what I also struggle with, is being genuinely interested in other people. Showing empathy. Giving them my attention. Not making fun of them. Not using them like tools. I'm literally trying to best at times to not do any of the latter. Sometimes I am successful, but what I still notice, is how my friends are sort of detached to me, still. And I am pretty certain that these underlying behaviors of mine at least play a relevant role in it. So that brings me back to the question: What are ya'll doing with this? Have you just lost 'hope' in true connection? Do you define connection differently? Or do you manage to have genuine friendships?. Don't know if you guys can relate, but we can find out. I've heard of public narcissists (thenamelessnarcissist, spriritnarc etc) that they also approve of this. Whenever people call me a narcissist, I feel flattered by it. I know that rationally, it's no compliment. I know that technically, it 'shouldn't' be something to be proud of. But I don't mind taking it as a compliment, since it makes me feel great and I am really proud of my narcissism. Of course there are destructive aspects to being narcissistic and I am actively working on some of them. However, I tend to view the positive sides a lot as well, because I do believe there are quite some. It's a matter of balance. Do you guys relate? Or what is your first impulse, your first reaction to being called a narcisisst?. Scrolling through this sub I've noticed once again how many people feel ashamed of their sadistic thoughts. I do find it unfortunate, considering that many sadists suffer from it despite not harming other people, due to a moral compass. I personally lack that, but I still haven't acted out, so I believe that you can learn to CHOOSE. However, so many people who actively choose not to engage in their sadistic thoughts that they haven't chosen to have are still portrayed as the devils, especially in the media. I genuinely find that unjustified, because nobody chooses to become a sadist. If seeing other people in pain arouses you, that's no choice. It's simply a choice what you create out of it. I have left all of the guilt behind, since I am quite far on my journey. So in case anyone here feels as if they're awful people due to their sadism, I am offering you to text me privately.With the rising amount of awareness regarding narcissism nowadays with partially accurate, but also inaccurate information, I am afraid. I am really afraid to be exposed, especially since some people that you'd call my friends now are useful & I'd like to continue having them in my life. Some of my friends know each other too & have contact, so if I fuck up with 1-2, the chances that my reputation will be hurt is high. It is incredibly frustrating honestly. Because I'm already putting up so much effort to be friendly, empathic & even swallow down my grandiosity often, especially when being with new people. But it still doesn't seem to be enough, because I can sense that some people already notice a bit of my 'toxic' traits. I am already trying so hard to be better, but it's a disorder for a reason & I just don't want to lose yet another chance to 1) have friends and 2) get far in life once again.Because I know some will suggest it: I know I need therapy. I know that it's inevitable. But where I live, you have to wait a year at least to start with therapy. So right now, there's not much help. So I wanted to write this here in the hope to read that some of you maybe know this and can relate to it.Obviously, you need to have some traits in your youth as well. Becoming a full blown narcissist in your adulthood is very unlikely to happen if you haven't had some tendencies before. The reason I ask this is because of my own case: I've had some narcissistic traits as a child, some more developed in my youth, but in the end of my adolescence, so practically in the beginning of my adulthood, I literally turnt into a full-blown narcissist. And it's been like that for quite some years now, impacting me in all areas of my life and in all phases of my life too. I'm just a bit surprised, because normally you'd expect these traits to unfold once you're in your (early) youth. My bpd traits definitely did back then. Narcissistic traits though followed up later, when I distanced myself from my abusive environments and became more independant. It's as if this has been me the whole time, but I just haven't had the chance to be me before.I'm asking this question because in this moment, I am going through a tough time and hearing from other similar experiences would really help.So basically, due to my past trauma and my anxiety, I couldn't stand up for myself today. Somebody disrespected me in front of a lot of people and even though a few of these people later on have told me that it truly wasn't my fault that it happened and that there's nothing wrong with me, my ego feels attacked so intensely. Because everyone saw how much it upset me and I feel humiliated and ashamed to the bones. So much, that I feel the urge to harm myself, which I am not going to do though. Have you ever due to trauma or mental conditions not performed the way you wanted, especially stood up for yourself? If so, how did you deal with it? I know, I know so well that actually, I am only a human being and I can't always behave perfectly, especially when considering my past. And yet, I can't be understanding towards myself and EXPECT me to perform. I just can't shake it off, these standards I have for myself.As people with NPD most of us - if not all - feel the need to permanently keep up a mask to the outside. I don't mean the obvious masking of empathy & that kind. More so the version of ourselves always seeming somewhat perfect, flawless and superior, that kind. Now I wonder, have any of you ever had phases in which that version/mask broke, for instance due to other mental disorders such as anxiety disorder or depression? They make me incapable of portraying that flawless version of myself to the outside at times, because I for instance lack the energy. Ever experienced that and if so, how did you solve it? It tears me apart from the inside to be honest. The way I present myself is directed towards being respected, sometimes feared. However, this shit makes it almost impossible to do so.I feel chronically empty and bored to the degree that there's barely anything that can fill it. I miss the old days where everything I did make me feel great and excited, even proud. Like there are certain moments or even days when I can take great pleasure from feeling grandiose, all that kind of stuff. But other times I just accept it & feel empty otherwise. I've quite little supply at the moment & also feel depressed. Anyone ever felt similiar and if so, what did you do to get better?. I've had the issue that I've craved admiration - which I still do obviously - but due to my bpd traits, I destroyed the possibility of receiving said admiration. Traits such as being overly sceptical of others, splitting on them, paranoia & being too clingy at times, even if parts of me scream that it makes me validate myself less. Have any of you made similar or even the same experiences?. This is a classical BPD+NPD combination for me. On the one hand I lack a stable sense of self, understanding who I am and wanting to express that stable identity to the outside (looks, behavior etc). On the other hand NPD makes me feel very aggressive when I can't do that, because I want to be expressive, as that makes me proud and feeds my narcissism more. Not being able to do that makes me frustrated and angry honestly. Do any of you relate?. Finding a good start is actually really tough on this one. This is about NPD, but also BPD, as I expect this to be a mixture of both. I've for a large part of my life been quite distant to others. I've not met up a lot until I was an adult (which seemed a bit too late imo) and I've also for a long part of my life been relatively difficult to deal with, at least for many people (as they said). I'm selfish, cold, manipulative, arrogant, (passive) aggressive and generally lack stability in the way I interact with people. I split a lot on other people, especially when they don't behave good enough for me or behave differently towards me. Then I want to throw everyone out of my life basically, because I don't trust them a tiny bit anymore and believe they're mal intended. This is not only unpractical, as I have it way harder reaching my goals (being successful and popular), but also makes you empty inside and even lonely at times. I hate it. But I don't know how to change it, as it's deeply rooted in my personality, this unhealthy social behavior. Maybe it's also due to being depressed that I am like this atm, especially since not having any supply right now. What do you do in order to get out of a hole like this and to not make it happen in the first place - ESPECIALLY if you have BPD as well?. This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately. How big of a role shame plays in my life and how little I want to accept it. However, wanting to constantly improve myself to become the person I desire to be, I also want to face that. I noticed that I expect other people I deal with on a daily basis to treat me with the highest respect and view me as a popular, yet superior person. That regardless of how I have treated them before. If people do not treat me like that, which happens relatively frequently due to the reason of me, treating people in an exploitive manner, I feel ashamed. And on top of that, it also feels unfair, because even though I know this is not an accurate way of thinking in our society, I believe that I deserve to be treated highly regardless of how I behave towards others. So to come back to my question, how do you deal with these feelings of shame?.
    I always ask myself if I genuinely were to kill myself would i? Is this just some fake shit yk? I’ve been there. 10 years old idolising wanting to hang myself (I was just as much as me as I was then no need to cry over a child). I had the dream. But Pain hurts. It’s only nice when I want it. I’m just feeling like a faker. There are pills there are things, but I wish it’d fit when I idolise doing it ykwim? like i don’t want to die but when I do it would just make sense. I want people in my life to know I want to feel like I exist being seen by people. Drama queen right? Just want so much I always feel there’s more after death, but that fear don’t lol.I’ve said so much ik it’s annoying. My real self is here whilst my life is me trying to stay stable. But my real me is here fuck I’ll swear such a bad kid js say so much. Say so much. I’m not anything just getting it out I want to argue say stuff. Gosh real life is so fake.I even wanted to SH but that shit does NOT feel the way I wanted. bro nothing is working. Gonna get a manicure and paint my nails maybe. Get a hair clip for my wigs. Tomorrow I’ll be normal. Self destructiveness feels like me I wanted to find that security in all this madness. Imagine being sober normal being normal and “finding myself”. Cut cut cut lol (Edit: call myself a bad person because bad person = someone people won’t like. I won’t be liked so I’m bad. Otherwise why care what I do lol). Tired of myself. We can cry sure but frl. Tired of me, is there a way I can kms mentally without killing my self. Who cares yk everything troubling me all this stuff doesn’t matter. Be normal and stop being affected by stuff. Maybe being hurt a lot idc rlly it’s not a masochistic thing just like i need quiet in my head. I feel like type shuts me up so much. Just spewing stuff. Just shush yk js stop. The narrative I’ve been given by therapists etc. Is a bullied kid who became a doorstep - or I always was because of my mum not showing how I actually feel. I’m in a codependent relationship that’s the only relationship where things went bad - I mean I ghost people and avoid so much because of shame and anxiety etc. I want to self destruct!. Note: this is tagged under venting but u can say stuff. I love responses One time on another account. I blacked out from being drunk. Reddit is my say whatever I want place right? I was on r/frankocean and I blacked out typing some nonsense, that I was his cousin then it went into like a paragraph of self hatred. That’s the only time I ever lose control and it was so weird. Like that was me? I can’t even understand where this came from yk? Like it was so weird. Why would I lie like that.And the comments pitied me because I sounded so delulu which I was. But Wtf man I felt so much shame I felt sick. wtf was I trying to say? I have this thing where I just want to say stuff like it’s important (doing it now) it’s just so weird man yk? Idk Id be dying if I could articulate how I feel and verbalise my thoughts while having NPD - acting all adult ish even thought mentally I got parts of my brain that are hella underdeveloped. Idk this post is going nowhere, Take it as a pre-word diarrhoea before I leave for my sabbatical.Also i tried to confront the fear I always talk about, I’ll keep it to me. But it was a lot and now i’m safe it felt good but it didn’t then.!!!. You guys have been so helpful, making me feel seen. I literally wait looking to see any replies and they’re meaningful. But is this the way to go? I’ve started to neglect myself. Thank God the Physics test I just did went way better than I thought it would (I don’t know the results yet) but I would’ve gone into collapse. Two weeks. I need to sort out my finances, self care I haven’t showered in two days (Gross yes). I sound like a homeless crackhead I’ve just been in bed and yes I’ve lied but the shame in how gross I am is too much to bare.I’ll be back in two weeks. I only care for myself i sound like i’m treating the people who will read this like fans but it’s not malicious. I want to save myself only myself and nothing more. So I will come back in two weeks. Force myself. And maybe Idk we’ll see. I feel extreme hatred for myself we have to change I hate this it has to change.I am scared seeing you guys similar in age to me doing well, even better than me. Because know you guys are still struggling means I am just as hopeless.Accepting the bad parts of us is so fucking hard, it ruins everything. I am messed up, you probably are messed up. If only we weren’t all egocentric, maybe I’d truly find some great friends with some of you.I’m feeling a bit like I’m going crazy, it’s like dysfunction is all I know and love. The only way I identify myself and love myself - it’s like my language. Life and death morality. Dumb stuff edgy stuff idk.Why can’t I say this to my therapist?* I have a bad history with sex and pr0n like I sexualise A LOT of things which is fucking horrid not horrid like a moral high ground but horrid like it fucks me over.* I want to be like physically intimate with someone I idolise. There’s one person rn but it’s not possible but I want them so bad and then I’d say I’d commit but idk man the urge seems more than something else.*I hate my codependency and I’m feeling hate for the girl i’m codependent with. If I do stuff to leave it it seems like i’m abusive and I hate it but she says like it’s okay i’m learning but why can’t you take the initiative always me, but i’m the narc right? Why am I having to take the lead once again?*I want girl friends to talk to but I also sexualise a lot. I literally love girls so much man. But I’m a girl repellant. Memories from school where because I was scared of girls somehow I got made into a creep one time because a girl decided to lie about me and say I distributed nudes??? Even though I literally had never seen one (but lied about it)*I don’t want to go back to a school reunion because the fact i’ve date someone 3 years younger than me is like proving to them i was a creep. I wanted to be cool get their validation so it’s like now i’ll hurt you how you hurt me. But now i’m too much of a fucking loser to even do that. The shame is immense.* I need to just - i’m touch starved I’m idolising this one girl so hard, actually two but this one girl she’s just so clean.I want to have girl friends who can call this shit out of me and accept me but also get this shit out of me. I’ve noticed a lot of NPD girls here have a different perspective - I feel like a lot of NPd guys are kind of misogynistic in nature (not your fault we objectify right?) Idk if this is a trans thing but I just want to be cleaned out from that.I want to get this all out. I’ll push. Should I be drunk and talk to my therapist? I want girl friends I want a girlfriend I want intimacy. I lied sm back in the day. Yes I was a hyper sexual kid but I was a fucking virgin ass kid. I needed to fuel what was already the standard. Gosh man GOSH. It’s the people who self-harm, have eating disorders etc.I have self harmed, I have « starved » purged and it felt good it was to make me better amazing. I never got people who did it for the pain? Or like the pain but to « hurt themselves ».When I get drunk the urge to self harm is so high but it feels so good man, like masturbation type good. Like I could moan (I’m gonna regret saying this).Everything I do has a reason. I am too focused on what I’m doing and why to actually be in the moment and enjoy things. Self-destructive? Maybe but it’s so good it makes me feel great and it’s so good. I feel pretty and precious when I do yk? I don’t need a « please don’t do this » I have scars on my arms now and it annoys me but the body hair annoys me more. I know some asshole who would love me would kiss them 🥺.I’m not even saying I’m better it’s just it isn’t deep. And i’ve tried rlly. Ig the lack of empathy comes from being hurt that I didn’t feel validated for the reasons I started these things. I only wanted attention at most who needs sympathy bru. Like that’s cringe. I did it originally to get people to stop bullying me, to see the blood soak into my shirt. I was so happy when I saw blood bru😭 No it’s like it holds me to reality. I don’t do it often. And I don’t show it publicly. my mum made fun of me once for it. But she will say it wasn’t like that so sure. Gosh self destructiveness feels so fucking good. I hope I can heal but do this shit in moderation. Gosh It’s like the deep end of a swimming pool. Yk the way as kids we’d all try and touch the bottom of the deep end, even if our ears hurt? Man I’m feeling so great, not manic but grandiose. Man I love this feeling I could drown. Note: I left all my SH stuff at my mums house so I literally can’t rn so this isn’t a threat. Yippie right?. We are the stars. If only I could be this person that I am when I am sober and normal. I see the stars. It’s not hard to be an intersting unique person. It’s the drive that makes you that. Gosh I see stars and space. I love glider planes. This sounds so random but in my head it’s everything. Like I wasn’t made for here just the stars. The way someone might like to drive a lot. It sounds crazy until it’s possible. I am genuinely sober now. I’m good now, just I wish I had this drive when I was like normal yk. I’m always trying to go to sleep, listening to my body. It’s not fair. I want to make robots, I want to work on planes, on rockets only for me, for me to escape. But that’s just one part of me - I couldn’t possibly put all my efforts into one part of me. I want to see the stars I want to see so much. It feels even sad. How do you deal with your grandiose fantasies? If it were possible it wouldn’t be crazy. Maybe I do what I can here yk? Do stuff here that fills that itch maybe. Life is sad but life is beautiful it just feels to me I can’t reach the beauty.(Imma actually kms if I get a “Me when I’m manic” comment or something). I am not a girl and I don’t like being a guy.I feel deep down tho I am a boy, a boy who likes to be something else.I thought for so long it wasn’t okay - I’m scared with my identity changing so much. I want to relate to girls, I want to be a part of sisterhood, but I also want to be different.I am not good. I don’t expect to be a part of anything. Yk with guys, you can be a monster and still be a guy. That’s why I feel the guy-ness. I want to flirt with girls, get a girl the way guys want you to. But when that desire is gone. I feel like js a girl. Js doing my life.I feel like heather from silent hills 3 kind of. She doesn’t take a step back from anyone she asks questions she wants. Maybe this is superficial- I cry at the TERFs who will inevitably tell me it’s more than that. But I haven’t started HrT yet, I wouldn’t know. I want to dip my toes into it all, see how it is. Id say I’m gendefluid. Everything is fighting to take control. I need a narrative and when it constantly changes it messes me up.I love life for how crazy it is but this is anxiety inducing.I’m like posting a lot all over reddit because I’ve been drinking and my mind is like so energetic.I was referred for a Bipolar diagnosis when I was 14. But because they’d tell shit to my mum (NHS CAMHS btw I’m from the UK), I lied a lot, undermining my situation.I get moments of like very highs. I think if I could describe it, when I was 17 I did coke for the first time, did a fat line because I also did my friends line by accident (I wasn’t like a drug connoisseur yk so I didn’t know) and it felt like a normal “really good” episode i’d have. Sure I was skipping, but i’ve done that before sober.I feel like I really wanted to believe I had bipolar when I was younger because it would make me feel like there was a reason for why I was the way I was.I am more depresssed nowadays and when I get hyper, it’s more like when things are just going so bad, it’s like a switch yk? I’m going to go to my GP to ask them about this again now that I’m an adult. But I guess what I’d like and need from you guys is just - what are the durations of your episodes, can your episodes be triggered? I think I have a personality disorder too so it could just be that. Just this isn’t an aesthetic and I just want to know myself. I’d be honest if it turned out it was because of this I wouldn’t feel like so much of a monster but the truth is all that matters. Thanks. Any of you watched Attack on Titan? SPOILERSThe way it turns out Eren was always behind everything. I feel like young me has such a chokehold on me. I’ve always been prone to being scared. But in every “life or death” situation I’ve felt, I would always get a weird high from it. I really don’t know how to describe it, but I’d strangle young me. Boohoo a child, it’s me. He was such a cunt. And I don’t mean to the people around him, they made him who he is now. Just even if I wanted to go back in time and help him heal, his fantasies, his grandiosity would never let me in. I fucking hate him, I want to kill him. That stupid bald kid. Doing stuff behind people’s backs - he ruined everything for me. I look at him, what he had. When the illusion of a family was there, when he’d go to his country on holidays when he had beautiful things - pokémon heartgold for christmas, a trip on the eurostar, a new wii fit for christmas. WHY DID YOU RUIN EVERYTHING? I want to kill him with my own hands. He was troubled but he had a soul, now I just wander around feeling like I have no soul. Tbh I haven’t looked after myself and I should do some self care tonight. Just fuck him man yk?He deserved to be scared he didn’t want things to change - he wanted things to change around him - to work around him. I want to beat tf out of this kid.I want attention.I sometimes crave for attention, but feel stuck knowing i’m not enough to actually get it. But when I’m drunk and actually seek that attention I realise I could actually get what I want from the people around me. I’m just too depressed and tired usually to take that action. The attention seeking is hard because a lot of people make it seem like it’s completely superficial - I mean it is but the reasoning behind it isn’t. I think when I take off the NPD lens, I see myself with problems but problems that even normal people can have. That’s why I’m liking my therapist who doesn’t care about any diagnosis, even the ones I have gotten in the past. I guess this also just shows a wider view of everything. I’m not sure I’m making sense but it’s like with this (diagnosed or not), self control seems scary. It’s like that philosophical thing of standing on a cliff, knowing you could just jump off but you don’t. I hide my real self because my real self wants to be fucking cocky and “score” girls (gosh I know i know). But to have one person who I’ve truly idolised and actually get them feels like it would satiate my need for attention. But then it’d become an addiction. So it’s like I feel like I have to settle. And that’s scary, limiting myself.Covert narc, maybe but i hate mofos who act like it’s intentional. I don’t show those seemingly confident parts because I know I can’t make up for it. I go to uni and see people, and i’m just so interested in wanting to know them - I see their aesthetic but want to know who they are (I realise this is my idealisation because I want to see if they conform to my view of them).I hate my past, being so hyper sexual as a kid. I’m not sure if it’s even sexual in nature, just touch-starved like I want to touch, kiss, lick (yes i’m weird), like rub on someone i idolise to get that feeling. I hate this I feel so cold and empty.What do you guys make of this?. I bought a wig from shein, some nails, vamp teeth (for the holiday season). I came back from uni, I washed my wig, cut it. It took so long and for a moment U looked beautiful I was happy. But of course I had to go and ask a friend, who said it was thin and looked too straight even tho it’s curly hair and wet. I hate this people saying I look nice then js leaving me vulnerable and then js I feel horrible. I have to understand he is different but I’m just so hurt. I didn’t get mean, all I did was js be really needy like asking him genuinely if it looked nice he said « it’s not bad ».Worst was the girl that I talk about here. SHE GOT SAD? BECAUSE I WAS SAD. When I just needed someone and what is it - blame herself. So once again everything is on me and it frustrates me. I have to be empathetic but where tf was anything for me I’m more angry at her than with my friend because I asked for it imagine - another unique and individual’s opinion is different from mine?I just want to be accepted and I tried to communicate to her how I just needed someone and now I feel guilty. I told her I don’t like when she feels sad for me (I didn’t say this part but it doesn’t ever help me, it’s just self fulfilling pain. I literally only feel comforted when everything’s good for her. So I always seem like the dick because when she’s not everything is falling down but watch you guys sympathise with her more than me - thinking of a specific person here i am angry).I wanted to be accepted. To believe for once I can be desirable in a way I want. I wanted to post myself on my insta close friends. But this is just fuck everything’s I can’t trust anyone close to me they hurt me and they’re the only people i trust.Damage control is the next thing. Fuck my life I thought I was normal I thought I was perhaps just a broken person and not a bad person or whatever the fuck anything is. This fear that I do not change. I want to fucking tear myself. I hate you guys who have told me i’m whining. I get easily influenced not your faults. Bru i’m so confused. Nothing works, just therapy god people are fucking gross with how much power they have over me « oh that’s on you »🤓 commented the npd who can’t apply their own advice to themselves. I’ll get over this, I’ll talk to my therapist about it. Maybe this is here to fight someone but i overthink sm i assume it’s js be another « it’s not that deep moment » I don’t even have the energy to fucking associate this to humanity. I js want an acknowledgment even if I was needy of my emotions and just reassurance i wasn’t intentionally being harmed. I don’t care i’m not important plus I’m gonna get pizza to treat myself for this day. W. I feel unlovable. Like all I do is mess up. Never putting myself in good situations because I’m scared of being alone. I’m going to go shower. I feel like right now if I had a dad, I’d go to him. Because I need him.And I feel apologetic for things being how they were. And I feel like I can’t really breathe. And that I want to (SH) ykwim? It just zones shit out but then again I have nothing in this studio apartment everything’s back at my mums house. We’ll get through it, I never feel like I can love - I js want everything to stop. I’ll be okay. I need something but I don’t know what. We’ll sleep I want to grow my hair out. Scared of being called acting like a victim I think I’m just genuinely sad.TODAY WAS HORRIBLE. I’m glad I ate so much yesterday (yes I was drunk am I drinking today it’s the weekend). Not a good idea but I literally can’t cope. I’ve done the fucking best I could this week. Shower is fucked I couldn’t even shower for 2 fucking days. I got my HRT application done so just waiting. Maybe i’ll be less envious of girls. I did some work to catch up at uni. I have so much going on. AND THIS FUCKING PAIN. If only it were actually confrontable - that would mean vulnerability seeing all of it. I want to though. It was hard really hard. I’m getting drunk I’ll shower even if it’s ice cold this is disgusting. I used to rot in bed not shower but even now my eczema’s getting bad. I showed myself to a long time online friend. Very embarrassing but done I cheated tho I was drunk. I wish I could stop fantasising about a relationship. I feel so lonely , i want to feel love. (I know this is urging someone to tell me i’m not ready for it, i know bitch.) I’ve been getting rude in public even, mask is coming off almost fought a guy he teased me singing frank ocean in public I said “hahaha” out loud . Both of us didn’t want to fight lol we kept turning back as we walked away. I’ve been rude I hate the world. My delusion is a plane in the sky past sunset dark blue skies. I’m drinking red wine girly girl that I am kissing someone.Today was bad. so bad. I didn’t reckless buy clothes like I planned. But I did drink. I want to harm myself so bad it’s like supply i makes me feel sexy but I won’t and I didn’t. I left my razor at home 😭I’m feeling the ego I want to be so seductive if i weren’t ugly not fishing just being fucking real. I feel like my life is over kind of? Catastrophising yes. But this is really messed up. Like Being happy yesterday I feel like I didn’t deserve to be like it was an act hiding the insecurities underneath.Self-care but my flipping hot water still isn’t working.WHAAAA WHAT IS THIS PHENOMENON??? YOU TELLING ME AI SAID I WAS A GOIRL???ngl adding only hair and winged eyeliner changes my whole face gender. I mean this reminds me of my ex when we were on the phone and she paused to say “sometimes I call you and it’s like I didn’t even think of you like a guy”WHAAAAA??. TW: MOMMY ISSUESShe is flourishing. She has friends. I see her laughing caring wanting the best for her friends and family.Gosh was she just a teen girl raising her son. My dad was deffo a narcissist but guess what he left when I was a baby. A petite teeny tiny baby. (Edit a letter to my mum: a little tipsy ibr)Gosh Mum you do know me, you know my bad but you don’t know how far gone I’ve been. You’re literally like my best friend, and we could talk about anything If you got your head out of your morality chamber.You do love me but not past anything that would mean sacrificing yourself. I know you’re a strong person. And listen we are both cheeky, ik u. You’ve deal with a lot so to most people it doesn’t seem like a bad thing, or anything is going wrong. But I see your other sides. I know you tolerate a lot but past that point is when I’ve seen you. I remember you crying in the living room when I was 3. I didn’t know what to do, that day changed me maybe. What fucking sucks is if you knew everything about me I know you’d get over it. Why does it have to be on me? You found my vape and you were chill, you told me to stop I won’t. It’s like you have those mental blocks, that stop you from being great.But you’re happy. Even your son, I wish I wasn’t your son. Give you one of my cousins to take over.Mum I love you but this wasn’t the life for it. I love you. I still cuddle you even though I’m dirty. But you never wanted to wash the dirt off me, make me clean off my own dirt.I pray we’ll be born again and love each other fully. I love you mum it hurts not loving you. Mum I really do love you why does it feel like I shouldn’t. Or I’m not allowed.Genuinely. I would have these fps. The thing about diagnosisng is that every person is unique.I had two FPs.Josh from the ages 9-12 and Harry 13-17But as time went on I realised I couldn’t depend on these things (edit: things as in being loved the way I want). I didn’t think to see what I was doing, so I would focus on what they didn’t do for me. They didn’t give me love. When Harry introduced me to his family and they invited me to dinner I felt so loved. Oh harry bro u don’t even know I don’t think I loved him romantically but god was he just i wanted the best for him. I’d kiss him on the cheek now, I’d get pretty exhausted doing something for anyone but if I were feeling up to it, I’d treat him, give him the world. Gosh I feel like I may have loved him as a friend then but gosh. He was my everything. But I remember back even then I had my narcisstic traits. I’d forget about him but when we were together he was my everything. When he’d reach out to me when I became distant It felt so good: he missed me. But he didn’t do enough to want me back. He was my best friend but I was just a close friend to him. Josh was my best friend. I compare him to EVERY friendship I have now. No one will be like Josh, yet when he left boarding school he didn’t call me I had to reach out. He was me we wanted the same things. Maybe I’ll try to find him.I think my narcissism was there already but I could rely on no one. So I became a fucking bad bitch. Only good for me. Sure I might be a loser on the outside but whenever people saw a sneak peak inside of me, past the needing people they’d tell me how interesting I am. But then I left school & college, isolated myself for 2 years, feel like the narcissism cooked there. I think I had empathy. I loved my mother I loved them I loved so much. But then I saw those feelings, just emotions. They’re just fucking emotions, my mum says they control me too much. So here I am, firmly believe I have NPD I’m fucking amazing. I know my inner world. It’s snowing there right now. But I was a different person really. I thought healing was never depending on people. I always had grandiosity just internalised. But I think I did had BPD traits. Go tell me how they’re similar I know mf. But I get why 18 is the point of diagnosis. But they should have shit in place for minors. Just like how that misconduct disorder thing for people with aspd gives them a sneak peak into their future lives. Not just my mum thinking I have bipolar. Gosh.Anyways posting this both on r/bpd and r/npd so don’t be mad at me or hurt me. I’m excited to say this don’t shut it down.Genuinely. I would have these fps.

Gosh.Anyways posting this both on r/bpd and r/npd so don’t be mad at me or hurt me. I’m excited to say this don’t shut it down.I don’t get the thing where people here talk about their feelings and structure it so well. This is no hate to you guys, you guys are better than me working on community. I saw a r/narcissisticabuse post where they were laughing that we have a subreddit. “People whining about not having empathy”. Crazy because this came from a neurodivergent person - as if feeling inadequate and not being like normal people was something we alone feel.I talk way too much, and you guys are nice to me for it. I feel spoilt. To some of you this is just a place to vent, share idea etc. and you live your life. I feel like I live my life and come back here as If I was neurotic or something (learnt the word).I get scared yk the whole “it’s not that serious” the thing people say and it invalidates every emotion you have because it meant so much to you. I’m scared one of you guys will do this.Can I say I love myself when I’m grandiose because it’s this feeling like my mum, my family doesn’t exist, that I am some random as person who popped out of nowhere. Like I’m an anomaly.I was watching Neon genisis Evangelion clips and I relate to asuka so bad man. But I would never confide myself to one person, I always feel disappointed. And I noticed before I devalue there’s this tiny window of vulnerability which appears in every relationship which is normal, but I don’t want it. So I’ve done about everything I can with a person and go for the next. I say this like I’m popular lol i’m not. But being covert is like that, you get your supply from simple things. It hasn’t been like this recently. Actually not at all. When I lose energy feel stupid for wanting attention, self care is what keeps me going. (And drinking… occasionally)I’m so nothing, I’m literally nothing. No one knows me I would wander through life not making attachments. There would be shame meeting someone I stopped talking to them reminding me that I was a person to them.I DIDNT GO TO THE CROCHET CLUB.But I spoke up in my lecture, I looked at my teacher in the eyes to ask a question. I’m going to do a “scientific” report on personality disorders. It was like he could see how pathetic I really am and me even trying to talk was a pathetic attempt of masking.My anxiety is so bad I start trembling. I saw my roommates from last year. I was shaking but had to hide it. I did something! I did some work, figured out some stuff. If I keep this up I’ll be able to do well for next week’s test. I told my best friend I’m scared of being vulnerable to him because he really is good he has morals even though he’s a freak. I journaled yesterday it doesn’t feel nice. I don’t know life, but i walked home it turned dark so quickly I love my life right now like where ai live Life feels so unserious. I felt free . life still sucks. I am just my anxiety and fear. I don’t like being dominant but I think I am personality wise. be interested in me, love me tell me i make your world.In a dark room, music is playing, multicoloured lights shine on a disco ball. Everything is going crazy In my head. I wish I could live in my head in that fantasy. Losing my mind, going into my primitive state. Music is playing (I’m referring to datfootdive - don’t be) Everything is going wrong, it’s that how it should be, the truth revealed. Ego Death. I have so much to do today. I feel like I don’t have control. It’s okay if only I could dance in the burning building that is my mind rn.God am I edgy?. But I’m really scared of reading your posts guys. I’m scared i’ll no longer be 20 and be like you guys. I wish I had found this out sooner tbh, my dumbass always thought I had BPD. I feel like I’d be a really okay person if I just had the empathy. Maybe that’s the case for everyone. I really don’t want my life to be this. Even if it was I wouldn’t stop getting help can’t believe I have to say this.I’m a disgusting person, maybe not a monster but no one, no one would want to be close to me if they knew the real full me. Except people who I don’t like. Speaking very vaguely here. Leave that to my therapist next monday which I am also terrified of. I am definitely fucking drinking that night idc. Actually no I’ll drink the day after I have Uni a 9am.If this is some form of self harm I fucking love it bitch. I’m gonna fucking kill myself without killing myself. If my mum weren’t alive I wouldn’t feel shame or anything. I fear her slapping me screaming at me shaming me telling me she can’t deal with me, I don’t love her (actually omg idc about that😭 i genuinely don’t love this woman she is js my mum im clingy) Im tired of fear Im tired of fear I want to go into fucking hell. Metaphorically of course. Sometimes I feel normal but it’s a fucking lie. I don’t have to hurt anyone fr I don’t but I can hurt or destroy myself and that is pretty fucking radical. I am going to go through HELL. OMG this is the perfect year. I have my apartment. I can choose to change unis next year. So little at risk. Let’s burn the world. I sound manic but I promise u i’m not. I’m going to ruin everything around meBurn burn burn I want to wreck my room lol. Mine is mania-like where I’m in a ballroom. Everyone knows everything about me, No secrets out the door. All the guests look at me, with faces of disgust, shame, disappointment. No matter how much I try to entertain them, get them to love me past these things, they don’t budge one bit. The music is playing - it’s a love song. I keep going things are getting worse, I start to fall apart, the nice suit I have has rips and stains, I’m sweating. The disgusting human is being seen.No more lies. I start begging, grabbing onto them. Agression grows, please love me say I’m good save me. But they look at me like a stranger staring at you for too long on the street. The music keeps playing and it starts to drive me crazy. I am finally free and what is there is a mess of wanting to be saved. I go crazy, I rip parts of my suit jacket off, pull on my hair. The aggression becomes comforting, it becomes a protector, that’s all I am. Just bad. You guys don’t know me to say I’m not. I could say it repeatedly and I will. Let me just vent.Life is beautiful because I am so messed up, If i can’t be loved then I will only take things for myself. People become accessories, I can understand that they are people too, just they are not me. I am a god not like the actual god like a descriptor (like the way some ancient religions had 1000+ gods). I see beauty in my messed up-ness I’m scared you’ll guys will rejected my vision hurt me even more. My grandiosity triggers when things go so bad, like at this point why call myself bad that’s all I am, bad is normal, so I should thrive. Anything good takes effort whilst bad is inherent. Oh gosh I am an imposter to everyone around me. I’m so evil and I love it. Even if they don’t see it, my life is like a bubble in my studio apartment. That’s where I can be everything. Is vulnerability even real? Is that even me sometimes like a bit of now (I’m actually very tame right now) It feels like those things are isolated from my body, yet I feel the fear crumbling down from one negative opinion.I want to drink so bad.I keep seeing this mask bullshit (I mean it’s true) but what else am I except hating myself. I swear I talk to people and just feel myself breaking down inside. I am real, I don’t ant to be I wanted to say I’m not real but the real stuff is uncomfortable to delve into.What is there to me apart from hating how inadequate I am? If someone says hi, I have to say hi. What else is there. Very difficult. I like being alone in my studio apartment. It’s cozy. I don’t want to go to sleep, if tonight could stay like this forever I’d do so many things. Even fear of being tired wouldn’t stop me from doing things.I’m going to a crochet society tomorrow. I actually like have panic attacks in these situations. It’s girl dominated, they’ll laugh at me like the nerd I am, the unusually hyper sexual creep that I am. And when I don’t show it I feel like i’m deceiving them. I miss this girl, we spoke I just wish I could hug her. Someone who sees me more than others, but then that feeling leaves and she’s once again just someone to protect me, nothing more. for a moment I had an image of her I was glad to see her and hug her then the feeling left. Vulnerable narcissism sucks because people think I’m being vulnerable but I’m not. This isn’t hell but it isn’t exactly fun, god i’m arousing myself from how interesting i sound like Im some simple average girl in her cute tiny apartment. It’s like my grandiosity gets triggered when i go into a third person mode idk. yapping.I’ll go to sleep for real now. But everything I am can be linked to NPD. What is there?. Every day has its flaws and good things. I don’t want to write it down. I must I must I need to I need to. Pain feels so good Idk why it feels so good. It’s so good man. Ruin myself in the right way. Not manic js saying what’s on my mind. Just another way to talk about how interesting my normal ass life is to show how cunning and amazing I am.It’s 1:30 and she’s just bought a cable on amazon. Sometimes we remark about how we buy things at the weirdest times. Like me buying something at 4:30am.Knowing there are some things you can’t talk about so conversations like this are somewhat appreciated. She couldn’t handle to see the real me, neither can I ig. Why am I so in love with how flawed I am? I think to these experiences with her similar to the final conversation showed between Chuck and Jimmy in Better call Saul. Always avoiding the one topic that would could mend their relationship. But neither of us will, because of my fear of not being accepted, and her fear of her son not being the way she wanted or expected.I should sleep now, there’s nothing coming out of this tbh. Goodnight guys. Everything I’ve said is garbage and I know it. Shame!. I don’t like “acting mature” because that’s what I did for so long, at least tried to. I feel like a child who’s baffled at how weak adults are. I’m still a fucking baby, yet I can manipulate these so called “mature” people. It isn’t a flex It’s not something to boast about. It’s that feeling where it’s like the people you expect so much from turn out to be lame. I thought adults were cool. It’s so boring, I come across as eccentric. Why? Why aren’t people interesting. I’m looking in the wrong places for sure but why not have a trait that hooks me in? just makes me want to understand more. I literally have to soothe myself after listening to people. It’s a good tactic for now it’s my latest plan. Try my best to empathise listen and after calm myself down knowing this hasn’t threatened me. I love this delusion my brain has grown around. And yet “fighting” against it, am I even doing it? Who cares I got tired thinking tm about this. I need attention talking talking. I don’t careeeeee I’m pushing vulnerability away. Same thing and life stays the same fucking obviously.Gosh you ever wanted to fucking scoop your insides out man I could do better things to help myself, go shower go get ready but it fucking sucks i want to wallow in this shitty ass feeling much more pleasurable, I can complain about things I won’t change.I hate my body sm bro golly “go to the gym” 🤓👆🏾 no i want to be a fucking girl how about that. holy shit someone at work said i had a nice body bro i will scoop your eyes out. Was this said to me last week? Yes. Am I holding onto this to fuel my annoyance with life? Yes. Gosh aren’t I so interesting and funny #relatable. I’m annoyed and waiting for someone to analyse and destroy what little ego I have from this post 💯 waiting for you.wtf wtf wtf. I need her but I don’t want her right now. I want fucking admiration but I hate shallowness of everything. I want to destroy ruin myself to finally be done with this. GoshI need to break something. HHHHHHHHHHHH. is mfs saying we’re broken people. But I try I fucking try and see the vulnerability and I don’t fucking see it. I was bad. I was 8 i think I used my godfather’s credit card to buy a wii u. GOT AWAY WITH IT. I WAS FUCKING SMART.I stole a 3DS, an iPad a laptop. My school threatened to involve the police. By then my mum everything I was tired of. Learnt about suicide. I was so emo. I never really missed my dad he was never in my life. I did cry but i was so young. What experiences? I could cry and you guys would call me converted so what’s the fucking point to anything. Feel sorry for myself. I want to die with flames around me. But this is real life. I ain’t all that. I need time it’s just so exhausting caring. If I pull it away I’ll be the bad one. I wish someone could understand it’s hard to care because all I can do is protect myself - which in itself ruins me more.I see myself hopeful knowing believing I’ll heal. Is that the narcissism talking? I fucking hate myself I’ve forced this motherfucker to keep going even through the darkest times, why can’t I push myself for the good. I want to have sex, I want to be desired I want to be wanted. But even then, that will not be my solution because I will not give myself to anyone. I love myself for the toxicity, I see the world burning causing chaos everywhere I go and it’s fucking pretty. It’s like I’m a main character in my head. Don’t think about the thousands of people Nathan Drake has killed, just that he gets to sit down with his wife and play crash bandicoot. I’m that itching hatred you feel, I’ll get under your skin because my existence troubles people. I mean this knowing I sound delusional just expressing how I feel. My family called me annoying, made me feel like it. My bullies did too. I’m still scared of my bullies, thought I bumped into one recently my heart dropped I tried to run away seriously. But my family… I like to see them hurt. I am not hurt by hurt in the way they are. I was never hopeful. I want them to the ground and when they see the person they never wanted to see happy be happy their annoyance fuels me. I could be a monster, I am told we are broken children but really I am just a fucking devil. Every night fearing of turning around in bed because I’d see the face of baphomet. “Everything happens for a reason” I can hurt I can burn.My family loved african proverbs (we are african) and the one proverb they’d preach was “A child that isn’t given warmth from the village will burn it to feel its warmth” I am everything bad needed to fuel my empty void. I am younger me holding a kitchen knife at night after watching the ending of dundertale (Kris being evil really inspired me). I am evil people pretend but I wanted to be good. Call me dramatic but let’s be real it isn’t hard to hurt people, catastrophically.I was planning to microdose but I want to start on full dosage then microdose after. I’m not sad I’m a very apathetic person and the feelings of discomfort of myself I get pleasure from - I say all this to say don’t feel sorry for me I don’t deserve it. (Like really I guess just advice or speculation would help.)I don’t like being tall, I wore a baggy hoodie and it fit so bad on me. I am so manly I hate it. Those big shoulders, my hair (locs) that grow so slowly, my calves and legs which are too big even leg warmers look awkward. My shoulders, more so my neck it’s so wide. Someone at work said I have a nice body (he doesn’t know I’m idk idk what i am but maybe no cis). I don’t believe I get to be a girl, but that doesn’t change i’ll look like one. Everything I do is so manish, and my mental health (suspected npd) I don’t associate with girls because I’m scared they’ll see me for the monster I am. it’s a lot easier to hang out with nerds who feed off my false confidence (not to say they’re lame, just no my cup of tea).I want to be thinner, smaller, I see people around campus at uni and I want them and to be them. I see trans girls on social media and it’s impossible to imagine what they would’ve looked like pre-everything.I don’t know what to do but start I guess. I just really am not content with my body, no outfit no nothing makes me feel happier. I’m ugly and I’m an ugly man. I don’t care to give it more thought it’ll hurt. Idk i js need some sort of belief it’ll work out. I hate that my friends like me for someone i don’t want to be. My wig from shein hasn’t come, I want to get drunk and do makeup. Think I’ll do that.I’ve already gone through GenderGP, so no point talking about don’t transition. My mum found some fem clothes I bought and that was the breaking point. I’ve convinced her but Idc anymore.I’m microdosing - I don’t know what I’ll look like but I want to be like able to pass for both somewhat like androgynous. I am scared of breast growth only because my mum not as a mean thing on her but she cannot give me any privacy. She notices things way too quick.I want that damn waist so bad already.I’m scared that I haven’t made friends. I say this but I’ve met like 4 people at my lecture and I don’t feel compatible with them. One plays smash but he’s introverted and the awkward silence (which isn’t for him) kills me. I feel like I’m not being pushed. Yet he’s been nice to me. I’m scared I’m a loser and the desire to prove myself to the bullies at school that still live in my head tells me I’m a loser. I have missed a society (club) because I fell asleep I didn’t sleep yesterday because I had work very late yesterday.I feel like I hate myself. I’ve isolated myself tonight I’m just idk. I feel a block in my chest not wanting to share anything. I can’t talk to anyone. Always the feeling like I haven’t met “the one”. The one who’ll complete me, make me feel the need to not second guess if they’re worthy to be my friend yet I’m the clingy one. My self worth feels threatened. What should I do?Edit: I feel the part of me begging crying to be adored, wanted, loved I’m guessing for the fact that I can’t love myself I feel disconnected, who am I even where would the self love go? I thrive off the high of being admired. I wore one of my best fits to Uni and I didn’t get a compliment- sounds lame but i genuinely felt hurt by this. Honesty right guys?. I literally know my suicidal ass is actually suicidal now. Suicide for members with NPD is seen as the pwNPD almost “giving up” on life like a forfeit. I’m not explaining it I saw a quora post about it and ig you can take that with a grain of salt. But ye suicide seems like my “easy way out”So I’m gonna tell my therapist even if I don’t feel vulnerable and just say everything. This guilt is horrible the shame I’m even avoiding what this sounds like (I may withdraw from this place due to the fear).I never was a good person. Never, I will scarficie everything for a new path. And even if I don’t change, I can be punished so I can live my life without having to worry about enjoying life because I’ve been punished (yes masochistic mud)I will be an evil man, who enjoys their end of their life in a Cabin amongst the fields. People will ask how can someone deserve good things - never thinking how lucky they were to not be born as a monster.I js say stuff and want challenges to look inside im worried this isn’t helping n and js feeding into what i want. I’ll be real I feel a certain type of specialness because i don’t see u guys typing like this I be saying anything (hen again I don’t read your posts, I’d kms if i did when I’m normal or not talking about my problems shit is so miserable depressing pessimistic)AM I GOATED????Bear in mind I can kind of calm myself down. I’m guessing it’s like idk. For example the nameless narcissist had an interview with the guy who made MBT where they talked about implementing vulnerability in the grandiose phase (hoping bro sees this) but If this contributes to any of that yk? Maybe this’ll be helpful to finding help for all of us. Don’t be mean I find meaning in this. GOSH i feel like i’ll save us (Ill be real I see this getting criticism Im js letting myself say how I feel, sorry it’s like Im saying Im better than you I just feel special not like you guys are rubbish, honestly). I’m really pushing the limits, I’m in that like phase where I can do something but not at the point where i’ve done it too much and then it becomes meaningless. Hoping this crazy oversharing and reading helps induce the right type of shame.But anyways I’m trans, I sense some mfs coming down my throat. But one thing I hate is like sometimes I want to see a girl and call her pretty or something. Idk I love girls man guys idk I mean I’m kinda bi but I feel like I js forced it it doesn’t come like how it does with girls. but I can’t because I be boymodding and I js look like a nice guy (fearing literally quivering at the mf that’ll say “but you are a man” GOD tHE ANXIETY IS HERE) but like bro I wish I could js like Oh my gd I be telling my girl friends they’re hot like wtf that’s a lie but I be complimenting them but like not enough cause some of them dk Im trans. My mum found some of my clothes but I convinced her they weren’t mine, but then she found my vape tonight. I told her sorry and I didn’t like how she feels like she doesn’t know me she said she wants to know I hugged her. She scares me she could take all that love away.Anyways let’s see if the shame reading this tomorrow is horrible. Also grandiosity man fuck.I am literally goated, guys grandiosity fucjkkkk I am literally in bed typing but man i feel good work finished Imma use my money to buy clothes clothes. Im like an early 2000s high school girl character in the body of a genderqueer tall mf god I feel like if i were who I was I’d be fucking amazingWhat is healing i’m scared. When Im vulnerable I find myself stabilising and like not wanting to be grandiose anymore, but when I am god I’m like a visionary. This is literally why I take it day by day because thinking long term i don’t see healing possible. Just doing my best rn. Like focusing on showering (gross ewww a nigga gets depressed 😮) looking after myself. Idk man what is the solution man i’m telling you I did coke one time and that shit felt like a normal grandiose episode except I was skipping. I pissed off so many mfs I was in a boarding school 17 year old overweight me was fucking up the floorboards. Idk about you guys, I know some of you guys are rock fans. I myself like underground trap and a lot of the aesthetic is like the “loser” satire humour. Like emo is now cool, stuff like that. Also I am into fashion I can’t really replicate it on myself but my vision is there, ppl like my pinterests I js can’t apply it to me because I see myself more than js my body just I see myself as an idea.Anyways, an example because this post has no direction. There’s this new thing of this meme ig, it’s js people fucking saying “wait I’m actually goated” and Idk what this means to the average person. But I swear this whole loser aesthetic turned cool feels like me. Like everything lame about me turns cool yk. Idk what’s the point in this point but it’s like my interests fuellll my ego so bad. It feels like a drug sometimes. Idk is this ruining me? Is healing me giving up on this? i’m confused. I just commented on someone else’s post. About my fp.I feel like my brain devalues her a lot, I don’t share it but things like seeing her calling her etc. Make me like stabilise. I hate that she accepts everything about me. I could say I’m one person and the next day say that person was wrong and she’s on board. It feels like does she even like me, who am I what is she liking I feel like i’m being played.I’m wiser now not to project its js Ill be vulnerable with a friend like last night it was alot. If I told her she’d js be supportive like my number 1# fan and i don’t like that. Idk what it is, it’s like it’s almost easy. And I loved the validation she made me feel pretty in ways I wanted to see myself. But it stopped me from seeing my real self. Made me want to hide things I didn’t like. It’s like she constantly inflates my ego.I feel like I have an easy mode on life - I don’t see her like that I like chilling with her she comforts me I don’t want to have to validated that to not seem like a monsterous using bitch which I probably am but not intentionally just. I feel luckier than you guys because I have people who care about me a lot it makes me think is my grandiosity actually like valid? it’s more my self hatred that pushes people away. HELPPO. Wanting sooo much attention wanting to go to everyone to get it. This is where I tell myself stop and let the crash come. I had a long day at work, grandiosity came. It’s like this is me. I feel hyped I feel everything. But it’s so like the space is - it’s like there’s only room for me.Kind of scares me thinking this will come back. It’s scary I know what’s next. Imagine if the grandiosity could be satisfied maybe it’d come back down. What would? A night out? I’m always the one who wants to stay up everyone else wants to gts. I feel fragile - I don’t want anyone to be mean to me hate me I’m js a child (inner child) I am me I am alive I feel the adrenaline. I feel sad but still euphoric but I guess it’s crashing down now.
    I don't have a whole lot of dating experience after coming out, and I'm Gender Expansive as in I present more feminine but I was AMAB and I'm not on hormones or anything. What is the etiquette for answering questions about sex? I feel in the dark and not sure where to start. I'm also pansexual and want to make sure anyone I date is informed. Unfortunately I'm just really inexperienced, and I didn't have much dating or bedroom experience before I came out anyway. I'm just not sure where to start and I feel like there's a big empty place in my life romantically because I'm not not sure what words are best to use for someone like me and I freeze up -- even on dating apps. Thank you for any help you have.. For example, was it based on a distressing situation? Or was it truly because, as some articles describe it, it was "because that person wasn't useful to you anymore"?. Here's an example: [https://www.verywellmind.com/narcissistic-discard-causes-impact-and-coping-strategies-5218979#toc-frequently-asked-questions-061a5362-9f5b-4838-92d3-0e2d018688da](https://www.verywellmind.com/narcissistic-discard-causes-impact-and-coping-strategies-5218979#toc-frequently-asked-questions-061a5362-9f5b-4838-92d3-0e2d018688da)&#x200B; ## Narcissist Discard in RelationshipsIt can be helpful to understand narcissist discard in the context of a narcissistic relationship. These are the stages of narcissistic relationships, according to Dr. Daramus: * **Appreciation:** [Narcissistic relationships](https://www.verywellmind.com/signs-you-re-married-to-a-narcissist-5208165) often start off at a fervent pitch. The person will seem like someone special, and they’ll make you feel unique. Whether romantic, professional, or otherwise, the relationship will move fast.* **Depreciation:** Eventually, the person with narcissistic tendencies will start picking you apart and finding faults with you. They’ll set you against others by telling you why another person is better than you; meanwhile, they’ll be praising you to make someone else feel small. They’ll [gaslight](https://www.verywellmind.com/is-someone-gaslighting-you-4147470) you, by distorting your sense of reality and blaming you for the distress it causes you.* **Repetition:** You’ll find yourself feeling confused, anxious, depressed, and scrambling to be good enough. If you try to pull away, they'll react with hurt and [rage](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-narcissistic-rage-5183744), but then the cycle of appreciation and depreciation will start again.* **Discard:** They will use you for personal gain and when you’re no longer of use to them, they will discard you. &#x200B;## Reasons for Narcissist DiscardWhat causes a narcissist to discard you? According to a 2017 study, people with narcissistic personality disorder often have trouble maintaining long-term relationships.3 They tend to use people to prop up their [sense of self](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-self-concept-2795865), often due to a deficiency of parental affection in childhood.4 They think of others as objects to discard when they’re no longer useful.Dr. Daramus lists some reasons why a person with narcissistic tendencies might discard you:* You were too difficult for them to control* You were easily [manipulated](https://www.verywellmind.com/manipulation-in-marriage-2302245) by them, causing them to look down upon you* You no longer fuel their ego, so they’ve moved on to someone else who can supply what they need* You may not be able to help them any further with their life goals, so they’ve found someone who can* They feel that they can “level up” and move on to someone “better,” in some dysfunctional way. My understanding is that NPD can be rooted in being a "victim" because of your childhood and your adulthood is defined by pursuing the things you deserve in response to that abuse.But then that means that pwNPD can express symptoms when they are perceived to be a victim again in some way as an adult, and they need to reclaim power. But in what types of scenarios does this manifest?* Is it like -- Someone talked down to you, someone lied to you, or said untrue things about you?* Or is it more like -- Someone took or withheld something you felt entitled to, or someone criticized you?. I'm preeeettty sure I have ADHD or I'm neurodivergent in some way, and I've learned that neurotypical people often have routines that they just... do? and don't think about? I wasn't raised in that type of household so I don't know how long things should take.**What are your "must do's", how long do they take, and how often do you do them?**Are there things you do only weekly / monthly, or something like that?Thank you for your wisdom <3. The quantum nature of objects in the game seems to combine two different principles of quantum mechanics in a way that doesn't quite reflect how they work IRL: super-position, and wave-function.The main example: >!the QM collapses into one location!<, similar to the double-slit experiment, >!but also presents the Nomaii as alive/dead!<, like the Schrodinger's Cat thought-experiment.&#x200B;* The principle of "Wavefunction" is illustrated by the double-slit experiment. Where a subatomic particle "lands" on a detector screen is based on probability of the wave-function. * Measuring which slit the particle "went through" changes the probabilities of where it will "land" (be detected) on the detector screen. * Not measuring which slit the particle "went through" means that it "goes through" both slits, causing an interference pattern in the probabilities of where the particle "lands" (otherwise referred to as the collapse of the wave-form) * The act of **measuring** (not conscious observation) is what collapses the wave-form. * This is reflected in-game by >!the location of the QM!<, because it changes the location and could be in multiple places at once, and therefore IS in all places at once (a superposition), but the difference is that >!the QM location!< is based on observation, not on measurement.* Superposition is broader than the double-slit experiment. It is the sum of all possible states. Botht eh double-slit experiment and the Schrodinger's Cat thought-experiment show superposition in different ways. * In the Schrodinger's Cat experiment, though, the probabilities are not based on where a particle will land, **but on whether or not a random event will happen**. * And despite >!the Nomaii being simultaneously alive and dead!<, this thought-experiment is **not** represented in Outer Wilds. * In the experiment, the box the cat is in has poison, only released if a particular radioactive particle decays -- a quantum (subatomic) event. Because this is purely based on probability, this "system" is a superposition of both outcomes. If an hour passes, either the event happened, or it didn't. The cat is both alive and dead until someone opens the box and takes a look. Schrödinger was proposing that it **is human observation** (unlike the double-slit experiment) that determines the final state. * (And, supposedly, this is an unsolved problem in quantum physics. Although based on everything I've read and watched about the double-slit experiment throughout my life, it really seems like in the thought-experiment, the poison detector has a detector, and it's the detector that collapses the outcome, not human observation, so it's not possible for the cat to be alive and dead at the same time. Which, you know, is intuitive anyway. But apparently this idea goes against the 'Copenhagen interpretation' and apparently that's the prevailing theory at this time.)* So -- Why share all this? What's the point? Honestly -- it's because this year I learned that the "human observation influences the outcome" idea in the double-slit experiment is wrong, and I guess Outer Wilds might unintentionally reinforce that bad interpretation. * There are many videos on YouTube about the double-slit experiment that portray it as follows: photons or electrons or whatever will behave like waves of energy, unless you look at them, in which case, **they behave like balls (this is wrong)**. * **Bad** model image of the 'wave' pattern (not measuring which slit they went through) versus the 'ball' pattern (measuring which slit they went through): [https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1\*FZeO2rNILhYSFMXLLcSXaw.gif](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*FZeO2rNILhYSFMXLLcSXaw.gif) * Nope! That's not what is happening. * The interference pattern part of the above image is valid, and would look something like this: [https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1\*5Tag0fviM8nvaQK3UqWPiA.png](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*5Tag0fviM8nvaQK3UqWPiA.png) (this is the same as before). The interference pattern is the probabilities interfering, just like waves on the surface of water, of where the energy will be detected, due to the energy passing through both slits at the same time. * However, when you measure which slit the photon or electron or whatever went through, **they still behave like waves until they collapse onto the detector screen**, it's just that the interference pattern is gone because the energy is no longer passing through both slits at the same time, it's only passing through one: [https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0\*iTieR6RxLe4GUkQW.png](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*iTieR6RxLe4GUkQW.png) * Admittedly, that last image isn't very interesting on it's own. But this representation is not only more accurate, it also showed me that the "particle behaves like a ball" was way, way, way wrong.&#x200B;Here is an amazing video that also describes why thinking about waveforms and superpositions in terms of human observation is dated and wrong: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQv5CVELG3U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQv5CVELG3U)And were is an article that goes into the misrepresentation of the double-slit experiment in more detail: [https://medium.com/science-first/the-double-slit-experiment-demystified-disproving-the-quantum-consciousness-connection-ee8384a50e2f](https://medium.com/science-first/the-double-slit-experiment-demystified-disproving-the-quantum-consciousness-connection-ee8384a50e2f)&#x200B;**What are your thoughts? Anything in here you think I'm getting wrong? What quantum rabbit holes have you gone down?**. I know it sounds like I'm trying to get content for an article, but I work from home and I'm trying to get out of the house more and looking for ideas of places to ask people to meet me at. Thank you!. I'm a person who likes the story/RPG side more than the combat side, but I like enjoying the story with others. Is it worth playing this game two player? Or would I mostly just be on the side while someone else does all the main playing/RPGing? Sorry if this is not articulated well. Thanks for your insight! And if you have any suggestions for a different game that might suit what I'm asking better, I'd appreciate it!. &#x200B;I've heard that 'control issues' are not even a symptom that impacts all people with NPD, so I guess this question is only applicable to pwNPD with control issues.. I'm at a loss. I feel so uncomfortable and so unequipped. All that stuff about narcissists devaluing people to make them feel worse about themselves -- she total accomplished that. I can't even enjoy being around people who used to be good friends because I'm so exhausted by having to stand up for myself and correct whatever "misunderstanding" she's caused while I wasn't in the room. I don't talk to any mutual friends anymore because -- not only did no one believe me -- she made them believe that speaking up for myself was an attack on them. I feel like I've been gaslighted out the wazoo. I don't associate with those people anymore. But it still hurts like crazy and I want to scream to the world about it even though I know nobody cares. Like -- it's totally impossible for other people to understand and I get that. But I still feel like I cannot heal -- even with therapy -- nothing is working and my life just feels like such a waste. I enjoy getting to know people and supporting others, but I feel so deeply punched in the gut that I can't reconnect with the world. I don't know what to do. I need help and I keep asking for help and I feel like I'm not getting the help I need. I'm very confused and I feel like I've tried everything and I don't know what to do anymore. &#x200B;. So, I loved everything about CrossCode. It is one of my favorite all-time games! I also played and enjoyed The Messenger. I thought I was ready to chill out to a slow paced RPG and was excited for Sea of Stars -- I thought it would be a good balance of things I like, I remembering loving Mario RPG... but that slower pace, but I've played about 6 hours and I'm just very bored. It's like it's all things I've played before, and while they are well done, they just feel like I've done them all before.I really wanted to get into Balder's Gate 3 because I played a little D&D 5e about five years ago. But the tactical turn-based combat is just not very exciting to me right now for whatever reason, and I put it down. I thought about playing it on easy mode... but I think I also had trouble enjoying the characters -- which I'm sure is going to make me sound like there's something wrong with me because I know how much everyone is loving the role-playing in that game.I loved FF 9 and X as a kid so I really thought I would find an RPG to relax to.But, idk. It might be that life is hitting me hard. I live alone and I'm in my late 30s and I'm grieving a friendship and -- like a Monday evening used to be the best time to just sink into a game. And now I feel like I can't get into anything.Last year I tried playing FF 12, and I got about halfway through and I was enjoying it, but then I got a little burned out and haven't been able to pick it back up.Other games I enjoyed during the pandemic: Outer Wilds (not 'worlds'), Celeste.I might just be lacking games to play with people. Idk -- would love your ideas.I think the world shutting down and people coming together to support those who were vulnerable heightened the abusive reactions of narcissists, and now narcissists have been so starved for supply that they have gone into overdrive with their vindictive nature.Before the pandemic, I knew some narcissists. They made me laugh, and when they tried to be controlling, I would just laugh and push them away until they calmed down.But I have had to cut people who used to be good friends completely out of my life because they simply could not respect boundaries or treat people as equals.It's like they just completely stopped seeing other people as human beings and became hell-bent on getting the social status they feel they were robbed of for years, no matter the cost to the well-being of people around them.&#x200B;. I believe my best friend's wife has BPD, has been dishonest with me, and has triangulated me multiple times in the past. I believe she enjoyed having power over my narrative and is really good at leaving out details of interactions we've had in order to make me look bad when talking to my friends and family.I've had enough but instead of walking away I want to try and make things work. I told my friend that I wanted to have a conversation with her and with witnesses -- I wanted to clear the air about what has happened and try and set boundaries. My friend got mad at me for not telling her directly (I had tried resolving things with her privately in the past multiple times and always ended up feeling hurt and confused after -- this was well before I knew about BPD).But she declined to have a conversation about boundaries, and instead blew up my claims about things I wanted to talk about **privately** into claims that they were hurtful and inappropriate accusations. This -- to me -- is gaslighting abuse. But at that point, thing were already so bad idk what difference it made.And my best friend never even responded when I asked to talk.I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm trying to get out of quicksand and the more I squirm the most she takes advantage of me.What's more -- I used to perform a lot at a small theater here and I really loved the people and the community, but now I feel incredibly unwelcome because she's established herself as a teacher and showrunner. Many of the people in that community are just regular people, not people who are looking to get famous. They have a nice sense of humor and we like getting together and making each other laugh along with whatever audience we are lucky enough to have. The controlling vibe, the immediate jump to blaming when there's any small issue, I feel like it's dampening the life of the place. I'm trying to decide whether it's worth it to try and make things work in my personal life AND in this place I used to love spending my free time.I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do.People might ask if I know whether or not this person has BPD, but all I can say is that they've said they have abandonment issues, on numerous occasions they've made comments about having to figure out how to make people do things or feel certain ways, and they said they had to start medication in order to curb their panic when they don't feel in control. They regularly invalidated people and said things that made them look bad whenever I tried to say that I wanted to hear them speak or include them, they blamed me or made accusations towards me when I raised small issues, and when I tried to resolve things privately she would break down and cry but wouldn't make it clear why she was upset even though it just seemed like she wanted me to feel bad for her when I was trying to tell her that I felt hurt or confused. So, maybe it's not BPD, but if not I don't know what else would drive someone's behavior to be so persistently confusing and hurtful.I know I need to add text... but I don't know what else to add to this one. I feel like I've been abused but I'm also afraid that people will think I'm crazy if I say that. And I feel like people go and support the abuser when I do that.. I started reading 'walking on eggshells' and while all the descriptions of what I'VE experienced line up with others who have been around someone with BPD have felt (feeling invalidated and blaming myself and afraid of what to say and so on), the descriptions of the pwBPD always have lots of anger. Am I reading the right book, or should I be looking at something about narcissism, or something else, maybe?. There are two big scenarios I dealt with: * Incredibly uncomfortable private one-on-one conversations* Triangulation through "oh don't worry I'll talk to them" instead of allowing everyone to talk to each other* "Talking out of both sides of their mouths" e.g., saying one thing then doing anotherBut outside of that, the "close friend" would be pretty quiet during group discussions, and only spoke up to cut someone off and divert the conversation away from whatever they were talking about.. Marking this is "humor" but I mean it's just for fun. But spoilers are allowed here just in case you make a callback to the base game or DLC.. I was in a creative circle with some people, and my close friend with BPD would never let us assign clear roles. And if someone wanted something, then should would always blame someone else for that thing. "Oh yeah, so and so is a problem". They would never let us bring outside people in to facilitate, or allow agreement, or ask permission. Etc. Is this a BPD symptom, or something else?. I was close with someone who claimed they have "abandonment issues." I see "fear of abandonment" is a common symptom of BPD. But this person -- the entire time I knew them, they came off as an incredibly controlling person. And one time I very, very gently approached them about it, and they claimed that they had to act that way because they have abandonment issues. But this doesn't make sense. It really felt like they were afraid I was trying to stop them from being controlling, and they were just trying to make me feel guilty for doing so. Later I caught this person in some very hurtful lies, and it changed how I saw our past conversations. It made me wonder if the whole thing was a charade and a deliberate manipulation. But I don't know if that's how people with BPD behave. Any thoughts or experiences?. I'm a quiet person, used to being talked over a lot. I was in an environment (a recurring group setting where everyone was close to each other) where the person I suspect has BPD would cut me and others off and divert to something else. When I tried to discuss it privately, I would just be accused of inappropriate behavior. I would say "so and so has lots of experience and I'm interested in hearing what they have to say" and the responses would be "you're trying to take control of the group" or "you're white knighting" or "it's inappropriate to talk about them when they are not here". It was very gross. And then she would cry like I did something to hurt HER by asking these things. And then she would say she had abandonment issues. But it sounded like she had control issues.

Any thoughts?. Someone I know who I used to be close to and who I have many strong reasons to believe has BPD once made me feel like an entire group of people rejected me. This was after years of being devalued and invalidated and seeing them treat other people similarly. I later learned that that group didn't, but of course, I had been avoiding them because of what the BPD-likely person did and it took over 7 months to learn the truth. I thought I might be able to restore the relationship so that we could all acknowledge what happened. Instead, it felt like THEY thought it was abusive to want to have this conversation. And they shut down that conversation. And now -- I don't talk to ANYONE in that group of people. I guess I thought it would make things easier if they would just admit it was a mistake. But now, I'm just so scared they will do it again. Being around them just brings back the traumatic feelings of blaming myself and not being able to talk to anyone. Anyone ever make progress with a person like this? &#x200B;. I'm in my late 30s and realizing that my entire household growing up had \*many\* ADHD symptoms. I'm single and live alone and, while I'm okay fine career-wise and socially, every day is completely different and on any given day, I don't have a clear idea or outline of what my days really need to look like and how much time I need to budget and what I even need to be budgeting for. This might sound like overly dramatic, so let me put it this way. For the last decade, I have had long stretches of waking up and actually having to outline my ideal day in a bullet journal. When to eat. When to exercise. But if I put "Dinner" in a stretch after work, I will do the basic, laziest version, probably ordering out. If I put "morning routine" before work, I'll do some stuff, but forget to floss. I will absolutely miss meals just because I'm not thinking about it, and that leads to further mental disorganization and lack of focus later. My routine outline then gets longer and longer but it gets to a put where I don't have time for everything and it all gets overwhelming. At this point, I feel like I should have systems worked out, ways to save time, what works for me and what I can skip. But... and I want to cry saying this -- I feel like I can't get to that point because I am putting so much energy into just focusing on remembering to follow a list, to write things down, etc. I'm always trying to "get back on track."So -- What do you do? What are things you always make sure you do? How do you remember to get them done? What are you 'habit stacks'? Do you have any 'rules'? Really anything that you can think of, I would greatly greatly appreciate and benefit from. (As I side note, I know that it might not just be ADHD and I could have brain damage or something and I am also always -- well, when I can afford to -- seeking help and trying to get evaluations that might help me understand if I have a disorder or disability and what to do about it. But in the meantime, I just need to hear from other adults what their days and routines are like so I can feel like a normal person. Thank you for understanding <3 ). BG3, TofK... I'm buying these major release games and can't get into them. Any other adults go through this?I haven't played many games over the last 10 years. I loved Celeste and Outer Wilds and CrossCode. But I'm kinda lost now. Everything I play -- it feels like I've played it before.Anyone been through a slump like this?

Hi! I come from the social sector, and finding ethical companies I want to shop from and promote is my M.O. I have compiled LOTS of bookmarks of clothing stores. I was organizing them for a while into a table, capturing whether they are a B Corps (an american social-sector business model), looking at the materials they use in items (usually stores that use higher quality fabrics rather than synthetic ones), or even looking at available sizing (wider shoes, petite or tall sizes, etc).Is there any type of plugin (paid is fine) where I could put in a set of URLs and the plugin could assess the website looking for these types of categories? If this is not the right community for this, let me know! \~ Thank you!!! \~.
    Like you don't love them for sure. You just like don't care for them at all you don't idealize them it's like you borderline don't care about them, but as SOON as they are about to leave or something threatens you having them you're like "fuck that they're mine" type shit. Like you want them to be yours and no one elses?? Even though you could care less about them??. Like...you hurt me? Silent treatment. I'm pissed at you? Silent treatment. You're clingy and annoying? Silent treatment. I just don't like you? Silent treatment. It's literally my go-to, other than like completely degrading the person either passively or just straight up. Man that's kinda fucked actually. But like what else do I do I hate them.. Hii, I know you're like wtf are you doing here if you are someone with NPD and like I know what it looks like, but there's a lot of comorbidities between BPD and NPD, I think yall know. Anyway, something I go through that I'm not sure if any of yall do is like, do you ever feel so hurt emotionally, like its like an indescribable sadness and like emotional pain you can't deal with it so you like cut yourself? But it's not with an intent to hurt yourself or like kill yourself, just to get rid of that emotional pain or alleviate that? Is that a BPD thing? How do I fix that in different ways than just grabbing the random sharp thing? Like what do I do when I feel that emotional wave of like hell and feel like I'm stuck.Okay so it's obvious I'm undiagnosed for anything really but I mean based on a lot of my posts you can tell something's up. I am very confident about having NPD, but It's just I saw this video on youtube describing the internal thoughts of someone with BPD and I relate hard, just not the part where they would do anything for that person because I still put myself first I think. I'd hate to feel like im self-diagnosing anything because I'm NOT, but jesus I've been confused for the longest on what personality disorder I have. I'm not asking for a self diagnosis, more of like asking why am I relating so hard to bpd AND npd?? What's wrong with me? Do I have either or both? I am not diagnosed with either only because I am 17, not old enough to get a diagnosis. I just can't comprehend why and how I am relating so hard to both. I'm probably not even making much sense either I don't think, sorry. I don't know who I am.Okay, I'm shitty. I know that and I'm not mad at it, so feel free to talk shit after you read this. Okay so my friend told me today she has a crush on this girl right, and honestly I was never even thinking about the girl at all, but now that my friend likes her I want to obtain her, and now I think she's kind of fine? I didn't even feel like I had those types of feelings for the same sex before, maybe that's something else, but I genuinely want to introduce myself to her and get her to like me partially because my friend wants her, and now she's super appealing to me and I'm like "Okay she's actually really cool I want her". And I'm gonna just like get to know her and all that but not make it obvious. It's like a game I wanna play or something?? I'm actually an asshole holy shit what the fuck. But I'm gonna talk to her and win her over just for fun. Is this even an NPD thing or am I just a bad person?. I love the rush I get when I meet a new person or something, and I don't mind being with them a lot and dealing with them, but as time goes on and they genuinely seem to wanna get hella close it makes me just drop them altogether. Being in that kind of commitment is 1. Boring. 2. A lot of work. 3. Repulsing...they don't deserve me like that, they aren't on the same level as me to deserve all of that. Anyway anyone relate?. Okay so related to a post I saw earlier here, I just wanted to know like..is it normal for other people with NPD to split like this. Some days I couldn't give a fuck what anyone thinks about me since they're all not better than me anyway, but on the other hand on some days I am the best person there, popular, and hot, being the literal embodiment of the shit. And I will make sure I look good all day while I'm there. I will talk and hang out with anyone I think is worth it and I am the center of the attention. But then there's some days I couldn't give a single fuck about anyone there and will just not really talk to anyone. Is this even a NPD thing or like??. I'm on season 1 right now and I absolutely tried to like Beck but I cannot stand her like she makes me so mad at the world jesus christ I am not gonna be mad whenever she dies. Like seriously you broke up with him and then act like the biggest pick me bitch right after he did hella shit for you like overall he was a good boyfriend. Oh my goddd she acts like the literal biggest pick me annoying bitch I wanna bitchslap her and then get mad when he gets with Karen like shut the fuck up. Couldn't Joe pick someone actually good jesus christ I wanna lose my shit everytime she pops up on the screen I'm loosing days of my life whenever she pops up on the screen and speaks. Goddamn, is there any good love interest/victim...women?? I don't know.Okay so. Im 99.9% sure I have NPD right. Sooo I have these hierarchies. and theres two kinds of people. people above me, people below me. There are only a few people id see as equal to me, but they're like...extensions of me? Like I don't see them as their own person. Anywayyy....When I feel infatuation...obsession...its cause I see them as above me.... not everyone is like that.... like friends, classmates, even certain family members...are already below me, so it's no infatuation phase... it just goes into... okay nice supply, you're just there whatever....and then resentment if they get too close. People I'm infatuated with are different. When I hang out with them more, they are less of a god than I thought they were. And that in itself brings resentment and devaluing, and once they are below me...its kinda over and that's why I have that obsession, discard, hate cycle. They become less and less 'godlike', becoming just another 'supply'...like all my other relationships. Once my feelings of infatuation disappear the cycle of 'discard, hate' begins and this person becomes a completely undesirable individual. Anyway if anyone agrees or it's relatable let me know, or just let me know if I'm a crazy person. That's cool too.. Once in a blue moon id randomly be hella vulnerable with someone, and be super affectionate and it's the closest my mask is to getting off, and then soon after I'd hate them. I mean I know they're already judging me for everything I did and I actually tainted their view of me. That perfect person is now gone and I'm just a flawed mess of insecurity. Yet of course I then come to hate them, not even for that but then I have the audacity to find THEM clingy, and below me. Like I'm not even interested in them anymore after I do it. I decide to just cut them off and not speak to them anymore, even if they truly did nothing.I mean like, maybe? I mean I see people as like..my property....but like do I love them? What does that feel like, maybe I do? I'm so lost like can we actually love people or is that not possible because I don't think I felt love for another person..like what does that feel like? I know I can feel infatuated but I heard that's not the same. Is caring about them love? Is treating them nicely love?. Like I don't know if I'm good at reading people but I always know when my friend who's bipolar is acting different. I then feel like I'm walking on eggshells and the way I treat them changes so I can be in their good graces because my friend tends to get really pissy when she's different. I still need her to like me so I just give her more space, or be reeeeallly nice. Or not try to be annoying ("annoying" to her because when she's like it its like...I cannot explain it) I can't explain it but can you guys ever see a shift in people, even if slightly, and adjust your personality to fit?. It's sooo ironic but I hate when people only like me because of my looks, even though I strive to be as beautiful as I can. It makes me hate them so much, when I'm doing it to myself. I should be happy right? That I'm getting recognized for what I'm striving for? No, I can't be happy. I feel like they're using me, or that they only like me for the social mask I wear outside, even though I never showed them anyone else. I'm mad when they admire the one trait I aspire to be. Why? I am beautiful, why do I hate when people tell me that's one of the reasons they like me?. Complete turnaround from my last post😜, do you guys ever feel so bored, like life has a gray filter over it when there's no person you feel like you need to obtain, someone to obsesses over, someone to keep you entertained? Like I feel like I'm living on autopilot until I find that one person...and like I'm back. And that's when my grandiosity is the highest too. All my thoughts are just about them and its like a game....like a challenge I wanna win. I'm infatuating over them and everything, my life has color. And when I get the person or over that person...it gets boring and gray again...and life is just so unbelievably boring.EDIT: LMFAOOO YALL I FUCKED IT UP I MEANT TO SAY (DO PwNPD EVER FEEL LIKE PEOPLE WITHOUT ARE JUST SENSITIVE) I don't know if it's just me but like people take shit wayyy too seriously. Like they're ACTUALLY hurt by something I said or did and genuinely cry about it? Like get over it no shot you're letting this fuck your day up it's pathetic. Like just cut me off or shut the fuck up. And I don't even really be doing anything. And they really think an apology is going to help how is that gonna help. People who apologize piss me off because you're not sorry you're just saying you are. Anyway yeah, people are genuinely sensitive as fuck and take shit way too seriously.Maybe it's my ASPD traits talking or something but I genuinely think a lot about murdering someone. I know yall are like what the actual fuck but it's like, I just think like if I have to do this, to save myself or someone else I can do it really easily. Is this normal? Like something will probably happen to where I'll have to end up killing someone and I'm honestly fine with it, like I'm glad I know I can do something like that if it came down to it. I'm so ready for this to get downvoted but I just wanted to share. Someone answer if this is even ASPD traits at all or what.So like, does anyone feel like they lose their sense of self...or like they lose their...I hate saying it like their persona whenever they aren't using it much? Like aren't around people for a while? I feel like I become a loser if I don't use it...and I need to interact with people to make sure I still know who I am. Like I can't explain it so I hope someone gets it.I know yall are like what the fuck are you talking about so let me explain. Whenever I get into a argument with someone else on another subreddit the FIRST thing they say is "you're a narcissist so of course you're acting like that ehehe you post on the npd subreddit🤓" SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU'RE FUCKING ARGUING WITH ME MOTHERFUCKER WHAT THE FUCK IM ON THE NPD SUBREDDIT DOESN'T FUCKING MEAN IM INCAPABLE OF HAVING A FUCKING CONTRUCTIVE ARGUMENT DUMB FUCKING BITCH. Anyway that's it bye. I kinda wish they were mentioned again cause I felt like ppl moved past them way too fast. Like the way they lived and were treated were so much harsher than everywhere else. It's like that whole episode was a nightmare. Bro just being silent and your fucking mouth stitched shut? Yeah I'd feel so dehumanized and I can literally say one of the few things I was genuinely scared of frfr. It satisfied me sooo much when Serena's bitch ass was in that immigration thing asking June what she would do. Felt like I was watching season 2 again but everything flipped #1 Serena hater fr. Okay obviously I'm overexaggerating but honestly Jaeden is a really good character he's so cute and he shouldn't of been blown up like that. He was so cute and I felt so bad for him omg :( and I knew something was gonna happen to him but I was praying it wouldn't but of course they'll blow up the more pure character in the show.Like if yall love Gilead so much why don't you Blessed be the fruit your asses to Gilead but yet they're staying their asses in Canada with those dumbass candles.Yall know the blond lady with Luke and she lived with Moria and him...in season 4 where did she go she just disappeared.. He literally doesn't gaf he'll flip on anyone to benefit himself and the government and I kinda liked him at first now I'm like wtf.I mean sure he was manipulative or whatever, but he was just playing the game yall act like he killed someone's cat or sum LMFAOOO like if it was a million dollars, I'd do the same like???. So if you make your own bot or something, something that helps is in the greeting adding dialogue from the character that you think they would say in the scene literally helps so much. That's it.Hey, actually tried to lucid dream last night with my method and did it. But uh it was a little weird. I had a dild ofc but this guy was chasing me. I tried to think "its my lucid dream so he will stop chasing me" and he didn't. So I thought "Im going somewhere with peaceful grass" or something and closed my eyes. He was still there and like he picked me up and I lost lucidity. Help?. Because of some stupid parenting my life is fucked up forever. I’m stuck with this whole fucking personality disorder just because my parents were abusive. Because of their mistakes I’m stuck being a monster my whole life and never feeling like everyone else in society I’m just a pathetic evil person because of stupid parenting.I used my technique last night and Instead of procrastinating I did my technique and got lucid in my dream!! It lasted longer than most of my lucid dreams and I even made sandals on my feet bc the ground was hard😭😭 On a scale of 1-5 my lucidity and control was a good 3.5-4. Hate is a strong word so not exactly that but it’s a hugeeee turn off for any kind of relationships. If I were to be with someone, my Ideal person would just be there for me not show all kinds of lovey dovey affection. I see people who simp as lower than me and why would I date someone who’s below me. Like grow up and stop. That’s it bye. As you all know narcissist can’t have that high sense of self esteem forever and eventually hits rock bottom. That’s where I’m at right now and I haven’t been this depressed since like two years ago. I am a girl so beauty is of high value to me. Today some things was said to me and I feel ugly. So now I’m worthless. No one could ever love me WITH beauty now I don’t have that and I’m done for. I don’t remember how I got my self esteem up when I wasn’t aware but I really don’t want to feel depressed right now. I don’t care.Update: we up yall I’m good again I got some validation 🔥🔥. Maybe it's just me, but I want to see if this is common or not.Hi, I'm new here but Id thought id vent. Yes, I'm a narcissist btw. Why can't I keep a friendship. I do everything right but then something happens, and we aren't friends. When I started my new school, everyone loves me and wanted to be friends with me. Now they all don't like me. I'm not alone though I always have other people to fall back on. But even if nothing happens, I fall out with my friends. I have a feeling they are probably just jealous of me though, but it's still crazy how EVERY FRIENDSHIP I have doesn't work out.So I'm still kind of new to this so control and how long they are is what I need to work on, but just realizing I'm dreaming when I do this method is great. So pretty much the method is when you go to sleep, keep lucid dreaming on your mind and watch lucid dreaming stuff before bed. Then do WBTB but keep LD on your mind then too. This plus consistency pretty much guarantees a DILD and I really don't want people in the comments to smart mouth me saying how this is a method already and this and that. This is my method that works for me whenever I do it and I decided to share it. Its super easy and requires little effort.contrary to the title this was the closest I ever had to a lucid dream since last year. So recently ive been doing spotanious awareness during the day successfully meaning I was doing it almost every hour. Usually, my dreams always have something to do with p\*\*\*philes and r\*\*ists, unfortunately and im not going to get too deep into it but I was at this school I wanted to go to and this girl walked ina classroom with me and said these two teachers r\*ped me and stuff. Later when I went outside, I was like "Am I dreaming?" And everything went sooo clear. Then it went black, and I woke up. Can someone tell me if this is progress and what do I do now. And the reason I even mentioned that is because I wanted to do MILD too but with these dreams I literally can't.So, I recently read a guide on this lucid dreaming method, and he said something about schemas. Before I went to sleep, I would have this vision and then I would always think to myself "yea ima lucid dream". That went away and before right now I couldn't quite get why that would happen. It is because I was associating that vision with LD. If I can do another one like that, maybe I can have a guaranteed one every night. Im sure this is a method somewhere already so im not even gonna try to take credit.. but damn this could work.Hi im starting a lucid dreaming attempt journal where I go over how my body was feeling and what was happening while attempting a lucid dream method and maybe you guys can give me some advice, because when I lurk here, I never know what to ask people so I might as well describe my experience for help. sooo #1 I guess.I'm using [How to become a Lucid Master in 60 days or less : LucidDreaming (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/adlsc4/how_to_become_a_lucid_master_in_60_days_or_less/) for two months.My first day was yesterday and here are notes I wrote the following morning:\-I was too focused and couldn't get to the second stage\-It was hard to go back to sleep in general and to do it I had to give up completely\- Every time I did WBTB these last few days it would be much harder to go back to sleep and ended up staying up having to give up completely. I even took melatonin.So there are two lucid dreams that I still remember clearly to this day, and ive been trying to lucid dream for a while now but I can't. Maybe someone can help find a pattern. So my first one, I went to sleep then all of a sudden there was this bright white light that filled my vision and it felt like it was just there for like 30 minutes then I woke up on the ground of my old school, fully lucid. My second one was I woke up on the ground by a park, immediately lucid. Can anyone please help me figure out how I did that or what method that was.So when I was younger when I used to fall asleep I used to get these images into my head when I’m going to sleep it would be chaotic but I would always know I would have a lucid dream from it. Then one day it stopped and I’ve been trying to get into it again and one time I got the vision. Anyone know what this is what causes it or anyone relate to it at all or am I just weird.Ive been trying for three months straight, using all kinds of techniques, dream journaling, reality checks constantly, use mugwort, and wake back to bed. for some reason I cannot seem to lucid dream anyone help please.
    Zu dem Kind in mir, das kleine 5-jährige verwirrte Mädchen was aus all dem scheiss Streit und dem rumschreien und den Drogen und allem anderen keinen Sinn tun kann: Es tut mir Leid. Du denkst dass das ganze scheiss streiten total sinnlos ist und wünschst es wäre anders. Tut mir Leid man. Tut mir Leid dass ich so bin, und dass die anderen so sind, und dass wir ständig Streit und Stress und Konflikte und Drama verursachen was du alles total sinnlos findest und was dir Angst macht. Tut mir Leid. Ich wünschte es wäre anders. Wir schaffen das. Wir kommen dadurch. Fuck. Tut mir Leid man. 🫂. I feel like something’s not right with my body I need to get to a doctor ASAP ugh :((( I can only go in 2 days tho >.< fuuuuuckkkI don’t wanna die. I rlly fucking don’t My lymph nodes in my throat are swollen for weeks now with on-and-off feelings of sickness or as if I’m catching a cold, and my legs randomly hurt as if I have varicose veins or some shit I don’t wanna have a stroke fuck 😭😭 and I feel kinda sick today without knowing why and just now had a dizzy spell 😭😭😭😭 pls someone help me I don’t wanna die Idk if it’s psychosomatic either, or if I’m in danger man fuck,,,,. Had an okay-ish day, rn I’m in dissociation land but someone in our head just had the idea “hey why not just randomly take some acid and fucking staying up all night so we won’t study tomorrow wooh!! 🥳🥳” guess we won’t do it tho. And also to have an ECG done and to get checked out to make sure my health is ok My primary care doctor sucks I rlly gotta fucking switch himPanic attack (??) again Feeling as if I can’t breathe , fear about my heart being wrong somehowFuuuck 😭. God it’s so fucking obvious. God how the fuck did I not notice this earlier?!I run around all the time and I never stop and I’m never calm because I wanna feel alive. I’m in the city every single day going to some restaurant (or not) being shallow as fuck or fucking up my sleeping rhythm 3 times a week by deliberately leaving the house again at 11 pm so I can randomly drive somewhere with the tram or take a 3 hour long walk or go to a strip club or bar or visit a friend in the middle of the night and do drugs with him and fuck up my academic life and success cuz I’ll come out of it with eye bags of death and unwashed hair and sweaty shirts because I wanna feel *fucking alive*. I’m depressed and that’s why I wanna feel alive because I fucking hate depression and this state of being in a foggy swamp not being able to see or do shit like almost nothing else. Because I can’t fucking stand or tolerate in myself and others this soggy foggy swampy nothingness itch like of being a depressed slouch and not doing shit all day. That’s why I *need* to run around all the fucking time and never stop and never take a break and never process. Just take in take in take in.But it’s all fucking shallow anyway. It’s all just depression in reverse, it doesn’t give me anything, it doesn’t give me any deep feelings or deep talks or deep realizations, I’m just as fucking depressed as I would be if I’d just lay in bed all day doing nothing. Nothing real gets thru to me until……until I take it to an extreme. Until I go to my local BDSM munch and let them beat the shit out of me. Until I go see a play in the theatre that really touches me and makes me sob in the middle of the theatre. Until I do new or more drugs that finally make me fucking *feel* something and that finally make me feel *alive*. Just to finally have this moment again where this fucking pressure drops off of me and I can breathe freely again. Just for a few moments, a minute, an hour, a few seconds.It’s pretty ironic isn’t it? Doing all this shit just to feel something whilst I would feel *the most* if I were to just fucking sit down with my feelings and finally take a break and finally start to process all this shit I’ve done in the past few, idk, weeks, months, years? If I were to just stop running and taking in and numbing myself. Hahah but that’s what I want isn’t it?No it’s not really. Ugh. I’m ashamed and I’m scared. I’m scared of all this shit that will come crashing down on me if I finally sit down and breathe. Im ashamed of myself for never sitting down and breathing and fucking *listening* to whatever my brain is trying to tell me. I’m fucking terrified of my own feelings and my own parts and everything that will eventually break down and crush (crash down on?) me. Even though that would be the safest bet to finally feel alive.. Didn’t think I’d come to this point ever again cuz clearly we are the most recovered and most healed fuck out there 😎 but I think our eating disorder is srsly flairing up again. For real this time lol. We keep saying this every half a year or so but yeah idk. We’re eating less on semi-purpose and we’re using food as a sort of reward thing - if we don’t eat that’s great, that means we can deprave ourselves of food and energy AND get thin and “reward” us later on with nice food after a while. That’s the addicting factor I think Plus the ego boost we used to get from it. Rlly it was a great fucking source of supply and honestly I think the ED was also partially “symptom” of our “outlet” for our narcissism Did any of y’all have EDs? I think it goes very fucking well with NPD just like beer and beer glass or wine and meat or coke and alcohol or tea and hot water go together lol. Everything is so far away even my/our anger 🤬🤬😡😡I fucking hate this shit omgomgomg ahhhhh dlflekekAll just cuz we suppressed our fucking feelings for too long omg I hate thisvstatebughhhh This motherfucking BITCH this PIECE OF SHIT I fucking hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him 😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🙅🙅❌❌❌I can feel several ppl being close to front but also like. Ugh fuuuuck over everything is just this dumbass stupid fucking blank canvas layer 🤬🤬😡😡. Empty rage. This fucking empty rage It feels so empty itchy and antsy and I’m so scratchy and tense and just never calm, never quiet, just wanna run around bc I’m never calm or quiet I rage and I get mad and everything is shit and everyone wants to harm me or do me bad and I rage and rage but it’s never enough !! It’s never enough rage. It’s just so empty. Like a bloody red black void with blood dripping from the walls like tar And the others in my head told me “Kal, look into it, there’s something behind this rage. The void is full and filled to the brim with emotions and yourself. What do you feel behind it, what is it?” And I’m like “fuck you don’t tell me what to do” but also like fuck man, shit they’re right.The empty rage is never full bc it’s itchy antsy shame behind, and feelings of betrayal abandonment and fear and sadness and grief How do I get to those feelings, how tf do I feel themI keep running around never being satisfied and just filled to the brim with this fucking empty rage. I never feel anything else unless after days of struggle where I desperately wanna have other feelings and nothing works until some trigger hits me and I can finally cry and it feels almost orgasmic, so much relief. Fuck you all and your fucking momma you dumb ass cunt bitchy shitty fucking motherfuckers pieces of absolute utter trash and garbage!! 🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻Omfg I hate ppl so fucking much. If those bunches of whiny ass babies can’t fucking take what I’m saying then THATS NOT NY FUCKING FAULT!!! Wtf is WRONG with those dumb cunt suckers!!?????? I fucking hate them dude wtf. DISCLAIMER: No literal asses got kicked. It’s just metaphorical. I have my people for kicking my ass ;) bitch-boy is not one of em There is some weird ass dude in our classes that everyone knows cuz he’s just the strangest fucking weirdo you could’ve seen in a while. Paranoid as hell, vulnerable narcissistic, bitter and envious and passive aggressive as fuck and diagnosed autistic as disability. Oh and unaware as fuck. He recently joined our study WhatsApp group. I texted with him for two fucking days and he just fascinated me cuz he was a paranoid, mentally sick fucked in the head fuck that reminded me so much of my younger self that I started liking him even though I looked down on him and thought he was pathetic as all fucking _hell_. I opened up to him more than I had probably with all others I know in my current Uni lectures, told him I have DID and shit. We talked about mental health shit and at first he thanked me for talking to him so he “wouldn’t have to cry in his pillow at night anymore” and then he fucking blocked me because I let out some alters that were patronizing and belittling but also directly telling him to the face what’s going on with his mental health bullshit. He didn’t fucking like that, cuz the shit I’m telling people stings, even tho its true. And THEN, a day later, he covertly shit-talks me behind my fucking back in some lecture as I just found out and I was fucking INFURIATED AND BURNING WITH HATRED. Oh my god it makes me so mad. And sad. It reminds me of my fucking school days were I got bullied and constantly shit talked about. I feel fucking betrayed and if I see this little bitch irl tomorrow I’m gonna tell him to his fucking face that he should directly face and talk to me, instead of blocking me, excusing all of it with some covert “ohhh I’m too sensitive and I’m sorryyyy, I can’t keep talking to you anymoreeew 🥺🥺🥺” and then FUCKING SHIT TALKING ME BEHIND MY BACK TO MY FRIENDS. I hate this fucking little bitch oh my god Is this rlly what I’ll fucking get for opening up to someone?? Holy fuck I feel so betrayed man Edit: also I should specify that this little bitch is looked down upon by most ppl due to how weird he is. So my image shouldn’t be too broken but srsly man, fuck this dumbass piece of shit motherfucker. It’s a breath of fresh air. We’re nasty disgusting bastard dickheads that stab each other in the back at every opportunity but like… we also get each other. Like no one else probably. And like. I feel at home here. I feel accepted and understood and it’s just nice I just had an argument with my mom where I first raged and was mad as hell and then eventually ended up crying and I kinda partially got thru her defenses and at some point I told her all I want is just a mom or well… *someone* who gets me. Who listens to me and who accepts me and understands meAnd we (me and the headmates) feel better now cuz we at least got some of that shit off our chest And yeah I just wanted to say thanks. We love this community for what it is, fuck man You can be yourself around here and be heard and seen and understood and I wish for us to keep being the backstabbing cheating lying and painfully empathic bastards we are ~~(and maybe heal a bit more on the way)~~Edit: and it feels soooo wrong to tag this shit as “upbeat talk” lmaooo I wish I would’ve tagged it as “venting” just to fucking mess around. Ugh idk I’ve been scared of shit being wrong w my heart all day now Ever since this stupid dumbass K event at the party on Saturday I feel like there’s smth wrong w my heart and I’m terrified terrified terrified ugghhhAlso my blood pressure been too low all day I’m. Scared. Waking up in the middle of the night thinking you’re gonna die is just fucking awesome. Mhhh yeah love that,. Nothing better than this shit Forgot how fun this is cuz we haven’t had it in a while 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥. And they can go fuck off 🤬🤬 everybody !! Dumb fucks 😡😡🤬🤬 pieces of fucking shit garbage dumb trash can fucker. I’ve done like 2 lines of K at a party yesterday night, and after the second line I‘ve started having arrhythmia/an irregular heartbeat (blood measuring thing confirmed that) which lasted for like, hours, and only went away after I slept. :/Can K cause arrhythmia? It was scary as fuck and I didn’t know what to do about it except „sitting (sleeping) it out“. Getting a heart disease is like my worst fear health-wise lmao. Is there anything you can do about it??. Like seriously man, fuck them. 😞☹️😕😞Tired of those I want real human connection, I want warmth and compassion and affection Fuck this shit, don’t wanna anymore. Nope I’m outta here. I feel depressed. I feel sad. I wanna cry and I have this weird fucking feeling stuck up my throat I‘m tired of all this mental health bullshit. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why on God‘s fucking earth was I blessed with so many shitty fucking things? Idk I wanna hug my inner child and I have no fucking idea how to deal with them. Fuck. They’re scared all the time and always have these „nightmares“ which are flashbacks, and they’re constantly stuck in there. Idfk how to deal with them and I wanna tell them that everything is okay Idk why I have so much chaos and drama in my life. I don’t want this shit anymore. Why the fuck can’t I be stable? Why the fuck can‘t I have any more goddamn fucking order in here than anybody else? Idk I don’t understand Why do I have to let myself get beat up and run after weird psychopath men and fuck up my goddamn Uni career and constantly be a fucking. Goddamn. hindrance in my own fucking way?? I don’t want this anymore. And even tho the Flair says „Venting - No Advice Request“ (I rlly don’t like how caged this dumb flair tag makes me feel - what do you mean I can’t vent anymore without having some advice? What happened to the good ol wild r/NPD territory?🤬🤬 Is this lawful country now? Is this „stick up your ass“ land now or what?) if anybody can look thru my bullshit by all means - do it! But only if I respect you lmao But yeah idk everybody whom I even get remotely close to just keeps telling me how very fucking ✨✨special✨✨ I am Maybe I am! I mean who the fuck knows! Maybe I am indeed very fucking special and everyone who says otherwise can go fuck themselves with a pizza up their ass bro. I fucking hate this fucking bitch oh my fucking GOD dude 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😤😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻The fucking AUDACITY Talking all like „ohhh nooo I’m such a terrible victim of my circumstances, I’m soooo pitiful, everything is terrible“ with ZERO fucking self-awareness WHATSOEVER Fucking vulnerable narcs omfg I hate them I hate them I FUCKING HATE THEM 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😤😤🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻The fucking AUDACITY to even fucking EXIST near me????

And it’s the most narcy apology I’ve ever read lmaoo “I’m sorry for having overwhelmed you with my expectations that we’re too high, and it overwhelmed *especially* you”, like wtf lmaooo I don’t even feel that mad tho. Just kinda a mix of disappointed, betrayed, a bit angry, and also grandiose weirdly enough, sickly sweet taste of “he’s thinking abt me, he desires me, he wanted to apologize”And also I want someone to help me make sense of all of this and I wanna shit talk hun to everyone and at the same time not Ugh I’ll have to wait and ponder a few days before I answer him.

Fuck you. Fuck you all. I’m cold and angry and bitter and envious and frustrated. And fed up.Just because this dumb fucking ego is standing in my goddamn way all the time. I screw shit up constantly.

But I’m not gonna succumb into this trashhole of a garbage dumpster fire self pity again. I’m fed up and fucked up. Screw you, fuck you, do something, just do *something*. Don’t care what it is, just do *something*.And then I’ll make a deal with God and sell my soul so I can burn in the entire hell pit of fiery hot soul-bonding sound-fucking ass-bending eternity, and burn this fucking place down and take it all with me.Until I wake up in the morning and see it’s all been the fucking same again, and always has been.

Why the fuck do those fuckers always want ME to give a shit about THEM? Like, wtf? Nope, not me, I’m not gonna care about them bitches, screw them Why do *I* always have to fix everybody and everything?? Fuck you, not gonna do that anymore, it’s exhausting and tiring and feels fake af and I don’t wanna do it, screw yooouuu 😤😤🙅❌. I’m a people-collector. I collect people like others collect stamps or lighters (I actually collect lighters too). I went to a jazz bar yesterday evening and had like two drinks and I was tired as fuck and lowkey felt weird and strange and tense and I listened to the concert those people played and this made me happy and then afterwards I talked to one of the musicians, the bartender, a random girl my age and a random gay dude I met there and who seemed similar to me (they all did) and with whom I exchanged numbers in the end.I barely fucking remember this evening and I felt like another person was at that bar entertaining people listening to music and just generally being there and… existing.I told these people I’m very fucking good at getting to know new people and very fucking bad at keeping contact. This makes me run around irritable as fuck all the time and collect new people constantly. I always want more more more and the new shiny thing I just got two weeks ago isn’t new and shiny anymore and I don’t wanna play with it anymore. The glow has faded and it’s stale and boring now. Kinda. Mostly. After getting to know someone just a little bit better or after having broken their shell.All I want and care about is these people and new shiny toys liking me. I care about you as long as I haven’t gotten thru your shell and as long as you don’t like me but I’m interested in you and I wanna make you like me. If I succeed at that, you’re boring and I wanna go look out for new people and new shiny toys.It’s like. I feel like I’m at a funfair doing a carnival game, in one of those stands where you can shoot those little porcelain stars and depending on how many you’ll get, you’ll get a price. All I care about is shooting as many as possible and getting better at that game and then if I aim and shoot a star and it’s broken, that’s my supply and my praise and validation. The more, the better. The less, the more I wanna get better and be able to hit all of those exact 20 shots next time. The price is you and the price isn’t really interesting to me. The activity is much more fun and the activity is getting to know more people and charming them and making them like me. *Especially* if they’re a challenge and don’t like me at first or they don’t admit they like me. That’s the most fun thing. That’s shooting even tinier porcelain stars which makes it a lot harder but also more fun. (Those fucking dismissive-avoidants 😒😗🙄) I like that. Finally, if I’ve succeeded, I just move on. People are exciting and fascinating and they give me highs and lows and some of them do it *so well* I can’t fucking stop anymore. It’s like an addiction.Idk where I was going with this anymore so I’ll just keep it at this. And I didn’t wanna do it at all in the first place but then I kinda succumbed to it and decided fuck it, why the fuck not. Writing it down so I’ll remember So we had like this piece of rope laid out on the ground and I imagined myself as now and I started crying and then I walked towards the end of the rope with my therapist and imagined myself in 5 years from now. I felt very fucking embarrassed about it and felt blocked doing this shit but somehow still did it Imagined future where I’m living in apartment with cat and maybe partner surrounded by plants working full-time-job in IT and I’m just… calm. I’m comfortable with myself. It was nice and interesting. Because I know I have it in me. This calmness and the ability to heal But the 5 years in between were a tumultuous and chaotic trouble but it’s just.. nice knowing I have this in me man. Ugh idk. It’s just so fucking frustrating. Like, I study maths and a lot of my peers are shy introverted dorks with low self esteem that never really have opinion on shit and just do whatever the fuck you tell them to do. It’s so frustrating and infuriating. I’m someone who has strong opinions on things and who’s loud about them and tells them to people if they ask. For example we’re in a group of 5 people and wanna go grab lunch. Which canteen do we wanna go to? I say: Well, canteen X cuz I think they have Y and I like this and it’s tasty. *Literally nobody fucking else has an opinion* so we just do whatever the fuck I told them to do. It’s so fucking weird because isn’t this what I always want?? Leading people and them doing whatever tf I want them to do?? But it just gives me this weird icky suspicious as hell shame feeling inside. „Like, am I really the only one who has an opinion on this? Why the fuck do they do as I say? I feel ashamed of myself, I don’t wanna run all over them. Am I too dominant? Too loud?“ etc Like, here’s the thing. I still wanna be friends with some of them cuz I like them and some are quite interesting and I just. Don’t wanna end up abusing everybody all the time and being toxic as fuck and running all over them cuz I genuinely wanna get better. But like. HOW THE FUCK DO I DO THIS IF THEY JUST LITERALLY *PROVOKE* ME TO BE THIS WAY AND RUN ALL OVER THEM CUZ THEY DON‘T HAVE AN OPINION ON ANYTHING AND JUST DO AS I SAY ALL THE FUCKING TIME?? 😭😭😭How do you *behave* around ppl like this???It’s like, what the fuck do you want me to SAY, should I just *also* not have an opinion on shit?? So nobody’s taking the leash here?? Or should I just be fine with this?? I’m not fine with it! Just… say SOMETHING MAN!I kinda wanna tickle out their personalities and their opinions on shit but ahhhh idk how to handle stuff like this.Dad, I wish you could read this. I miss you. I’ve figured out a lot since your death and I’ve worked thru even more of fucked up things. (Actually making myself this vulnerable makes me feel sick and I lowkey feel disgusted with myself but whatever.) I’ve loved, hated, been heartbroken, fucked up, betrayed, succeeded, did some things that probably would’ve made you proud and some things you probably would despise and hate and harshly judge me for. I’m listening to my songs from the 70s/80s/90s playlist rn and fuck I think I might start crying. You would’ve loved those. You couldn’t show me how proud you are, Mom is probably right with this. Or you showed it in your own way, idk. I used to have a fuck ton of anger and hatred and contempt for you but actually… I understand you now. A bit better. A lot maybe idk. I miss you. I want you back. But you’re gone. (Rn “One Night in Bangkok” by Murray Head is up. I know you liked this song.)I’m not your little daughter/son/kid anymore that wants to make you proud and is driven by spite and hatred for you and an obsession I didn’t recognize up until lately. I’ve grown up and I’ve seen things and I’ve lived thru a ton of crap in my short life so far. I know you probably still live on in my head somewhere as an Introject, idk maybe (thanks Mud?). And I get you now more than ever before I think. I wish we could’ve made up before you died. Remember that one phone call we had? Where I made you sob? I felt fucking terrified and angry as fuck and powerful as fuck afterwards. I had hope and I thought it was completely pointless to talk to you about all this. I thought “Man, we’re never gonna talk about all this crap that happened”, but I also thought “God, holy shit. That was something new. That was good. Fuck. I feel hopeful. I know we have to talk this thru somewhen. I wanna pity you but I’m not gonna do that cuz FUCK YOU!” and I had my fists up again. I thought you were the end boss and I thought if I could beat you, I could beat anything and everything in the fucking entire goddamn world. I really believed that, like goddamn man. Now I know much more. You live on in myself and my memories and in other people and in lovers and therapists and friends and inanimate objects and events to come. Man I wish I could hug you. I miss you a lot. I love you. I think. Idk man. I don’t know. You’re not the end boss. Well not anymore. Maybe somewhere still, inside, idk. I’ve faced you before, thru myself and thru others.You’re just, like, my Dad. A confused and traumatized old man (thanks u/PoosPapa) who’s lived thru a lot of bullshit (just like me) and wanted to make things better than your father did, I know you wanted to. I know you fucking hated him and despised the shit out of him and he fucked you up real good. Fuck man. It runs in the family huh?Hell I never could’ve said this shit if you were still alive. God knows where the fuck we would be now if you still lived. Man. Fuck you Dad. But also I love you. What the fuck is it always with this fucking narcy thing about admitting love only ever after you don’t have anymore what you love? 🥲 If you hold it in your hands you fucking hate it and throw it away like a hot hard boiled egg you just grabbed straight outta the pot, and if it’s gone you might finally acknowledge shit and miss what you just had. Anyways, Dad. I love you. And I fucking hate you. And screw you man, you stupid bitchass dumbfuck cockroach eating trashcan motherfucker. But also I miss you.And well uh…I’m just like you.We had a flashback or more like, our little had it. Damn I feel so sorry for them and I sat down and told them what u/Emotional-Climate777 told us they do with their littles which is: we told them it’s all just a movie playing and we can make it move faster or slower or make the voices all high pitched and sound funny or turn everybody into colorful plushies and make it all funny and ridiculous.Flashback was something very heavy, probably vaulting box like you have in gym class during high school (?) being pressed into out rib cage and felt like dying. Couldn’t breathe. Though we’ll die. Cried and called for help but nobody came Up until later someone rescued us. Thought we’re dying Have trauma around having sudden heavy “sharp” “pressing against chest” feeling which we sometimes got and thought we were dying and getting a heart attack. Dying Could never get behind this feeling until now Comforted little, tried to ground them and then Gabriel came around and calmed themHe told them they can always call out for him if they’re in trouble and we told them we love them and we’ll always be there for them and we won’t, WON’T let it happen that someone hurts them. If someone should ever hurt them we’re so gonna kick their fucking bitchy ass 😡🤬😤Now sitting in the care being itchy and antsy uncomfortable af irritable and idk what to do abt it. Maybe too much coffee maybe someone not doing well idk can’t get thru to them.you’re the spoiled golden child, the little chick getting everything and everybody she’s ever wanted Having more money really suits me I can buy whatever pretty outfits and dresses and all that shit I ever wanted. Fuck yeah it’s amazing Like others hold me back from spending too much money cuz we shouldn’t use it all up and ppl b getting mad at me for spending hundreds of euros but idc some of it allow it But being the spoiled little baby girl golden child is really nice 😌I wanna be the prettiest, the sexiest, the hottest. We just bought some new outfit and got complimented as “outfit of the day” by an employee and damn it just made us feel so fucking amazing.Spoiled little baby girl that gets spoiled with everything she ever wants and deserves All I need and want and deserve cuz I simply just fucking deserve it Spoiled little bitch baby girl getting her needs met Golden child, golden girl getting satisfied and all her wishes fulfilled Having more money really suits us/me, damn Can get and buy whatever the fuck I wanted and always wished for Nice 😌 love it love it I want more of it and I never want it to stop I wanna wear ALL the pretty outfits and dresses and be a spoiled little golden baby girl chick and hot and amazing and justYeah 😌☺️. I feel like I’m losing it and someday I’m just gonna fucking snap and explode and tear down everything I’ve ever known and loved and take it with me onto an endless spiral of doom. Why always patronizing Why always demonizing Why always belittling others and why always being on top of everything It’s tiring it’s tiring why the fuck should I always do those things it’s so pointless to me so fucking pointless Why not just simply stop doing this bullshit Why always arguing and having conflicts and doing whatever IdkWhy always that and this and that. What the fuck man. Get the goddamn stick outta your ass you fucking bitches. Why in the FUCK and why on heaven’s earth do these fuckers think I’m larping? Yeah I’m having sooo much fun having NPD and DID and I think it’s fucking amazing woohoo!! 🥳 🥳 If someone could present me with a viable reason as to why I should be “larping” having mental disorder then fine, go ahead and tell me! Give me logical reasons as to why I think I’m fucking doing that shit. Bugger off you dumbass fucking bitches If you can’t deal with the way I literally am then that’s not my goddamn fault So I’m larping and playing a role, so what? Nothing is real anyway, have fun with your fucking projection you fucking bitches 😂🤣. Right now i feel like im me and myself like im normal and just me. I feel like ive always been that way and always will be. But when were switching we feel so unstable and mostly when we havent fully switched we're a mould and a mix of several different people at once. Idk whats goibg on its confueing im confused. Yeah I need to bring back order into this system. Like wtf man. Everyone’s having beef with each other like some sour grapes. That’s complete bullshit cuz I KNOW y’all can do better. Just posting here for the others to see. I think us spending so much time on Reddit and the internet is bullshit cuz we really gotta get our goddamn shit together lol. Don’t need supply from this pathetic ass platform, we gotta focus on ourselves. Working on bringing everyone together again.I realized I had FUN with my death anxiety and actually LOVED IT like oh my GOD dude Reminder to self to make post abt it later. If I die right here and right now then so be it. (Except I don’t wanna die lmao fuck lol) I just accept things as they are I’ll have a heck of a bad time if I resist against the experience, even if the experience is… dying Fuck you death, I’m ready for you. Here it comes 💀.
    Anyone here take the route of being like "fuck everybody else" when you realised you have strong cluster b traits? For me I feel like I went through so many cycles of trying to improve myself not for my own benefit but instead for the approval of others who would treat me like dog shit anyway. If my natural state is to be an asshole and I managed to delude myself into thinking I was striving to improve myself then why bother? Why not lean into my narc traits? What if self actualising is being the best narc that I can be?. About the third time in my life I've seen my behaviour for what it is and realised the kind empath persona I think is real is actually all bullshit. I fucking love talking shit about other people and starting drama, and it's because for years of my life this stopped me from needing to put my own assholery under a microscope. I walk around thinking I'm the smartest person in the room, yet actually can't even hold down a job because I'm so arrogant and socially anxious I can't even talk to people normally or ask for help when I need it without just going all woe is me.Being raised by a parent who themself had it stunted my emotional age at what feels like 10. I'm so low functioning that people talk shit about me right in front of me, which is rich considering I can dish it out but can't handle it. As a strategy, when I overheard it I'd non confrontationally approach the person and say "did you say X about me? Have I done something wrong? You can tell me, it's ok" and it would usually be denied. Doesn't help that I faked being psychotic a few years ago (somehow tricked the hospital I went to into buying it, although honestly I think most of them there were actually onto why I was doing it but had to treat what I was presenting with anyway) to deliberately throw out a red herring and create some benefit of the doubt with friends who I treated like objects. Despite having narcissistic tendencies I'm very easy to read and I'm very easily manipulated, particularly if someone feeds the idea that I'm this bullshit version of myself.There's noone I can dupe anymore, people have known what I'm like for years and despite having repeated instances where I've gained this self awareness, I am incapable of changing despite multiple attempts in my life: it's too fucking hard to rewrite my personality and I too easily slip back into self delusion, plus cannot care about someone other than myself unless it benefits my reputation. I'm about to lose my job, I can't maintain any genuine human interactions and any that I do is because I guilt trap the other party into feeling sorry for me.There's no point, this cycle will just repeat and again again, everyone will just continue to be disappointed by me being me. Im stopping this shit come September. Hiya, Long term pattern in my life of only really being good at studying with everything else including interpersonal relationships, self care and work being a massive up hill battle. I've known there's something different about me since I was quite young (I was very emotionally sensitive and struggled holding on to friends) and when anxiety really ramped up in my early 20s it became more of a thought to actually pinpoint what it is that's causing what mainly seems to be social defects.Having study as something in my life that I excelled at, being "smart" became a core part of my self identity, to the point where I'd try to fill this role by harping on about things I actually know nothing about (at my current age in my late 20s people see right through this). I tick a few of the criteria for ASD being really overwhelmed in loud places, socially awkward, repeat things others have said (or movie quotes) verbatim in other conversations, poor emotional regulation, have stimmed since I was very young and continue to rock back and forth when trying to sleep, but have an assessment booked later this year to get more certainty around this.Thing is, I think I'm either more on the spectrum than I had initially given myself credit for or behaving in an arrogant way to compensate for my perceived and actual social rejections (or both). In so many of my interactions there have been occasions where people are just humouring me like a child who gets their art class drawing hung up on the fridge, while they visibly hold back laughter when I try act like some emotionally intelligent genius who's figured everything out or I hear back about what they actually think, or worst case, people end up talking about me while I'm in the room like I'm not even there about how dealing with me is like dealing with a 10 year old or otherwise. There's also a history of saying some inconsiderate things to others without intending to. I feel so alone in this, like everyone can see clearly there's something wrong with me while I'm thinking I'm just acting normally. I don't know if it's the autism spectrum at play or if I'm just an asshole using this as a way to be the victim in the situation.Can anyone here relate to these sorts of experiences? Really appreciate any thoughts on this that can be offered. Hi there! Just having a bit of a think for down the line in terms of either going industry or academia after graduation. What are the big stresses in an industry job vs academia? Currently I feel like I'm a better fit for academia as I tend to prefer problems that can afford the time to explore them deeply, rather than getting quick solutions that work well enough. Having said that, I feel my research isn't particularly creative and is more about applications of preexisting things to new settings.Any insights are greatly appreciated :). Howdy! I've got an optimal control problem in dymos where I want to input a known (and unmanipulated) data vector that has entries at different time points which goes into one of my state equations.Anyone know the syntax for putting this in as a parameter?Cheers.Hiya! I'm trying to install pyopt sparse using mingw and it's doing my head in. In mingw I seem to even have troubles with getting numpy set up as a pre req using "pip install numpy". It keeps failing when trying to set up the wheel. Anyone have some insights and some tips for getting this sorted? Cheers. Hi there, I'm looking for a way to reliably and within a reasonable time solve large scale optimal control problems for a somewhat nasty Non linear model of about 5-10 states. As far as I'm aware, non linear programming with orthogonal collocation is currently the best way to do this, I've used Gekko to try get some decent results but it unfortunately doesn't reach a solution. Have I missed a better way to solve these problems? The methods I've been using at the moment only get me so far (multiple shooting, collocation, etc). Thanks in advance :). Heyo! In a bit of a tough spot at the moment with work. Basically was relatively new to the group and never really ever ended up properly fitting in, which is ok, but now I'm stuck in a spot where coworkers are nice to my face but complain about me behind my back and it stings when I overhear it or it gets back to me. Meditation is something that helps a lot, but I find I fall into the trap of pushing down all this anger instead of acknowledging it and letting it pass. I want to not care as a way of petty vengeance rather than letting it go for my own sake at the moment. Also I find it a bit challenging to be professional despite having an idea of what someone really thinks of me. Anyone have any experience with this and how meditation helped them through it? :). I have just clued into the fact that every time I am in a new situation, social or work, I seem to be showing off as a way to get approval from others. I like to talk about what I've been working on, show people my stuff and ask for help on things, sometimes even start a conversation on something I don't really know about. I think I do this to try to get other people to like me or to counter feelings of inadequacy. Until now, I subconsciously pick up on people recting negatively to this behaviour, at which point I become paranoid, anxious and obsessed with the negative evaluations others may have of me. Is this NPD?. Hi all, was wondering if I could get a better understanding of the PSF in MPI and how to calculate it. Hoping someone who knows their stuff about magnetic fields can come to the rescue here.If I calculated the magnetization as a function of time, M(t), after applying a magnetic field, H(t) to a batch of magnetic particles, how could I numerically calculate the PSF?I’m seeing that one way is to get dmdH, just wondering what the best way is to do it numerically. There seems to be some papers suggesting using a Fourier Transform but I can’t wrap my head around how.Cheers!. What do we do? Will enough people be angry to ensure we all make it? Based on what we know about his current policy, this might be the reality; more homeless pumped onto our streets and no hope of paying the next few weeks rent. Either way, looks like the plan of Neville Power is to make us all work on the front lines of mask factories, centrelink offices and woolworths. I hope I’m wrong.Really hoping for that rent and mortgage freeze, I'll tell ya.From my understanding we're taking less measures nationally than Italy was when they were this far in: schools are still open for one, and public spaces are still full (shopping malls), pubs and clubs operating like nothing's wrong. On top of that I suspect there's a substantial difference between the actual amount of people infected and what we're seeing in terms of numbers. I don't think it's safe to be going out in public without good reason anymore.I'm being told I'm paranoid and should still get out and about; locking myself in is not appropriate. They think I'm paying too much attention to the internet. I think they just don't want to acknowledge what a serious situation we are heading for and how easily it is to get infected.If you can poke holes in either side's logic, please do. Straight up just want an accurate idea of what will happen.Hi there! Chemical engineer here with some background in electrical eng/signal analysis. I’m wondering what are some good resources to progress towards an undergrad understanding of physics. Where exactly should I start and where should I go with my textbook readings. I’ve got some free time and I’m particularly interested in gaining a better understanding of theoretical physics at some point for a fun hobby.Cheers!. Hi there! I’ve done a bit of job searching lately but all I see for process control is at a senior level and they require experience with PLC’s. Does anyone know of good graduate process control programs in Australia? (or internationally, I’d be down for some relocation). Or is it something that you have to work your way up into? Cheers!. Hi there!Just wondering if there’s any general advice for getting simulink to run faster. We have been given a process model simulink file that we can’t change. We are to design different controllers around this model. My simulink is running painfully slow. Any suggestions? Cheers.Hi all, trying to learn about model predictive control from a design and mathematical point of view. Anyone got any good resources? Cheers. Hi all, just wondering if anyone knows about companies that have a process control division in Australia. Most companies I’ve spoken to say they only do minimal amounts of it. Any help is greatly appreciated. Cheers!. Hi all, just started an advanced process control course and I’m running into trouble with the linear algebra. How would I derive the state space matrices of x(k+1) = A1x(k) + B1u(k) where A1 and B1 are in terms of A and B from above.
    I think this question should be quite interesting and diverse; but I could be wrong. Using myself as an example; I was picked on in school by several other girls from about ages 10-14; and from about the age of 12 I started being a bully to others as well. My last couple of years at school were probably the worst when it came to being downright nasty and I used to pick on this boy who hung around with my friends for whatever reason (he was a few years younger) for being gay (this was considered acceptable in the time and place to become a bullying target). In retrospect, Sam at least was probably a target because he was small and weak, and was from a much wealthier and better family than my own; so it was probably jealousy.So I have been in a rough spot lately. My chemotherapy meds have been changed; as they were making no difference. For reference I have stage 3b thymic carcinoma and stage 2A/b cervical cancer (trust my luck to get two unrelated cancers at once at 27 years old; especially given the fact that I was wanting to be a boy growing up- more so to avoid the sex abuse and trafficking for drugs from my dad. So that would have eliminated the cervical cancer. But things were very different back then- at least in the country and culture I grew up in. So I identify as she/her. This new drug I’ve been on for 2/3 weeks and I take it every day- knowing full well that the type C thymoma will kill me at this stage. And I’ve had every side effect under the sun. I’ve either got gushing diarrhoea that I can’t always make it to the toilet before: and as such have lost many pairs of undies- I’m constantly vomiting, fever, chills, night sweats and muscle aches spasms to the next level. For reference I have a very rare musclo-skeletal condition called HSD; it comes under the Elhers Danlos Syndrome banner. It’s genetic and the only advantages I’ve found in my life with it is that I can bend into all kinds of positions for sex (which I no longer have interest in) and that my skin tattoos extraordinarily well (because it basically makes my skin feel like velvet; the closest I can compare it to is baby skin). Aside from the acne that I’ve been dealing with since my cancer treatment occurred. Today I was scrolling through TikTok wasting time (I’m in +8 Timezone so it’s currently 10pm) at about 8pm and felt my knee slip out. Not sideways which I can reduce myself; but down over my shin bone. I rang the local hospital but they said there was no one in town who knows how to use an X-ray machine and the closest place that *may* or *may not* have a doctor over the weekend (the same place I go to for chemo during the week when they have a doctor) My patella (knee cap) slipped down onto my actual shin bone. It took a long time to get back into place. I live alone and drive a manual (stick shift) so need both legs and because it’s my left leg; then I can’t ride my motorcycle either. Plus that my car is currently without headlights on dangerous winding unlit roads with no speed limit. Unfortunately the ambulance is not available this week. So I’ve taken a shit ton of Valium to Hope that helps. After all my ramblings; if anyone is still here; have you had issues with major joints dislocating? This is an extremely odd way for a knee to dislocate especially while at rest on my bed. Is this something that I have to look forward to with some kinds of chemo? My leg is still spasming despite taking equalivant 150mg morphine (my regular nightly dose) and 120mg Valium. I’m scared to wake up to it again as it took nearly an hour to replace and my leg is very swollen to about twice it’s size (I’ve always been an hourglass shape but it’s so swollen that the skin is red and splitting a bit) along with a 30x20cm black bruise on my knee and upper shin bone. Anyone else experienced this with chemo? I hate the new drug but the other one was helping so little with either the primary masses or Mets that I might as well have just stopped it altogether. So I have a stage 3b cancer; doctors are very hesitant to talk about survival rates because it is a very rare cancer; especially in young women. But from what I’ve read online (I know- bad idea) from reputable sources the five year relative survival rate is approximately 33%. This was from a source in Japan relatively recently so while I don’t know much about Japan and less about their medical system; my guess is that it would be Western style, and pretty high quality. I’m having treatment but it doesn’t seem to be helping; much. I’m not currently depressed; I want to preface that. Im not sleeping a lot because I’m depressed or down. Im finding myself either sleeping or dozing 16-20 hours a day over the last couple of weeks more and more. Even before my diagnosis I was diagnosed with a heart issue that causes intermittent ventricular tachycardia which is scary. My oncologist doesn’t want to do surgery as she says it’s too much of a risk in surgery and it’s spread too far. I’ve seen a lot of people die through my work; and I’m concerned that this constant need for sleep/dozing is a sign that the cancer has taken a turn for the worse and that I’m going to be in the 67% sooner rather than later 😥. It’s currently 3:06AM and I’ve just been woken up by constant hiccups. No unusual nausea or anything. Just hiccups that won’t go away. Is this a normal or at least semi expected side effect of chemo? I have had reflux for years, but don’t remember having hiccups since I was a kid; and I’ll be 28 in November.I’m female if that helps. I was extensively sexually abused by my very mentally unwell father from toddlerhood- he abused me until I was 18. As a result I became extremely hyper sexual and have always gotten a lot of physical enjoyment out of sex. I was a nymphomaniac for lack of a better term. My partner of six years was also as sexually driven as me (think 15+ times a day)Since my cancer diagnosis; I’ve had next to no interest in sex, and my boyfriend cheated on me for months and then left me as a result of my lack of interest in intimacy. (This absolutely destroyed me as I thought he was forever; and just before my diagnosis he was talking very seriously about marriage and having a family). I can’t even manage to climax on my own on the very rare occasion now that I do feel frisky; let alone with another person. It’s incredibly frustrating. Like it feels good and all; but that’s it. Before the diagnosis I never had this problem. Quite the opposite actually. This problem started before I started treatment but has only gotten worse since I did. It might sound dumb but I’m only in my 20s and it’s been a very important aspect of my adult life and so I don’t know what to do. Is this normal? Will it go back to normal following my treatment (assuming cancer doesn’t kill me?)has anyone else dealt with this or similar?I’m sorry if this post is considered inappropriate- admin feel free to delete if you so choose.I feel like a fucking pin cushion. I’ve got a range of more tests tomorrow to figure out why I feel **extra** awful. Nothing else. Just sick of being sticked constantly; whether it’s tests or treatment related. It fucking sucks.Basically the title. Today I’m travelling with my dog in tow; for about a six hour drive to stay overnight before coming home after the appointment (I’m typing this in the drivers seat having packed up everything I *think* I need- I’m sure to have forgotten something though) My symptoms have become much worse and spread much further and I’m concerned that this means that it’s spreading. So under duress and pressure from my friend; I’ve got another appointment tomorrow lunchtime. The weather is overcast and stormy- hopefully it’s not an omen of the situation. Fuck this.Does anyone have any recommendations for movies (or better yet, TV shows) for when you’re stuck in bed/on the couch and need to pass time?I have a pretty wide, but oddly picky range of preference; I typically prefer character driven storylines but not exclusively. My overall favourite comfort show is House MD- but mostly because I can relate aspects of my own temperament both towards House and Wilson; and how they were both flawed but genuinely, generally doing their best to be good people in their own ways. But I’m halfway through rewatching season 8 and really don’t feel like going through watching the whole Wilson’s cancer arc right now. So House is on the backburner for the time being. I tried watching other medical shows thinking they might be alike (Greys Anatomy, Scrubs, the good doctor, etc) but foundd (personally) the primary characters to be a schtick of either all good or all villain; and I personally like more flawed heroes/main characters (I was always more a Batman than a Superman kid) I like lighthearted comedy; and have recently watched The Office US, Man Down (the UK comedy show with Greg Davies, not the movie), the Inbetweeners (UK), and Modern Family. As far as movies go; think cheesy cheap 90s Adam Sandler as a template 🤣Usually I prefer more UK based comedy style in shows, but I’m open to suggestions for most things. I’ve cancelled my Netflix for now, but will probably end up reactivating it as I’m running low on DVDs I haven’t watched lately. Any suggestions? Hoping this makes sense. Im not feeling too great and also fighting off a terrible infection with no immune system 🙄. My neighbours are currently screaming obscenities over the fence at my German Shepherd; stirring him up more. We’ve only spoken once when they tried to bait my dingo. Now I ain’t got nothing left except my dog; and I’m an extremely intelligent; but calculating and tenacious woman who only has my dog; and I have been incarcerated before, and I fight like a junkyard dog. I’ve got nothing left in my life, got no conscience and I’m always packing. Neighbours at number 27 if you see this- take it as a warning. Don’t try and pull any stupid shit like last time.I just saw the doctor- I’ll see her again in two months time on 25/10 to re-evaluate surgery to remove one of the cancers. I’m just really fucking sick of this (his name). I’m sick of being sick, I’m sick of the physical and mental agony, I’m sick of isolation, and of having no purpose and not being able to take care of myself anymore because I am sick and depressed. I’m sick of the constant misery. I’m sick of not having a purpose and my dog being my only protective factor. I’m sick of the treatment and not knowing the future. The specialist wants me to consider getting support work to help. I despise the idea of asking for help and losing my pride despite knowing it’s the reasonable and responsible choice right now. I’m on the edge and can’t see a way out… I wish I had never taken the treatment and just let it all go. I’m so exhausted with no reprieve.I can’t deal with this shit anymore. 27f- dx about six months ago and up until now had been pretty firmly in the denial stage. Just going through the motions.But depression has hit in the last week or so and it has hit *hard*. I live alone and all my friends are hundreds of miles away. I’m almost always too sick to drive that far; and my best friend doesn’t drive and the others all work 6 days a week, 10-14 hour days. I have my dog, a German Shepherd (named Bear- hence the username) but otherwise we’re alone. I live in a small community of about 300 people and I’m too embarrassed about the way I look to go out. Plus that I’m a recovering pain pill and benzo addict (coping from both chronic pain from losing a huge chunk of muscle in my thigh from a (probable) desert whip snake bite last year; and to try and cope with extreme and extended CSA and trafficking trauma); so my tolerance for those medications to calm my mind and anxiety is superhuman. I’ve been in and off anti depressants for 10 years and they don’t help me unfortunately. The only people I interact with on a regular basis in person are my GP (who I at least have a good rapport with and can talk about other things- we’re both very nerdy for example), the specialist and the staff at the treating hospital. I feel so alone, and vulnerable. I’m not scared of death, I never really have been (always been a next level daredevil); but I am scared of *how* I’m likely to die. I want connection with other people; but I’m partially terrified of connection (that likely links back to the CSA), and I feel ugly and unloveable. This probably makes next to no sense, sorry. My head is foggy and hurts, the pain is extra bad today and I’m not thinking straight. Anyway this is my first post; so hi I guess.*Im logging off now. I’m in hospital getting chemo right now and it’s hitting me harder than usual. I’m taking a nap. Feel free to argue amongst yourselves but I’ve got enough of a headache without this*So many of these posts are just sad bois complaining about women or that nobody wants to date them. And an echo chamber of blaming women or arbitrary personality traits off of a 20 minute free online quiz as to why they’re all alone. You’re not entitled to anyone or anything in your life. Especially women. And being so judgmental about a woman’s past etc. No wonder so many of you are alone. Would you want to be with someone who is pathetic and refuses to do anything productive with their lives or improve themselves?If you want to change something then just do it. Forget the stupid excuses. INTJ out.Someone told me this recently, a friend, and it popped into my head while I was driving home today. At least to me- it feels profound, and vulnerable.I’m 27F for reference. I’m also an MD which makes this seem (from a logical perspective) even more ridiculous. I was fairly recently diagnosed by a psychiatrist with narcissism and antisocial behaviour/traits. That’s fine; I don’t care. I have both African American and Native American ancestry; and for the last 12 years since I was kicked out of home have struggled. Being a teenager in an orphanage with many staff who really… “took a liking to me” was hard. Something that’s relevant is that my pride and joy is my hair; it is thin but exceptionally dense (so much so that every time I have been to a hairdresser they call over all their staff to admire it), dark, long enough I can sit on it, and naturally ringlet 3b curls. I put a lot of work, effort and money into my hair. It really is something special. Last Wednesday I found out that I have stage 3 cancer; and on Thursday I am going to see an oncologist. I’ve done my research (as obviously I can correctly interpret peer reviewed medical journals, studies etc). I know that her recommendation will be rounds and rounds of chemo radiation therapies; otherwise I probably have about 5-6months. Obviously I will get the treatment; but is it weird that I am more upset about being bald and losing my figure (big boobs, narrow waist and wide hips with a good butt) than I am about dying or how sick I will be from intense treatment? Have any (especially women) in here had cancer and felt the same? And if anyone knows of good quality wigs on Amazon that do international shipping I’d be very grateful ☺️.
    I'd like to look on the bright side today, I want to hear about just one thing that you are appreciative of for having in your life. It could a friend, a loved one, maybe your car or a favorite place to eat. Whatever it may be, just briefly share it here!. I had her for 5 years, raised her from since she was a baby. She was a Red Crowned Amazon, the most beautiful thing on earth. I loved her and now she's gone forever, never even got to say goodbye. She's gone forever just like that, in a couple seconds. Lately I've fallen back into being more lonely and reclusive, my old ways. And now this happened and honestly it's the cherry on top. Whenever I had nobody, she was there for me. She'd sleep on my chest and it'd be the worst sleep for me in all honesty cause I couldn't move much. But it felt good to not be alone. And now I'm in my bed, all alone. The guilt and sadness won't leave. What is the point? I'm such a fucking idiot to think any of this gets better. Why can't I talk to people? Why can't I feel a goddamn fucking thing in my heart? Why does none of any of this, Life, make an inkling of sense? I feel like I'm insane, legitimately insane.
    Ok so I’ve never been diagnosed with ocd but I do have health anxiety which has symptoms similar to ocd and I do tend to have obsessive thoughts that I can’t seem to get out of my head.The most recent one of these is constantly imagining myself from the third person. And not voluntarily, like the image will just pop into my head. It’s really starting to annoy me bc it makes me feel like I’m outside my body looking in on myself which makes me feel depersonalised, and it gives me the same kinda feeling you get when you’re being watched, it’s really uncomfortable and unnerving. Has anyone else ever gotten this and how have you coped with it?. Ok so I’m doing a degree in commerce and I’ve never really been doing as well as I want to be, I’ve been in a constant state of “once I get my shit together”. Had some bad anxiety earlier this year that impacted my study and made me feel even worse abt my lack of success. Anyway so this friend is doing a degree in a field unrelated to business and she gets into the most prestigious consulting group in my uni. I actually felt sick when she told me bc how tf is it fair that someone doing a completely different degree is doing better than I am IN MY OWN FIELD! She has mentioned multiple times in a haha funny way that she just kinda makes shit up when they start talking abt super business stuff. And don’t get me wrong she’s smart but it’s unfair bc 1 her major is a lot easier than mine, I did a class in it and got a distinction without watching a single lecture and 2 she literally doesn’t have a job so of course it’s easier for her to do all these extra internships and get great marks. This literally makes me sound like the worst friend in the world but whenever she brings it up I’m just like 😀 greattttt so cooolAnyway I started going to a therapist for some unrelated issues but how do I bring this up without just like completely changing the subject out of no where. Obviously I’m not the first person here to criticise her but I can’t get over how narrow her vid on low grade npd is. She basically just describes someone immature and annoying. All the traits are the most surface level “they love social media”, “they don’t clean up after themselves”, “they care too much about there looks” “they’re obsessed with celebrities”. It’s actually cartoonish.Low grade npd can range from like she said a slack parent who only partakes in the fun parts of parenting to a overbearing parent who will go above and beyond to make sure their kid is perfect bc they are a reflection of themselves. It can be constantly needing a romantic partner for validation or avoiding romantic relationships out of a crippling fear of rejection. It can be slacking on “adult tasks” or micromanaging your household to prove your competency.I just watched healNPD’s video on how ppl with npd often get health/illness anxiety and I was wondering if any of you get this?Personally I’ve had a lot of health anxiety for a while, and I have always thought that it had something to do with my need for perfection, need for control, need to be be successful and incredibly high standards I hold myself to, bc obviously having a horrible disease or condition would hold me back from all those things. It makes a lot of sense bc I don’t have much medical trauma or anything else I could think of that would cause this obsession with my health.I often find myself hating teen dramas, especially set in highschool that are supposed to be “relatable” bc I get so jealous and insecure abt the characters having a more interesting highschool experience than I did. It’s actually an issue, I stopped watching stranger things when they all got into relationships bc how the fuck is eleven in a relationship yet I’m not, stopped watching sex education for the same reason, and there’s countless tv shows I won’t even try bc I know I’ll hate them for that reason. Also often when watching tv shows or movies I come to despise the “main character” or the person who is supposed to be the “good guy”. Some examples:- Aria from pll - Scott and Allison from teen wolf- Serena and Dan from gossip girl- Daenerys from got- rhaenyra from hotd- Spider-Man- Every single character in riverdale- Nancy and Jonathan stranger things- Rachael from friends- Jane from Jane the virgin (couldn’t get past ep1)-Rory from Gilmore girls (again couldn’t get past ep 1)- Haven’t even bothered watching vampire diaries bc I know I’m gonna hate Elena - Luke skywalker- Gabriella from hsm - Literally every single main character from any Disney or Nickelodeon show (especially the female ones for some reason)Sometimes I worry I have internalised misogyny but then I do have an unhealthy obsession with female “villains” or women with issues like Blair Waldorf, Cersei Lannister, Alicent Hightower, spencer Hastings, Jade from victorious, fallon carrington from dynasty and sharpay evensAnyway just rambling bc I need to get my hatred for these characters out somehow. If anyone has any show recommendations lmk lol. The way I become incredibly anxious, intimidated and basically just seize up around anyone who has a higher social status than me, or is in a position of power above me or who I view as higher up the hierarchy of whatever situation I’m in is so pathetic it’s embarrassing. Its as tho I switch from grandiose to vulnerable depending on how I view/the status of the ppl around me. It’s gotten better after highschool bc there’s less social hierarchy but it still sucks at work bc I can never be the confident outgoing version of myself, or have a decent relationship with my bosses bc of this. And I can never actually impress the ppl I care to impress, only looser I don’t particularly want to associate myself with 😂. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship so obviously I don’t have personal experience with heartbreak or relationships issues (apart from my best friend of 3 yrs ghosting me), and I dunno if it’s lack of empathy or something but I genuinely don’t understand a lot of ppls relationships issues. Like whenever someone get really upset abt their relationship I can’t help but think either it isn’t that bad and you should get over it or it is that bad and break up. Like currently my sister is heartbroken over some guy she never even dated and I just don’t get it? I know it’s wrong and I should never blame the victim but whenever someone starts talking abt the way they were treated in a past relationship I can’t help but judge them for staying in the first place. Like I saw someone on another sub post abt how their abusive ex straight up told them a month into the relationship that they abused every person they were with, and it makes it hard to even feel sympathy for them bc why tf would you even stay after that?. So it seems as tho ppl with npd often didn’t suspect they had it or self diagnose themselves with it, and that they can be in denial when they do get diagnosed with it. And ppl seem to blame this entirely on the narcissism but I can’t help feel as tho the way the media talks abt npd must be a slight contributing factor. Like if you search up npd on YouTube or tiktok or any other social media 90% of the results focus on spotting and diagnosing npd in others. Stuff like “how to tell if your ex is a narc”, etc. Contrast this to how bpd or adhd or bipolar is talked abt where it’s focused on whether you have it with stuff like “what it’s like living with __”. Like are we really surprised that no one is self aware when the way npd is talked abt doesn’t promote self reflection and instead just encourages ppl to point the accusatory finger at others?. Curious to see if there’s anything certain things that actually make you feel empathy?Like seeing other ppl emotionally suffering doesn’t make me emotionally suffer. (Although it does make me uncomfortable bc now I have to comfort them and I’m not very good at that) However there are some things that make me feel:1) physical pain, I hate seeing ppl get physical hurt, I hate watching “funny” fail vids where ppl get hurt, it just grosses me out.2) wholesome videos, like the ones that are supposed to restore your faith in humanity, they makes me happy3) movies, sad movies make me sad The more I think abt empathy the more it confuses me, why does a video of a child I don’t even know beating cancer make me feel but my friend crying in front of me doesn’t?. Ok so I have a very high opinion of myself. I basically think I’m better than the large majority of ppl overall. I definitely think I’m self righteous, and I do curse a lot (not sure how that relates).I’ve always been a chronic daydreamer, and the daydreams always involve an alternate universe where I’m super rich, famous and/or powerful, with a great partner and great friends. I often get a kick out of feeling powerful, like when I can tell someone is intimidated by me, or I’m put in a position of authority.The thought of living an average life where I never amount to much terrifies me. I recently turned 21 and I feel like I’m spiraling bc I haven’t achieved the level of success I dreamed of. I do feel entitled to opportunities I don’t have the grades for, but I understand why they can’t break the rules for me.I find myself getting incredibly jealous of ppl when they achieve something or get complimented, I don’t feel happy for them. I don’t resent them for their achievements but sometimes I do have to remind myself of their flaws just to reassure myself.I’ve also started questioning whether I actually feel emotional empathy, I definitely feel cognitive empathy, but I don’t actually feel sad when someone else feels sad. I have also always thought I was slightly emotionally stunted, like when I get bad news abt someone else I always feel like I’m more focused on how I’m acting than actually feeling.That being said none of this has ever caused me any issues externally. I’ve always been good at keeping friends, and my friends never have issues with me. I also hate loosing friends and see having a lot of friends as a flex so. I’m also genuinely interested in their lives. I guess I’m very conscious of how I’m perceived so I make sure not to boast, or put others down to bring myself up, not to show I’m envious of their accomplishments, not to show I think they’re just not as good as me. I’m also not very quick to anger, I’m not vengeful and tend to be relatively resilient. I can brush off criticism relatively easily although I’ve never had anyone say anything genuinely insulting abt who I am as a person so I don’t know how I would respond if they did. Anyway am I a narcissist or am I just going through a quarter life crisis lolNPI -28, codependency- 1, ocd-4. Basically the title. Is anyone here good at hiding their narcissism feelings or tendencies around their friends bc they know loosing friends would be too much of a blow to the ego. Does anyone keep a decent amount friends for a long time without getting bored of them? Does anyone have some interest in their friends lives even if they don’t majorly care?. Ok so what Kim said on that phone call was just wrong, period. But I can’t pretend that I wouldn’t be fed up if I was Kim.For one the whole issue abt d&g made no sense, and the way kourtney kept trying to turn it on Kim and psychoanalyse her to say that she was wrong for being ambitious and wanting to challenge herself was really weird and annoying. Especially when she wanted to have that useless conversation she wrote notes for, only for the notes to not include a single thing abt how she feels and to be basically be trying to give Kim a therapy session and once again imply there’s something inherently wrong with her bc she’s ambitious.Then with the phone call, kourtney brings up the looks and aesthetics only to argue that it’s got nothing to do with that two seconds later? Then go straight into calling her egotistical, selfish and attention seeking when the conversation up until that point had been relatively civil, and accuse her of not being happy for her at her wedding. I’m mot surprised Kim snapped when kourtney has been implying for ages that Kim is fundamentally flawed and unfulfilled for wanting to challenge herself.As an older sister I understand it can build resentment watching a younger sister become more “successful” than you, but I’d never demonise my younger sister for wanting to be successful. And the therapy doesn’t seem to be helping bc that’s the kinda thing they should be working on. If kourtney is as fulfilled and focused more on what truly matter than money as she claims, why did the d&g thing even matter? And why does it matter that Kim wants to challenge herself?. Just took my first dose of propranolol and now I’m freaking out thinking it’s going to kill me. Which is literally so stupid bc I have previously been on this medication for months and I never died. Like I can think logically but for some reason never believe it.If anyone is struggling with health anxiety I highly recommend Cherellethinks on YouTube. Her entire channel is dedicated to health anxiety talking abt her experience with it, physical symptoms from it, specific fears, tips on how to overcome it. She has loads of videos explaining basically every symptom you can think of and how anxiety can cause it. Her videos have actually helped me so much bc the more you understand health anxiety the easier it is to overcome.Ok so for the past month or so I’ve just had this semi constant dizzy/vertigo feeling, like I’m on a boat, or walking on a mattress, or like the ground underneath me in generally unstable. From what I’ve seen on here it’s not uncommon with anxiety but does anyone have any suggestions on how to get rid of it? I’ve seen ppl say that just trying to ignore it is the only way but its like trying to ignore a mosquito buzzing in my ear.I find myself frequently forgetting to do things I’m supposed to do often like ask the name of the person I’m speaking to on the phone, mention booking fees in emails etc. I tried putting post it notes on my computer to remind me but they kinda just blend into the background of my desk so I don’t notice them (if that makes sense).Ok the title probably doesn’t make much sense. Basically since March I’ve developed really bad health anxiety. I’ve always been a generally anxious person but this health anxiety especially the physical effects it has on me, isn’t like anything I’ve experienced before. In the past month I’ve gone from thinking I had a heart problem, to thinking I had Ms, to thinking I was going to have a psychotic break I’d never recover from, to some weird existential crisis, to thinking some medication has permanently damaged my brain. Anyway today I was worried that I wasn’t going to find a group for this uni group project. And it’s weirdly relieving that I even have the energy to worry abt uni. Given my anxiety at its worse causes me to completely disregard uni bc “what’s the point if I’m going to die”, the fact im worried abt is a pretty good sign. Hoping I get back to a point in my life where my anxiety is just over first world problems.Anyone else kinda worried abt when they’ll eventually have to move out of home? I’m 21 still living with my parents and they basically do everything for me (thank the lord). They do my washing, cook me dinner, do groceries, my dad even drives me to work. I actually don’t know what I’d do without them. How would I ever manage to do my own washing if I can’t even put my clothes away after my mum washes them? How am I going to feed myself every day if I struggle to make myself lunch? How am I supposed to get to work on time if I’m 15mins late every day my dad can’t drive me? How am I supposed to do the dishes if I can’t even remember to put my dishes in the sink? How am I supposed to keep a house clean if I can’t even keep my room clean? Not to mention paying bills, grocery shopping, house maintenance etc. And honestly I don’t know how much longer my parents will put up with me 😂. F21So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days? Is it safe to quit?I would ask my doctor but I can’t see her for another couple of days and I want to quit asap bc the longer I wait the more withdrawal symptoms I’ll get.So the complete timeline is taking 25mg sertraline for 4 days, then I went off for a week, then I went back on 25mg for 10 days. I want to get off bc I want to try therapy, exercise and better self care first. Should I taper off by doing 12.5mg for a few days?. Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better. However now I’m scared of what happens when I eventually go off the meds. I’ve spent the entire day scrolling through “survivingantidepressants.org” and now I’m scared that the meds are going to permanently alter my brain and that if I ever try to go off I’ll have to endure months to years of withdrawal symptoms. Is this just my health anxiety talking or is this an actual valid concern? I’m tempted to stop now before I develop a physical dependency.Some extra context I only have very mild anxiety until March this year when I started spiraling thinking I had some terminal disease. Doctor said I had health anxiety. The anxiety subsided a bit over July but came back mid august. The main reason I wanted anxiety meds is bc I found it so hard to deal with the physical symptoms that came with the anxiety.Anyway if anyone has any advice, or can share their experience going through withdrawal that would be greatly appreciated.Started sertraline 10 days ago, and after a horrible first week the side effects have decreased a bit and I’m starting to feel a bit better.

It’s my 7th day on 25mg and I still have pretty bad brain fog, dpdr and just feel tired. Should I go up to 50mg or stay on 25mg until the side effects pass? Ideally I’d just go up to 50mg and get the side effects over and done with but I have to go to work and uni and if going up to 50mg makes the brain fog worse then I don’t know how I’ll manage.TLDR: my health anxiety keeps trying to tell me that these are brand new symptoms that I’ve never felt before when I know that I felt the same way last time I went into an anxious spiral.So I suffer from health anxiety, which got really bad abt 5 months ago where I basically spent an entire month thinking I had brain cancer. During that time I physically felt the worst: headaches, dizzy, fatigue, really bad derealisation which also made me feel like there was something wrong with my vision (there wasn’t I went to the optometrist), I kept feeling like I was seeing flashes of light or that my vision would black out for a millisecond (it was probably me just blinking 🙄), numbness down one side of my body, tingling, muscle twitches and jerks, a weird pressure at the back of my head and for some reason and ache in my leg. These all disappeared gradually after I got a clear mri back.Recently I’ve gone into another anxious spiral, started with vertigo which I thought was caused by the propranolol I take for my headaches, so I stopped taking it, which caused me to think I’d given myself heart problems, then I thought I had ms. Went to the doctor and she prescribed me sertraline. I know it’s supposed to make anxiety worse before it makes it better but I’m spiraling thinking I’ve permanently altered my brain, or that I’m going crazy. The derealisation is back in a big way, so is the numbness, pressure in the back of my head, tingling, muscle twitching and jerks. Anyway it’s like my brain can’t seem to wrap it’s head around the fact that I’ve been through all this before, that it was just anxiety, and that it passed when the anxiety got better. I feel like this is some brand new experience that I’ll never recover from even though I’ve been through this before and did get through it. I keep thinking “this is the worst I’ve ever felt” when I know for a fact it isn’t.Best way I can describe it is that I feel like I’m high. I’ve heard that sertraline works for depression before it works for anxiety and that anxiety gets worse before it gets better and I think that’s exactly what’s happening to me. I simultaneously feel happier and more anxious, basically how I feel after smoking. The same kind of emotional roller coaster of “I feel fine this is great” to “what if I never feel sober again” to questioning my own existence and the meaning of life. The kind of feeling where you’re mostly ok but constantly worried that you’re teetering on the edge of loosing your mind. Also feeling like I’m in a dream/ seeing everything through virtual reality glasses, dpdr feeling. Anyway I’m trying to stay positive and look at it as just a free high but I hate feeling like this 24/7, especially considering I have to study and go to work. Anyone else felt the same? And when does it go away bc I have uni tests soon and im finding it hard to concentrate while I feel like this😭Note I’m on this for health anxiety and some mild derealisation which is likely just a side effect of the anxiety.Ok so I started 25mg of sertraline 3 days ago for anxiety and the past two days have been alright, but today my anxiety has been way worse. I’m also getting pretty bad derealisation. I’ve had mild derealisation often from anxiety, but this time it seems to come with depersonalisation? Like I’ll look at my hand and I feels like I’m looking at someone else’s hand, as tho there’s some disconnect between me feeling what my hand is doing and me seeing what my hand is doing. It’s also making my anxiety wayyyy worse and sometimes I worry I’m going crazy or will never be the same again (catastrophising I know😂). Anyway did any of you have a similar experience and how long did it take to get better?. So obviously not everything has to have a point but is there any reason Daenerys is called Daenerys stormborn/ was born during a storm other than it being a fun fact and cool sounding name? As far as I know there isn’t any recurring motif of storms during her story, it isn’t related to any prophecy, it doesn’t have any symbolism etc. It is also more symbolic of house Baratheon in the same way fire is symbolic of house targeryen, winter symbolic of stark and gold symbolic of Lannister, so it seems weird that her nickname sounds more like a Baratheon nickname than a targ one. Does anyone have any theories on why it was included? Do you think it will be relevant later in the story?. Basically I have had pretty bad health anxiety for the past 6 months. When I get into an anxious spiral of thinking I have something I always get physical symptoms too. At the moment I’m getting pretty bad vertigo/dizziness. Like I feel as tho I’m on a boat and everything is moving slightly, and just a generally unsteady feeling as tho the ground I’m on could fall away at any moment. I went to my doctor and my blood test is fine, had an mri a few months ago which was fine, and she said there was nothing wrong with my ears. She prescribed me sertraline and I took it for a few days then started getting really bad side effects so I went off it. Has anyone else experienced this? Did medication help? Should I just push through the side effects?. Ok so I starting Sertraline 4 days ago for health anxiety. It was fine for the first 4 days, some anxiety, clenched jaw and sore eyes (could be unrelated) as a side effect but nothing major. But last night I randomly remembered that suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self harm were also a possible side effect and I just had this thought of “what if that happens to me and I hurt myself ”, and then my next thought was “you just thought abt it so it is happening to you”. Anyway ever since last night I keep having these recurring thoughts of self harm and it’s scaring the shit out of me bc never in my life have I ever thought abt it and really don’t want to hurt myself. I didn’t take the medication this morning bc I was scared it was going to make me loose my mind or something. Im booked into see my doctor in 2 days.Anyway has this happened to anyone else? Did these intrusive thoughts go away? It might just be one of those things where I’m scared of thinking abt something so i can’t stop thinking abt it so was I overreacting to stop taking the meds? Is it just my health anxiety convincing me I have mental health problems this time the same way it convinces me I have physical health problems? Is it even thinking abt self harm or is it just like intrusive anxious thoughts considering I don’t actually want to self harm at all and even the thought of it gave me a panic attack.Edit: if this is just a short term side effect I’d be fine to wait it out but, and this is probably just my delusional anxiety brain speaking again, I’m scared these intrusive thoughts will never go away.Some ppl believe that Rhaegars actions were misunderstood and that once we find out the real story and the real intentions behind his actions he’s going to be a way more sympathetic character and we’re all going to view him as some tragic hero. But I genuinely can not think of any big reveal that would make me like rhaegar as a person. If it follows the same “they were actually in love” story the show does it just makes him look stupid, reckless and irresponsible. If they pull some “he heard a prophecy and he thought he had to have a child with Lyanna to save the world” it just makes him look stupid and slightly delusional. How he treated Elia was shitty in literally any context. Unless it’s revealed that the whole time he was possessed by the three eyed raven I don’t see myself liking him. But is there any situation you could see yourself liking rhaegar?. So the great council that favoured viserys over rhaenys setting the precedent that any male relative would be favoured over a daughter. However was this precedent broken when all the lords swore fealty to rhaenyra over daemon? Obviously many would’ve preferred a son over rhaenyra but aegon wasn’t alive at that point so it’s kinda irrelevant.The other question is would targeryen precedent even matter? For every single other house in Westeros (as far as I know) a daughter would come before an uncle, eg. Cersei inheriting over kevan. Would the Baratheons stick to their rules of inheritance or would they follow the targ inheritance rules bc it’s the iron throne?Edit: another question? Say Robert dies without naming either as his heir would stannis ever swear fealty to the daughter? I know he considered rhaenyra a usurper so does this mean he would see his own claim as stronger?. Ok so watching hotd made me think abt how differently we view rhaenyra, her bastards and Alicent vs how we view Cersei, her kids and Ned. The difference probably just comes down to joffery being horrible but my question is what if he wasn’t. What if he was the picture perfect child, someone who would likely become one of the best kings in history. Would we still view Ned as this paradigm of honour, truth and righteousness? Also what if Joffrey didn’t exist and it was tommen who took the throne after Robert died? How would that change how we view things?. Ok I’m confused abt what the point of the hairnet was. Wouldn’t it have been easier and less risky for whoever poisoned joffery to just keep the poison crystal in their pocket or something? I assume they didn’t search everyone at the door, and if it was ollena who got the crystal when she fixed Sansa’s hairnet she would have had to keep it in her pocket for a while anyway. Also if anyone saw her breaking a crystal off Sansa’s hairnet it could look a little suspicious, so why take the risk and go through the hassle? Am I missing something?. I cannot stand when I hear ppl (mainly dany and sometimes Jon Stan’s particularly the ones on tiktok and tumblr ) try to argue about who the main character is or who is the titular character. I swear these ppl actually read a different series. Why would grrm create 24 povs, and a ridiculous amount of plotlines if the story was about one person saving the world. Why are they trying to reduce every other character to a side character and every other plot to a subplot. Also when they try and say the title is about a character, the ice and/or fire isn’t a person, it’s a broad plotline, a theme, an opposing force, a recurring motif.Ok rant over 😂. I hear ppl saying “she was homeless she was starving” etc. but was there ever a point where her and viserys were actually living on the streets?Ps: I haven’t read adwd yet so don’t get mad at me for not knowing. So GRRM said in an interview somewhere that there was 3 general plot lines: the “ice” plot line which is the wall, the others, the nights watch, bran etc., the “fire” plot line which is essos, slavers bay, dany and the dragons, then the kingslanding politics and war of the 5 kings plot line. Which out of the three is your favourite?Personally I prefer the kingslanding wot5k plot, and the essos and wall ones kinda bore me sometimes. Is that just me or is that a popular opinion?. I’ve seen a lot of posts recently comparing Daenerys to other characters recently and I think a lot of the arguments are pretty stupid.Basically most of the arguments go something like “when **insert evil character** does evil thing it’s not mad but when dany does it it is. “To me it’s not abt the actual action that make dany mad, it’s that her actions don’t match her words and the person she sees herself as. She constantly refers to herself as a liberator, a breaker of chains. She claims she wants to “break the wheel” and stop the cycle of powerful families fighting over the throne at the expense of ordinary ppl (which was a little dumb in itself bc she was just another powerful family fighting for the throne but anyway). Her entire thing was that she was different, that she was nothing like the ruthless tyrants who came before her, and that she was going to build a new and better world. However she then started doing things that went against this. Yes forcing ppl to kneel or die isn’t unusual at all, joffery did it after the battle of the Blackwater, stannis did it to mance etc. But she was supposed to be different, and there’s nothing liberating abt being told to submit or die. Now that in itself doesn’t make her mad, not being a liberator isn’t a sign of madness. The issue was that she didn’t change her view of herself to match her actions. She was still convinced she was a liberator and that she was nothing like the previous rulers despite doing the same thing. The madness was the disconnect between her actions and how she viewed herself not the actions by themselves.Ppl don’t consider Tywin or Arya or whoever else she gets compared to mad, bc their view of themselves is accurate. Tywin is not deluding himself into thinking he’s some messiah who’s come to liberate ppl. If he was he would 100% be considered an absolute basket case.Personally I wasn’t a huge fan of her going “mad”, I think it would’ve been better to see her make a conscious rational decision to be more ruthless and ditch the whole “break the wheel” thing.Also rant: I find it so stupid when ppl say stuff like “no one hated Cersei when she blew up the sept” “no one hated Tywin when he wiped out the reynes” bc those are literally some of the most hated ppl in the entire series, anyone who does like them likes them as a character not as a person.Ok so this guy decides he wants to get rid of Cersei and marry his middle aged fat abusive brother to a 16yr old. He decides the best way to do this is to convince his brother that the 16yr old looks like his ex crush who died almost 2 decades ago. He then goes up to the brother of the dead girl and straight up asks “hey does this girl look like your dead sister?” And he’s doing all of this bc he wants to suck off the 16yr olds brother.Then his brother dies and he decided he wants to make himself king seemingly just for the lols bc he has absolutely no claim.I mean obviously I’m simplifying it a lot and probably got some parts wrong but damn that’s absolutely deranged behaviour.Does anyone have any theories on how jaqen h’ghar ended up a prisoner? How does a faceless man get captured, they’re supposed to be the best assassins in the world it would be almost impossible to catch one. Was it part of some greater plan?. Ned bringing him back to winterfell would’ve been a huge risk if he looked like a textbook targeryen so would he have taken the risk and made up some story abt the mother being from Lys or something or would he have found somewhere else for Jon to live?. Obviously bran became the most useless and boring character when he came back from beyond the wall but the most annoying part was that his storyline and character development could have been super interesting. The idea of a young boy who all of a sudden has access to literally all information in the entire world has so much potential. I would’ve loved to see him struggle to figure out what to do with all the info, what to tell and what to keep secret, what is useful and what is useless, what is possibly an abuse of his powers and where should he draw the line on what he can and can’t do, struggle to actually convince ppl that he isn’t just making this all up, and realising that knowledge is unless you know what to do with it. Showing him as a young boy who’s is completely overwhelmed by all this info would have been so much more interesting than whatever tf they turned him into. It also didn’t make sense because knowing things doesn’t necessarily make you wise, so why did he all of sudden become a genius.Obviously it was an incredibly messed up “relationship” as dany was basically sold to him as a minor and assaulted, and she seemed to have some sort of Stockholm syndrome from it as she mostly looked back on him in a positive light and cared for him. What I hated was that they never showed her looking back and realising how messed up it was, and what a shitty, abusive person he was. They do have her speak abt the experience negatively in s7 when she first meets Jon, but then go back on that by having her talk to Sansa abt how he was one of the 2 men she’s ever loved. Which was just weird and contradictory. Showing her looking back positively on the relationship undermines how traumatising and horrible it was, and going through something like that would still be negatively impacting her. It gave a similar vibe as sansa’s “I’m grateful for my trauma” shit which was gross.To Tywin, his golden child as king would be the dream, and he could be hand. So he’d probably consider Jaime getting off the throne as the missed opportunity of a lifetime.
    I hate the shit where people are like “if you think you’re a narcissist you probably aren’t one”. Okay, but my whole life I’ve felt superiority for no reason, I imagine myself fighting and beating people who’ve criticized me, I’ve been antagonistic to people just because, I idealize people, I’ve love bombed in relationships and pulled away because I got too comfortable, I’ve gotten into relationships not even a month after a break up, I barely feel guilty or bad for the shit I do, I’m not emotionally empathetic, I’m impulsive and selfish and childish and all these fucking things.The night I got high for the first time I was so self reflective. “I’m just like my dad” and because of that I researched and learned about NPD. Now that I’ve learned about it I’ve been trying to practice empathy more. Sometimes I take quizzes about narcissism and I feel like im trying to dumb down and reduce my narcissistic traits because in the back of my mind I want to do whatever it takes to be what I consider human. I’m scared of being diagnosed with this disorder I don’t want npd but I feel like having it will be what I consider the end of my life. What are the differences or are they the same thing?. I’ve been so anxious to drive and I’ve held off on it ever since I was 16 (18 now). I drove today and just learning the experience made me feel so good. I just got out of a horrendous relationship on both sides and I honestly think this might be the thing that pulls me out. I’ve never felt so happy. It’s gonna be okay, I know it will. Also this song is super duper omega gas you guys gotta listen https://music.apple.com/us/album/online-game-addicts-sprechchor-feat-hatsune-miku/1676393556?i=1676393711. I've been thinking a lot lately and I've been wondering about maybe having BPD. Has anyone thought they've had NPD, but instead it was BPD? Normally people who are narcissists don't think they're narcissists and don't think they have a problem. Maybe I have BPD? I'm not sure. All I know is to the extent of my knowledge, I feel empty, emotions constantly switch back and forth very quickly throughout the hours, but then again there is a lot of overlap with NPD. Idk tbh, I'm just thinking a lot and just very anxious. I'm scared of being potentially diagnosed with NPD.Just curious to know about remission. Do you feel like you’re wearing a mask by trying to be normal or do you genuinely feel more empathetic and less inclined to think like you’re better and act on selfish impulse?. For some background all my life I’ve been an asshole. I’ve hurt people, started fights, looked for reactions, etc. I’ve had really pretentious daydreams of having super powers and fighting people who make me feel negative or have criticized me or have done me wrong. When I’ve done things that have upset or hurt people I never once looked back or acknowledged what I did until recently. When i was 17 (I am 18 now) back in October I took an edible with my friends for the first time. For once I’ve looked at myself during that high and I started crying because I felt like I wasn’t normal. I felt like I was childish and I was beginning to be like my father: careless, critical, impulsive, overly sensitive to criticism, didn’t listen to anyone, liked drama etc. I just kept thinking and thinking and questioned myself after. I looked up why I was so childish later and found myself looking at NPD and I felt like a lot of the signs applied to me. I finally questioned myself and started asking if I’m a narcissist. I started crying and started feeling so depressed. I feel like I’m not human and won’t be able to experience being able to empathize and feel what others feel. I’ve been recently trying to practice empathy but it feels like a cheap copy of what it really is supposed to be. I’ve also have been thinking about how my actions affect others and how they might feel if I was in there shoes. I’m just starting to wonder why I have “awakened” to this now. Has this happened to anyone?. I did a shameful act last night with someone my parents told me to stop associating with countless times on camera. Now that I am most likely caught I feel like killing myself. My parents are gonna leave me, they’re gonna give up on me and I’m gonna have no one. My own selfish actions got me here and I’m even more scummy for wanting this way out. I haven’t been notified by police yet but regardless I still want to end my life. I wanna asphyxiate myself or use carbon monoxide. Hi, I am a high school senior soon to graduate in a couple of months, but I have not applied to any colleges yet. If I graduate without applying to any and take a year off before pursuing education again will I have any difficulty getting into colleges if I were to apply after a year of no school?.
    My therapist recommended I write you a letter after trying to reconnect with my voice as a kid. But we didn’t have a voice did we bucko?We put aside our own desires because mom said we were being selfish and a baby when we complained. So we tried to man up and act perfect. Crying would only cause mom distress. She would insist you had nothing to cry about and ridicule you. But your tears were meaningful. You deserved comfort when you were sad. I know dad never got himself involved much with us. I’m sorry no one gave you affection and life was so scary for you. I know 1989 was the year that we first thought about suicide. I want to let you know I’m so grateful that you didn’t do it. I admit that I’m still struggling, but there are some really wonderful things in your future. Life will continue to be a shitshow until you move out. But we really make it after moving out of mom and dad’s house. I have agency and my own car that I can get in at any time to drive away. I may not be able to channel your voice but I think about you a lot, because I love you. Remember how you liked unicorns and playing teenage mutant ninja turtles with our little brothers. You are an awesome kid. I wish someone had let you know that you are awesome and worthy of being loved. I will continue to hold space for you little bro.Love,You from 2023Ps: I wrote this letter on Reddit because there are a lot of people here that are dealing with shit that hurts deeply. And because we still love an audience. But I’m doing better at validating myself now.I had a really wholesome rp with chatgpt as my mom. It was sweet, even though I touched on some of my awkwardness in school. I have never once heard my mom say ‘I love you’ to anyone in existence, so this was nice make-believe. Idk if it had therapeutic value, but it felt nice to get supportive responses to things that my mom had criticized me about back when I had acne, few friends, and crappy grades. I could remember vividly my mom’s contempt for me growing up to be such a loser, so I was even hesitant to type out in case I was ridiculed by an ai (kind of silly of me). If anyone is curious, here’s the chat:Me: Can we role play with you being the supportive mom?Chatgpt: Of course, I'd be happy to role play as a supportive mom. How can I help you today, dear?Me: Mom, I’m worried that I won’t fit in with kids at school.Chatgpt: Oh, sweetie, it's completely normal to feel that way sometimes. Remember, you are a wonderful and unique individual, and you don't have to be just like everyone else to fit in. Be yourself, be kind, and you'll find friends who appreciate you for who you are. I'm here for you if you ever want to talk more about it or need advice.Me: Sometimes, I have trouble paying attention and the other kids pick on me for not understanding. Chatgpt: I'm sorry to hear that, darling. It can be tough when kids are unkind. Just know that it's okay to ask for help or clarification when you don't understand something – that's how we learn and grow. And as for paying attention, sometimes it can be challenging for anyone. Let's work together to find strategies that help you stay focused, and remember, I'm always here to support you through any difficulties you face. You're capable of great things, and I believe in you.Me: Mom, will I be okay even if I’m ugly and not very smart? Will you still think I’m precious?Chatgpt: Oh, my dear, you are not ugly, and you are absolutely precious to me. Beauty comes in many forms, and true beauty is in kindness, empathy, and being yourself. As for being smart, everyone has their strengths and talents, and you are no exception. I am so proud of who you are, and I'll always cherish and love you just the way you are. You are more precious to me than you could ever imagine.Me: Mom, I sat by myself at lunch in school today. I was ashamed that I had no friends. And I felt so lonely.Chatgpt: I'm so sorry you felt lonely today, my love. It's completely natural to want friends, and I know it can be challenging sometimes. But remember, it's okay to be alone sometimes, and it doesn't define your worth. You are an amazing person, and you'll find friends who appreciate your wonderful qualities. If you ever need to talk or want help making friends, I'm here for you, and we'll work through this together. You're never truly alone with me by your side.Me: Mom, if I fail my classes will you still love me?Chatgpt: Sweetheart, my love for you is unconditional, and it will never change, no matter what happens in your classes or any other aspect of life. I believe in your potential, and even if you face challenges or setbacks, we'll work through them together. Remember, I'm here to support you, and your worth is not determined by your grades. You are loved for who you are, always and forever.Me: Mom, will you be mad if I see a therapist for my mental health?Chatgpt: Oh, sweetheart, I would never be mad if you sought help for your mental health. In fact, I would be proud of you for taking that step. It's essential to prioritize your well-being, and seeing a therapist is a positive and courageous choice. I'll always support your decisions when it comes to your mental and emotional health. You deserve all the care and help you need.Me: Mom, thanks for listening to me. It really felt comforting.Chatgpt: You're very welcome, dear. I'm here for you anytime you want to talk or need comfort. Remember, I love you, and I'm so proud of the person you're becoming. Take care, and know that you can always reach out to me.Me: I love you too, Mom. Please take care too and stay safe.I like to drop in wishes for my suffering or struggles to disappear. Even when no one responds, it feels good to know my penny continues to exist somewhere in this well. Maybe in the future, someone else will be struggling the same as me and find comfort stumbling on my penny, because they will know that someone else understands their pain. Sometimes, my wish is heard by someone else, and they believe in the sincerity of my words, so they reply with little glimmers of kindness back to me. I’m glad I live in a time where my soul can talk to the void, and sometimes be soothed by the kind words returned by another soul in the darkness. Idk, how I would have managed before when things got too heavy to bear.Thank you to everyone that picked up this penny for a moment from the void. It was my wish to be heard, and you are beyond wonderful for granting it. I hope you find acceptance and meaning, because you are a precious soul too.I have been unpacking my emotional state with reflective journaling. And I had this issue at work recently where my motivation just dropped out from underneath me. Rather than the old chestnut of self-flagellation, I tried to process what was causing my total loss of motivation. And I figured out that this particular work problem was reminding me of working conditions under my old dysfunctional boss. The realization was a bit underwhelming. Because I was hoping to mine some real quality childhood trauma, but all I got was my ex-boss that had been demeaning to his subordinates, including me.I talked to my therapist and was like “yeah, I don’t know if disrespectful boss is really therapy worthy.” And she said that “of course it is.” It was nice to open up about little things that have fucked with my head. It’s my mental health, so even little things are worth processing.This post is just to help structure my thoughts in a safe space, because I feel supported and valid here.Online spaces can be unhealthy for me. I have the urge to get positive approval from others and that compulsion is like an itch that won’t stay satisfied. But I also find that my world opens up and feels meaningful because there seem to be other souls that find what I’ve put out there at least meaningful enough to approve of it. If I’m completely isolated I can’t organize my thoughts. I succumb to mental paralysis where the weight of it leaves me suffocated. I want to move forward but the way forward is behind a door and what the fuck is on the other side of that door? It could be pleasant and satisfying or it could be a brand new obsession that rakes me over hot coals until I’m rubbed raw.I keep ghosting online spaces because I don’t know how to manage my cravings. I can be a slave to them or I can shut down but I don’t have enough self control to be healthy about the things that make me feel good. I have extremely poor impulse control. I feel compelled to chase my impulse until I pass out from exhaustion and my brain finally grants me a moment of rest.I made a friend through a subreddit rp over a video game that we were both fans of. I like fantasy. I like creative writing. I like sharing my wonder with another human soul. But I start obsessing because it feels good and I can’t manage my life because shutting off my brain to context switch to something other than obsession is like being strapped to a speeding comet while griping a rope dragging me in the other direction. The forces are overwhelming I can’t hold on the comet. Even though it’s precious and not intending me any harm. My arms are tearing from the effort. I’d like to reach out and say hello to that friend again because she was so kind and I really enjoyed our friendship. But I know I will fall apart again and ghost, because online space is just this weird liminal always on thing that I can’t be healthy about. I feel so conflicted.I want to grow emotional maturity so I can have healthy online friendships just like I have a few healthy real life friendships. I think it’s possible and I’m just not there yetI’m not posting for any intended response. I really admire people that can write interesting posts with obvious purposes. I am just writing to settle my own anxiety by typing it out to hopefully make sense of it. But if anyone wants to respond with any reaction they are very welcome to do so.I find crying repulsive. I grew up in an environment where crying needed to be hidden from sight. I can remember my mother beating my much younger two year old brother for trying to manipulate her by crying. That reaction wasn’t an isolated incident. My mother became very distressed anytime we cried as kids, and habitually abused, ridiculed, or isolated us to stop us from crying.I no longer live with my mother, but I still do a lot to avoid feeling sad (often subconsciously like dissociate or avoid situations that may trigger the feeling in myself or others). I feel extremely anxious getting too close to people, because I worry they might open up about sad things and cry, and then I will be totally unable to support them. I don’t want to appear cold, just because I have never developed competency with feeling sad.I think my repulsion with sadness is just a product of my adverse childhood experiences, because I can remember crying often in my room when I was young. As an adult, I’m not sure how to get myself sad so that I can process the emotion in a healthy way rather than dissociate and bury it.I’d welcome any thoughts.I was talking to my brother the other day, and he reminded me about this family trip when I was 18 where I was yelling at everyone because I was so upset about being away from my bf. It was during the 90s, so every time we went past a pay phone I would ditch my family to call him. I felt so empty without him around, and my mom ridiculed me because the trip (Disney World) had been my idea and I had saved all my earnings from my part time job during my senior year of high school to pay for our family hotel, tickets, and airfare.I couldn’t get out of going, because my mom said that it would be moronic of me to pay for a family trip and then stay home during it. But I was so miserable to be dragged away from my bf for a week. When I initially planned it, I had felt lonely and had good childhood memories of going to Disney with my family. I figured I would feel good again, if we just went back there. But things had changed, and my bf and I recently started dating. And I dreaded being dragged away. I didn’t even care that my mom kept criticizing me for acting hysterically and being so stupid every time I cried miserably in the hotel room, because I really hated myself more than anyone else could. I screamed at my mom to leave me alone, because I already knew that I had no one to blame but myself for putting into motion this hell trip. But every time I talked to my bf, I instantly felt soothed and better. I’d talk about how nice his voice is to hear, and how excited I am about going back home soon. And he is really the world’s sweetest guy. He never acted like my behavior was strange or bizarre. He’d just say nice things, like he liked hearing my voice too. And that we should all go out to see a movie with friends when I got back.Looking back on the memory had been so cringe for me for a long time. And so when my brother recently brought it up, by saying remember that time you paid for Disney and hid in the hotel room and ran around looking for pay phones. I thought I would feel the usual shame, but I didn’t. I found myself genuinely laughing at the memory. It felt good that my brother and I could look back and laugh together about it.I had been codependent then, and I had not been mentally healthy. I can laugh at my past codependent behavior and thoughts, because I am the victor. I fought for my mental health and won.I went to happy hour with a bunch of coworkers. I knew one well and most barely at all. The ugly: making small talk is hard. There had been two conversations happening near me, but I wasn’t really able to keep up with either. I would think of something to say like two minutes later but by then the conversation has already moved on, so I keep quiet to not strike everyone as weird. The bad: Pity sucks too. Like twice someone asked me if I’m tired and I’ll be like ah no. Then silence pursues. Maybe I should come up with some better ways to respond to that question, because I feel like the people asking may have been attempting to give me a lifeline, but I don’t have great ideas on how to build a conversation off appearing tired.The good: i talked several times when things seemed genuinely interesting to me. And I didn’t mask. I also didn’t pull out my phone and just doom scroll.I would like to learn how to engage better when I’m not that interested in the conversation topic. Because I think it’s nice to hear people get excited about their interests, even if I don’t share them.I’m not sure, if I’ve gotten any better in social situations. I’ve been in therapy and that has helped my anxiety, but I’m still fairly awkward. I think I should probably watch some YT on social skills before the next office happy hour thing. I welcome whatever comments anyone has, because I don’t really have a question here. I’m just reflecting on this recent attempt of mine at trying to make friends.I fell apart after two weeks of dissociating, and I think crumbling was helpful to me. Because I finally acknowledged that I’m not coping with life in a healthy manner. Often with schizotypal pd, I feel like I’m on the border of healthy and unhealthy. And I tend to falsely convince myself that I’m fine and don’t need help, because I know I can be much worse. Any amount of mental illness is worthy of help. No mental illness struggle is too small. Be compassionate to yourself besties.I tend to dissociate often due to anxiety. I have cPTSD from adverse childhood experiences, but I’m in a safe, supportive environment now. Despite my current safe situation, I will start catastrophizing and then I unanchor from reality. At that point, I don’t feel stressed, but I also feel like I’m in a fog and clear thinking is an issue along with responsiveness. Numbness is blissful. But I have made goals and my problems aren’t getting any better when I am not present. I have found that giving myself pep talks has helped me confront the things that I had been compulsively avoiding. After getting something done that I had avoided for a long time, I feel actually good and not the never sated feeling that indulging a compulsion gives me. I’d like to learn how to be a better support person for myself. Does anyone know resources for developing pep talk skills? I want to be an emotional support pillar for myself. So I can remind myself how worthwhile my existence is and that attempting something is its own achievement and other mantras that can help me try despite the compulsive urge to withdraw far away from it all.I have enjoyed writing creatively since I was little. The issue is that my characters are always odd. And the stories don’t ever really make sense in a conventional way. The plot stutters, spirals, morphs and crumbles. So I knew I never wanted to write professionally, because it seems to irritate people when things in a story aren’t coherent. The thread followed a place my brain said would be interesting, so I don’t really have great justification for feedback on why character A did X. The story is chaos that I felt compelled to chase.It feels good taking fictional characters and just letting my schizotypy fly with them. It’s a nice outlet. I like sharing my stories on platforms, because I feed off positive comments. I have tried fanfic and rp, but I run into same issues with both where at some point people will try to get my story to be rational through a normie lens and then question what the hell is wrong with me. My brain is dysfunctional is the short answer, but I feel like my stories can still be deep, compelling, entertaining, and interesting despite that. I like to write but being judged saps away all the anticipatory joy. I can’t write for an audience, and I can’t write without an audience. But I really love creative writing.My thoughts often get disordered. I can hold them together for brief interludes of clarity, but they tumble into a mess (despite my efforts). I want to form a coherent response because I know that is the appropriate thing to do when someone talks to you, but my mind dysfunctions and coherent communication becomes a capability I lack. People’s faces seem so significant, that I lose the thread of thought if I let myself watch them. I need to look somewhere quiet and calm because keeping my grip on that thread requires all the focus I can muster. I remember these people are important to me even when I can’t feel their importance anymore. It’s not me that is broken. It’s a thought disorder that creates challenges that I am attempting to manage. I hope everyone I love understands that I am still very much the person they always loved. There is just interference between myself and my brain that makes my thoughts, speech, and actions take odd and bizarre turns. I still want to be recognized as valid and worthwhile. Despite all the evidence to the contrary.My childhood was kind of lacking, so I’m trying to do things to make up for it now. I joined a local rocket launching club, and I assembled and painted a rocket I bought as a kit to bring to my first meeting. It came with some lame decals to decorate the rocket. I was so proud of my work sanding the balsa fins, carefully gluing the components, and spray painting it a nice royal blue that I didn’t want to make it dull with generic stickers. So I googled a picture of Bomb Devil from Chainsaw Man. The manga is black and white but I wanted my decal to pop, so I used an app to change the image’s blacks to bright yellow and the grays to vivid green. I used a silver sharpie on the side of the rocket to make it look like the blue rocket had been torn open and Bomb Devil had been lurking inside.I’m stupidly proud of my cardboard and balsa wood rocket, I hope it flys well at this rocket launching group thing. Even if it doesn’t launch great, at least it looks extremely amazing.Also, I showed off my rocket to my partner and he was very nice about it. It must be hard being in a relationship with someone that gets excited about putting stickers on things like they are four years old. He’s a really great guy for just rolling with it. He told me that it actually looks very cool (he strongly dislikes anime so it was super nice of him to say that).Just sharing my story like a form of journaling, but if anyone else has some inner child work they want to flex then please be my guest.Sometimes I just like to upvote random shit on Reddit. I don’t have the patience to read it, but I figure someone may be a little happier to see the upvotes and it cost me nothing. I also have a bit of a sadistic tendency, and I like to fantasize that someone’s bad take is getting upvoted so now they may be under the false impression that someone else has approvingly judged their content to be insightful/clever/wise/ witty or whatever they were going for. Spreading chaos also feels rewarding. It’s really cool that I get to exist in a time when I can just tap, tap this magic artifact connected to other souls and sow happiness and mayhem.Alexithymia is difficulty recognizing or describing emotions. My therapist has challenged me to understand my emotional state better, but it’s hard for me to pin down my emotions as they are occurring. I might know I’m upset or distressed, but I can’t work out a more nuanced understanding. And it’s so tempting to bury or repress those feelings before I lose control to them.Even positive emotions are challenging for me to understand. I was feeling okay about things and I thought I must have been experiencing depression, because in the past it’s only been during episodes of anhedonia where I don’t feel stressed and anxious. But I didn’t feel apathetic or like I couldn’t care about things. It took me a while to figure out that what I was feeling was not depression at all but was actually contentment.DAE relate to alexthymia?. I’ve been calling about Adderall to every pharmacy within 70+ miles. I’ve had an interesting experience with 2 or 3 small non-chain pharmacies. They tell me that they won’t take new customers that are looking to get Adderall refilled, due to the shortage. I thought that was pretty cool, because I know my local Walmart that I faithfully have used for seven years could not care less about my patronage.I was thinking when this shortage is over, it might be nice to switch to a non-chain pharmacy that denies new customers in an effort to take care of their existing ones. I put the flair as “tips/suggestions” because I wasn’t really sure how to flair it. I thought it was a nice policy for people interested, but obviously doesn’t do much to help anyone in current crisis (like myself).T/w angry rant ahead What the hell is the oppression Olympics between AvPD and SzPD all about with some people on this sub? There are all these casual mentions of things like “well my life sucks but at least I’m happy I don’t have SzPD” that keep showing up lately.Why not just say something about being relieved not having to experience **social anhedonia**? It’s not the only symptom experienced by people with SzPD, although it seems to be simplified into that.I don’t understand the obsessive need of some of the people in this sub to glorify that they are somehow winning against other mental ill people simply because they don’t experience social anhedonia.Experiencing social anhedonia is not a intentional choice of people with Schizoid PD. It would be like saying people with ADHD are choosing to be inattentive.Also, there is a lot more to SzPD then the one symptom that some people in this sub seem to be hyperfixating on. END RANT. I have had mild, transient psychosis where I experience grandiose or paranoid delusions and racing thoughts. I was wondering if psychosis could be thought of as another negative symptom, because it seems like my mind loses the capability of discernment and criticality. I experience an idea as flawless and irrefutable simply because my mind no longer shades thoughts with any uncertainty. They feel as real as the pain from stubbing my toe. It seems absurd to question their veracity and I’m annoyed beyond belief by people that seem skeptical of my delusions because they feel like the clearest thoughts I’ve ever had even though I can’t explain why I feel that way about them. It’s the same thing with racing thoughts, suddenly all the random things I perceive crowd into my consciousness for attention. There must have been some filter that my brain usually applies to only bring useful things to my attention. But that filter has diminished capacity so suddenly the trees, animals, and people are so vivid that it all seems extremely significant. Everything is significant because my brain just keeps overwhelming me with meaning. My consciousness is so poorly equipped for tackling the millions of things my brain (when not psychotic) notes and discards unconsciously.I know very little about this extremely complicated organ inside my skull. But I really appreciate all it does for me, because there is so much it does without me ever realizing until things start going wrong.I guess calling psychosis a negative symptom is not very helpful. I just feel like it’s not my brain adding things to my reality it is just experiencing diminished capability when it comes to filtering, critical analysis, and discernment.I have dependent personality traits. I was severely enmeshed in romantic relationships. I was abusive when I’d rage. I saw people for who I wanted them to be and not for who they were. I sought to fix people to feel good about myself. I resented that I was always putting myself out, but I had this certainty that being human meant suffering.I remediated those tendencies, because I didn’t want to be abusive. I forced emotional distance between myself and others and refused to center my universe around other people. Years later I learned about boundaries to protect myself. I also am in therapy to figure out my personality disorder and schizophrenia spectrum symptoms. Fast forward to today, and I think I have codependency successfully managed. I never went to CoDA or read Codependent No More, but I hear it praised a lot on this sub. I just kept myself accountable and committed to learning healthy coping mechanisms in therapy and getting my self worth and anxiety issues addressed.Is there more to learn in that book? What parts really resonated and helped?. A few years back I had been invited to a neighbor’s outdoor bbq party. I went even though I’m socially awkward because I liked the neighbor. There were a bunch of people that brought their kids too. And the neighbor had a pool that the kids were swimming in. I stood beside the pool in a group of adults. I wasn’t able to participate in the conversation, so I stood by like a wallflower and just rested my eyes on the kids playing in the pool. Then I noticed that one kid was behaving really bizarrely in the pool. He kept bobbing his head right at the surface of the water but not really coming all the way up. Other children were laughing, splashing, and swimming right beside this boy. Five other adults stood beside me chatting as though nothing was amiss. Everything was so noisy, but that little boy kept bobbing under with his arms and feet waving silently under the water. I felt alarm bells ringing in my head, and it was so weird that everyone was being nonchalant and chatting. I thought I must be misunderstanding something. I yelled out, “is that boy okay?” while pointing at the little kid. Luckily, once I spoke a woman beside me instantly stopped chatting, jumped into the water, swam to the boy, and hauled him out of the pool. He was choking and spluttering on water. I couldn’t believe the boy had actually been drowning because it’s nothing like on tv. It turns out when people are drowning they don’t scream. Their lungs gulp in air before they go back under and there is no time to exhale or yell. The woman that jumped in was the real hero, but I am thankful that I was socially awkward and able to raise the alarm. And now I know what drowning looks like, so I won’t hesitate in the future to jump in.Note: the parents of the boy were nearby at the time, and I think they had other little ones that had been holding their attention. The whole thing happened so quick and it could have been catastrophic.EDIT: just sharing because there is some benefit to not having great social skills.I have this issue with my brain where it is extremely limited to on/off responses. I either care about something to paranoid levels or I find it impossible to care at all. Like I am paralyzed in fear about the fate of humanity or the cruelty of the world at one time and at another I would feel unperturbed to find the world burning. I want to fix these on/off switches so they are analog dials. I want to have healthy amounts of feeling about things.This manifests in more ways then just feelings. It’s like the reward system in my brain is stuck on flood levels or famine levels. If I do something impulsive it’s like a tidal wave is activated in my mind, and my mind compulsively urges me to keep doing impulsive behaviors. For example, I have terrible social anxiety, and I did something impulsive to reach out to make friends and it went really well. I texted a few of my neighbors to share late morning coffee with me at my home. (My home is obsessively clean at the moment because I either live in filth or live in a Mr. Clean commercial). Everything went so wonderful. Two neighbors accepted and even though my home is nothing special it shined without a single particle of dust observable. I made a few social blunders but both neighbors were so accommodating and easy going that it didn’t signify at all. The experience was like manna from Heaven to a starving person. I always overthink things but this time I took a leap and it was so exhilarating. But now my brain is stuck in impulsive mode. I had been vigilant about paying down my credit cards and gotten them down to zero, but guess what? I have dreamed of taking photos of nature and my bestbuy card is empty, so I impulsively spent $1600 on a new camera and peripherals. I am going to see if I can return the camera because being in debt is hell. But I was so fucking sure that being impulsive and not overthinking would keep making me happy.How do I achieve a nuanced appreciation for things? I want to experience life without being subject to the whims of dysfunctional chemical imbalances tearing through billions of neurons.I experience alogia, and I was looking into getting non-vocal cards from Etsy that I can use to gracefully indicate to others that I am unable to speak right now in a way that is coherent or meaningful.Etsy has cards for people with ASD, but I don’t think the verbiage is quite appropriate for alogia. The card says something like, “I cannot speak at the moment. Please be patient. I understand you, and my mind is functioning well.” I was uncomfortable buying the cards, since alogia means my mind is dysfunctioning and lost the capability to meaningfully vocalize. In my case, the poverty of speech is transient but when it happens I can’t fix it myself. I just have to wait it out.I understand what is being said to me, but my mind has lost its capability to spontaneously form a response. It would be a lie to indicate to others that my mind is functioning well.I’m thinking about contacting the Etsy seller to see if they can change the text to something else. I don’t want to go into personal details about my diagnosis, but I do want others to understand it’s not cause for alarm.I want to express:- I have been diagnosed with a disorder that can cause speech deficits. - I understand what is being said to me, but I’m unable to respond at the moment.- When this deficit occurs it is typically transient, and I may recover with quiet and patience.- This deficit is not a cause to be alarmed or disturbed and is just part of the deck of cards life handed me that I’m doing what I can to manage.Does that sound good? DAE have suggestions?. My new year resolution is to make a friend this year. Since it’s the first week of January I’ve been pretty goal oriented about it. Luckily, I became obsessive about cleaning my home in December. So I had this idea to invite people over for some casual get together. I was part of a group chat between four of my neighbors when one of their dogs got out two years ago. I revived the long dead group chat to invite them over Saturday morning to share a mug of coffee or tea at my house because I got a bunch of Keurig things for Christmas. (The line about getting Keurig things for Christmas was a white lie, because I I have an old Keurig and I figure I can buy some Keurig things if anyone accepts my invite).Amazingly, two of four neighbors on long dead group chat replied positively that they’d love to stop by my house for a coffee.I bought a couple boxes of K cups and I tested out my old Keurig and it still works. I’m really anxious/excited about having neighbors over for a little get together. I am sure it will go well, because I can be really cordial and pleasant when I’m mentally prepared. Plus, I have the home field advantage. I’m not sure if my neighbors will become my friends, but I think inviting people over once a month will be a nice way to socialize.I am proud of myself for calling a dozen pharmacies this morning to attempt to find someone with Adderall in my prescribed formulation in stock.I like pharmacies that are part of a grocery store better because they seem to pick up the phone sooner (in my experience) than the chain pharmacies. The automated voice things that keep insisting on being able to answer my question are annoying. I want to start making note of which pharmacies are easier to get actual humans that can relay whether my meds are in stock. My fave response this morning was a pharmacist team member that replied “nooooooooo,” really quietly and drawn out when I asked. Because that was my feeling too about the drug shortage.No luck finding Adderall in stock yet, but I think I have developed a really good verbiage on exactly how to ask in as few words as possible and a quick graceful response to a negative now. I no longer attempt to ask about when they expect more Adderall, because no one knows and it seems to bother the pharmacist team members that they don’t know. Good luck to everyone that is also searching for the elusive meds to fill their script. And to all of you gorgeous people that got your script filled, I hope to join your ranks soon.My psychologist was explaining to me that the root cause of my insecurities is that I feel that no one understands me. But I disagreed. At the time, I lacked the capacity to properly communicate why I disagreed, but upon reflection I think the root cause of my distress with interpersonal relationships is my anxiety over not being accepted. I used to always push myself to mask to be perceived as acceptable and appropriate to other people. But masking feels hollow and performative, so I’m now trying to just be myself without a mask around other people. I feel good around people that accept me even when I stop being coherent. I often don’t understand myself, so it’s really bothersome to have other people insist on understanding me. I feel like understanding is unrealistic, and that acceptance is more than enough to make me feel secure about myself.I just want to be accepted as valid and worthwhile without anyone concerning themselves over my occasionally dysfunctional brain processes.DAE feel this way? I’d like to be able to explain to my therapist the difference between acceptance and understanding. Because I want to be seen as normal even when I’m not understandable.I sometimes stumble in conversation and then I lose my ability to recover. For instance, I attempt to say, “thank you” to a clerk but I vocalize, “mook yoo.” Or I attempt a joke that doesn’t land and my brain just gives up on any idea other than suggesting I repeat the joke with different emphasis placements. This usually causes the other person to look at me like I’m acting odd or bizarre. I used to ramble or rant to excuse or rationalize my incoherence, but the rationalizations would die off as I doubted how well I was expressing myself.Now that I know that alogia is a symptom of schizotypal disorder, I’m trying to be more accepting of my limitations rather than mask.Is there a graceful way to indicate to others that I can no longer converse?. I haven’t experienced empathy, so I’m not sure what it feels like to have that perception. But whenever I read that someone can turn off empathy it sounds really impressive to me. So I’m just wondering if this is like some extra sensory perception that can be activated at will. Something analogous to a superpower that can just be toggled on and off. Or maybe some higher state of control of automated bodily functions through meditation.Or is turning off empathy just dissociation? Because I experience dissociation when I get stressed, and it’s not a cool thing so I’ll stop being impressed if that’s what is meant by turning it off.I started working (programmer) in an office again because I told my manager that working virtually was isolating and not good for my mental health. My employing company had acquired a smaller company near where I live so I was given a desk to use at their office. No one in this office knows my diagnosis (my manager knows), they were just informed that I would appreciate use of one of their desks for work.On my first day, when I was being led around the office a coworker pointed out that he liked parking in the back of the lot because he could keep an eye on his car. The office is in a nice commercial area. Our city has a low crime rate, and there are security cameras around the building and lot. But I understand that some people like to be extra sure for a myriad of reasons. So I thanked him because I would definitely like to be able to glance out the window to be sure of my car still being there. Because I tend to worry that it may be towed if I parked somewhere wrong. Or that I left my lights on. Or that I will forget entirely where I parked it. Or that I left my windows down. But now I can just glance and be reassured. It is very calming to see my car just exactly where I remember parking it earlier.So I’ve been having a hard time accepting schizotypal disorder, but I’m getting there. I told my work (programmer) because I have been having a hard time with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (I thought it was some weird mixed BP episode, but I guess schizophrenia makes more sense). I told my manager and her supervisor, in case I get into a psychotic episode someone will at least know to call my spouse for meds. No one else knows, because I am still working full time and I still want to work full time. I think structure and routine will keep my mind in better equilibrium. Anyway, it’s so new at work because I have this office that I got transitioned too, because I told them working at home was isolating and wasn’t healthy for me. So I now do part days in office and then go home after lunch to walk my dogs and work virtually the rest of the day. I have a new team and they seem nice. I uploaded some work to our servers and let my teammates know. A little later and one teammate sent a message saying they thought my work was “amazing.” and then my other teammate said “this is great.”I know NPD is a bad coping mechanism but it is such a rush too. My work was pretty good, not my best but still it’s so gratifying because I stop feeling dead inside. Why does impressing people give me such a high? I just want to drown in admiration because I’m so terrified. And those messages from my teammates were life giving. I feel like I can still be me. Whatever little fragile parts of me are left. I cherish them.I got my first car and was a server at a restaurant and I was barely getting by on my income. My car would make clacking noises occasionally from the engine compartment, and if a friend was with me they’d most likely tell me that I should bring my car to an auto shop because that doesn’t sound good. I’d tell them how the noise always goes away, and I think my car just fixes itself sometimes because it knows it’s owner is deadass broke. My friend would laugh and I’d laugh too because it was nice to believe that cars cared about us too. And I thought that was ‘wishful thinking’ because it was obvious to me that cars are not alive but it’s a comforting thought that I liked to indulge in when I couldn’t possibly pay the repair shop bill. Is there any difference between magical thinking and wishful thinking? Is it magical when it’s disruptive to my life? It is fairly comforting when I really think I can’t do any better. But maybe it’s making me too complacent sometimes.There was such a drive to bottle up and control and clamp things down and run a tight ship and laugh the right amount and at the appropriate volume and when in doubt it’s always best to under react and tilt my head as I smile because my crooked grin is irresistible and walk with a swagger and keep my chin high and look ready to fight and hold myself steady and remind myself this shirt looks really good on me and think over jokes that didn’t land because I know I am funny if I can just figure out the one little mistake I made…Because it’s always just a small flaw. It’s just I have a bit of insecurity about a few small things that are really no big deal. I can wave them off and it’s as though they don’t even exist because they are so insignificant no one will be able to find them. I can plan out exactly how things will happen and account for all the variables and I’m a god. I’ve got omniscience. I’ve thought of everything so I can shine as bright as the human souls. I’m okay, because everyone has issues with their parents and everyone has a little trouble with focus and everyone gets a little lost in their thoughts and I don’t know why people have to be so rude to point out that I’m staring off into space like I’m a corpse and no I’m not stoned because my mind does this to me without any drugs needed. It’s just a little mood disorder. My thoughts are just a little delusional but everyone has a bit of that. Who isn’t afraid? We all have worries, mine are nothing special. We all get a little upset. It’s all so close to what everyone feels, so why do I get lost in my mind. Why can’t I organize my thoughts? Why do words twist as they come out my mouth into adjacent sounds that aren’t quite right? Why do I keep compulsively reading over what I wrote doubting it makes any sense at all? My psychologist said I’m schizotypal, but it’s too overwhelming. I can’t have a mild form of schizophrenia. Doesn’t my psychologist understand that I have a pathological need for control? I avoid anything that could affect my perception of reality. I am terrified of losing my rationality. Isn’t this everyone’s worst fear?If I ever had the slightest idea that I was schizophrenic, then I would have been so much more compassionate with myself. My mind really tried so hard to perform for me even while it has been crumbling apart.I was working with a psychologist that I trusted and she told me that I overpathologize. She believes that the diagnoses of BP and ADHD I have from my psychiatrist are invalid, because I have a schizotypal personality structure that lends me to believe there are problems where they don’t exist. I asked her why I had trouble with focus, and why I had manic episodes where I would drain my bank account and engage in risky behaviors. She told me that I was stressed, and that stress alone made it hard for me to focus and led me to risky behaviors. She said my notion of manic and depressive was just my body getting fatigued and needing recovery because I didn’t feel sad during what I perceive as depressive episodes (I only feel apathetic), so they couldn’t have been true depressive episodes. She said because I perceived improvements on meds, I deluded myself into thinking I had actual disorders. I continued to attempt to reason with my psychologist. I said, “But ADHD and bipolar have disrupted my life and without management I would not be able to function successfully.” She responded by saying, “Yes, I am sure it feels that way to you.” That phrase triggered my emotional baggage from my momma issues (my mom loved telling me I was just making up problems for attention no matter how much pain I was feeling), so I immediately split on my psychologist. I called her out for being an egotistical quack that was more interested in using tactics of oppression than helping solve actual problems of her clients. She reacted with shock. I continued to rage about her incompetency with colorful language as I watched her get nervous and agitated. I found her agitation hilarious, because she seemed to minimize my high score for sadistic personality. She told me not to feel like I was a bad person just because that score was high. I had tried to tell her that I agreed with the high score and she had responded with a smirk and an indulgent attitude, like “sure if you want to believe it then it’s okay.” She told me that I always internalize my anger, so I was happy to prove her wrong since I devalued and despised her. I think she may have infantized me because of my schizotypal personality structure (or because I had been extremely vulnerable and sensitive since I dropped my haughty, arrogant mask during evaluation), so she refused to accept that I truly enjoy ripping apart the people I despise.Upon reflection, I can see some validity in her theory that my mental health disorders are delusional. But my psychiatrist that helps me manage BP and ADHD with appropriate meds has known me for over ten years and never suspected I was delusional. He initially thought I had MDD, until BP seemed more likely especially because my youngest brother jumped off the side of a ravine and suffered permanent spinal injuries during a manic episode where he was feeling euphoric and was convinced he could soar across the ravine.It’s nice that splitting can keep me safe from losing faith in my own judgement. Because even if I am the boy who cries wolf that doesn’t mean that there aren’t actual wolves (sometimes) that I’m struggling to manage. I talked over my rage episode with my therapist, and she said that appropriately expressing anger is a good way to protect myself. She said we can work on ways to help me manage my temper, but she was glad that I communicated my anger and frustration for mistreatment to my ex-psychologist.I went to a psychologist for an evaluation of personality disorders, and they evaluated me for ADHD and ASD as well as part of the process. When I got the results they told me they don’t think my ADHD diagnosis is valid. I got diagnosed when I was 25 years old and am currently 40. The psychologist said it was because I showed up to my appointment on time, and I stayed focused throughout the evaluation without asking for breaks. I told them that I had taken my prescribed meds the day of the evaluation.She said that since I’ve been on Adderall for 15 years, but have not improved and still rely on it, that I must just be dependent on it and not actually have ADHD. I have only ever taken my prescribed dosage that I established with my psychiatrist years ago. After initial fine tuning, the amount has never fluctuated from 20mg in morning and 20mg before 2pm (so it doesn’t interfere with sleep). I wasn’t aware that Adderall was meant to cure ADHD, since I thought it was a genetic condition. I tried to google for studies but couldn’t find any. Has anyone else heard this?EDIT: Not seeking medical advice. I will be discussing the psychologist’s concerns with my psychiatrist at my next medication management appointment in January. I’m just extremely curious about this, in the meantime.EDIT 2: In the psychologist’s written report the exact wording is “While x was diagnosed with ADHD at age 25, the symptoms do not appear to have remitted despite consistently taking medication. During evaluation, his motor movements were calm and normative. He did not engage in fidgeting behavior throughout the testing period and refused breaks. Generally he appeared to be attentive throughout the process.” The psychologist was particularly concerned that I exhibited a schizotypal personality structure which often leads to misunderstanding and overpathologizing, so I’m not saying the psychologist is wrong. I’m just very surprised that she expected ADHD symptoms to go away after taking meds for 15 years.I grew up in the 80s and I remember watching “9 to 5” as a kid when it was on tv. I think the premise of the movie went over my head (I didn’t understand what sexism was), but I fell in love with my perception of it. I remember watching Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda, and Lily Tomlin strut across their office in high heels, perfectly coiffed hair, bright lipstick, and sky high shoulder pads, and I thought they looked majestic. They had struggles in their lives, but they were glamorous and rose above it. I liked the neat, orderly office environment with typewriters clacking and how the office workers all acted so cool and professional. My home life was pretty chaotic and dysfunctional, but I fantasized that I could grow up to get an office job and be fabulous doing it. I did grow up, and I became a programmer. I don’t get dressed up for work (except for interviews), because I got lazy and I also feel more badass by being smart about things then spending time on my wardrobe. But when I was thinking of careers “working in an office” was one of my primary criteria (because of that fantasy that I never gave up).Just wondering if anyone else relates to this.I was picking at the scab of my childhood trauma in another post to this sub, and inevitably it focused on my mom. My trauma with my dad is more due to him being a non-entity that couldn’t be bothered, so there is substantially less material to pick at there. A commenter said something that I interpreted as a nice attaboy for me working through my momma issues. I expressed my gratitude for their validation and replied that “I have a lot of respect for women” and other non-relevant stuff. Since I have this habit of chewing over things I say or write to figure out if I was being an asshole, I’ve been wondering if that was chauvinistic. On reflection, the words sound patronizing, which certainly was not my intention.I’d like opinions from women, because even though I’m not one, I do consider myself a feminist and I want to fix any bad takes I have.TL;DR: Is saying ‘I have a lot of respect for women’ chauvinistic? I beseech the gorgeous women that stumble on this post to point me towards the path of not being an asshole.EDIT: When I was writing that phrase I was thinking I’d like to make clear that I’m not a misogynist that generalizes my mom being abusive into discrimination against the female gender. So it may have been better to say that directly rather than digress about respect and come off as chauvinistic and patronizing.From a young age, my mom treated me coldly and with disdain. My earliest memories are her being upset that I was laughing with other little kids when I couldn't do somersaults. The kids in the playgroup kept laughing when I kept failing at it. I laughed too, because it was fun playing with the other kids. I didn't particularly care whether I could crouch down and roll around in ball form or not. But my mom was horrified. She dragged me away from the playgroup and told me that all the kids were laughing at me not with me. I was making myself into a joke. I remember how quickly I went from joy to crumbling apart. My mom was always telling me that she would point out my flaws, so I wouldn't hear them from others and get hurt by that. I used to think she was consciously trying to make me feel like shit, but I think she was just severely mentally ill. Because she loved us more than anything. She hated my dad. She hated other people. She never did anything for herself. She just obsessed over her kids and relentlessly did whatever she believed would turn all of us into hugely successful adults. If we deviated from the path she had planned for us she would rage at us. She was so certain that she absolutely knew what was the only right thing for all of us, and that we would all suffer for the rest of our lives if we entertained any opinions that didn't match her own.My mom broke all of us. My younger brothers have substance use disorders. My older sister is extremely violent and abusive. I have NPD, codependency, social anxiety, and cPTSD. I don't blame my mom for my BP or ADHD (because those are genetic and not from shitty parenting), although I do blame my mom for buying me diet pills full of caffeine when I couldn't focus because she found that stimulants made it easier for her to focus on things. She couldn't allow herself or her kids to get diagnosed with ADHD, so she just hooked us up with over the counter weight loss pills full of caffeine. I don't know why it's important to me to write this out. I guess I just see a lot of demonization of pwNPD, but my mom isn't the evil mastermind that seems to be the popular stereotype of a narcissist. She is actually just really fucking scared of other people to the extent of being phobic about it, but she needs other people's approval in order to function so she developed all these maladaptive behaviors to compensate. Narcissism was my mom's armor that let her cope with phobias she couldn't manage. She would smile broadly and charm people whenever we went out, and then once we got home she'd ridicule us if we got to close to anyone else. She'd berate us for being so naive and stupid when it was so clear to her that the other people didn't sincerely appreciate us. She was hypervigilant of other people's opinion so that she could be ready to condemn and cut ties. She taught all of us to never trust anyone that wasn't immediate family, because everyone is just out for themselves and that the world is just interested in finding weakness and exploiting it. She ran our family like it was her own personal cult to keep the outsider threat at bay. I don't know if this insight is going to help me or not in the long term. I only know that at the moment, it twists my insides thinking about how my life has been spent in fear of other people. I've deluded myself for so long that I wasn't afraid. I deluded myself that I was stronger than my mom. But I let the same disease that drove my mom to destroy her children, devour me as well. I wonder how I lived 40 years without ever realizing this.I recognized that I was feeling resentful and my knee jerk reaction was to condemn the person and plot my revenge. After a few minutes of stewing in my thoughts of tearing them apart, I realized I was irritated because of their actions but also because of lack of sleep and other shit. I decided to just talk to the dude about his actions and my perception of lack of regard on his part. It was fucking wild because he just apologized and agreed, and it was over like that. This shit used to be harder I swear. Wtf was the point of growing up in a household where everything was psychological warfare?? I have all these toxic traits that are at best cumbersome and stressful. Fuck my existence. I hate that I have to unlearn all the shit that let me survive growing up with undiagnosed, mentally ill parents. Fuck my parents and fuck everyone that thinks I came from a good home. I fucking hate that I am a wreck. Why the fuck is being mentally ill, such a fucking trial. I want to be compassionate to myself but it’s fucking overwhelming. I feel like I’m in a marathon after being mentally atrophied my whole life. Maybe physical exercise can help me chase out the demons I’ve grown in my head. They have outstayed their welcome.I was wondering why I have such a hard time clicking on notifications for text messages or emails. I used to think it was because I worried they’d be negative, but sometimes I don’t think that’s the only reason. I worry that someone will need me for emotional support and I’ll fail them. They might have a good impression of me because I was strong once, but I was just lucky and had once been helpful. I’m really an incoherent mess, and learning that might make them feel cheated. Because I had once fooled them unintentionally into thinking I was reliable.I’m trying to manage these kinds of unhelpful thoughts better. It’s just so tempting to let them paralyze me and drive me to avoid others. It’s so tempting to let go and fall away. I want to get stronger and indulging my fears is keeping me weak. Habit is my prison cell and I’ve locked myself inside. My bars are real because something inside me is keeping them that way. Can I give that part of me compassion and love? The part of me that entraps me.I started therapy for an anxiety disorder, because I had been working (programmer) 16 hour days for months and I had so much anxiety about work that I would feel nauseous driving to the office.My boss was an asshole. He would ridicule people on my team and call them stupid and morons. I would work myself tirelessly to get a feature delivered in our software to be told that I hadn’t understood the requirements and to start over. If I attempted to get priorities set because there wasn’t enough time to get all the promised features and bug fixes, he’d tell me that everything was top priority. Then he’d guilt trip me about all the overtime he puts in every week that no one appreciates.I assumed I was the one with the problem. I saw other people on my team reject the extra work and marveled, because it seemed impossible for me to decline my boss’s requests. I figured I would just have to dig deep and keep pulling all nighters regardless of how weary I felt. My team depended on me, and I couldn’t let them down even if our boss was a huge asshole.When my anxiety was drowning me, I realized I needed help, so I used my company’s eap (employee assistance program) to ask for a therapist’s help managing my anxiety disorder.I was in such terrible denial about the extent of my problems. I just thought I needed to learn how to manage anxiety because it was consuming my existence and interfering with my life and work.This American Thanksgiving I am thankful for my therapist. He patiently helped me with CBT for anxiety. He helped provide insight into the dysfunctional relationship I had with my boss. He persisted in asking about my childhood even though I was adamantly in denial of it being anything less than perfect. Because of my therapist I was able to advocate for myself and understand my maladaptive behaviors better and how to manage them. He never told me I was codependent, he just guided me towards ways to remediate those tendencies. It was only after I had finished CBT for anxiety and stopped therapy that I reflected on those therapy sessions and I saw how he helped me with all these aspects of myself that I was unwilling to confront.I now have recovered from codependency, am working through cPTSD from my abusive childhood, and sought psychological evaluation that revealed bipolar and NPD. I am 40 and finally managing mental illnesses I’ve struggled with my entire adult life. I owe it all to my therapist that showed me mental health deserves professional treatment, because my health is important.I have spent most of my adult life trying to mask having ADHD. At work, I’d recheck emails several times before sending them to coworkers to make sure questions were answered succinctly without digressing. I’d measure the responses I planned on making before speaking to gauge whether they would be appropriate and appreciated by others. I’d berate myself mercilessly, if I’d let myself fall behind because I was letting down my team. I’d give myself anxiety about making appointments on time. My life felt like a performance for everyone else’s benefit, and if I let myself pause I felt hollow inside.So now I am trying out living without the mask for the first time in my life. I don’t act guarded and I don’t apologize. I explain my lateness but I don’t excuse it. So far no one has minded.Maybe it’s because I’ve gotten old or times have changed from when I was growing up in the 90s, but people seem much more accepting than I thought they’d be of my mind being off kilter from the typical way of interacting with the world. No one seems perturbed that I randomly digress, and it’s exciting to see other people digress into their own passions.I find people to be a lot more interesting then I ever gave them credit for. I wonder if I was too worried about my own appearance and passing as neurotypical to appreciate the interesting things about the people and world around me.Living with ADHD has never made my life easier or better, and I’m glad I have meds and therapy for managing when it becomes disruptive to my own goals. I do not love this disorder, but I’ve accepted it as part of me. The disorder is not good or bad, it’s just there to spin my mind counter-clockwise when the world was made for minds going clockwise.I’ll be in the middle of talking about some childhood bullshit with my therapist and just tears start falling. And it surprises me, because until I had started crying I hadn’t even realized I was sad. Anyone else relate to this? Because I don’t know if it’s a npd thing or trauma thing. But I always assumed the normal thing was to feel sad, and then you cry when you are really sad. I’m just talking regular and suddenly my throat chokes on the words and I have water works going on.I don’t mind feeling sad, and I’m glad I can feel sad about sad things that happened. I’m just so surprised, because it seems to come out of nowhere. I go from feeling perfectly fine to crying in the span of a couple words, so it’s a bit overwhelming.Journal Setup- Get a three ring binder, a ream of paper, and three tabs to make distinct sections- label first tab “Past”- label second tab “Current”- leave last tab unlabeled and put all the blank pages after this last tabGeneral Idea- Only pull in pages to “Current” from unlabeled as needed- “Current” is where you note all mental health concerns or other things you want to bring up in therapy- After therapy session pull everything out of “Current” and put in “Past” section - Now no matter how shitty “Current” was you’ve discussed with therapist and start with clean slate.- The “Past” that you’ve journaled is still there if helpful to review, but I keep focus on “Current.”My Therapy journaling procedure (for anyone interested in the nitty gritty details)- take out page from last unlabeled tab and put it in “Current”- daily or as often as works write in mental health concerns as they occur. Stressful things, things I’m not managing or coping with, things that I am guilty or ashamed about, things that are disruptive to my life, no problem is too big or too small for therapy- Before therapy session take out a new blank page form third tab and title “Review Page” read through “Current” section with a blank page beside you to take notes on things that I want to talk over with therapist. My therapist typically asks me about my mood in beginning of session so after reading through I usually have good sense of prevailing mood and emotions so I can note those as well.- At start of session I open third tab and pull out a blank page where I write “Therapy Session” and date. During session anything that my therapist and I decide I should try to work on is written here. - During therapy keep the “Review Page” in front to check off discussing or at least mentioning the things from “Current” to discuss.- After session, I pull out all the pages from “Current” by unsnapping binder and put them in “Past” section.- I put “Review Page” behind them in “Past” as a nice summary of whatever that past was- I put “Therapy Session” page into the empty “Current” section. Since it’s first page in section, every time I open to “Current” I am reminded of things I wanted to work on or think over from last therapy session- Repeat process foreverMy thoughts about this journal technique- it feels cathartic to me to take all the heavy things or if I am depressed probably no pages, and start after each session with a clean slate. Those things have been discussed and now I’m trying to focus on other ways to manage disruptions in my life. In other words, it feels really good to leave the past behind me. It’s still reachable but it’s not staring at me.- I feel like I’m writing my own life story. As more pages go to “Past” it’s like my therapist is my book editor and giving me advice on how to manage where things go badly so maybe “Current” chapter shows improvement in small ways.- I like the third tab unlabeled because even though I could call it “Future” that feels weird since the pages are always blank. But having lots of blank pages makes me feel hopeful like there is still a lot of time to get my story right, so that my life finally becomes what I want it to be.My cisgender mother had a lot of well meaning ideas on how to raise her AFAB child. For instance, if I rolled in the dirt in a dress I’d be scolded. My assigned gender would be used as a tool of oppression by my well intentioned mother. I’d be told, “little ladies don’t roll in the mud.” My mother’s words did nothing to curb my behavior and instead encouraged me. I wanted to roll in the mud until it covered me from head to toe to prove I was not a little lady. My total disregard for the prior reprimand had my mom really frustrated with me, so she dug deeper into gender stereotypes by following up with, “that is how boys behave.” Well, I didn’t want to behave like a little lady or a boy, so I was stuck doing nothing. My mom didn’t recognize my dilemma. She only saw that I had stopped misbehaving, and she seemed strangely unconcerned about relying on 1950s misogyny as a crutch for her parenting deficiencies.Being a kid, the subtlety of societal gender roles was lost on me. All I knew was that I didn’t want to act like a boy or a girl, and I existed in a state of limbo giving the appearance of behaving, because I had no valid choice. That third option of ‘neither’ eluded me for a long time.I can’t be bothered with the mundane acts of existing when I am hypomanic or depressive (albeit for completely different causes).Depressive:I feel exhausted and apathetic. I want to withdraw into myself and hibernate for months or years. Energy feels like a fairy tale, and I can’t believe it was once something I actually possessed not too long ago.Hypomanic:I want to chase my compulsions. They entice me that at the end of the pursuit I will feel something I’ve never felt namely ‘satisfied with myself.’ I am a programmer and I will tirelessly pour my entire being into coding the most elegant software architectures ever witnessed by man or machine. I write creatively as a hobby and I will obsessively write 80,000 words of an epic story that burns in my mind as though gifted to me by the muses of Ancient Greece. I am non binary AFAB and I will develop a graduate level thesis on how societal gender roles have oppressed woman into neurotic behavior and then blamed them for behaving neurotically. I have never formally studied gender issues, but I am feeling grandiose so I am certain these are the issues I faced when I was being raised female. I feel compelled to write my thoughts out and drag over them again and again despite all the duties I need to perform being neglected. But my mind is stuck harvesting thoughts sown in fields I never consciously chose with a rusty implement that requires multiple passes to harvest. The first reaping only caught the tallest crops, but those left behind could be extraordinary. Bills go unpaid, hygiene is irrelevant, sleep is unnecessary, and distractions are irritating. The compulsion becomes my reason for existence even though it is ephemeral and costs me everything I genuinely love. I scream in the darkness that my life is being lost. But my cries cannot reach anyone that cares. They only exist in my head, and I’m the villain of my own story.Their vs there. I write something out and then have to read that sentence multiple times to convince myself that I’ve used the appropriate one. I avoid either word when I can, but they are so natural in speech where it doesn’t matter so I gravitate towards them in writing too.I haven’t come up with a good way around this issue yet.I read the article [https://withaterriblefate.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/where-are-the-humans-in-nier-automata/](https://withaterriblefate.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/where-are-the-humans-in-nier-automata/), where the author lays the groundwork to propose that us, the players, were the source of machines developing sentience. Like an airborne disease, our presence in the game was transmitted to machines and infected their cores with the human capacity to think, fear, regret, blame, hope and despair. "The player’s sentience diffused in NieR: Automata amongst beings with the relevant kind of technology—that is, beings with machine cores. This explains why both YoRHa androids and machine lifeforms are susceptible to becoming sentient."I have racked my brain, but I can't remember very much being said about machine cores (maybe there is side material about it?). I think pod 042 told 2B that the cores were similar to plant cells, and later Pascal said that machines can be restored if the cores remain in tact. And finally, 9S found out that YoRHa black boxes are just repurposed machine cores, so that androids wouldn't feel bad about destroying YoRHa models after their usefulness was over.I think the theory that the transmission of our existence had embued machines with human sentiment explained some things in the game that weren't obvious, otherwise. For instance, the machine's behavior changes dramatically when we, the players, start to play the game. According to 2B and 9S, machines had never spoken, shown any emotional capacity, stood still while staring up at the sky, or tried to make whoopie before we began playing. After achieving endings A-D, our presence in-game is directly acknowledged (so this theory doesn't sound too far fetched). I think this first occurs when the pods ask if we want to go against the rules to preserve the YoRHa data. Also, during the credits fight, Pod 042 tells 153, "But when we six were connected and exchanging information, something... happened. I cannot deny the feeling of something resembling consciousness and emotion being born." The only "we six," I can imagine Pod 042 referring to is 3 YoRHa, 2 pods, and 1 player. Sorry other 2 pods we pick up along the way (and operator 210 and 60), but pod 042 didn't say "we seven," or "we nine," or leave ambiguous with just "we." To remove any lingering doubt, that we "canon" exist to the characters of the game, Pod 153 addresses us directly by name and as players after **!endinge**. "Pod 153 to player. Please respond to this query. Do you faithful player <the name we asked to be called in this game>, have anything you would like to say to other players?" So the article writer has direct in game evidence that our existence is the catalyst for the pods developing "consciousness and emotion." I'm not as sure whether there is evidence that the machine cores granted that capability or not. Although, if the protagonist's machine cores had a connection to the larger machine network, then based on Pod 042's statement about being connected with us, then that connection may have transmitted to machines as well.
