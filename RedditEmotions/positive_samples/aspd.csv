I started smoking when I was 21 - pretty late by many standards but started hard nonetheless.Used to light one cigarette after another until I was done with 2 whole damn packages and then some, often using the last drag of my previous cigarette to light the next.40 cigarettes a day for almost 7 years as a way to cope with the stress of my job and several mental illnesses I've got - an unhealthy way, to be sure, but therapy back then just wasn't working for me, and meds left me feeling completely trashed and horrible.I tried to quit several times. Tried replacement therapy, joined support groups, did the whole damn stunt over and over again.Everyone tells you what a great idea this is, how it's the right decision and stuff. Everyone - or almost everyone - pats you in the back when you say, "I'm going to quit".Nobody talks about the withdrawal symptoms. No one tells you how miserable you can feel during the first 4 days, or how the second and third weeks are literally Hell. The headaches get worse, your mouth feels like cotton, you get all angsty and irritable, you cough so harshly you feel like you're going to spit out a lung, and you can't seem to focus on anything. My insomnia also got much worse and I was hungry half the time. Even my periods got more painful.But the world doesn't stop for you to take a break and try to control those nightmarish feelings and symptoms. You have to push through it, yet it's a nightmare.When I tried to open up about how I felt during that time, I got a huge load of backlash. I wasn't strong enough. I didn't have it in me. I was lacking self-discipline. I didn't really want to quit. Had to hear time and time again how X person was able to quit immediately, how What's-Her-Name just decided to cut her smoking and she did it, how So-and-so didn't get any withdrawal symptoms.Ironically, most of the backlash came from ex-smokers, which made me feel even worse. Time and time again, I failed to just go from 40 to 0. The backlash got worse. I started believing that I really would never be able to give up my addiction.Last May, however, I thought about *slowly* cutting down my dosage of nicotine instead of trying to get rid of it completely. A few people who I talked to about this told me that was just an excuse and that I wouldn't be able to pull it off. Some others just shrugged and said it wasn't a good idea.I decided to do it anyways and to stop sharing my progress (or lack thereof) with my acquaintances. So much for having a "support network", I'd go the distance alone.Each week, I cut down 1 cigarette. I spaced out the cigarettes throughout the day, chewed gum in between them, ate some small snacks, walked around when I had the urge and I was close to reaching my daily quota.It was hard at first, but the withdrawal symptoms were certainly much milder than when I suddenly stopped, and they improved over the first months.Today, I realised I'm at 5 cigarettes a day.Yesterday, I only smoked 4 and didn't get any cravings **at all** after the last one. It's 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I finished smoking my 2nd at noon - still haven't felt like lighting another one yet.If I keep this up, I might just spend the first week of January smoking every other day before finally being able to smoke one cigarette a week and then none.I'm so f\*cking happy I could cry.Just wanted to share this with someone and encourage anyone out there who's still fighting the battle. Please don't give up. We've got this!. A rather long story, but I really need to shout this out.So, the 9th grader in question (I'll call her G) identifies as female, has asked us to use she/her pronouns, and wears her hair long, always in a dainty plait or ponytail. She once told me that she had been growing it since 6th grade and taking good care of it because it made her transition easier. G's parents are aware of her situation and fully support her.Most of the staff either have no problem with this or we keep our opinions to ourselves and comply with the name change, pronouns, etc... That is, everyone except her Social Studies teacher, Mrs T.From Day 1, Mrs T has refused to change pronouns with G, deadnames her, has told her several times that she needs to "act/dress like a man", and often mentions her hair is too long. Mrs T has been teaching at the school since its inception and is close friends with the Assistant Principal... So, yup, a bit of seniority leverage comes at play...A few weeks ago, G came to me (I'm the tutor of her class) to tell me that Mrs T and AP had given her an ultimatum - either she had her hair cut by the end of the week, or she would get a suspension.Since G was visibly troubled and she's a nice teen, I got a copy of the school's regulations and gave it a read to see if I could help. I did find a few sentences that mentioned hairstyles but they only stated, quote, "*Students' hair must be kept away from their faces at all times. Unruly or uncombed hair is not permitted. Hair is not to be worn any shorter than a Number 3 cut*."As you can imagine, G was in fact following the rules, so I told her to get a copy of the regulations and plead her case directly with Assistant P. She did, and everything seemed okay...Last Friday, however, G broke down in tears in the middle of the lesson. While Assistant P had initially agreed that she was following the rules, she had told her that morning that her hair "wasn't appropriate" and she had to cut it by next Wednesday. AP even mentioned the possibility of changing the regulations to make sure she complied.The class was in disbelief, and I felt mad. Went to talk with AP and argued for G's case, but I would've had better luck reasoning with a wall. Then, an idea - I texted my Principal (he was away for a regional meeting) to ask whether the staff had any regulations on hairstyles. He said of course not, there were no regulations. Great, that's all I needed to know...Monday morning, I walked through the halls showing off a very short pixie - short enough to still be considered professional, yet a far cry from my trademark long curls.Mrs T went pale as a sheet when she saw me and my 9th graders were aghast when I entered the classroom, but ended up cheering. I got a tearful hug from G before we started the lesson.A few hours later, the Principal knocked on my door and asked if we could talk outside. He told me Mrs T had entered his office in quite a state and said something about me stirring up trouble and setting a bad example. What was that about, something to do with my new hairstyle?I told him I thought he was aware of what happened with G last week. Nope, he said. I explained the whole thing, finishing with a firm, "You can fire me right now if you think I crossed a line". He belly laughed and called me a firecracker before sending me back to my lesson. Mrs T and AP were called to his office during the day and, before we left, staff received a Whatsapp from him.In short:* School regulations must be followed to a T, but so far there's no distinction between male and female hairstyles and there won't be.* Starting tomorrow, all 9th-grade teachers and classmates must use G's chosen name and she/her pronouns at all times.* Discrimination of any kind, against staff members or students, will have severe consequences.Did I play with fire? Maybe.Was it worth it? ***Absofreakinglutely***.\-------- EDIT: Holy... Wow. Guys, thank you very much for all your kind words and support for G, for sharing perspectives, awards, for taking the time to read.And you honestly have no idea how much it means to me when someone goes out of their way to praise something I did. Truly, you can't imagine. I'm freaking crying. I really hope I can become a better teacher and person with this boost, so THANK YOU.Let's all keep up the good work!. Long rant, but I need to share this with someone...I got diagnosed mid-20s (close to 30 ATM), and a few months ago in therapy I was talking about my dad (biological maternal grandpa, but for all intents and purposes he was my father).I went on and on about how patient and supportive he was while teaching me tricks and stuff to manage several things I struggled with (which I now know we're obvious symptoms of ADHD), how he always seemed to understand what was going on without my needing to explain or even say anything...Suddenly, Doc asked if my grandpa/dad was a psychologist or something. I said, nope, why?Doc goes, "Odd... The things he taught you were basically management strategies that are very specific for ADHD, plus you said he empathised with you on a very deep level... Do you know if he ever got diagnosed?"It was like time stopped.The majority of my family were the kind of crowd who thought therapy is for the "crazy/deranged", so they never went to check themselves or anything, yet I analysed everything I could remember about Pá George, the things he said and did, similarities and differences between us. No idea why I never thought of the possibility - it was so glaring obvious.Decided to reach out to my mother (60F) and her two siblings (all of whom I'm sort of LC with) to explain everything that happened and ask if they'd consider getting checked.Turns out, my uncle (45M) and one of his sons (23M) had been diagnosed a couple of months before, but hadn't shared it. My aunt (65F) told me my cousin (37F, who's currently a psychiatrist herself) also has ADHD.After a loooong video-call, my aunt and mother finally agreed to go ahead and do it. I also wanted to talk to them face-to-face - even if it turned out they didn't share the disorder, I just wanted to have a real heart-to-heart with them.Fast forward to today, when we met for brunch and my cousin (the psychiatrist) also came...What do you know, we all have ADHD - my mother even went to 2 separate clinics because she couldn't believe the results.We spent over 4 hours sharing experiences and talking about Pá George. Since he passed away almost 15 years ago, we've no way of knowing for sure, but based on our shared observations and my cousin's opinion, it's highly possible he also had the disorder.There were lots of talking, a bunch of tears, a lot of vulnerability. Things each one of us went through as kids and teenagers, even as adults, now make sense. It still feels surreal.At the end of the day, there's something we all agreed on - we needed to talk about this and it brought us closer than ever. And Pá George helped us big time, whether he truly knew what he was doing or not.Wherever he might be right now, I'm forever grateful to him.So, 1st official day of school and we got a new arrival from Russia.For some background, I'm teaching English as a second language at a private school in Mexico. Students are mostly Mexican, although we have several international students - just never a Russian one in this particular institution. While I've had Russian students in my classroom before, they had quite a good level of English, which meant we could communicate very efficiently. On the other hand, I've seldom encountered students who needed to be taught very basic English, literally from scratch.With this young man, however, it's very different. Apparently, his English is very limited (A1 at best from what I could gather during my class with him, while most of his 8th grade classmates are B1, few of them A2) and he just moved to Mexico very recently. His mum speaks a little bit of English, but admin had to rely on a translator to communicate with them.During today's class, I tried to use very simple and short instructions with him, coupled with a lot of gestures (for example, I say "Paste the paper here" slowly first. Repeat the instruction, this time pointing at the glue while saying "paste", clasping the sheet up as I quote "the paper", and placing my hand on his notebook with "here"). I also gave him a thumbs up, a nod and smile while saying "Хорошо!" (Fine!/Good!) when he followed through with instructions.Although he was very hesitant at first, he seemed to perk up whenever I gave him a thumbs up, or understood a bit better when I acted things out. Another thing that worked was pointing at my eyes, then at what his classmates were doing, then at him and waving my hand as in, "Watch what they're doing and repeat". He caught on very fast on that.However, I know this is just the very beginning, and I'm honestly not sure if I should teach him as I would any other student I've had before. For starters, I'm not even sure he's very familiar with the Latin alphabet, because when I started writing the date, my name and some prompts on the whiteboard for the icebreaker activity ("I like...", "My birthday is...", "I'm very good at...") his eyes bulged and he just froze, staring at the board like it was a wormhole. I asked him if he could understand the sentences (used the app translator for this) and he said no.I've already set an appointment with him and his parents, and I'm making a list of basic questions I need answered, such as, does he know the Latin alphabet? Can he use it to read and write? How long has he studied English? What resources did his teachers use? Were the classes based on translation?... And based on this information, I'll make a plan on how to help him best.But I'd really appreciate some tips from teachers who've dealt with this situation before. What are some resources you'd recommend? Any websites or apps that can help him learn a bit of basic English by himself? Or apps that may help me communicate better with him?. He graduated 2 years ago, was always a jokester. We shared an odd sense of humour and music tastes.Just a few minutes ago, he sent me a Spotify link with a message that basically said he made the list thinking of me and what I'd need to start the year with a positive vibe, also hopes this year goes smoothly for me.I thought it was so sweet of him, I opened the playlist... And my ears immediately recognised Guns N' Roses "Welcome to the Jungle".Cackled so hard my sides hurt. So spot on.I'm currently bobbing my head to "Crazy Train" and thinking how much I loved those teens and how I miss that darned young man.ETA: So, I've been trying to find a way to share the playlist, but for some reason the option won't appear; I'm probably doing something wrong (not very tech-savvy, as you can tell)...I'll just copy-paste the link he sent - hopefully that does the trick.[Here you go!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4MzB656S2sUFMzW7gE6PJH?si=-EDrcDBbSzqr8tZyc3F62w&pt=043a041efdb8845b00cdcd53e3d9eabb). Since I was a young girl, I knew I didn't want to be a mother. I've got at least half a dozen reasons why, but the conclusion is pretty concise - I don't want children, not now, not ever.I was 15 when I first went to an OBGYN to express my decision to get a tubal ligation. Boy, it was Hell - felt so much more invasive than the interrogation and all the other processes I had to face to get legally emancipated the year before.Long story short, at the end I got told I was too young to make that decision and I'd probably regret it later, to wait until I had a relationship, to give it some thought and at least wait until I turned 18 (official legal age in my country). Health-wise, there was nothing preventing me from undergoing the surgery, though. I also had saved enough money to pay for everything.I visited other doctors who asked the same questions, parroted the same speech and advice. After a long time of going back and forth with them, I sighed and agreed to stay put..The day after I turned 18, I went to a different clinic... Then another and another, only to experience the same thing yet again: I was "too young", I "could regret it later", I needed to "give it some more thought, be absolutely sure because there was no going back". No doctors seemed willing to perform the operation.Only the last guy was honest enough to tell me it'd be easier to get an approval on the procedure if I was over 25. Seeing it would probably be a waste of time and money to keep insisting before I was in my early/mid-20s, I reckoned, I'd already waited for so long, what's another couple of years?So, I waited. Life came and went. I changed jobs and got my degree, then moved out of state. Moved again. Pursued a second career. Politics in my country made a 180° turn. COVID happened. A lot of things happened.Every time I mentioned my desire to get a tubal ligation to colleagues, friends or acquaintances, I received some variation of the "That's too extreme/Are you sure?/What if you regret it?" speech and we always ended up in debates regarding motherhood and whatnot, or at the very least I got stared at like I was crazy. I was about 26 when I decided to just keep it to myself, not share it with anyone ever again.Last week, I was able to get an appointment at a private clinic. Pretty much same procedure and protocol, then Doc asks, "You understand this could potentially be permanent, right?"Something inside snaps and I go, "Let's get this straight - I've wanted this since I was a teen. I've known the risks since then. I've gone to 9 different doctors. I've explained my reasons over and over. And I'm honestly f*cking tired of people hinting that I don't know my own mind or understand what I'm doing, OK?"He was rather shocked at my outburst, but he eventually smiled before saying, "Yeah, you definitely want this!" and scheduling the procedure for August 7th.The moment I left the office with my paperwork, I felt so happy, excited, and free. So bloody liberated I actually made a small tap dance right there on the sidewalk.After 15 years of waiting, I'm finally getting my tubes tied!. I just read this [piece](https://www.abc15.com/news/state/some-valley-schools-accused-of-illegally-teaching-dual-language-programs) a few hours ago... And went down a rabbit hole of sorts regarding Arizona's Proposition from 23 years ago and California's Prop 277, two years prior. I read a bit about the criticisms and analysis directed at bilingual education, immersion courses, and dual language classes.While I can see good arguments on both sides, my personal perspective is probably different from USA language teachers (I teach EAL - English as an Additional Language - and French to 7th, 8th and 9th graders at a Mexican private school).I'm still intrigued and burning with curiosity, though, as to how you might perceive this legislation and its effects.So, American colleagues, what do you reckon about Prop 203?Do you agree or disagree with it? Do you think the theory is OK but implementation is lacking, or you're set against it no matter how it's sliced? Why?I'd also like to hear the opinions of other teachers abroad! Would you agree to a similar piece of legislation being passed in your own country? Why or why not?ETA: There's a typo on the title, LOL. Meant to write "What's your ...". I've been doing some research and apparently people with curly hair ought to wash it once or twice a week.Problem is, for starters, I live in an *extremely* hot and humid place (think humidity almost never below 80%, and temperatures of 26°C/78.8°F being considered merciful interventions of the Cold Deities), and walk 3.5 km/2.2 mi every day + work on my feet 5 days a week + light exercise now and then.I tried going 3 days on a row without shampooing, and the result was just ghastly: an oily, dull, clumped, tangled, slightly smelly bird nest it was 🙈...I used to wash it every day, but apparently that's not good either, so I was wondering if shampooing every 2 days might do the trick? Or does the secret lay in the shampoo?I'd deeply appreciate some advice 🙏🏼!!I seem to have 2c/3a hair that's either medium or fine, probably low porosity, if that helps.ETA - As I mentioned, I'm just getting started, but basically what I use is:Shampoo, OGX's Quenching + Coconut Curls.Conditioner, same brand.Cantu's Curl Activator Cream (I use very little product and add water to lighten it).Oil, Marc Anthony's Coconut & Shea.Mousse, Schwartzkopf's Smooth Shine.Also, I air-dry my hair and I'm learning how to plop and use the Denman brush properly.After a several hours of teaching, grading projects, making lesson plans, filling in 3 extra classes for one colleague who was absent today, an array of parent meetings, and an unscheduled staff meeting at the end of the day, I was literally dragging my feet when I got home. All I wanted to do was body-slam my bed and be MIA for at least 7 hours.As soon as I entered the flat, though, I remembered I had to take care of the laundry. Trailing like a zombie, I got all my clothes together, including the ones I was wearing, put them in the washing machine, and started the cycle.Now, our *very old* washing machine has a peculiarity - you need to keep a close eye on it, lest you forget to turn off the water flow at a specific point and end up having a medium-ish pond in the middle of the utility room... So, my plan was to simply sit near it and have a small nap, 25 minutes tops, while the machine worked its magic. I set the alarm and started dozing off.1st part of the FU...Apparently, my brain was so extenuated that it decided to ignore the alarm not once, not twice, but for several hours. When I finally woke up, the utility room was a bloody ocean. As any burnt out worker would, I cursed all living, non-living, and divine beings on Earth and parallel universes that may be, while I tried to salvage what I could...Then, I noticed something odd. Floating on the floor and in the washer, there were small packets of brown flakes, chips and shavings, as if a llama had somehow found its way into the laundry and decided to start shedding to kingdom come. While my brain cells tried to make sense of what the shavings could possibly be, I suddenly saw a sad little lighter, bobbing on the surface of the water like a buoy.And it dawned on me.Early in the morning, I had bought a pack of cigarettes and placed them in my jacket's pocket... Which I hadn't emptied before throwing it into the washing machine. I had just wasted the equivalent of approximately $10 USD, because I hadn't even opened the darned thing.For a few minutes I was caught in limbo, deciding between sobbing hysterically or cackling like a madwoman. In the end, I settled for the most epic facepalm known to mankind.And here I am now, typing this on Reddit after cleaning all the mishmash and coming up with particularly creative oaths condemning alarm ringtones that aren't high enough, old washing devices that constantly overflow, and my seemingly ludicrous decision to pursue the educational field.Summer vacation can't come any sooner.TL;DR - After a long day at work, I was too exhausted to remember to empty all pockets before doing laundry, plus I fell asleep. I literally washed away a brand new pack of cigarettes and transformed the utility room into a lake.I can't believe what just happened today.A couple of "friends" (not sure I'll be calling them that anymore) and I were hanging together after work - all of us women - and one of them crept behind me... And just like that, she bloody groped my breasts like it was fricking nothing.I can't even begin to describe what it felt like - the whole rampage of emotions was so sudden, violent and confusing I just lost control. Out of a reflex, I swivelled and punched her squarely in the face.Their reaction? I was overreacting! They just wanted to "see if they're real"! It was just a joke! If I don't like them, I should just get surgery! We're all women, so it's fine!... Um, ***ex-f×cking-cuse you?!?!***If another person touches me without my consent, I'm overreacting?Why in tarnation would I lie about them being natural?Is my body a fricking joke or a toy??Do you realise the problem was not my breasts, but what you unilaterally decided to do with them??Is it okay to be disrespected as long as we both share a bloody vagina/gender??WTAF...We had a huge fight and I came back home. It's been several hours already, and I'm still... I don't even know what I'm feeling. Rage, fear, embarrassment, frustration, helplessness, I'm just overwhelmed, I want to cry and scream and punch something.I could've expected such disrespect from teenage "boys" or downright disgusting "men", but we were all women in our late 20s and early 30s! How the Hell could they ever think I was going to be okay with that?F\*ck, no - *absolutely* ***nobody*** *gets to fricking touch me without my bloody permission*.ETA: First of all, thank you all for your kind words and advise. These people and I don't work together, we simply used to meet up after our working hours since we know each other from college and high school, so I couldn't go to HR with this, but I did reach out to them after I calmed down.When it became obvious they still thought the other person wasn't in the wrong for doing what she did, I decided not to have further contact with any of them and let them know just that. A few of them tried to reach out today to "talk/smooth things over", yet this is something I'm not willing to overlook.Second, I'm truly stunned to learn other people can relate to this because they have been through that or something similar themselves. It shouldn't be that way. Nobody should go through anything even remotely reminiscent of this.I'll echo several comments here... It doesn't matter if you're a man, woman, non-binary, etc, and it doesn't matter what kind of relationship exists between you and the other person - nobody gets to touch you in any way without your approval and consent. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Our principal (one of the best bosses I've ever met) quit a fortnight ago, and the Assistant P took his place.Due to several reasons and past experiences, I can't say I genuinely respect her but, you know, I try not to put myself in her crosshairs unnecessarily. *I swear I try!*Anyways, ever since I've worked at this school (early COVID), she's always bragged how she knows several learning platforms like the back of her hand; specifically, Google Classroom had nothing on her, she had near-IT-divinity-like knowledge on the matter.Today, she sent a message on the teachers' chat telling us she put up a new assignment (we have a Classroom specifically for teachers to submit paperwork, planners, etc.) and we had to resubmit a Docs file we made a couple of days ago.Ok, no biggie. I unsubmit my old work and upload it in the new assignment.Less than 2 minutes later, she calls me out through the group chat, convo pretty much as follows:*New P*: Silver! I told you to submit your work again, NOT unsubmit the old one! 🧐*Me*: Um, sorry? You mean you want us to make a new document and start from scratch?*New P*: 🙄 No, just send your document again!*Me*: 🤨... Ma'am, I'm afraid I can't do that.*New P*: Do I really need to teach you how to submit it again, Silver? 😒 You've been using Classroom for over 2 years, I can't believe you don't know how to do that by now! Are you as lost as the students?!(Ok, now I'm getting irked... Dare I?... You fricking bet I do!)*Me*: ... Ma'am, I thought you knew how to use Classroom? The moment anyone submits a Docs file through an assignment, the owner of the file changes... Which means the one who initially submitted it can't edit it, copy it, or pretty much do anything with it. That is, unless we unsubmit the assignment.*New P*: 😐😶... What?Yeeeeeah, sure you know about Google Classroom, lass... Staff's currently cackling and roasting her like BBQ on the other chat we have.I doubt she'll live this one down...On my last session, the psychiatrist talked about the differences between cognitive Vs emotional Vs compassionate empathy. It was truly interesting.The way he explained it, cognitive empathy is all about "logically understanding (not sharing) people's emotions and figuring out what they might be thinking - almost like putting together a puzzle", while affective empathy is "what people usually do instinctively, feeling what others are feeling and making it their own". Compassionate empathy means taking it to another level, "thoughts turn into action, when you want to *do* something to help and your motives are selfless".He mentioned that some people with ASPD may actually have a high form of *cognitive* empathy, while their *emotional* and/or *compassionate* empathy is often low, impaired, misaligned or lacking. Along with that, he told me some researchers have proposed that ASPD patients may have some sort of "empathy switch" so they can turn it on/off.He further commented that empathy was to be understood as a spectrum as opposed to the black-and-white idea that either you have empathy or you don't.All this makes sense to me, and it rings true. I'm currently researching a bit more on the matter, and I'm getting curious - what's your personal take on this issue?What are your thoughts on empathy? Do you reckon you have some degree of it? Which type? How high/low? How does it present itself?. My Ss are given projects that they have to develop on a weekly basis throughout the unit, instead of written exams at the end of it. This month, my 9th graders had to explore their "dream career".Among other things, they had to visualise what "success" truly meant for them, sit a skills and abilities test, look at different careers and universities/colleges, and pick one programme to perform research on. At the end of the project, they have to write a magazine article in which they bring together all the information they gathered.At the beginning, it was challenging for most of them - unsurprisingly, for example, nobody had ever considered that "success" could have a variety of interpretations - but eventually they got truly immersed.It was really fulfilling to see them every Wednesday (when we work on the project) as they called me over and went, "Miss Silver, I found this really awesome course in Canada/Spain/Austria/USA/what have you!" or when they talked amongst themselves, "This guy/lady I'm interviewing gave me some tips!", "Did you know you could earn XYZ after a few years of experience?", "I didn't know you could choose these subjects at uni!", "This school offers sport scholarships!"...I've been giving out this project every year when I teach 9th. Obviously, I designed it as a sort of coaching/trial so that later on they don't find themselves as high school graduates with no idea as to what they want to do next - I never expect Ss to stick with the career they chose for this particular project when they go on to high school. Sometimes it happens that a student *thinks* this career is what they want to study, but as they do research they realise it's not a good fit for them, and I still consider the project a success. Either way, it's just a project, not a life plan by any means, and they still have 3 more years to explore and decide.But this time, something happened that I had never witnessed before.As it turns out, 4 teens (who didn't really hang out together or anything, and picked different careers) got extremely interested in several German universities that happen to be in the same city. The moment they learnt this, they started talking to each other more and more in class and after school, sharing what they found about their respective degree programs and stuff, including academic and language requirements, fees, scholarships...Then, while working on the project, they took things to another level - together, they checked accomodations for international students, how it was like to live in that city, cost of living and monthly expenses, etc.An idea was born and last week they excitingly told me their plan - it contemplated them being roomies in Germany (they found a middle point between the Unis and commuting options), with each one of them raising X amount of money from this year till they graduate high school so as to get their Visas and cover expenses, as well as taking language courses together in order to achieve at least a B1 level in German by that same time (they actually compared several courses and schools available).They even told their families about their newfound friendship and plans; their parents emailed me. Today, the teens were very happy to tell me they just had their first German lesson yesterday.While I know that a lot of things can happen in 3 years and this might end up being just a beautiful dream, I've literally never seen them so enthusiastic and committed to a goal... Deep down, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they actually end up doing it!So yeah, this year's "Dream Career" project is already playing out very nicely 💜. My friend "Abby" (32F) and I (29F) have been friends ~5 years. I'm usually the first person she reaches out to when she has an issue/emergency, or needs to vent.Last week she called me in quite a state after a nasty argument with her BF (they lived together) that ended with him telling her to leave. I went to fetch Abby and brought her to the flat I share with my roommate "Gary" to calm her down (he was off at work at the time).We spent the afternoon together until I realised it was really late, and told her we should get her a room in a motel nearby so she could spend the night (she didn't have any cash or cards on her) and I'd check on her in the morning. She said she wanted to sleep over with me, which wasn't exactly a crazy suggestion - she had done so once or twice when I was renting a studio, prior to my moving in with Gary last December.Thing is, Gary and I have an agreement: no sleepovers *unless* we let the other one know in advance *and* the other one says Ok - I tried to reach him a couple of times, but his phone was off.I explained all of this to Abby, and she said she didn't want to be alone, the agreement isn't written down anywhere, and it's just this one time. I told her I was sorry, but since Gary had no way of giving me the green light, I couldn't let her stay. Again, I offered to pay for a room, or drive her to one of our friends'.She got really upset, how could I choose a roommate I barely know over her, our friendship meant nothing to me, stuff like that. Things got heated until I told her she had to calm down and either accept one of my offers or come up with another.She cussed at me and ran out. I followed her for a couple of blocks, saying at least I could drive her somewhere (it was past midnight by then and my neighborhood isn't exactly safe) but she ignored. I was too angry and tired by then, so I decided to go back home and hope for the best.Next morning and all through the week, I got messages from several friends berating me for not letting Abby stay the night - apparently, she had texted everyone about what happened at my flat and slept at a bus station.After I gave my version of the story, only one friend says I wasn't in the wrong, while the others say I'm a huge a-hole.So now I'm seriously wondering, AITA?ETA: Some people pointed out that I could've stayed at the hotel with Abby... TBH, I don't know why it didn't occur to me at the time, and they're right, it should've been an option.Gary is a cop, works crazy hours and we have great communication - that night has literally been the sole exception. He got home at 5 the next morning, give or take. We talked about what happened, and he said if there's an emergency again, just texting him will suffice. He insisted that I still need to give him the OK for his sleepovers.Be advised, this is a loooooong rant just because I've never truly voiced my thoughts before...For the record, I'm envisioning *culture* as "the way of life of a given population/social group/nation, including but not limited to customs, rituals, expressions, arts, social institutions, and achievements".Several months ago, I found the following definitions for *cultural appropriation*:"The use of a culture’s symbols, artifacts, genres, rituals, or technologies by members of another culture"And"Inappropriate or unacknowledged adoption of an element or elements of one culture or identity by members of another culture or identity".While I can definitely appreciate the strong argument from the latter, I'm bemused as to the former - as I understand it, it implies that people are *not* meant to traverse beyond the culture in which they were born.This posses a huge dilemma for me, and actually makes little sense from a certain perspective.To begin with, it poses the issue of the existence of a "prime/original culture". Our history as species and societies has been plagued with different instances of contact (belligerent and non-belligerent), exchange, interchange, and assimilation between two or more cultures, which ultimately IMO has shaped contemporary society and globalization. From where I'm standing, it makes it close to impossible to pinpoint or even define which were the "true and original" cultural expressions of any given nation, with perhaps (*very*) few exceptions.Just to give a crude example, the *Día de Muertos*, internationally recognised as an intangible cultural heritage of Mexico by UNESCO (in order words, it's a huge deal!), is actually an amalgamation of pre-Columbian customs and European influences - it's taught as *the* ultimate example of syncretism, for crying out loud! And even now, there's an ongoing debate (albeit a quiet one) on just how deep its indigenous pre-Hispanic roots go... If one were to delve into the history of Latin America, or a number of other cultures for that matter, they can immediately appreciate how their contemporary culture has indeed been shaped by contact between different cultures and assimilation of foreign practices across history.Don't even get me started on the idea of "Western culture"... Or languages...This begs the question, when/how/why exactly is something considered "part of a culture" in the first place?Then comes a more personal perspective - what happens when a given person has different cultures involved in their ancestry? Are they "allowed" to indulge in the expressions, art forms, customs and rituals of those cultures and claim them as part of their identity? Or are they invariably commited to the culture of their immediate family, or the culture to which the majority of their family belongs to? And what happens when you're adopted?This hits close to home. I've been able to trace back my ancestry up to the 1800s or 6th great-grandparents (call me a nerd, because I am!), and to say it's a varied family tree is an understatement - just to illustrate, my maternal grandpa's parents were Lebanese and Mayan, while my grandmother's were Cuban and Spanish; my biological father was Mexican and so were most of his ancestors, but there was the odd foreigner here and there.In this case, am I allowed to claim Mayan, Lebanese, Cuban, Spanish or any of the other cultures as my own? Am I supposed to identify solely as "Latina" or "Mexican" and thus implicitly forsake part of my ancestry?Last but not least... Ever since I was very young, I've always loved history (not obvious at all, huh?) and reading. Nothing was more exciting for me than delving into other cultures besides what would be considered "my own". Native American folklore, Maōri culture, Nordic lore, Arab art and literature, British language and history, Germanic history, Indian culture and cuisine, Inuit stories, you name it - I was enthralled by it all. Some caught my attention more than others, I felt a deeper connection to some as opposed to others, but the awe and curiosity were always there.As I grew, I had the amazing chance to meet different people from around the world, and what I learnt in books and encyclopedias took a whole new dimension. Digital technologies allowed me to get new perspectives as well. And, eclectic as ever, admittedly I've incorporated some things from other cultures into my way of life, ranging from decorations, style and food to language, rituals, mannerisms, and philosophy.It's not as if I go and say, "Oh, this looks cool! Imma wear/use/do it!", more like, "Oh, this looks cool! Where does it come from? What's the story behind it? Why/how is it used?" and then spend a fair amount of time researching before I think, "Yes, there's a strong connection to this. Reckon I've a decent amount of understanding. I'll wear/use/do it!". Most of the time, I'll end up just appreciating it and sometimes sharing my findings/thoughts if the situation arises...Yet the dilemma still stands because I have incorporated other cultures into my life, and questions abound.Mostly, when the issue of cultural appropriation comes up and the argument of "you shouldn't use/wear/do things that don't belong to your culture" is presented, I can't help but end up thinking, "Why should anyone be confined to a certain culture just because we happened to be born into it? It's not like anyone had a choice in the matter"...Also, one could argue that if we're not allowed to live or think beyond a specific culture, then the idea of "stepping into other people's shoes" or "understanding different perspectives across the globe" is rendered practically moot. I can categorically state it's not the same thing to just read or hear about other cultures as opposed to truly experiencing them. And deep down, to refuse ourselves the chance to explore, learn, experience and indulge in other cultures sounds rather narrow-minded and even purist/fundamentalist...Hell, if I wasn't supposed to learn/use things from other cultures, I wouldn't even be able to write *this* post in *this* language at all!. The country and culture into which I was born loves fireworks - the louder, the better.National holidays, religious celebrations, local parties, you name it - no gathering, big or small, can be considered complete without lighting up firecrackers. Doesn't matter if you live in a small village or in the big cities.December is a truly firework-heavy month, especially around Christmas and New Year's Eve.That means every damn year, I skip town on my own. I spend several nights sitting at the beach, as far away from the noise, smell and shockwaves as I possibly can, earphones on with music as loud as I can bear, curled up in a ball, trying to block out the barrages as best as I can.I have a couple of acquaintances that are understanding and have tried to get me to spend the holidays with them over the years and avoid the triggers, but it's no use. At one point or another, there's an odd neighbour that lights up firecrackers on the street, or there's the faint crackling sound in the distance, and I just lose my sh*t.When I've called the cops to see if anything can be done about it, I'm met with either heavy sighs or disbelieving faces. Very few of them have been empathetic, but since there are no real regulations for fireworks in my state, they can't do anything besides asking people to try and keep the noise to a minimum.The times I've asked neighbours to please not use firecrackers usually end up in a mess, a yelling contest, or a full-on fight - I'm already known in my neighborhood as "the crazy girl who's sensitive over loud noises". It's embarrassing and belittling.I've tried taking sleeping pills these days just so I can literally black out. It usually doesn't work, and I don't want to play Russian roulette and end up overdosing.I've gone to therapy for years and the darned firecrackers are one of the few triggers I just can't seem to cope with.The sound. The smell. The shockwaves. I just can't deal with it. I've tried and I can't. And I hate it.I hate not being able to control this. I hate feeling so weak, scared and vulnerable. I hate being alone every Christmas and every NYE. I hate not being able to enjoy the holidays. I hate crying over it like a stupid baby.I hate this so much.Today, an old colleague of mine forwarded me a video and said, "You need to see this ASAP".I was intrigued, so I opened it.It was a podcast and interview that went down a few weeks ago, featuring an up-and-coming businessman who's turning out to be rather important in our country.There were a lot of questions about what his ventures were and what was he planning on doing next, etc. Quite interesting, really. The guy was very articulated and charismatic, obviously proud of his work and results, successful and invested not only in his field, but also in charity work and the like. Overall, I really liked him and was quite impressed.Near the end of the interview, the guy said he wanted to address someone. He stared right at the screen and went, "Don't know if you'll ever watch this... But thank you, Miss Silver. Wherever you are, just know that you're my inspiration".I was in shock when I heard my last name - the young man had seemed a bit familiar at the beginning, but I couldn't place him. I wondered if it was just a coincidence and he was referring to someone else.Then the man started talking about this Miss Silver, an ESL teacher he had when he was in 9th grade; recounted several conversations she had with him where she made him believe in himself and turn his life around (he said he "was a major lazy jerk back then, but she wouldn't give up on me"), talked about several things the teacher did for him and other students, how she had inspired him "to be a better person, at least as amazing as she was".The more he said, the more my jaw fell... Finally, it clicked - 2012, my 2nd year of teaching. He was indeed my ex-student, and he was talking about me.Back then and even now, I genuinely never thought I made a huge impression on any of my teens. More like, I was one of many teachers in their lives and hopefully they had learnt something meaningful while being my students - then, I would reckon I did a good job.And yet there was this man, all successful and thriving almost a decade after leaving my classroom, saying how I inspired him and how he's still in contact with friends from back then and they all remember me as the teacher that truly cared, the teacher they respected and admired the most, one of the adults that truly changed their lives.I'm still crying as I type this, I'm so overwhelmed by the whole thing. It's almost surreal.Has to be the best Christmas gift I've ever gotten, hands down.ETA: Woah, this exploded somewhat! Thank you for the good wishes, and I hope you all had a merry Christmas!. I need a "heart-melting" or "awwww" flair for this, gosh darn it...I thought it was going to be just another regular Friday. I entered the building as per usual, said hello to some kids as I walked down the hall to my first class - and before I could open the door, 3 of my 9th-graders ran to me and said they needed my help, ASAP; there's something going on at the auditorium.They seemed so alarmed and it was all so sudden that I got genuinely concerned and followed them immediately. They lead me there, opened the doors... And all 70+ of my students from 9th grade started singing "Happy Birthday".They had decorated the auditorium as if it were the Shire (they know I'm a Tolkien junkie). They got me a cake from my favourite baker's, some presents and a HUGE handwritten banner that read, "Thank you for being our teacher".I had totally forgotten that tomorrow (Saturday) is my birthday. They didn't.Our Principal was also there and told me my Ss had been planning this surprise for a few weeks, even stayed late yesterday and came early today to make sure everything was set up. I had no clue.I'm typing this on my phone while ugly crying. For several reasons, I haven't celebrated my birthday in almost two decades and always spent it like it's just another uneventful day on the calendar. Today, I'm surrounded by warmth, smiles, hugs, letters, my favourite music playing, a pile of gifts (can't wait to open them; I'm like a bloody kid at Christmas), and a scrumptious chocolate cake.This might be the best birthday I've ever had in my fricking life. Did I already mention I'm choking in tears?. Now that my little monsters have officially graduated junior high and I've sorted some personal issues, I can finally share what went down after [this year's adventure.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/tcmyh9/looks_like_im_an_undercover_agentspy/). I can't believe it myself, and the whole thing made this my best year of teaching so far!!Sorry about the format - on mobile, you know how it goes 😅TL; DR - This year, my 9th graders were convinced I was an undercover agent. I framed it all as an April Fool's prank. Due to some unexpected events and the wild imagination of my students, it didn't turn out quite like I expected.So, between the last update of the original post and April Fool's, I kept at it and threw in several ideas that other Redditors offered into the mix... Loved every damned second of it, won't lie!Anyways, the day comes and I finally tell my little monsters they've been pranked big time and that the photos that started everything were taken completely out of context. I'm not working for the CIA, FBI, or anything like that.At first, there are lots of disbelieved looks, then loads of LMFAOs and whatnot, students telling me they totally fell for it, me explaining all the things co-workers, Principal and I did to make the story believable, we're all having a good laugh...Until my lovely student from Virginia stares at me hard and says it's all too sus - as in, they know I'm kind of weird/crazy (I took it as a compliment 😅), but who'd take all the effort and time to make *such* an elaborate prank, get so many people involved, etc... And besides, he said, the whole thing still doesn't explain several of the things that I do and know, or how I act.He ended up saying, "Making us think that it's a prank is the perfect cover up!!"I laughed it off and insisted I'm just a regular teacher, and even showed them this Reddit post to prove it was all a prank based on *their* jumping to conclusions... But many students glanced at me quietly, and VA student kept saying it was all "too sus" - by the end of that day, little over half of 9th grade was convinced the Reddit post and the April Fool's prank was just a smokescreen, and that I'm definitely an undercover spy, or government agent.From then up till early July (the month school year ends here in Mexico), a group of teens led by that VA student actually took it upon themselves to dig deeper and solve the so-called mystery. They tried to find me on social media yet again. They tried to get info out of my co-workers and P. They tried to find anything about me on the internet...They did a pretty good job, I have to give them that! If this had been a research project, they would've had As from me - they even got some parents invested in the research too, but I didn't learn that until a few weeks ago 🤣Buuut, here's the catch... It backfired somewhat.For starters, I'm not that active on social media - only FB, sometimes Reddit, and only started using Insta this last March. Thing is, I seldom post pics of my face/body in any of them, use different variations of my name to open accounts, and have never linked any of them to another, so besides things the "research team" found here on Reddit, they couldn't find my FB or Insta profiles, and came back pretty much empty-handed.Strike one...Most my co-workers don't really know that much about my personal life, and the few that do know a bit actually kept on messing with the students by keeping up the charade (even though I told them the prank was already over... Man, us teachers can be malicious sometimes!) or just said they couldn't tell them any private information. Whenever parents asked me anything related to my personal life, I politely changed the subject or gave vague answers - that's just how I am IRL, wasn't even fully aware how it would look!Strike two...Due to some peculiar things regarding my legal name (long story short, I have 2 legal birth certificates, plus my last name changed when I was adopted by my grandpa at 10, then legally changed the whole thing again some years ago - trust me, a complete mess you don't want to know about) and the fact that our country's bureaucracy/information management is a literal nightmare, there wasn't a lot of info my students or even their parents could find on other places either...This all cemented the idea that I was "hiding something huge" - even the teens and parents that didn't buy the undercover agent story anymore found it really weird that, while they could find so many things about other teachers (even the older ones), there was pretty much nothing about Gen Z little ol' me.Then, the cherry on the cake: the Zoom calls.Since I teach MUN and some old acquaintances of mine from junior high have actually went on to become attachés at the UN or work at European/Middle East embassies (yup, this is me turning green with envy, LOL), I thought it would be an awesome experience to have some of them as online guests during the last week of school, to let my 9th graders learn some more about the actual proceedings at the UN and some things on international relationships from people who know about that, right?So, I got approval from P to have them as Zoom guests talking to our students, enlisted 3 of my ex-classmates, scheduled them for different classes, yada yada. Last week rolls in and I inform my teens we're going to have Zoom guests. I give them a brief introduction of each one, tell them what they're going to talk about, ask them to be polite to them, you know the drill...Needless to say, Ss were quite suspicious as to how I even knew such people or was close enough with them to have them giving class presentations for us (people just don't know how many weeks it takes to prepare lessons like this, do they?).Either way, we start the lessons, I connect the computer to the projector, log into Zoom, guests show up, and it's show time.Things seemed to be running smoothly at first. My Ss listened intently to each of the presentations, and they were really into them... But when the guests did the Q&A bits, Ss slowly started derailing and flooded them with questions about me. How did we meet? Are we close? What did they know about me? Do I work with them?So there I am, trying not to laugh my head off, as the guests give me confused looks through the Zoom screen and have trouble understanding what the hell's going on. They did the best they could - yeah, they know me from JH... Er, not *that* close, not really... They don't know that much about me, but why??... Um, no, I don't work with them...The best thing, though, happened with my buddy "M".M's presentation was the last scheduled, he's been working at the Federal Foreign Office of a particular country for a long time now, and we were rather close back in school - we keep in touch regularly, and share quite a similar sense of humour.So, last presentation, last MUN class, literally the day before graduation day, and when questioned as to why he agreed to give the talk, M goes "Well, I owe Ms Silver a big one from a long time ago, so I said yes" (yeah, he owed me big time, ROFL - huge shout-out to him for taking time off his busy schedule to do this for us).All students just look at me like, "Ooooh, reaaaally?". Then VA student goes, "Mr M, can you tell us if... Ms Silver has ever worked with you... You know... In international stuff or something?".M seems surprised and I laugh into the microphone, "Don't mind them! They're convinced I'm an undercover agent, so they're trying to get info from you!"His face's projection plastered on the whiteboard awkwardly chuckles a bit... Then gets all serious, squints his eyes and says in the most dramatic voice, "Code White, Ms Silver? We'll proceed with extraction" before we hear the proverbial *shwoop* sound of someone leaving a Zoom meeting.In the second and a half that it took me to realise what M had done, my class. Simply. Lost. It. Have no idea how in tarnation I was able to calm them down without guffawing my brains out.By the end of the day, all my teens (this was only witnessed by one group) and even students from other grades "knew" for a fact that Yours Truly is indeed working undercover for X government 🤣🤣EPILOGUE:It's been almost two months since then.I promised my 9th graders I'd share my number and social media with them as soon as they graduated and their parents approved, so I did. They invited me to their graduation but I couldn't attend due to some health complications I had. Still got a lot of photos and messages from them during the actual thing.I got my contract renewed. P and other co-workers are still in stitches over this and wonder if we should keep playing this card the coming school year. M had a huge laugh too and he asked if we can do it again. I don't think I'm completely against the idea!I've also been in contact with several of my now ex-students these last couple of weeks. Some of them believed me when I told them M's reaction was totally unscripted, and that I'm not a spy or anything of the sort.A few of them are still going on with, "Come on, Ms Silver! We're not going to tell anyone, promise! You can tell us the truth now!".Several of them, however, including VA student, have finally come to terms with the fact that I'll deny my involvement with any foreign governments to the grave.Not that it means I'm *not* an undercover agent, right?Ha! Of course, they know better... 🤷🏽🤣🤣🤣. Last week, we were talking about jobs, professions, careers, university, life after school and stuff. Talking about abilities, capabilities, skills and passions. About the tests available to help you figure out what career could be a good fit for you.I asked my students what were their dreams when they were younger and how have they changed, if they planned to go to college, what they wanted to study, and what were some things they imagine themselves doing as young adults. We discussed what each of them understood by "being successful".The class was going amazingly great, everyone was taking part, they were really into it... Then this young man looks at me and asks, "Miss Silver, you always wanted to be a teacher? Like, since you were little?"Everyone looks at me. I chuckle - pfff, nay, it wasn't even on my top 5.*(Collective gasp)* "Whaaat? What *did* you want to be, then? What did you study?"Suddenly I'm telling the story of everything I ever wanted to study before college. Told them I have 3 bachelors' because I couldn't decide on just one, LOL, yet I kind of regret not going after forensics or criminology. The same student goes, "Sooo, you could, like, work as..." and there's a huge list of things I could potentially be doing instead of being a teacher... Erm, yeah, I could actually do any of that... Some teens ask if I ever took one of those career tests and what were the results. I told them the truth. More questions about what I used to do, the places I worked at, before deciding to stick to teaching.Silence again until... That... Same... Student... Asks, "No offence, Miss... But what are you doing here?"If somebody had asked that 10 years ago when I started teaching, I would've answered that I wanted to make the world a better place... 5 years ago, the reply would've been that I enjoy teaching and I'm good at it.At that moment?I couldn't answer. I stared at that young man, then the rest of my class for the longest time. I looked away. I thought about it and even considered giving them one of my old answers... Yet all I could say was, "I really don't know".I spent all week thinking about it. I had previously considered leaving the profession, more than once. I left for a few months and then came back. I thought this was what I wanted.I love my students. I enjoy most parts of being a teacher. I love those moments when my students get something or learn new stuff. I feel honoured when they open up to me, and when I'm able to earn their trust. I relish the times when I get to see ex-students thriving and getting out into the world. It warms my heart when they reach out many months or even years after leaving my classroom to say thanks or that they still remember me. I've made some very good friends in this profession and learnt many useful skills. I'm supposedly a very good teacher.But this is not what I want. Teaching is not my true passion. It's always been there at the back of my head, yet I didn't listen - or didn't want to.I've decided to finish this term, go back to school and get that criminology degree I've wanted since I was a teenager. I'll literally have to relive the chaotic life of working part-time while studying for a bachelor's. I'll even have to move states because there are no universities here that offer that career.I'm probably crazy... Yet I think this is the right move.So yeah, I just wanted to get this off my chest... And while I'm at it, wish you all the best of success, whether or not you decide to stay in the field!As long as you're doing what you truly want, and it fulfils your idea of happiness and success, then you're on the right path.For the record, I'm not a JW and I sincerely don't know much about their practices or religion, so I'm sorry if I'm in the wrong sub or using the wrong flair, but I guessed this was the best place to ask for advice and guidance.So, this lady (I'll call her "Abby") is 24 y/o and we met at work a couple of months ago (I'm a teacher, she's a part-time assistant). It's her first job, and she seldom talks to people outside her congregation, but we hit it off nicely from Day 1 during a staff meeting icebreaker. I thought she was a bit naïve for her age, granted, but she's extremely creative, analytical, and smart, very kind as well.Since then, we've spent a lot of time talking in between classes, during recess and whenever we have free periods. I became a mentor of sorts - I'm barely 4 years her senior, but she has often said she looks up to me as a professional (I've been teaching for a decade) and as a person (don't understand why on Earth she'd think that way, but I guess I'll take the compliment?).I found out Abby was a JW when I congratulated her on her birthday back in November. From then on, she became more open to talk about other types of stuff with me. She started asking a lot of questions about... Well, life in general. She seemed to be extremely interested in the fact that I left home as a teenager and kept studying on my own, for instance. She asked a lot about sex, gender, sex ed, family dynamics and interpersonal relationships. About history and social studies. About the laws of our country, politics and ethics. About films and poetry and interpretations. Stuff like that. Eventually, we even discussed a bit about our personal experiences with religion.Anyways, trouble started a couple of months ago. We used to go out for coffee at least once a week, but then she told me her family and congregation were asking her not to meet with me, that they thought I was a "bad influence" and leading her astray.This took me by surprise because... Well, I don't know anyone from her community and they don't know me, so how could they claim that I was a bad influence?I asked if she had ever missed any meetings because of me, if her family disapproved of me being ignostic/agnostic, if they didn't like the idea that I was estranged from my own family... But nope: they didn't know anything about me besides my name and the fact that I was a non-JW coworker of Abby's.My initial reaction was to say, if her family's approval means so much to her, then how about I meet her family so they can have a better idea of who I am, realise I mean them and her no harm, and perhaps talk to them about allowing us to hang out from time to time? You know, sort of asking for her family's permission to be her friend?In retrospect, it seems an incredibly naïve move, but that's what I said, and Abby was actually very glad I offered that. Unfortunately, neither her family nor congregation agreed to that (no idea what was the reason/excuse) and they actually doubled down on the idea that she shouldn't meet with me.When Abby told me this, I was sure she would say we couldn't be friends anymore... But on the contrary, she started voicing concerns about her congregation and religious teachings. And she began raising more and more questions each passing day, became a bit more independent and did some things that her family and/or congregation had told her not to... For example she started attending therapy, watching some movies like LOTR and the Hobbit, reading Harry Potter and other fantasy books, started going to yoga classes, came with me to sport events, started thinking about studying a bachelor's, became more open with our coworkers, stuff like that...About a month ago, she brought up the idea of leaving the JWs. I said she had to consider what she wanted to do with her life very carefully, weigh in the cons and pros (TBH, I had no idea about the shunning and everything else back then!), but that I'd be there to help whatever she decides to do. Abby said she'd think about it seriously, not to worry.But the thing is, the day before yesterday, Abby had her first "sexual experience" with a 30-something JW guy from her congregation, both of them aren't married... I put this in quotations because even though she says they "had sex", the way she narrated the whole thing and what happened before (her family has known this guy for years), it's pretty obvious the guy coerced and hurt her physically and mentally.As soon as she told me, I took her to get an emergency pill and get tested for STDs (guy didn't use protection). When we left the clinic, Abby broke down and said she wants out, she doesn't care what could happen, she just wants out. I offered to share my flat for the time being, to help her pack her things and everything, help her find her footing now that she wants to be completely independent, and told her I'm willing to accompany her to the police if she decides to do it.Since then, I've tried to get as much information as possible as to what it would mean for her to leave the congregation... And I'm overwhelmed, TBH.Almost everything I read so far about people leaving the JW community seems eerily reminiscent of the situation I faced when I left my family so long ago - scarring and traumatising, to say the least. Other people may think the accounts are exaggerated, but I've experienced something very similar to this and other things too, so I'm absolutely sure they're true.Thing is, I'm not sure how to effectively help Abby.She's extremely sensitive and cares deeply about her family, so I fear the shunning will break her. I'm willing to stand with her every damn step of the way, but I'm not sure my support alone, a person she has known for barely 7-8 months, will make up for the fact that she will lose all the connections she has formed over 20 years.What are some things I can do? As in, specific things?What can she expect if she decides to leave the community and her family's home? And how can I make it up to her?What are some warning signs I should look out for?I know some people will tell me to refer her to professional help, and rest assured I'll do that, but I also want her to know I'm there for her, not just in a "Oh, you know you can reach out if you need me"... More like, "Let it be abundantly clear I'm standing right beside you, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to help you".You know, because that's what friends are meant to do and I think it's the least she deserves.For the record, I teach ELA and MUN to 8th and 9th grades outside of the USA. And I apologise for how long this turned out. I just need to vent and could use some advice.Yesterday, this 9th grader asked if we could talk during recess. Nothing that hasn't happened before with other students, so I said sure. Student asked me some questions that at first were pretty normal and slowly became more specific. Why do I know so much about the LGBTQ+ community? Am I part of it? Which are some laws in our country that protect said individuals? Could I explain the difference between gender identity and sexual identity? Have I ever met someone who's not comfortable with their body? Is it normal to feel like their given name isn't right? Have I ever heard of breast binding?I replied as honestly as I could without giving away too much personal info - because I'm interested in treating others fairly and because we need to talk about it (the current English unit slightly mentions discrimination, and we're making a MUN debate about human rights)... I'd like to consider myself an ally... Your Civics and Ethics teacher is a psychologist and she can explain it better, but the way I see it, this is the difference... Uh, yeah, I know some people...At this point, I looked at Student and said, "Correct me if I'm wrong... But I feel you're trying to tell me something?"Student told me they identify as trans and non-binary and they've tried to talk to their family about it, but they are (quote) "the kind of people that say that if you're born a girl, then you are a girl, it was awful". Student has two older brothers that study in the same grade and some friends but hasn't told them anything yet out of fear of being bullied and/or rejected. Student is thinking about getting some chest binds because they can't stomach the fact that their body is developing into a woman's - Student earns some money by selling crafts and stuff and does so solely to start their transition - but their parents are forbidding them from even getting the binds and threatened to kick them out if they do it... Then Student looks at me with teary eyes and asks if I think they're abnormal, if there's something wrong with them.I almost broke down right there and then, and I'm fricking crying as I write this.I said, no, why on Earth would I think they're abnormal? I think they're awesome, creative, gentle, talented, and so bloody brave. I thanked them for opening up to me and asked if they've talked to Miss P (Civics and Ethics teacher) about this. Student said no, they don't feel comfortable with P, they told me because they feel I'm the only one they can trust.I urged the teen to talk with Miss P and told them why I thought it was a good idea and all. Eventually, Student agreed but begged me to be with them when they did that. Sure, anything I can do to help.In the end, Student said they were really sorry to ask this, they know I'm a teacher, they probably shouldn't ask, but could I help them get the chest binds? They have the money and they could buy them, but could I receive the package and then give it to them? They know this is a lot to ask, but they don't know what else to do and just can't go on like this. They promised that should anything happen, they'll deny I had anything to do with any of this.I almost said yes, yet stopped myself in the nick of time. I was in a similar situation when I started teaching (a student asked for my help with their transition; I obliged), and the result wasn't pretty (not the student's fault at all, though). Had to tell Student I was sorry, but couldn't help them that way - we would make it work somehow, we'd find a way... They were very grateful and hugged me in the end, but I could still see the drop on their shoulders when I said I couldn't do what they asked about the binds. I was already feeling disgusted with myself for saying no, their reaction was the nail in the coffin.As soon as Student left, I went to Miss P to discuss what had happened. At first, I wasn't sure if I should share what Student told me but ended up thinking Student will talk to P eventually, might give her a heads-up. Besides, she knows how to handle this and she could provide some insight on how to help Student... Lo-and-behold, Miss P said she could talk to Student about some things, but she can't guide them with their transition at all, and we should keep our distance from this to not get in trouble with the school or Student's parents.TBH, I was stunned.Miss P is part of the LGBTQ+ community and she's always been rather vocal about feminism and LGBTQ+ rights when we hang out outside of school, so I asked how could we *not* help Student? At least talk about the subject in one of her classes or something? Maybe work together in the MUN debate? We already have students in our school who are open about their sexuality or identity, so why can't we just follow through with this? If Student's family won't help them and their friends won't help them, then who will??She started saying it's not really our business, why do I even bother... And I sort of snapped, "Because we have to be coherent - how can we talk about people's rights or enforce respect towards others if we're ignoring this? We always talk about how we want our students to become better human beings than we ever were, don't we? Why do I bother?? Because it's the right thing to do, and you of all people should know it."She sighed and said I'm right, but as teachers, there's nothing we can do.***There's nothing we can do...***I've heard that phrase over and over since I first started teaching a little over a decade ago... Every time there's an instance of abuse of any kind, of neglect, of discrimination, of things we actually *could* change if it's even a little, it turns out we're not supposed to do anything, or we just can't do anything, or we're supposed to do things half-way... And I'm genuinely sick of it.Are we really that powerless? Are we truly supposed to just watch cases like this unfold before our eyes and do nothing? How can society go on and on about universal rights, protecting those who can't fend for themselves, helping others, if politics and regulations expected us to sit on our hands?Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm just too sensitive for this sh\*t. Maybe people are right and I shouldn't let these things bother me. Maybe I should just stick to my basic responsibilities and be damned...But I just can't. That's not me. It's not in my nature nor morals to *not* provide help when I can and somebody asks for it or needs it. I see a problem and I try to fix it to the best of my abilities. I became a teacher because I want to make the world a better place. I want to encourage younger generations to become their greatest selves. I want to *help* somehow.I don't think I can manage another instance where I'm told "there's nothing to do about it" or to just "leave things alone"... I really can't. My blood boils just thinking about it!! I'm a firm believer that there's always a way to deal with things and make things better. Maybe it won't be easy, maybe it won't be fast, maybe we can't see how it could be done... But there's always a way.Perhaps I should try my luck in a different field, but which? Or am I just too far gone, living in a fantasy world that can't be translated into reality? How the effing F - excuse my language! - am I supposed to just let things be if I know it's not right?. EDIT: This turned out very long and probably pretty graphic, so sorry about that and TW for mentioning abuse. IDK why I'm doing this or even sharing it, I just need to vent after all that happened yesterday...A couple of weeks ago, I left my mother's house in a hurry and left some things behind. I really didn't want to see or have any contact with that woman ever again, but those things carry great emotional value for me, so I enlisted the help of 2 of our "mutual friends" J (38M) and N (42F) - a married couple, more my mother's friends than mine, but whatever - to help me get my stuff. I figured my mother would keep her "Mrs Lovely Nice" mask on if there were other people present since these 2 had no clue what's she's truly like and she values what other people think of her and all...In the end, we agreed to meet yesterday at my mother's house so that they could help me load my stuff into my car and take it back to my apartment. As I reached that woman's house, N texted me they were a bit delayed. I got extremely anxious and terrified at first, almost turned back, but decided to just get in, grab my things on my own and be damned.I was just so done with fearing the POS that made my life miserable for so many years and so done with people not being there when I truly needed them...So, I ring the bell. She opens the door. She's all smiles and open arms until she realises I'm alone. She asks where J and N are. I reply they're running late, but they'll be here. As soon as I answer that, she drops the act and starts taunting me. Aw, are they truly coming at all? Or maybe they have better things to do than help me? What a pity they don't give a f\*ck about me! But then, who gives a f\*ck about me, right?My jaw and fists clench, but I push past her, start putting my things in the boxes I brought. My mother's voice slowly starts raising when I ignore her. Then, she's screaming and slamming her fist on the wall next to her. I tremble because I know what's going to happen, but try to stay focused and just get out of there with my things. As I put the first boxes in the car, she's already screaming the house down. A few neighbours outside give me some glances but offer no help.I break into a cold sweat. I could just wait for N and J to come or simply leave, but now I'm refusing to back down. I don't need their fricking help, never did, and I won't leave without my things. It's a matter of principles now.She starts with the pushing, then it's her nails on my skin, my back, my arms and my face. I refuse to answer back in any way, refuse to wince or growl, refuse to strike back no matter how badly I want to do it. I just walk past as I bite my lips, go back to get the bloody boxes with her at my back, like I'm on autopilot. I don't even realise I've left the front door open.She's not done with the screaming, but she's tired of clawing at me. It's time to throw things. Whatever she can find around her goes straight to my back and head. I refuse to turn my head, gather some boxes and walk down the stairs again, my ears ringing from all the cusses and screaming, my back and my face tingling with something akin to pain.I'm halfway down the staircase when I stop. N and J are standing right there at the bottom of the stairs. I don't know how long they've been standing there, but judging by their terrified faces, they've heard quite a lot of the screaming and my face is obviously a mess. My mother is still screaming, so she can't hear N's gasp and J is just staring at me.Suddenly, I feel something crashing on the top of my head. Something warm drips down my face and onto my shirt. I look down and realise that the heavy thing that broke on my head was one of my mother's heavy flowerpots, and what's wetting my shirt is blood.My eyes go to J and N again, I raise my eyebrows and a voice that's not really mine asks if they're going to help or not. My mother is running/walking down the stairs with another would-be projectile on her hands when she spots N and J. She freezes and starts blabbering, saying something about how come they're here, how *I* was acting crazy and wanted to hurt *her*, she can explain...J's the first one to move. He walks up the stairs, pale as a ghost, takes the boxes out of my hands, we get out of the house. Behind us, we can hear N asking what the hell was that all about and my mother saying it's all a misunderstanding. J walks me to my car and checks the wound. He finally asks if I need the police, the ambulance, or both. I shake my head, I just want to get my stuff and get out of here. He tells me to stay put. He runs into the house.Three overlapped voices arguing, I can barely make out what they're saying. After a few minutes, I can hear J screaming, "F\*ck you both, I know what I saw!".He walks to the car, I've never seen him so furious before. He pushes my stuff into the trunk, asks for my keys. He then steps on the gas and tells me he'll take me to the hospital and we'll call the police. I tell him I just want to go home. He says no f\*cking way, but then stays silent and just drives.He takes me home, tells me to forget the boxes and all but pulls me into my apartment. He grabs the first aid kit and starts tending to the scratches and the gash on my head. Good thing he knows how to stitch people up. We don't talk for the longest time until he asks if he can make some tea for us. Sounds good.He finally asks if "that" has happened before. I chuckle. Yeah, more times than I care to count and worse than he saw. He asks why I never said anything.I stare at him and ask if he would've believed me. I tell him I know what he and N used to say to my mother behind my back (or so they thought) - they agreed with her that I was a cold, distant and selfish person who didn't appreciate "all the sacrifices" she had done for me, that I'd come round eventually and if I didn't I wasn't "worthy of her love", that kids "are like that, they never recognise their parents' struggles"... And he could've realised what was going on. The bruises and scratches that my mother used to say I did to myself. The inconsistencies in the stories she often told. How different I act when she's around versus how I usually am with others... He could've known if he had *listened* and *observed*, if he had truly *cared*.J looks down. I'm about to tell him to just leave when he says that he's listening, he wants to know and won't leave until I tell him everything right there and then. I tell him it's too late to talk about it, what does he truly care, it's a long story anyway and not worth telling. He repeats that he's not going anywhere, he's not leaving me like this.And just like that, all the abuse I suffered from the moment I was born till my grandpa whisked me away from home, then the second time I lived with that woman, it just came pouring out. It was as if I was telling someone else's story, like I was narrating a documentary.Then, he hugged me. He put his arm around me and hugged me tightly... And I cried. For the first time in my fricking life, I cried my eyes out.He didn't let go, for hell knows how long. It was already dark when I calmed down. J asked if he could spend the night because he didn't want to leave me alone after all that. We set up the couch for him. N called him a couple of times while I was having the breakdown, but he didn't pick up until we were preparing the sofa. When he finally did, they argued - apparently, N stayed with my mother all that time, heard her side of the story and is convinced what she did was actually self-defence, that the flower pot falling on me could be accidental and whatnot. J was furious, screaming at his phone how could she be so blind, she saw the same thing he did, my mother is batsh\*t crazy, there's no way this wasn't abuse... He hung up on her in the end and stayed over.We ended up "sleeping"/sitting on the couch together all night. In the morning, he made us some coffee, and we spoke some more. He asked a lot of questions, I answered. Now and then he asked if I was okay talking about this, if there was something he could do. I said just talking seemed to work. He still thinks I should go to the police or at least the hospital, but he said he'll respect whatever I decide to do. Eventually, he left for work and said he'll drop in afterwards just to check on me, made me promise to go to the hospital if I'm feeling dizzy or my wound hurts too much.Last night and this morning weren't like talking in therapy - I actually felt heard and listened for the first time in a long, long time. I'm feeling almost... Happy? Relieved? Safe? Lighter? I can't quite put my feelings into words, not today.All I can say is it doesn't feel bad at all. It definitely feels better than I could ever remember feeling.So, after all that, here I am, writing away what happened to strangers on the web that probably won't even read this...But I'm feeling a lot better.I've always known my breasts are big compared to other women in my country (most of them are A or B, and only a few are C or even D), and I've been rather self-conscious about it my whole life. I found some full-cup bras that were rather comfy (Playtex) about a decade ago and stuck to them for a long time.Yet, there were always some issues - the gore was never flat against my sternum, my boobs were constantly doing the "escapee" act either on the side or below, straps were digging in, yada yada... Not to mention it's really hard to buy a 36DD bra in my country - whenever I had to shop around, the ladies at the stores would gape at me when I asked if they had that size, and they usually didn't, so I consistently ended up buying imported bras. I tried some other types of bras, but never felt really comfortable with them (strings were too narrow, didn't feel any support, etc.)Of course, getting a top that looks good is another nightmare altogether: every time I buy a T-shirt or blouse, it has to be XL or L, and I always end up taking it to the tailors' to make an array of changes lest I look like a cheap imitation of a circus tent, which adds up to even more $$ spent...Well, you gals know this better than anyone, so I'll move on...Today, I finally got my first professional bra fitting (that thing, although it *ought* to be a must, is not common in my country), and I genuinely reckoned they'd tell me I've been wearing cups that were too big or something.Yeah, right... Turns out I'm not a 36DD as I thought I was - I'm a fricking 34E.The lady had to measure not twice, but thrice because she thought she'd made a mistake. Based on the shape of my breasts (teardrop and relaxed... a fancy way of saying they're bloody sagging!), she told me I'd be better off with a balconette or a demi, which I don't truly like to be honest.I just feel really down.On one hand, I'm just thinking how hard it will be to find a 34E bra that's within my budget and looks nice - I already surfed Amazon, and the options are pretty limited: I'll still have to order them from overseas.And I feel even more self-conscious about my breasts now. I'm even considering reduction surgery, but it's cost-prohibitive... I thought exercising would do the trick and keep gravity at bay for a bit, yet it's not actually working.Could anyone recommend some bras that have worked for you? Any tips to prevent further sagging? And how do you keep yourselves body-positive?EDIT: Thanks a lot to those who helped! It seems like I'm was still fitted wrong and my bra size is actually 34GG in UK... I'll have to figure out how that translates into my country's sizing protocol!. I've always had a strained relationship with my mother, but during the last couple of months, we kept it rather civil (minimal contact, although she keeps pushing for me to meet her more often) and I thought I had set and maintained some healthy boundaries... Anyway, I was at my mother's house yesterday, helping her organise some paperwork and old documents she'd kept over several years.I was shuffling through papers when I stumbled upon the diagnoses I received when I was 9-10 years old - long story short; I got in trouble at school because I became physically aggressive towards one kid who had been bothering me, and the school told my mother I had to get therapy if I wanted to keep studying with them. My parents took me to a psychiatrist and a psychologist several times, I was in therapy for some months... And then it just stopped. I remember asking my mother why I wasn't going with the doctors anymore, and she said I didn't need it, that I was perfectly fine - and of course, a parent's explanation is usually gospel truth for a 10-year-old. I still had a lot of issues as a preteen, but I just thought I was truly a "drama queen" and "overreacting".Thing is, I was sure that, besides my old school, only I possessed copies of those documents (took them with me when I left home as a teenager, just to keep track of my health history if needs be), and I wasn't aware that my mother had kept any copies for herself.I read the evaluations (3 from the psychologist, 2 from the psychiatrist) and found a lot of red flags everywhere - "extremely anxious", "self-harming behaviour", "recurrent depressed mood", "suicidal ideation", "emotional detachment", "hypervigilant and hostile", "distorted self-perception", "recurring nightmares"... The list went on and on. Both documents had some notes at the end urging that "patient remain in therapy" and suggesting I started taking medication, the last document even mentioning "immediate intervention".I was dumbstruck because I was absolutely sure *my copies* mentioned none of this.I brought those documents home with me and compared the contents of the papers I had - my copies were half as long, didn't include most of those observations, and had a completely different conclusion/DX. Then, I analyzed the papers themselves and the print, including the signatures of the physicians... I realised my mother's copies were definitely the original documents, while the ones which were given to my school's administration and had been in my possession for years were forgeries.Today, I confronted my mother.She claimed she didn't know what I was talking about until I literally pushed my copies and the original documents into her face. She finally confessed she had falsified the evaluations and given the school bogus documents, which claimed I was just a regular pre-teenager having normal issues.Almost immediately, the excuses came flooding in. She said she never had the money to send me to therapy... Yeah, right - the physicians who evaluated me and the therapy sessions were free because I was a beneficiary of her health insurance. I had done my research years ago, and she had actually told me (several times) that she never had to pay a cent for anything health-related when I was young; so, she had either lied back then, or she was lying now, but she *was a liar*. Then, she claimed she just didn't have time to take me to the sessions... As if I could forget that it was my father who drove me to them and picked me up because she was never home, anyway.She gave excuse after excuse, and I gave her rebuttal after rebuttal, until she finally screamed, "Well, what did you expect me to do? I always did the best I could! It's not my fault you were f\*cked up! Wha was I supposed to do if people found out?"It felt like a bucket of ice-cold water. I realised she never, not even now, gave two tosses about me or my well-being - she only cared about herself, how others perceived her. Intellectually, I knew she was/is capable of many nasty things, and more than once I've wondered if she's just toxic or truly narcissistic, but this... This was something that I honestly could've never imagined. I just can't believe someone would do that to their own bloody child.All I could reply was a quiet "I wasn't f\*cked up - *you* f\*cked me up" before I left.It's been almost 5 hours since then. I've called my psychologist (went to voicemail), tried to let out some steam by running, walking, doing some other activities/strategies, surfing the web or doing whatever, but I'm still a mess.Worse yet, I learnt yesterday that, had I received treatment and therapy as a preteen, I probably wouldn't have developed the GAD, C-PTSD, BPD and MDD I suffer from today - of course, it's not a steadfast certainty, but it's quite probable that I would've been spared from a lot of sh\*t, or at least it wouldn't be so bad as it is now if I had continued therapy back then.That notion just makes me even angrier. Not only did she hurt me in the past, she actually messed up my future like it was nothing. She never apologised about anything, ever. It took her almost 20 years to come clean about this issue, and only because I found the papers - I doubt she would've ever told me the truth otherwise.I have never felt so much loath, disgust, and hatred towards another human being.And I've never felt so betrayed - just when I thought she could not hurt me any deeper than she had already.During this week, I met with a friend of mine at a random park. We exchanged some absolutely benign, law-abiding documents in a pair of manila envelopes, and apparently, some 9th graders of mine were in the park and took pictures of us, which they then shared with the rest of their groups.The thing is, my friend has a few quirks about him - he avoids eye contact when talking to people, loves wearing fedora hats and long trench coats, things like that... And we were sitting on opposite ends of a bench, so the whole scene actually looked like a CIA/FBI exchange from a Hollywood movie.On Friday, I have class as usual - until I realise my students are awfully quiet and glancing weirdly at me. I ask what this is about, and one of my teens (raised in the US, Virginia to be exact) goes, "Miss, we know you're CIA - but don't worry, we'll keep the secret."Woah, woah, *what*? What on earth are they talking about?They show me the pictures they took and start ticking off reasons I *must* be CIA or a spy:* I seldom talk about my personal life or my family - they know some of my hobbies, but they don't know where I live, if I'm married, where I was raised or even where I was born. They know my grandfather was in the Army, but that's about it.* My "brother" (not blood-related, but teens never got the hint), who's also a teacher at the school, has shared with them he was a SOCS before becoming a teacher - of course, it makes sense that *I* was in the military too, or had some akin training.* I speak several languages - throughout the term, they've realised I speak fluent Spanish and English, can hold my ground in German, Russian and French, and have some knowledge of other languages as well.* I know a lot about international laws/treaties and universal history, even though I'm "just" an ESL teacher - especially in MUN classes, I throw in a bit of extra info about NATO and other alliances, for example.* I know a lot about guns and martial arts - the gun issue turned up when we were discussing rifles and pistols after a WW2-themed class, gave them some inside info that I got from my grandpa... And one student attends the same gym I do, so he knows my bro and I give Krav Maga/self-defence classes after school.* I use a lot of military/police lingo/jargon in class - just for kicks and because I'm eccentric, I love using IROPA and police codes in class... You know, naming teams "Alpha", "Bravo", "Charlie", etc., telling my teens, "10-3, everyone!" when I want them to be quiet, or saying, "So-And-So is AWOL, huh?" when someone's absent, collectively calling them "my platoon" and going "Ten-hut!" when I want their attention, stuff like that...* I'm stealthy and always hyperaware of my surroundings - as in, I can "furtively" come behind them and surprise them with their hands in the cookie jar, it's like I have eyes on the back of my head... Or so they think; it's all just a by-product of my PTSD!I roared with laughter and told them I'm most definitely *not* a spy or a CIA agent, and three teens jumped, "See?! We told you she'd do that! CIA can't tell other people that they're CIA, they'll always deny it!!"I kept laughing and repeating I'm just an eccentric teacher, but they just rolled their eyes and went, "Yeah, right, Miss..."So, yup - my 9th graders are convinced I'm an undercover CIA agent or a spy 🤣🤣🤣&#x200B;UPDATE 1: I decided I'm going to play along and make this a nice April Fool's prep! Got my principal and 2 teachers on board with the plan - students know I'm close to those 2 coworkers, and they already asked them today if they ever saw me doing anything "weird"... Teacher 1 told them we go out together now and then, but I often excuse myself to pick up phone calls and then leave without an explanation; Teacher 2 told them he once saw me getting into this huge black van... P and I are still drawing up ideas, but I'll welcome any others you guys might have! ***\*Maniacal*** ***laugh\****&#x200B;UPDATE 2: I've spent this week leaving my laptop "accidentally" on while running Command Prompt, diagnostics and stuff (never thought I'd ever use the "dir", "tree" or "ipconfig" commands like this!), along with .bat files.For people who actually know what the Hell these commands do (not me) and what a batch file is (I just found out), it's nothing out of the ordinary... But for the untrained eye, it looks pretty much like you're hacking something.Guess what my Gen Z and Alpha students thought about it? LOL!I've been "cautious" about it, however: I sometimes leave the laptop in the teacher's room, as per usual, and then send students to fetch whatever from the room, as I've always done until now... Only now they return, quietly as mice, and give me strange looks every so often.We also have Mac computers in our classrooms, so I learnt how to hide the address bar and tabs on Chrome, use websites like Hacker Typer and Pranx, and just play around a bit as students enter the classroom - some of them have "spotted" me a few times or lean in to see what I'm doing before I quip, "May I help you with something?" and they just blanch and say "Nope! Nothing!".P also randomly calls me to his office just as recess is about to end and hands me random envelopes as students walk by (his office has some **huge** windows). When students "catch" us, he gets all nervous and shoos them away - he's a damn good actor, I must give him that!And yup, I have even fewer behavioural issues lately (can't say I had *that* many this term, though), there's increased murmuring in the hallways about how I'm definitely an analyst or something, and my students are giving me fewer and fewer excuses not to turn in assignments or whatever... This makes me wonder if I actually want to end this charade on April Fool's, LMFAO!. This is long, so apologies...About 2 weeks ago, student "Liz" came during recess and asked if we could talk. She's a smart, hard-working, nice teen that seldom gets into trouble (if anything, she dozes off in some classes and misses homework at times because her house schedule is a mess), so I thought it would be something rather simple.Right off the bat, Liz asks, "Have you ever made a mistake that changed your life?"... Talk about loaded questions. I answer her as honestly as I can without disclosing some sh\*t I've been through at her age, then ask, why? Does she feel she made a blunder? May I ask what this is about?Liz tells me she had sex for the first time with her BF (a student from another group that I don't teach - they're both 14, going on 15) a couple of weeks ago. It was "in the heat of the moment", but they used protection. Since then, they haven't done it again, but they always carry a condom "just in case". I was worried BF had cajoled her into sex, but after asking many questions, turns out it's not so and he seems to be a good kid.Now, Liz's mother (divorced, no contact with ex) found the condom in her bag the other day and she gave Liz an earful about how she's extremely disappointed in her, how she didn't raise her to do stupid sh\*t like that, how girls her age aren't supposed to go sleeping around, how Liz's older sister (20 y/o at the moment) never did that...Everyone in the staff knows that Liz's mother hardly ever engages in her upbringing and pays more attention to her older sister, but just to be sure I asked Liz if her mother had ever talked to her about sex, relationships, etc. - as I suspected, she hadn't. It doesn't help that our state (not the USA) provides a very weak curriculum on Sex Ed, if any.Bottom line is, Liz's mother said that since Liz is doing "adult things" then she will be "treated as an adult" - she'll have to take the bus to school with her own money (she'll have to work part-time somehow), do her own laundry, clean the house, make her own meals, etc. Their housemaid did all of it up to that point, but the mother fired her and it's up to Liz now... And Liz has no clue how to do any of that, yet every night her mother comes home, she yells at Liz because things aren't clean or ready, then gives her the cold shoulder. So now Liz feels overwhelmed, paralysed, and doesn't know how to get things done.TBCH, it didn't sit well with me that her mother didn't have any sort of talk with her prior to the issue, yet saw fit to push all the blame and responsibility onto Liz overnight - I didn't say it out loud, though.I told Liz that, while I agree with her mother that 14/15 isn't an appropriate time to have sex (explained to her why I think that), it was already done, and the important thing to do now is to buckle up and prove to her mother that she can handle this. Also said she ought to speak to the school psychologist, she may give her better advice.Liz replied she came to me because I'm the only one who ever gives them (students) "real-life advice that actually works", and she doesn't feel comfortable with the psychologist because all she does is say "it's OK to feel emotions, we're in a safe space to vent", but she never gives input on *what* to do or *how* to do it. Liz asked what she could do, if I could help her figure out how to do things by herself.I got legally emancipated when I was her age (no one at the school knows this), so I know how hard it is to have adult/new responsibilities without somebody else's support - I reckon that's the reason I thought, "F\*ck it, I'll try to help"...For the next few days, we met over in the cafeteria during her recess and got down to work. Gave her some tips on working part-time while studying and some places that hire teenagers without a problem but are still safe. Told her which buses could take her home quickly and some alternative routes. Gave her an old cookbook of mine with easy, healthy recipes. Taught her the theory of doing laundry, using detergents and cleaning products, gave her some tips on cleaning. Together, we made a schedule, and I stressed she had to stick to it no matter what because this time around she'd have no one to tell her "get your stuff done" - she'd have to rely on her self-discipline alone.It seemed to work.Every so often, Liz comes to me all bright-eyed to tell me she made it to school on time, her laundry is turning out great, she isn't missing assignments anymore, she could stay off the phone and clean the house in X minutes, she's doing great at her job, and her mother's surprised she's pulling it... Darn it, she even brings me regular samples of her cooking just to ask what I think (she needs to go easy on the salt and her chicken's still dry, but she's improving). I felt incredibly proud of her.Last Thursday, though, I got called by my principal into a meeting with Liz's mother.She told me she had figured out it was me who was "saving Liz's skin" (didn't ask, she just said, "It must be your doing!" - I didn't deny that Liz *had* asked for help, and explained what I did to help her), and that I should lay off her case because I'm "doing Liz a disservice" since "Liz f\*cked up on her own and she needs to clean after her mess alone, she needs to learn responsibility."I tried to keep my cool, said that I did what I thought was right after Liz asked for my help, that I'm no longer "on her case" (technically, not a lie since I helped her for a few days and now I'm only a witness to her success), and that while I agree Liz needs to own up to her decisions, it doesn't mean she *can't* reach out for help.My principal had my back somewhat, but in the end, the mother threatened to take her daughter out of school and sue us (no idea on what grounds) - after she pulled that card the principal complied with her demands. In short, I'm not to indulge in Liz's problems further (as in, next time she asks for my help or wants to tell me anything about her life I'm not to do anything and I should send her straight to the psychologist or the principal), and I'm not supposed to even talk to her outside of class... I clarified I don't agree with this at all, yet since he's my boss and it's an order, so be it.By the end of the day, all the staff had somehow heard about what happened and, of course, I got a lot of comments - everyone (12 teachers in all) agreed I shouldn't have stepped in at all, I should've let the psychologist handle it, this is above my paycheck, I'm already walking on eggshells because I meddle with things beyond academic issues...And I'm having mixed feelings about this.On one hand, my "teacher self" wonders if they're right and I should've handled this differently. I've been teaching for 10 years already but I'm not an expert by any means, and I've never gotten involved in this particular scenario - I'm inclined to think other people with longer careers would've experienced this, though, and if they're saying I made a mistake, then it must be so. I probably overstepped my boundaries because I let my emotions (relating to having "new responsibilities" while being a teenager) get in the way.Yet, my "human/individual self" thinks I did the right thing. It *felt* right and, deep down, it still does. It goes perfectly in line with my ethics and morals to help someone when they ask for my aid, even more so when I've experienced something akin to what they're going through. I have this little voice in my head asking, "What did they expect me to do? Turn Liz away? Ignore what she told me? Provide help in some half-hearted manner?"If the answer turns out to be that I should've stayed out of this in the first place, then I can't help but think I've been working in the wrong field for the last decade - I went into teaching because I want to help future generations, and that can't possibly exclude their personal/emotional issues, especially where teenagers are concerned. Besides, I can't just ignore someone when they ask for help and I can actually do something about it... That's just not me.I need other teachers' feedback here, please.Have you ever encountered a situation like this, or know a colleague who did? How did you react? What do you think I should've done? Do you reckon I need to change careers?&#x200B;TL; DR - A student came to me with a personal matter and asked if I could help her. I did because it felt like the right thing to do. Her mother found out about it and didn't approve. My colleagues also think I shouldn't have stepped in. I wonder if they're right or maybe I'm just truly not cut out for the education field.You ever watched a movie in which some people are bad-mouthing someone else in the restroom or wherever, and the other person is *right* there listening to them? And then when they make their presence known, the quidnuncs go silent as graves and won't even look at them in the eye?Well, that happened to me in the teacher's room today. I chewed their ears off and don't give a toss if they resent me for it.I'm still fuming, and just need a space to rant further...For starters, I can't take people who won't say things to your face - you got a problem with another person, you stand in front of them and talk about it, like the adult you're supposed to be.And so what if I'm considered the "cool teacher"? This is not a congeniality contest, it's a bloody school. And even if it weren't, it's not like I *try* to be cool. I just try to be as respectful to the students as I can, darn it! I'm not here to earn brownie points with anyone.I don't let them sit on the floor, on puffs, in lotus position on the chairs or one leg tucked under because I want them to like me better - I do it because some people just work and focus better that way, and as long as they're performing correctly, they could do a handstand for all I care. Besides, if they're comfortable sitting down, they get less stressed and less likely to get off track, which means fewer behaviour management issues for me to handle.I don't let them listen to music "just because" and all the time - for some activities, I allow students to pop on one earphone because I know some people can concentrate better with some noise around them (I can definitely relate to that), and they need to show me the playlist they intend to use *before* I let them listen to it. And they know that if they get truly distracted and stop working, music's dead and they lose the chance to listen to it for the rest of the day.I don't let them chatter away because I have no group management - I teach ESL, for crying out loud! They *need* to practice their speaking skills, and in a spontaneous fashion, not following a bloody script from a book designed by adults a decade ago! As long as they speak in English, keep discussions polite, in a tone of voice that won't distract other classmates, and they work while they do it, I don't mind being surrounded by chatterboxes.I don't stop in the hallways to speak to them because I want to become the popular teacher or because I've got nothing better to do - I do it because they're *human beings*. They're teenagers, they have their own dramas; they have their own issues that they sometimes don't feel comfortable sharing with other people, not even friends; they have a life outside of school that often permeates into their academic performance and they don't know how to handle it. Sometimes they want advice or they need help with something. I sure as hell remember being a complete mess in my teens, and if only someone had spoken to me and made me feel safe, I probably wouldn't have made a couple of idiotic decisions. So, what reason could I possibly have to turn a student away if they reach out? Being able to talk a teen out of self-harming or even suicidal ideation is a thousand times more important in my book than grading some projects that I still have some days left to check.It's not like I tell students to act the same way in every class - in fact, I often tell them to be *mindful* of how teachers expect them to behave. What's appropriate for one adult might not be so for another, and they should always ask for permission and follow the rules given by each teacher. It's as simple as that.I'm just trying my best to be a decent human being and teacher.And ooooh, my gosh... What do my coworkers care if I have a different hairstyle (and it's called a "pixie", you narrow-minded nincompoops, not "a weird masculine thing") as long as it adheres to our staff's dress code, which is virtually non-existent??Instead of gossiping, how about using that time to do something productive for a change??UUUUGHHHH...!!!Ok, the rant has ended. Tomorrow is another day!. TW just in case: Dissociation, and descriptions of violent deaths.&#x200B;I teach some rather well-off 9th graders (14-15 years old) in a private school that's thousands of miles away from this massacre. Often, they're really sweet and incredibly kind, but at times... I don't know, they just don't seem to empathise easily with some scenarios. They have their own traumas (just like we all do), but it's just... Not the same.Today, I overheard some of them talking about the news as we worked in groups during class. At first, I was happy that they were taking an active interest in an ethical/political issue... That quickly changed as I heard their comments."You think WW3 will start soon? That'd be so cool!""You think there are people blown up in the streets, like with blood everywhere?""I wish I could see the raids! So dope!""Imagine all those guns and soldiers, like so awesome! But the photos online are all censored!""Yeah, censorship sucks!"I just froze and stared at them, refusing to believe my ears, unable to digest what I was feeling.Some teens realised I was acting weird because I'm usually funny, easy-going, talkative with them and stuff. But 5 of the students just kept going, so immersed were they in their exchange, until one girl turned her head and point-blank asked me in what *seemed* the most obnoxiously ignorant tone, "Wouldn't it be cool to see the real deal, Miss?"Everything turned white, no warning.When I came to, every single one of my students was staring at me with a terrified look on their faces, some of them visibly quivering, one or two close to tears.I was shocked, had no idea what I'd done or said. I apologised profusely, had to calm them down for the longest time, and finally, one of them could find his bearings to tell what happened.Turns out, I had slammed both hands on a desk and my face twisted into something they'd never seen on me before.I told them in a "really scary" voice that they could never handle "the real deal" because >!they've no bloody idea what it's like to have a gun pointed at their faces, no idea what it feels like to hear a gunshot so close to you it leaves your ears ringing for hours. They've never smelt the rusty, smokey aroma in the air after someone gets shot next to them. Have they ever stared into the muzzle of a loaded gun, knowing that with just a small twitch of another person's finger, their life could end? Have they ever held a loved one in their arms so tightly that their blood spluttered and covered their faces and chests, going into their eyes and mouth? Have they ever tasted blood?!<I pretty much described, in graphic detail, the shootings I witnessed when I was their age, and what it felt like (smells, taste, sounds, everything) to see my boyfriend getting shot and dying about 7 years ago. It seems I went on for quite some time.I've never felt so appalled in my life. It took every ounce of willpower not to crumble and sob in front of them. I apologised to them again, had to fetch the school psychologist and the principal to let them know what I had done. They were taken aback (nobody at work knows about my past, my C-PTSD or my ties to the military, and I've almost had no problems with students - we actually have a great relationship) but they handled things from there.Yet, I'm still feeling utterly disgusted with myself.Watching my teens so shaken up and knowing it was *me* who caused that distress tore my soul apart. I went into teaching to *help* students, to ease them into real life, I'd be willing to lay down my life for them, and today I just went and royally f\*cked it all up.Besides police guns from afar, none of my students have ever *seen* a gun. They've never been mugged, kidnapped, or trapped in a shooting. They've never witnessed someone dying, not even at the hospital. And I just crammed it all down their throats without a filter.They're literally just kids - they didn't need to be told about the ugly side of life that way, they didn't deserve that. *Nobody* deserves that!I'm half-wishing my principal to call right now and tell me I'm fired. And if he doesn't, I feel like I should resign first thing tomorrow. I can only think how I deserve the worst right now.I f\*cked up so badly, I'm so f\*cked up. I don't know what to do. I hate myself for doing this to them.I really need to share this, it's almost unbelievable!*Some background first:*I work at a private school where teachers are hourly employees, which in my country translates as virtually no rights to social security + no sick days/leave. In a nutshell, if you're absent because you're sick, it doesn't matter - you don't get paid, and that's it.I've always suffered from cluster headaches since I was young, and they can last for quite a while (sometimes up to 3 hours). I always have my Sumatriptan on the ready, but these headaches are very sudden and the pill can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to work its magic, which means I still end up with excruciating pain for several minutes even if I take the pill as soon as the pain starts. Luckily, the episodes aren't that common (maybe twice a week) and I never had an episode while on the job. Until today.*What transpired:*I was entering the classroom when I felt the stabs surrounding my eye. I quickly asked the teens to take out their materials and start working, excused myself, ran to the teacher's room, and swallowed my pills. Then I went to the principal's office to let him know I needed a short break and someone had to monitor my teens for a while. Now, my principal knows about my headaches, and he's always been the most supportive guy to us teachers, he always worries about our health and he's the type of Admin that's willing to sub for you if needs be...But today, he wasn't alone. Our superintendent "Darla" was in the office with him - to put it *very* mildly, she's not the nicest person in the world. As the principal was telling me to go lay down in the nurse's office, Darla started asking why did I leave my students unattended, why am I making such a fuss over "a simple headache", who's going to sub for me... By then, pain was full-on, my nose was runny and I was tearing up, so I had a hard time articulating that my teens were fine and working and that I really *really* needed to take a break (first time since I started working at this school that I ever ask for anything remotely related to sick leave or a pause...)Darla goes, "If you don't go back to your class this instant, then go home, but you'll lose today's pay and I'll write you up!"I really couldn't afford to lose even a day's wages, my pain was too overwhelming to argue my case and the principal's face told me he would not challenge his boss, so I just winced and limped back to my classroom.I tried to continue the lesson as per usual. My teens, however, immediately noticed something was off and asked if I was okay. I mumbled that I just had a bit of a headache, but I'll be fine... After a few minutes, it was clear that I wasn't fine - I was literally keeling over because of the pain, tears were streaming down my face and my speech was slurred.Then one student went, "It must be a migraine!", and it was like she had given a signal: everyone started shutting the window blinds, switching off the lights and the projector, getting their lunch boxes out to offer me a drink of water or a snack.A boy said they'd do their work, but I must lie down. I was so lost in pain that I actually did just that - I lay on the floor, appearances and public image be damned. Suddenly, teens started flocking around me, putting their jackets under my head to make a pillow. One teen bolted to fetch the nurse while others sat around me whispering if I needed more water, if the A/C was too cold or too hot, and the rest of the group went back to work in the most deafening silence...Just then, Darla came into the classroom and all but screamed what was I doing on the floor.And you know what my students did?**They** ***shushed*** **her.** They bloody whisper-shouted, "Shhh! Ms Silver has a migraine, don't you see?!"I wanted to hug them so badly right there and then.Eventually, the nurse arrived with the principal, and they took me to the teacher's room together with two of my tallest students, who all but insisted on carrying me. I stayed there for a while until the pain subsided and I could go back to my class. I carried on with my day as usual (with students asking now and then if I was truly all right) until the last period, when Darla came over and said she wanted to speak with me.There in the hallway, right outside the classroom as my students were leaving (dumb move, if you ask me), she told me I had been utterly unprofessional, that she'd write this incident up, yada yada... Honestly fed up with everything I quipped, "So? You going to fire me over this?" and she haughtily replied, "Don't think I can't!"Oh, boy, she *shouldn't* have said that...The students who overheard immediately jumped in and started shouting it was totally unfair, she couldn't do that, they'd tell their parents, this would go viral, they'd tell everyone... Darla tried to double down but eventually made a hasty retreat. My students still made a huge ruckus until I calmed them down a bit and the principal came running. In the end, students left still upset, my principal said he'd work out things with Darla, and I went home.A few hours later, my phone chimed with a dozen notifications of mails, all from my students' parents. It seems my teens told them about what happened today, and they were all extremely supportive: they asked how I was feeling, some proposed to refer me to their family doctors, others said the way I was treated was completely unacceptable and they'd speak to the principal or the board, but I couldn't be let go. One parent (a lawyer) even offered to help me out if I get fired.I've never cried so much in my entire life, it's like I'm fricking dreaming. Very few people in my life have been so supportive, validating, and kind.I still don't know if I'll lose my job or what will happen, but I can say I'm truly happy I have my students. We often struggle, it took some time to build rapport, sometimes they can act crazy or lazy, at times their parents can be a real pain in the backside, yet today none of it matters.I deeply appreciate what they did for me, and I sure as Hell will let them know.So, I have a rather large extended family, but I know my genealogy up to my great-grandparents and my second cousins once removed - yeah, I admit it, I'm a bit of an ancestry geek...Anyway, I was just messing around checking my genealogy for the umpteenth time when I suddenly had the idea of looking at everyone's Sun signs and realised there's a repeating pattern since my maternal great-grandparents and all along the matrilineal side of the family.Considering Western astrology and its 4 elements (air, fire, water and earth), specific pairings of elements (parents) result in a certain element (children), Sun signs themselves notwithstanding.The pattern with the elements *always* happens like so:* Fire + Earth ***/ / or / /*** Water + Water = Air.* Fire + Fire ***/ / or / /*** Air + Air = Water.* Water + Air = Earth.* Earth + Earth = Fire.I double and triple-checked, but so far I haven't been able to find an exception, not even with stillborn babies or premature births, previous marriages or partners. My father's side of the family is completely another story (no norm I could pick up), but I still found the matrilinear pattern oddly peculiar.Could there be a reason these arrangements happen?Does it arise in anyone else's family?How common is this?. I appreciate some people want to help me out. Truly, I do. I'm grateful when they genuinely think they'll be able to let me vent with them and offer advice or just a shoulder to cry on.But the truth is, most of them can't take it. They don't understand, and they can't put themselves in my shoes, as much as they wish or hard as they try.I'm young, but I've already concluded that the only people that can actually understand the effects of my traumas haunting me are those who suffer from PTSD/C-PTSD themselves or a handful of psychiatrists/therapists - everyone else just can't deal with it.It's too much for them. They give me these flabbergasted looks, they can't find words to convey what they're thinking, they just can't wrap their heads around the fact that I'm still alive after everything that happened. At times, they can't even *believe* what I tell them.I've grown tired of acquaintances or friends pressing me to share things with them, to "open up" and trust them... Only to have them confused/terrified afterwards, not knowing how to react, reacting poorly, or simply treating me differently after I tell them even a smidge of the truth.When I say, "You can't handle my past, so let it be" it's not a challenge. I'm not telling you to prove otherwise. I'm not asking you to try extra hard to get me to talk. I'm not saying you're any less of a friend or SO if you can't understand me or don't fully know about the abuse.I'm just stating a fact.And the fact is, you don't want to even glimpse at my demons.This might be long and I'm not sure it will make sense, so apologies for that.Our relationship hasn't been the best. When I was younger, she was abusive. I won't elaborate, but it was bad enough that it got to a point where I physically fought back when I was 11 because I thought she was literally going to kill me. I ran from home and stayed with my grandpa (her father), who stepped in and refused to let my mother come near me or even talk to me after that.He advised me to seek legal emancipation and helped me start the process before he died. I was 14/15 when that happened, and I did attain emancipation. I moved to another state, got my mental health checked, started therapy with different people, built my life and didn't have any contact with my mother or most of my family for almost a decade.I kept in touch with one of my cousins, and I was 22 when he told me my mother had suffered a stroke and nobody in the family could take care of her. I felt troubled and talked to my then-therapist about this, and she thought it might be a good idea to try to "mend the bond" and solve the issues I never addressed with her.So, I went to visit my mother for a few months. Things seemed to go fine, we talked a lot, she apologised for the things she had done in the past, said my leaving had been the right decision, she told me she had been diagnosed with hormonal disorders and fibromyalgia, I shared my own diagnoses with her, stuff like that.It was like I was talking to a completely different person.I thought we had both changed enough to give the relationship another try - we're both adults now and communication had improved a lot, after all. I moved closer to her, started checking on her and everything, slowly re-built something that looked like a filial bond. So far, so good.I had just turned 24 when she convinced me to move back with her and work with her. Therapist thought it was a good idea too, so my mother and I discussed our boundaries, made a detailed cohabitation plan which, among other things, included me continuing therapy and her starting her own, some household obligations, some compromises, things we wouldn't do, how we would discuss things that were bugging us, an agreement that we wouldn't get involved with each other at work, stuff like that.Problems began within months.At home, she started dismissing my boundaries and our promises, never went to therapy, and the verbal abuse came back. At work, even though we belong to complete different departments, she dropped in on my department unannounced, began asking questions to my co-workers about my schedule, my habits, everything!As soon as I called her out on these things, she became passive-aggressive and began telling me it was all in my head, that she didn't mean to hurt me, that I was probably overreacting because of my mental issues... It really threw me off, especially since I didn't have any close friends with whom I could talk about it and because my therapist (the same that encouraged me to rekindle communication) often agreed with my mother's thoughts or told me I had to understand that my mother probably was struggling after the stroke or with her own issues, yada yada.It felt like I was losing my mind and couldn't trust my own thoughts after feeling quite normal/functional (as much as I could be in my situation) for ten years.The thing is, I became close friends with a neighbour who works with us as well. He could see I was struggling, and that there was something wrong with the dynamic I have with my mother, but it wasn't until last year that I finally opened up to him about everything.The first thing he said was that my mother's behaviour wasn't normal at all, then urged me to change therapists. It was one of the few times I actually felt validated, and there was this sense of relief that I wasn't as crazy as I thought. I followed his advice and got another therapist. Worked with him for the last year and I eventually reached the conclusion that I need to leave again ASAP and this time for good.This past month I packed my things, looked for a new place to live, and found another job. I'm effectively moving out in a few weeks.Both my friend-soon-to-be-ex-neighbour and the new therapist have been truly supportive, but there's this tiny part of me that suddenly started questioning if this is the right move.It feels almost sickening that I can't trust my own judgment at almost 30 years old, but here I am, wondering if I'm truly overreacting, if I'm just doing this because I felt validated by 2 people, if my mother truly can't help it and I'm punishing her without cause, if I should stick it out and give the relationship yet another chance.I often hear people say, "do what feels right", but that's the thing - I feel torn, it doesn't feel right either way. *I don't feel right to begin with*.Am I doing the right thing by permanently cutting ties with my mother?&#x200B;TL: DR - After parting ways with my mother for 10 years, I tried to give the relationship another chance. Things went awry. I'm leaving again, but I'm not sure it's the right call.&#x200B;EDIT: First, I truly thank everyone who took the time to read and offer advice and their thoughts - you honestly don't know how much you've helped me!Something happened a few hours ago that has finally led me to realise I'm doing the right thing by cutting her off of my life completely. This was the straw that broke the camel's back.She truly hasn't changed at all. She was just better at hiding her true self and she was clever enough to make me seriously doubt myself for almost 6 years, but she's still the same person who beat me, scarred me, and made me feel like a worthless POS.I should've known better and I'm really disappointed that I allowed the whole thing to escalate to this point before being able to trust myself again and realise how deeply toxic the relationship is... But better late than never.If there's anyone out there dealing with a situation of abuse, I can only echo what many commenters said: ***Please, get out and don't look back!***. Scorpio is much more present in my natal chart than I previously thought.I was around 11 when I read the horoscope section in a newspaper and realised my birthday meant I was a Scorpio. Didn't get too immersed in astrology until I was in my late teens, but then I started reading about the natal chart and planets. Did the Math, investigated a bit more.My Mercury, Mars and Pluto are all in Scorpio. I also have a bunch of other orbs in their corresponding/natal signs - very few of them are *not* paired with their ruling signs.Very cool!Fast-forward to my early 20s and I found out about the houses. Lo-and-behold, I've got good ol' Scorp (and consequentially, my stellium) in the 8th House, which is considered by some to be **the** house of Scorpio.Ok, that's interesting...A couple of years ago, I learnt about Ceres and Lilith. Went ahead, did the Math and also used an online tool to corroborate just in case.Guess where they're located...?Last month, I found an article on Pallas, Juno, Nessus, and some other asteroids. Instead of checking where they were in my natal chart straight away, I looked into their orbits... You know, just to figure out the pragmatical odds of having over 5 asteroids within the same space at any given time.I'll save you the Math: it is possible, for certain, and especially when you look at certain asteroids put together... But *very* unlikely when you consider other pairings.With that in mind, I finally did my calculations and checked not one, but three different online tools that calculate and show all planets, houses and asteroids together in the natal chart.All I can say is ***bloody freaking Hell*** \- my natal chart looks almost empty except for the cluster of planets and asteroids on the upper right quadrant.While I know asteroids might theoretically and pragmatically not have such a huge load of "energy/influence" as opposed to planets, I still find it quite peculiar and even unnerving to see a stellium and almost every asteroid (save from Chiron and Juno, which are in Virgo and Libra respectively) in Scorpio.It's even eerier when I consider the fact that I was an overdue baby and my birth had to be induced - as in, WTAH?I like astrology and all, but I study it as a hobby rather than as a serious discipline per se, so I didn't expect to be so shaken.We went back online despite being F2F for the last couple of weeks before winter break because my country's Education Secretariat just loves to jump from one foot to the other and didn't think COVID would hit again.(*Rolls eyes)*Anyways, I was mentally prepared to have near-empty Google meetings or students coming in late during the first day, perhaps even the full week...However, I was surprised to see my first class (I'd probably consider them the toughest group of 9th graders I've got) already had several students in the lobby when I logged in - I'm always 4-3 minutes early, so they were even more punctual than I was!We chatted for a bit while I waited until 7 o'clock to "officially" start the class. By the time I said, "Ok, corps, we're going to start now", I had 37 out of 39 students logged in. Heck, one young man even got online while he was in his parents' car, coming back to the state from his holidays.Students had all materials ready, and we finished the lesson in record time - not a single behaviour issue, no broken record of instructions, nothing. Compared to the first weeks back in August, it's night and day!I was so surprised I actually wondered out loud if they had been abducted by aliens and brainwashed or something. Teens laughed and said that they really missed me and ELA/MUN classes...(*Holy freakity frack, I'm definitely dreaming...*)Same thing happened with the rest of my groups (9th and 8th grades) - almost all students logged in punctually, engagement was superb, and everything was pretty much paradise!At the end of the day, the staff had a meeting to discuss any issues... And I was left even more befuddled when I heard most teachers complaining that students hadn't turned up at all or they had shown little involvement in class.I've got no bloody clue what the hell I'm doing with my teens or if this is some elaborate prank, but I'm feeling so freaking great I just want to jump on the bed.I know this is a sticky subject, but I've been genuinely intrigued for several years.Do you think this should be legal? Yes, no, under specific circumstances? Why?Under which circumstances would you consider it and why?Have you ever fantasised about undergoing euthanasia or assisting someone?For the record, I'm considering euthanasia to be "the deliberate ending of a person's life to relieve their suffering", and assisted suicide as "deliberately helping or assisting a person to kill themselves".\- \* - \* - \* -Personally, I think we ought to have the right to die as we see fit just as we're supposedly allowed to live our lives as we see fit. As long as we make an informed decision about it and it's our genuine wish to do so, I honestly don't see a pragmatic reason to be deprived of such a right.I would definitely consider undergoing euthanasia if it were legal and I was no longer able to take care of myself (due to old age rendering me unable to function autonomously, terminal illness, or my mental health deteriorating), and to relieve society of what I'd consider being a burden - if I can't offer anything to society anymore, why should I waste space and resources that could be efficiently used by other people or to aid them?The man I always considered my parental figure died a slow and painful death over the span of 2 years (pancreatic cancer). My family was well-off enough to provide some palliative care, medical aid and the like, but he often expressed his desire to die with his dignity intact.He was unable to do so due to my family being adamantly against it and euthanasia being illegal in my country. Even today, over a decade after his death, everyone always comments how he was "incredibly lucky and strong" - his initial prognosis had been mere months, but he went on to "live" for way longer...Yet, each day during those 2 years, he would confide in me that he didn't want to die this way, that he welcomed death because he had had a good life, and wanted to pass away peacefully, by his own right. More than once I genuinely wished I knew enough about medicine, law and assisted suicide to help him die with some resemblance of dignity, as was his wish.I didn't like seeing him this way because, as he once said, he was "turning into a shell of his former self, and this was not *living* by any standards".I feel I should've done so much more than just quipping into the family's conversations every now and then about how he wanted to be left alone, to die in peace or able to decide when and how to die, instead of being prodded and filled with tubes and catheters, fed medicines like sweets, and feeling as if he were slowly turning into a vegetable.Little Tigress, how come you by?How come you by these stripes?Little Tigress, please do not lie.&#x200B;Trickle, trickle, little rubies fall,Soul and heart with blood soiled,Within, flames and ice embroiled.Down the rubies drop, one and all.&#x200B;Little Tigress, were you born thus?Or someone smeared them unto you?Little Tigress, why the secrecy and fuss?&#x200B;Moonlight stripes, milky, svelte, and smooth.A spellbound canvas, one would believe;Yet they are nought but strife and grief,Forgotten memories, unspoken tales of youth.&#x200B;Why, Traveller, ask you for my tales?Confusing my scars for pretty stripes,When all are ribbons of pain and wails?&#x200B;‘Tis the story of Life I would rather soon forget.Dark secrets I hid within, and tears not shed,Wounds left unhealed, hatred scorching red,From all those hopes and dreams that I never met.&#x200B;[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/qov3a2/is_shea_alright/hjpuhb9/?context=3) & [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/qoracf/sharp_end/hjpi9by/?context=3). Not sure how to flair this, but there it goes.So, to be honest, I'm a very private person - I seldom share anything at all about my personal life with students or school staff. I've got a close relationship with the Physics teacher, but that's about it. My students always try to find out information about me, like where was I born, what's my ethnicity, how old I am, if I'm married or have kids, stuff like that.Anyways, yesterday (Friday) was my birthday and I was supposed to leave early because some friends had prepared a special dinner for me. Nobody in the school knew anything about this except the principal, and he was away for the day.For some reason, the last period was harder than normal. The previous teacher had done some type of craft activity and the classroom was incredibly untidy when I came in - students complained loud and long when I asked them to clean after themselves before we started the class (I genuinely thought we were past this!). Then, they weren't focusing on the lesson: many had forgotten their books and even notebooks, so I had to repeatedly ask them to change seats and work in pairs with others, to ask their classmates for a spare paper. They were taking forever to get ready, and it was plain clear they weren't as eager to participate as they usually were, there was a lot of complaining about the project we were working on...Long story short, I was feeling extremely tired, depleted, and just wanted to cry. It has been quite a harsh week as it is. I literally had to sit at my desk, close my eyes and take a deep breath because I was so overwhelmed. Some teens were taken aback - I never, and I mean ***never***, sit down or lose it in front of my students - but most of the group just kept at it and didn't mind.Then, the door opens and the Physics teacher peers in with a big smile and his booming voice, "Hey, Miss, forgot to wish you a happy birthday!". And just like that, the door closes again.You could hear a pin drop as every single student stared at me, sitting on my desk with my eyes downcast and trying to find my bearings. One teen who had been the loudest grumbler a few seconds before stuttered as he asked if it really was my birthday. I croaked out that it was.Suddenly, all 40 ninth-graders were up and quietly doing what I had asked them to do for ten minutes, moving their chairs and tables around so the students without books were next to those who did bring them, asking classmates for a sheet of paper so they could work... I gawked as my students organised themselves in under 3 minutes and silently waited for me to continue the lesson.One of the so-called "troublemakers" (IMO, he's just extremely bright) said he apologised on behalf of the group for "ruining my special day". Then, he started singing "Happy Birthday". I couldn't prevent myself from shedding tears as the rest of the group followed suit.We finished the topic in record time, not one behavioural issue at all.The bell rang and I dismissed them as usual, wishing them a nice weekend and opening the door for them... And before I knew it I was in the middle of a tight group hug, receiving beautiful hand-lettered notes and drawings as makeshift presents, voices telling me that I'm a great teacher, that they're so sorry for making things hard for me, that I deserve to have a great day. Three students even went out of their way to help me carry my bag and stuff all the way across the school to my car.I'm close to sobbing as I write this down.I think they care.>Plagiarism is *presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own*, *with or without their consent*, by incorporating it into your work *without full acknowledgement*. > >**- University of Oxford,** ***et al***.I've always made a point of explaining to my students, of any given grade/year, what is plagiarism, why it is to be avoided, and so on.Every single term, I make it abundantly clear to them, as well as their parents, that any submitted work containing plagiarism will be automatically graded with a zero (0) - no second chances, no excuses, no turning back. I don't give a damn if only one single teeny tiny answer contained plagiarism and the rest of their work was paraphrased - one single instance of plagiarism, and they get a big fat zero for all their effort.... Well, I've been teaching for a little over a decade now, and I've never seen so many instances of plagiarism as I have in the last 2 terms, especially when I ask these teens to analyse and explain something using their own words and thoughts in MUN classes or ELA's reading comprehension!I even find plagiarism in exams, because online lessons...The audacity of these students is mindblowing - or is it ignorance? Lack of common sense? Do they think I'm joking? Do they reckon they can outsmart me (or *any* teacher, for that matter) in that particular matter?As in, do they actually *think* I'll read their assignments/exams and go, 'Oh, Ms So-and-So used the word "belligerent" in her answer! Of course, it's part of her lexicon', when she couldn't come up with a synonym for "antagonistic" in the past exercise?Or that I won't realise that Mr What's-His-Name mentions the Balkans when barely the day before he was clearly struggling in class with the names and locations of European countries?Do they *really* think I can't tell the difference between their grammar and spelling mistakes and an elaborated argument done by someone who clearly spent a long time coming up with those concepts and ideas, with perfect punctuation?I don't know what angers me the most - knowing that the future of the country I'm currently residing in has little or no care at all for integrity, realising that parents try to cover up those ignominious practices, or the fact that I've suddenly gone from grading analytic skills to picking up plagiarism.What I *do* know, is that I've had enough. ***Bloody. Enough.***I don't care anymore if this sounds way too cruel or harsh, but students like them are wasting everyone's time and resources (including their very own), they're draining our teachers' patience, and they're pretty much insulting us, not to mention dishonouring themselves as students and individuals.These disgusting practices need to stop. Not next term, not tomorrow. ***Now.***\*Heavy breathing\*OK, now I'll go back to grading exams... Gods, I really don't want to anymore!. My boss, co-workers and acquaintances consider me hard-working, smart and funny. I'm constantly told my work is outstanding. They say I'm ambitious, organised, resilient and independent. People seek out my advice. I often hear compliments on how kind and mature I am. They say I can be incredibly dedicated and focused on a task.Keeping up that façade takes every single drop of willpower I've got, though.I tried to end my life many times during my teenage years. Very few people know about my mental issues, including MDD - fewer still are willing or able to help out. The few times I opened up before, sometimes they tried to help, but in the end, they either tell me I'm too much to handle or they lose their patience with me.I understand this mess is not theirs to look after, and I'm supposed to be the one handling this mess which is myself, but it's really hard to answer "I'm fine" whenever they ask how I'm doing. It's hard to smile every day and crack jokes. It takes every ounce of energy to accept an invitation to hang out with co-workers or acquaintances. It's exhausting to pretend I'm okay.The truth is I often cry myself to sleep for no reason at all. I feel lost and empty. I haven't been able to envision myself "in 5 years" since I was a teenager. I don't have any long term plans/goals anymore. It's a struggle to get out of bed every day. I often forget to eat. It's hard as f\*ck to keep to my schedule.I try to keep myself busy because I know that's the only way to avoid thinking about how much I hate myself and my life. I work harder than everybody because I don't want them to realise how weak and dumb I truly am. I focus all my energy on doing something, *anything,* because I know I won't be able to control that horrible fog in my head and the void in my stomach if I'm idle. My hobbies have become monotonous activities that feel completely bland and empty. Everything I do is an excuse to not think about what lies underneath.I've learnt that people don't really stick around you unless you're "fine" or you make them believe you are. My family has always had the "fake it till you make it" mindset in regards to mental issues and other things, so I haven't really had much aid from them either.I haven't been able to afford therapy for a long time, and even back then it wasn't really working - at least I was able to get labels and names for the things that were f\*cked up inside my head, but the tips and ideas to keep them under control were barely working at all. I was on meds for a while, and I think it worked a bit, but then I couldn't afford them either.I try to tell myself to take it easy and live one day at a time, but lately, I've felt like this is bullsh\*t - why live one more day when I have nothing to look forward to?Sometimes I wonder if I wouldn't be better off just letting that fog take over and be done with this once and for all. It'd be easier for everyone, in the end.On the very first day of school, I asked my 9th graders to make sure their books and notebooks had a name tag - the school admin also sent a circular letter regarding this.I admittedly didn't remind students a second or third time, because... Well, I thought it was a matter of course to write your name on your school textbooks and notebooks, especially in a group where you have 30+ classmates, I reckon?And come on, these guys are 15-16 years old...!Anyways, today I asked the teens to leave their notebooks and Pearson books with me - at least those who were F2F today (we're still working synchronous hybrid at the moment). As you do, I grabbed the bulk of 15+ books and notebooks, went to the Teacher's Room, got ready to grade any missing exercises or pages...Lo and behold, almost 10 of the books and notebooks have no name tags.Never mind whether the exercises are complete or not, whether the notes are missing the date/title or not. They. Have. No. Names. 🤣🤣🤣Am I supposed to be a certified graphologist on top of all the "unofficial jobs" I do?What's next - reminding students to bring pencils and pens to school?Oh, wait... I already *have* to do that...I'm laughing so hard right now. ***Miss\_Silver.EXE*** has officially crashed🤪. This will be a loooong rant - you've been warned LOL!The principal made up a plan before the term began:Half of each group (9 in all secondary/junior high, 40+ students each) was supposed to take online classes on Mondays and Wednesdays and would come to school on Tuesdays and Thursdays.The other half would be online on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and in-person on Mondays and Wednesdays.Everyone was supposed to take online classes on Fridays.He sent that plan to all parents in secondary/junior high - he shared it with teachers as well, and we all agreed that it was a marvellous idea. Several of us went ahead and made our lesson plans based on this schedule. It seemed efficient and as perfect as it could get...It's been almost 2 months since we started classes, and they may very well be the 8 most disorganised and chaotic weeks I've ever had in my 10-year-experience as a teacher.***And all because some parents cannot follow through with instructions, and they just decide to do whatever they please!!!***Barely into Week 2, and many students who were supposed to be taking classes online were dropped off at school by their parents, with no notification to the principal's office whatsoever. At the same time, students that were supposed to come to school decided to stay at home - or rather, their parents didn't bother bringing them to school. Again, most of them gave no explanation or even a heads-up.Week 3, many students who stayed online want to attend school in person, and other students are staying at home to take classes because their parents couldn't take them to school or whatever...By mid-September, the whole thing was complete mayhem.Admin pretty much washed their hands of this. So far, the principal hasn't been able to reinstate the initial plan, and probably won't be able to...Now, I have no clue who's going to be taking classes online and who'll greet me inside the building.I can no longer schedule assignments on Google Classroom ahead of time... Unless I send the activity to the entire group and then spend several minutes editing the recipients or answering messages and emails from students or parents saying "I did this at school! Do I need to repeat it??".I can't ask students to leave their notebooks or books with me so I can grade them, because I've no idea if they're coming to school tomorrow, and I don't have enough free periods to check all of them in one go... And asking them to take pictures of their notes or the work they did in their books has proven to be one of the worst ideas I've ever had.Group projects (and I mean doing *actual* collaborative work) are nearly impossible since we only have 15 available tablets for the entire building at any given time, there's only one desktop computer in each classroom and there's no way to know whether Student A or Student What's-Their-Name will be online tomorrow or not... At best, we can do some activities in pairs.So many things can't be organised, scheduled or planned correctly anymore.I thought online classes were going to be the worst I ever encountered.Ha ha, nope.***This***, right now, is as close to Hell as I'll ever be.Yesterday, I had a meeting with a mum (let's call her Karen) and my P regarding an assignment in Google Classroom, and it went something like this...*(She spoke in that undefinable tone and pitch that makes you want to encircle her throat with your hands and shake her this way and that)***Karen**: How can you ask my boy to read over 200 pages in a single day?? What KIND of teacher does that?? He has a LOT to do in the evening, he has football, he goes out with his friends, he can't be glued to his phone doing homework!! You're ruining his life and he's stressed, yada, yada, yada...*(We let her rant to her heart's content... P and I spent almost 13 full minutes or so biting our tongues)***Yours Truly**: ... Mrs Karen, the assignment was sent a WEEK AGO, so as to give students the chance to complete the assignment with no rush... (*Shows Karen the release and due date in Classroom*) ... On the other hand, your son didn't have to read the whole PDF - he just had to read 15 articles, which all in all amounted to 2 pages or 3 at the most. I wrote that in the instructions, it's right here. (*Shows Karen the instructions*)**Karen**: *(puzzled look)* I--- But--- But still! How was he supposed to find those articles in the PDF??? He would have to read the entire thing anyway!!**Yours Truly**: (*Moves her finger a smidge down the screen*) As you can see, in this list where I pointed out the articles they had to read, I ALSO wrote the pages where they could find each of the articles...&#x200B;To say Karen was utterly confused and speechless is the understatement of the century.P had to cover his mouth not to laugh in her face, and I think I grew a new pair of muscles for all the times I strained not to roll my eyes to the back of my skull.Now, I'm just laughing my head off. I swear, parents and students these days are something else...There, I said it.I just finished a meeting with my coworkers and Admin. Started at 8 pm, ended at 9 pm (no, I won't get paid for this meeting), and all Admin said was we "have to make sure all students' cameras are on during online classes, no exceptions" (we're doing hybrid synchronous lessons) - there won't be any severe consequences, like getting kicked out of the online class or anything. Nope, they just ***have*** to have their cameras on.And I've had enough of this - 18 months listening to the same damn thing, I'm over it.I teach 9th graders. They aren't little kids anymore, they don't need me to supervise their every move, nor should they - I'm a teacher, not a nanny or an FBI/CIA agent.Do they want to lay down in bed while taking the class and fall asleep? Do they want to walk around their house/room while we're talking/working and get distracted?They should know better by now and, either way, it's their loss and my gain since I'll be left with students that take online classes seriously and won't waste my time by making me go 'Mr So-and-so, turn on your camera!" or "Miss What's-your-name, your camera!".On the other hand, some of these kids have very lousy WiFi or internet connections, and turning on their cameras will use up a lot of bandwidth - it has happened to me before, so I can definitely relate to that frustration of being told, "You're frozen!", or the internet bailing on me and kicking me out mid-meeting because my Internet couldn't cope. Or maybe their camera is broken and they just can't afford a new one. Maybe their house is a mess and they don't want to be made fun of. Things that are out of their hands!If they're leading the discussion, sure, I agree it's best to turn on the cameras. But otherwise?As long as my online students can engage in a class by turning on their microphones (which they do), using the chat (they do that as well), or sharing the screen (they love that), I don't give a bloody damn if their cameras are on or not.Crikey, there are even some studies out there that seem to point out that turning your camera ***off*** during video meetings boosts productivity and reduces fatigue/stress - I sure as hell can attest to that notion!And either way, what's the bloody point of turning on cameras in junior high? I'm supposed to have better "management" because I can see their every move? If they turn on their camera, they'll automatically pay more attention? Will they respect me more?Again, they aren't little kids and I'm not their gendarme. A video feed from their end will not make them understand the subject any better, won't make them respect me or my classes more.The way I teach and the way I treat them will see to that, in my opinion.OK, so I know I'm not supposed to vent, and I'm supposed to keep a positive mindset.But, seriously? I can't anymore.I teach ESL/ELA at a private junior high school in Cancún, Mexico. According to our bloody-good-for-nothing government, schools with positive COVID cases ***may have the chance*** to go online, but it's not mandatory. We don't have any unions at all either.All teachers at my JH are floating/cart professors - most of us teach 2, 3 or even 4 different groups/grades. I move to 3 different groups/classrooms each day, 4 days a week. Teens spend 3 hours a day with me, Tuesday to Friday.We're constantly reminding Ss that cloth masks are useless against COVID, we spend half our classes asking Ss to keep a safe distance between them, to keep their masks on, to cough into their elbow and not the air, recess is a major pain in the ass 'cause teens flock together like bugs to a flame... Or at least, I'm one of the few teachers that are constantly on their case about it.No help from our Admin. Since day 1, and many times over the last few days, I told them we ought to have some protocols in place, that Ss shouldn't be allowed into the building unless they use appropriate face masks, that we ought to make parents sign an agreement of sorts in regards to what are the basic sanitary measures that everyone must follow, that it would be better to have less Ss in our classrooms... And of course, I was dismissed as being too paranoic.One of my 9th graders went to a bloody party last week. He still went to school in-person for 4 days after he went to that party. He started looking quite sick a few days ago (dizzy, headaches, coughing, shortness of breath). I sent him to the nurse immediately. I was told I was just making a fuss...Fast-forward to this week, and some of his classmates are also showing symptoms. I've been running a fever for the last 2 days, I'm coughing and sneezing more than usual, and my throat is sore; another 2 colleagues that have been in contact with that group are on the same boat.Admin finally headed my plead to have the teen sent home... And today, my student's mother sent a message to Admin - he tested positive for COVID.I thought, 'Of course the entire group and the teachers that have been in contact with that group will be sent home for a few days, right?' ... Oh, *no, no, nooo*, no such thing!That particular group will be sent home for 2 weeks and they'll take classes online, yes.But the teachers who were constantly in contact with the teens?We're going to keep attending school in-person. We're going to continue moving from classroom to classroom. We weren't even asked to undergo any PCR or antigen tests to make sure we weren't fricking infected.The better to spread COVID to other grades and groups, I suppose...?OK, seriously, this is BS. Anyone with half a functioning brain cell should be able to see the risks here. We. Constantly. MOVE. From class. To class. Every day. Every 50 minutes or so.I'm waiting for my PCR and antigen results as of now, but hopes are plummeting. My 58 y/o mother (also a teacher) lives with me, and she's been feeling quite poorly for the last 2 days as well, even though I tried to stay in my room as far away from her as possible, I never took my face mask off at home, and we tried to thoroughly clean and sanitise every single fricking thing I touched during the last couple of days.Worse yet, Mexican Independence Day is less than a week away. People will go out. They'll gather on the streets. They'll visit their families. We live in a tourist spot. We're going to be bloody sitting ducks.Admin keeps saying that 'one confirmed case in one group' isn't enough reason to be alarmed. Keeps telling us that as long as we're vaccinated, we're perfectly safe...***Do they have no sense of R0, Re, or how the spread of diseases works?******Don't they know that vaccines don't render us completely immune against COVID?******Have they forgotten the past 18 months??******Have they completely lost their minds, or just don't give a sh\*t??!***&#x200B;I swear this is complete and utter b\*ll\*cks.To be fair, I'm no stranger to entitled parents. They can be loud, they can be dramatic, they can be passive-aggressive... But **this** is the first time one of them left me almost dumbfounded with their display of rudeness.So, our junior high students are meant to finish classes at 14.30. Parents are supposed to collect them by 15.00 hrs *at the latest*. I don't know how it works in the USA or other countries but, where I live, private schools such as ours aren't supposed to keep students in school after 15.00 unless we're offering "afterschool activities" (which, due to COVID, we're not doing at the moment), lest we get penalised (financially) by authorities.First week back to school, and one of my students' mothers is consistently late. Every. Single. DAY.She ends up appearing at 15.15, 15.30, 15.35... Not because she works, mind you - she just has "a lot of stuff to do" which apparently is more important than picking up her 9th-grade son...Today, I was on duty. Clock strikes 15.00 and, of course, my student's mum is nowhere to be found. He tries to call her several times, but she won't answer. Clock strikes 15.30... Then 16.00... By now, the teen, my principal, the janitor and I are the only people left at school, since no relatives can be reached and we can't just leave the teen alone in the building.Eventually, the principal had to leave because he had a meeting. Fast-forward until my watch read 18.46 (I've never stayed at any school building so late) and a car finally appeared at the entrance. Since this was becoming an everyday occurrence and we could get in trouble for it, I approached the car and tried to talk to this "mother"...The teen was all curled up in the back seat, looking embarrassed as hell, while I was explaining to his mother why we couldn't afford to stay so late at school looking after one child, that we can't offer "afterschool activities" as of yet... She gave me the nastiest bitch face I've ever seen on a human being and said that maybe she'll just get her son out of our school and that would solve the problem (I guess some parents in private schools truly think that threatening to take their kid out is the ultimate menace, huh?)I started to reply that it was a decision that she had to talk over with the principal, when she simply rolled up her window - yup, while I was *still* talking to her.My reaction was to smile sweetly and yell, "Well, good day to you!" as she closed her window and drove away, but maaaan... Deep down, I honestly wanted to crack her windshield open, grab her by the throat, beat her black and green, and split her skull open!!I don't get paid to be disrespected, and especially not by some f\*cking jerk that thinks it's okay to leave her son alone for over 4 hours like it's nothing.I feel really bad and sad for the student, and I'm still feeling murderous.So, I had resigned in early April after I suffered a PNES (psychogenic seizure) brought on by stress. The initial plan was not to go back to teaching at all and just find another job after taking some time off to look after my health - I did that, took a much-needed break and all...Either way, about 3 weeks ago, another school contacted me with a job offer (8th and 9th grade ELA classes), and I thought, "Well, I'm in a better place now, I love to teach and I love teens, so what the heck!"When I met my co-workers and the principal for the first time... It was absolutely FANTASTIC - 10 years of teaching and this place has by far the best work atmosphere I've ever perceived!!!**P** is open to suggestions, delegates responsibilities like a pro, lets you know clearly what he expects from you and his feedback is concise and efficient. He replied to all my proposals with either "That's a great idea, go ahead!", "Tell me which materials/resources you need, so I can get them for you by tomorrow/day after", or gave me really good advice on how to make things easier for me and the students!!Almost all of the other teachers (except *one* \- that's right, just ONE) are efficient, incredibly warm, and helpful. They joke a lot and offer solutions instead of simply complaining about the issues the school or students have. 2 of them gave me a hand decorating my classroom this week, and the teacher from the previous year not only offered to help me navigate the new books and LMS they use but also gave me (much needed) input in regards to the students and their current level of English... I didn't even have to ask for it, he just went, "If you want, I can tell you how your groups look like right now"!!They're also willing to work on interdisciplinary projects, which in my country is *very rare* \- I've already drawn up a joint assignment with the Social Studies, Arts, and Maths teachers. It was almost scary how easy it was to bring ideas together, draw out the planning, delegate responsibilities, define the final product, and set a schedule for that!!I've yet to meet my students and their parents... But after meeting this team, they can turn out to be a bunch of bloody babbling bumbling band of baboons, for all I care!!It's almost too good to be true, and maybe something will come up eventually, but right now ***I LOVE MY NEW TEAM AND I'M ROLLICKING FROLICKING HAPPY!***.
    as far as I know people with DID have memory gaps. but doesn’t that mean it’s impossible to study something, because you switch and forget?. Sometimes I think I’m lesbian and sometimes I think I’m straight. This sexuality is so confusing. Like thinking about who I like more but I can’t decide because it depends on a situation. I hate it. At first he spoke to me when I was at home through telepathy then I went to school the next day and the magical feeling took over my body. I thought it wasn’t real. I don’t believe in spirituality but I know twin flames are real now. I’m a divine masculine. I thought narcissistic personality disorder and sociopathy was a negative diagnosis that can’t love and I’ll never find love, but if I have those disorders does it mean he does?. Back then when I was bullied I had a long plan/fantasy of a school shooting. I fantasized about stabbing a person who laughed at me instantly and setting a school on fire. At home I also hurt someone who mistreated me and got hospitalized for a long time. It went away after the bullying stopped.I don’t feel like I’m enjoying anything anymore. I don’t enjoy hobbies. I don’t interact with people in school. It brings me so much depression. It’s like I’m stuck in a never ending loop of emptiness. Like I’m stuck in one place. I try getting stuck in the fantasy again, but it feels so empty inside.I’m currently on medication, so I don’t feel manic anymore but it was kind of like a drug sometimes. Sometimes it was annoying, thought. I miss it. I know I’m supposed to be on medication and I’m getting better, but I wish I felt it again.
    I’ve had thoughts of these things for a while and I really vivid idea that I think about is throwing or losing something like a drivers license or a social security card and seeing how my mother responds to it. I know she’s be upset about it but like what kind of toll would it take? I’d had thoughts of being in a hospital so I was able to smell the hospital like I did when I was really sick as a child. Like I’ve had thoughts of breaking my leg or overdosing so I was able to feel and smell the hospital like I used to as a kid. I’m new here but I’m just here to share thoughts I’m unable to share with anyone else.
    There could *not* be a worse day for this. I have boxes to pack and move and cleaning to do I cannot be curled up crying. I can go months without breaking down about the loss of my partner. And then I see a tv episode about a widow or see someone with his smile and I just lose it for days. It’s so unpredictable and I feel like the longer I go without a breakdown the worse it is. I’ll be ok but I hope anyone else who feels like this knows it happens to me too.I’m bringing my fiancé for his first Scamp, first festival, and first time camping lmao. I’ve been to dozens of feats I wanna know what other newbies would have liked to know I don’t know how to prepare him. Also I’ve only ever car camped at Scamp and we’re doing GA so any tips would be very appreciated! Let’s make this last year the best!☀️. Does anyone know if there’s a way to get just a Friday-Saturday pass? I have to work on Sunday and I’m not trying to buy a three day because I’m honestly gonna leave late on Saturday but there are also not one day passes for the earlier days. OR if anyone is selling a cheap 3-day ticket that would work too. If anyone can help I’d appreciate it☀️. I was so so wary of telling my fiancé my diagnoses. I was so…not ashamed, because I knew he would understand once he fully understood. But the more people that know…the more people that know. And I didn’t want the stigma about me to spread. But he made me feel safe and understood and promised he would read resources *I* recommended and not judge me by anything other than myself and I’m just so so relieved after two years to have this off my chest.Mine is definitely the ish Finn gets for his “doughy”(?) body. Guys do not get made fun of for being shaped like Finn. Not even in 2010. They were trying so hard to make it seem like he was fat or something??? And he wasn’t. Made it seem like any guy without abs gets mocked in high school. And why would they write Azemio and Karofsky making fun of Finn for being fat when they…looked like they did. None of it made any sense 😭 The Rocky Horror Glee Show has some of my favorite Glee covers and that subplot ruins the episode. Finns hot and popular and the quarterback and NOT fat. I’m still confused as to why they chose to do it. They could have made the episode about Kurt? Being skinny or something. Or idk cast an actually fat actor and gave them screen time. Anyways what are y’all’s?. …that anyone outside of us will ever accept me the way I am. Feeling a bit better. More hopeful now. But I mostly felt bad about stepping away from this community. If no one else will accept you or relate to your problems, I will. So I’m back and I’m sure most of you are like uuuh who is this. So hi! I’m Liz. I’ve been diagnosed ASPD for 10+ years and I’ve helped a lot of people on this sub (not as many as have helped me) but I am here for you all. DMs are always open for venting or advice and I want to remind you we’re not all edgelords or resigned to a life of othering. You can get better. You can grow. And I’m here for you. Trolls DNI, or do, I’ll just ignore you.Tiktok would have been a great asset in a new age gossip girl that the current reboot lacks. I can genuinely imagine a OG style check in with tags on the fyp about the main group it could have been good. I say this as someone who hasn’t watched the whole reboot but just sayin.That you’re a hardcore member of a fan base of undoubtedly one of the best lyricist and creator of the 20th century? Idk sometimes it blows my mind that I know and respect so much about someone who deserves every ounce of credit he’s gotten. There’s no superficial fanfare here. Nowhere else on the internet for fandom is like that really. Not even the Beatles. And don’t get me wrong I am a huge Beatles fan, and for their music. But I don’t feel like there’s a fan that isn’t there at least a little for the aesthetic. And I feel like sure there are Dylan fans like that but…you don’t get that feeling here on this sub. I feel like everyone here has had a visceral feeling or experience with his music. I just feel like it’s crazy how intense a fandom of someone so old is still so electric. And I’m in my twenties. And despite my parents being huge fans of artists from their time I found Dylan all on my own. And I feel like his music is very transcendent of time and age. I just feel very lucky to be here with all of you and having gotten to see him live. Love you all and I love what you all bring to this community.Followed me back on Twitter and responded to one of my tweets and liked it and if I posted this there I would seem like a silly fan girl but the person that made a lot of the content that got me through the pandemic (or is still getting me through) knows I exist! And that’s cool! Anyways hope everyone is having a good night :). I’m a tenured partner and I only got a 1% raise? Anyone else?. I’ll go first: The Titanic. I love this movie and it’s nice and long so I thought it would be great but then the boat sank and I just wanted to save all the people and I had a little panic attack and we had to turn it off.I’m so sick of seeing that “Professionals say Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men is what a rEaL psychopath looks like.” I just. Want. One neurotypical person on the whole planet to understand what ASPD is like for the average person with this disorder. The *minority* are violent. Violent thoughts do not equal violence! Anyways. If you want to see a real portrayal of someone with ASPD watch Sleeping With Other People. Main guy 100% has ASPD and I don’t even think they meant to write him that way. Seriously watch the first ten minutes and tell me that guys not a sociopath. And the main girl definitely has BPD.And I am proud of all of us, I didn’t know if I could handle today and I did. We’re gonna be okay. I hope you all felt loved and supported today.EDIT: I love this community and I am so thankful for all of you and everyone sharing here. Knowing we’re not alone is what we need more than anything. Thanks for that, love y’all.Just got to the part in S6 E11 “Domino Effect” after Big’s heart procedure when he’s running a fever and he says to Carrie, “How about it, kid? You and me, the early bird special.” And…they never make it that far. They don’t get to grow old together.From the moment I wake up to when I go to sleep I need some sort of stimulus to keep my mind from wandering to the pain. Does that ever stop? Been a year.They should have tips on it or something it’s amazing how unhelpful they always are.Has anyone been referenced since the bonus increased and been accredited the $200? It’s been a while since I got my friend hired and I haven’t gotten it and my manager seems to know nothing about it.Spring Gathering 2018 VIP Holo Poster2 of 3 Deja Posters 2019 DOTD POSTERNYE 360 2019 VIP Poster Noise V. Beauty VinylAll available! Comment or shoot me a DM if you’re interested! ✌🏻. Is it a guy thing? I mean Joey was also dating another woman it’s not like Kathy cheated on Joey. And then Chandler throws that “well when you consider how we started out” at her thing when he’s jealous? And Joey was fine with Chandler dating Kathy until he found out he kissed her but…they weren’t exclusive. I understand being mad but *as mad* as he was was weird.Good ole circle faces. They’re held in and unable to speak like prisoners. They’re killed pretty much without much discretion. So you’d think they were being paid something extreme but then why sell the organs? Are they just sick fucks who want to watch the games too? That’s supported by the taking-turns-with-the-corpse bit. Are they also down on their luck? Maybe not financial ruin but criminal histories? Need a home and job away from the police and government? Do they live on the island full time and help build the world of the games? I really don’t have any concrete theories to who these guys are and I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts.Carrie sure does lose them a lot! Stolen at gun point! Stolen from a party! Eaten by an animal! Maybes it’s the things you love the most in life you lose so you appreciate them.Had a dream of an alternate BD where Bella dies but Jacob still imprints and the wolves try to kill the baby and almost succeed because the Cullens are preoccupied protecting Rosalie from Edward because she can’t hide her thoughts that she’s happy because she wanted Renesmee to herself and Edward is trying to kill her. And then Jacob ran away with Ness and tries to hide her from everyone and raises her and then Edward joins the Volturi and tracks them down when Ness is like 12 (or looks 12) and Edward tries to kill her! And then I woke up. It was crazy.I think Rosalie is a likely candidate. After Renesmee matures and goes off with Jacob Rose won’t have her around as a daughter figure anymore. I think it’s possible she could talk Emmett into fathering a child with a willing human who they would promise money and immortality to after the birth. I also think Aro will probably attempt it. Whether he will tempt already existing hybrids to spend time with the Volturi so he can study them or even father a child himself. I think Aro would probably seek out a human with some sort of ability and try to have a hybrid child with them. After all he is seeking a psychic. Combine that gene with his mind reading power and you could have a powerful hybrid that would be loyal to the Volturi and able to blend seamlessly with humans. What do you guys think?. That in the twilight universe the myth of mermaids originated with vampires. Say there was a coven of female vampires that lived on a mostly deserted island in the middle of the ocean. They wouldn’t have to worry about human interference or hiding from the sun and would have their whole area of ocean to themselves for recreation or what have you. And they could, whenever necessary, sneak up to unsuspecting fishing boats or pirates- gorgeous and sparkling in the water. And lure them away to feed on them. Has anyone else here ever thought of this before? I don’t think the Volturi would mind this way of life and it would give those who chose it freedom from human interference so they wouldn’t have to be nomads.Found a grey hiking backpack abandoned in the farthest end of the parking lot Sunday around noon, watched it for hours hoping someone would get it. I’m determined to find it’s owner if you can tell me what’s in it I’ll get it back to you!. I can’t find the price of parking on their site I know we buy when we get their also I never got a wristband or ticket just a digital Etix? Is that ok? First timer here.Getting a very passive aggressive text response from someone you didn’t know was mad at you might be the actual worst thing ever help I have no capacity for processing this amount of frustration, confusion, and indecision. Finally going to get The Anthropocene Reviewed but I also want some other stuff! There is an author both brothers have mentioned and recommended more than once and I cannot remember his name! I wanna say his first name is Philip? Does anyone know who I’m talking about? Help a girl out so I don’t have to go my bookstore twice in one day (not that that would be awful but I don’t think my wallet could take it).Totally obsessed. What do we call ourselves fans of the row? Critch? Fae? Carnies? Discuss.It’s the one year mark tomorrow and there’s still no place for me to visit, no grave to lay flowers on or sit with and talk to. And it hurts so much and if anyone else is grieving without a grave to visit I’m sorry because this is awful.Am I right? You know the one.And I am sick to my stomach thinking about how I have to go in and do it all over again tomorrow. And I’ve been doing this for ten years!! They must know??? They must know the understaffing is *killing* us. How do they sleep at night? Do they not know?? I will be composing a formal complaint to my manager this week and I suggest anyone else feeling this way to do the same. Enough is enough.Tyra says *multiple times* on the show that retouching costs THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of dollars. Is that true?? For one person’s photo shoot?? Was this really the standard pre photoshop? Is it still like that?? I just remember watching the episode where they rip into Fatima about her armpit hair and thinking like “I could fix that in photoshop in 10 minutes what’s the big deal.” Anyone else?.
    Every one of my relationships in some way ended because I stopped being interested or my partner became too insecure about me not caring about them. And idk, they might be right they might not be, I can't tell. Even my family members stay clear of me and invite me out of familial duty and habit. My mother and siblings have explicitly expressed that they can tell that I don't care about them in the standard way. I appear like the best person ever when you meet me, but when it comes to showing care and dedication, all that "affection" disappears within a week and the illusion disappears. I used to be able to keep it up for longer but I genuinely started becoming so tired by it that I quit.I want that mushy soft caring love that ordinary people have. But I'll never be able to feel it even if by some magic I do get it, so what's the point?.

I imagine a hire functionality and self isolation as a defense against abandonment? Oscillation of going months even years at a time being completely content being alone and then having an intense hunger for connection and intimacy, only to be disgusted by it and to want to turn away and become cold to their partner?. 4th Seizure after having a TBI where someone busted my head open with an Assault Rifle which was swung at my head like a baseball bat. The first episode happened roughly 5 months after the incident and I’ve had one about once a month ever since. They always start at night soon after I doze off to sleep and I’ve also noticed that during every episode I have been sleep deprived. I’ll be having a dream and all of the sudden my body will collapse in my dream like someone shot me in the head and my dream visuals will turn pitch black. This will happen a few times until eventually I wake up shaking violently, unable to move, unable to speak, semi conscious of what is happening until I black out and wake up shaking again. This will usually happen three or for times all maybe over the span of 45 seconds to a minute.Something else that’s strange is it feels extremely hard to breathe, it’s very reminiscent of being strangled or choked out in jie jitsu. I can feel something tightly squeezing or wrapping around my neck as I lose control of my body and black out. After finally being free of the shaking spell I feel extremely terrified, it’s hard to breathe/ swallow, my throat feels swollen, and my head/ body hurts like crazy. At first I thought I was tangling my shirts/ hoodies around my neck but then I realized these only have been happening after having my head busted open and receiving a concussion. This last time was the worst as after the episode I had extreme cold sweats, just freezing cold and just completely drenched in a layer of sweat. I couldn’t feel my pulse with my hand over my chest and when I felt my pulse down on my rest it was extremely faint and slowed way down. I also had this immense left arm pain/ tingling feeling that felt very strange. I’m trying to figure out if it’s worth doing one of those sleep deprivation eeg studies and maybe possibly even a sleep study. I have had sleep paralysis before and this is different. I’ve never experienced the inability to breathe or the involuntary shaking. I’ve been so anxious since it’s happened and am just seeking advice or reassurance.. thank you..4th Seizure after having a TBI where someone busted my head open with an Assault Rifle which was swung at my head like a baseball bat.

Like even while psychotic your reasoning can make sense there’s just no evidence? Or especially when in remission, you find yourself less influenced by emotional input and tend to be very rational? Or if you’ve ever done mbti I’m curious what you type as? I’m an INTP. Is it true that there’s a form of Auditory hallucinations where a noise will sound like something it isn’t to you? When I hear running water I hear people moaning very vividly, or the ac will sound like people screaming. Also I get things like hearing wind or rattling and I make out people talking bad about me.Is this a known type of hallucination or is it just my imagination? I am diagnosed schizophrenic but as far as I was aware I’ve never experienced a Hallucination, except for when I went off my Vraylar. Only ever really had paranoid delusions, ideas of reference, and the negative symptoms.“ Roko's basilisk is a thought experiment which states that an otherwise benevolent artificial superintelligence (AI) in the future would be incentivized to create a virtual reality simulation to torture anyone who knew of its potential existence but did not directly contribute to its advancement or development.[1][2] It originated in a 2010 post at discussion board LessWrong, a technical forum focused on analytical rational enquiry.[1][3][4] The thought experiment's name derives from the poster of the article (Roko) and the basilisk, a mythical creature capable of destroying enemies with its stare.”https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk#:~:text=Roko's%20basilisk%20is%20a%20thought,to%20its%20advancement%20or%20development.She agreed to fly down with him to get him used to being over at my new place. We have 50/50 custody but am only now able to have him over because I just got my own place. She’s been flirting with me a lot lately, asking if I’m still single, saying how handsome I am, telling old inside jokes that we used to flirt about etc. at first she hated my guts for letting her down and not stepping up more but as of late she’s really been super flirty and taken a deep interest in my life again.I really want to fix our family and to put everything back together. I still love her and I know it would be best for our Son. She originally left because I was extremely depressed and addicted to video-games, I was going through some heavy trauma and it made me very selfish and withdrawn. I was a total garbage fiancé and father and might as well have been dead. I didn’t help much with our Son and I spent very little time with her. It’s been 7 months now and I’ve learned a lot since we’ve been apart and have been able to change many of my old habits into better ones. Any tips or advice to making things work? Any ideas on dates or ways I can show her appreciation? Thanks. I thought being a Doomer had more to do with seeing through the proverbial rat race, and feeling depressed because Modern Day Life feels extremely meaningless. I thought it was a pervasive sense of loneliness because everyone seems so preoccupied with Hoi Polloi things and fails to understand the fundamental reality that is Nihilism? Or is Doomer more encompassing? And just general depression? Thought it was more so an intellectual loneliness more than a lack of intimacy?. Do you always have to live in the county where you were issued the voucher for 12 months before you can move? Is that only for moving out of state? I’m so disheartened after having finally gotten approved for Section 8. Feels like I will be homeless forever with no place for my Son to visit.Edit: so I called my local RHA and they told me I can’t switch counties nor can I switch states until I rent for 12 months, no exceptions. Unfortunately they also told me that they are not doing any extensions. Anyone else in a similar position your best bets seem to be, Facebook Marketplace, AffordableHousing.com, your local RHA website, 211, local homeless shelter, as well as the old fashioned way and meeting private landlords and tell them your story and how they could benefit from Section 8. Also I moved right to the top of the waitlist because I was homeless, have an extremely low income $1,100 a month, and am on disability. I must have emailed 30 people on Facebook market place and got 6 offers in one days time. Good luck!. I’m a total newbie and started the beginning of this month, I’m currently disabled so I have all day to spend on this craft. Currently I’m at 5 hours a day consistently, trying to work my way up to 8. Roughly how long should I expect it to take for me to be in a position to become a Junior Artist? Or to be good enough to get commissions? Also, any tips on how to get commissions? I play Warhammer 40k and was thinking I might be able to get some through the group of friends I am in but am unsure of how to gauge when I will be ready to fulfill something like this. Thanks for any advice and tips!Also how much would you charge for a stylized miniature in the style of 40k or something like World of Warcraft?. I’m pursuing this as a career, should I be concerned? Is there a future for me here?. How much per hour or per commission can one expect to earn once they are able to make AAA level characters? How many hours should this take on average? I’m just getting started and am curious to see where I could be headed. Thanks for the input!. Just curious if it’s common to react with equal or greater force, or if you just let it go?.
    hey everyone. new here. 28f with ASPD/Bipolar Disorder. my impulse control is severely lacking and due to that i got caught after months of stealing. makes my 3rd arrest. kinda bummed about this last arrest as it puts an end to my shoplifting career. can't risk it anymore, but was fun while it lasted. i'm curious what prized possessions you've stolen. the biggest for me was a 50 inch 4K TV.
    There's no denying that I am one hell of an eccentric little weirdo with some fantastic quirks and a hefty list of mental health issues, alongside a tic disorder that although generally mild really adds a nice fistful of freaky rainbow sprinkles on top of the whole sick doughnut cake...As much as I've come to accept and love that irredeemable dork, there are times I do some random shit that makes me wonder if it's just another facet of my strangeness, or if other people share these tendencies. In this case it could also just be a matter of being high, which of course often makes users act like Pleiadian lunatics performing space yoga, but aside from revealing myself as a bit of a mental case I figured there's no harm in asking --When nodding, do any of you start having entire conversations with yourself, or figures in the semi-dream Nod state, generally without being aware you're speaking to people who aren't there? Talking to myself or responding to voices is something I do semi-regularly anyway, but this is when I'm conscious - sober or otherwise - and I know that's more of a psychosis symptom, but one I'm fully cognizant of being a psychiatric behaviour. I find it pretty funny when I come round more from the nod and catch myself doing this, realising the situation that's playing out isn't happening in reality. Sometimes it can involve some movement, like trying to pull aside an imaginary wire between me and the Nod guy, or attempting to hand them something. Thankfully I'm never in public doing this shit, but it tends to make me laugh whenever I come out of it.Anyone else with similar stories?. Comment section: Drugs turn you into mindless zombies, man.Spoilers for John Wick 4 fyi. >[JW4 - Berlin nightclub fight](https://www.reddit.com/r/JohnWick/comments/17996rt/jw4_berlin_nightclub_fight/) by[u/sickdoughnut](https://www.reddit.com/user/sickdoughnut/) in[JohnWick](https://www.reddit.com/r/JohnWick/). Aside from the obvious Interstellar and Inception which sort of have a similar energy, if you enjoyed Flashback (...or it's original title, The Education of Fredrick Fitzell, which I think fits the arty weirdness better...) there's a movie called The Frame... Prime lists it as a 2023 movie but it's 2014. It hit me in a way really similar to Flashback, where I was basically incapable of doing anything after except sit staring into space embroiled in emotional chaos...I literally just got watching this movie and my mind is fucking blown. Like I’m a mess. It’s one of the best movies I’ve ever seen.I'm midway into watching John Wick 4 and my immersion has been totally thrown off due to the nightclub patrons dancing like crazed robots despite people fighting, shooting and dying around them. Wick just hacked someone to death with an ax and none of the civilians batted an eyelid. There were a couple of moments some folks stopped and stared at them going hand to hand on the upper walkway but they were basically like lol oh well. I've been enjoying the movie so far but this scene is so stupid.For me, in the S2 finale, Mat was the standout character. From the struggle you see in him when as a broken mess on the verge of mental collapse, he's presented with the dagger that for me as an addict resonated so closely with having a bag of gear and a rig dropped on the table - this might not have struck other viewers in a similar manner, idk, but I know what that would feel like and how difficult it would be to resist, particularly given this major trauma he's just been through, showing him how he's fucked up again and again being so fresh and raw in his mind... most addicts would just snatch up that gear and give in. Because we do that to ourselves, we feel we're that disgusting ugly piece of shit and our minds won't quit turning over all the bad decisions and horrible behaviours that forecast the inevitable repeat of the same old crap, so we might as well just use again, because it's all we're worth, and for a while we don't have to remember it.So you see him in that state of mind, and I honestly figured he was going to pick it up, but then the genius little fuck pulls off the absolute MacGyver of the Third Age, which was just brilliant. Egwene impressed me with her mega Ishi-Nope shield, and Moiraine's splodey Seanchan genocide was glorious, but when Mat blew the horn and all the heroes manifested, I had full-body goosebumps... except not when they swirled into formation, as exciting as that was: it was Mat, the way he shifted and realisation spread across his face and he says, "I remember, I remember..." as each lifetime of true heroism smashed through all those shitty memories, and another hero of the horn turned to him and said, "I have fought beside you a thousand lifetimes..."Oh my God. Every hair on my body stood up. I don't know or remember the line he roared in whatever tongue it was but I wanted to yell along with him.Couldn't we get things cleared up one way or another in regards to the main R\* allegation? The accuser says there was another women there which was the reason for her rejection, so that means there was a witness. Why hasn't she been brought forward in order to corroborate or deny the events? Even if she was in another room, she would have heard commotion - I would imagine anyone hearing those kinds of noises would have come in to see what was happening. Has this been covered and I missed something?. This is kind of irrelevant but I was impressed with this enough that I had to say something - idk how they did it, because if it was CGI then I couldn't tell, but the age regression on Moiraine and Siuan in their flashback was remarkable. I don't think I've ever seen any other show or movie in which they pulled off the same so well.At several points throughout the show, particularly season 2, I couldn't help feeling like the driving force behind the phenomena has an agenda to bring itself to a wider audience... that it goes beyond the crew journeying through this powerful initiation and is directly using them to reach the minds of millions of people. Not that this means they aren't experiencing an initiation; I don't think either possibility is mutually exclusive, but that they might both be part of the Plan... the talk of divine rebirth, opening the gate, Pan returning to life as this documentary ignites something in its audience. There's a definite sense of feeling as though you're there with the crew, like you're going through it all together. It might need collective energy on a massive scale to return. Does that concern or excite you?Another question on a similar vein - do you think it's possible for the phenomena to manifest in your own life simply through watching Hellier? These are hypothetical questions - I'm not experiencing anything that seems related (yet, lol) but I have had a lot of experiences in my past that watching doc has brought up for me, and with hindsight and some of the discussions in the show I feel like I may have missed an initiatory event(s) that occurred when I was a lot younger.Lawless society for the elders... with the exception of sexual assault and murder (and probably attempted murder) ... for a month or two, to see whether they would maintain their behaviour as part of well-developed conscience and respect, how much deviation would we see if those with less years in front of them than behind were given carte blanche to do what they like without consequences? I guess many wouldn't have the energy and/or being set in their ways would apply to adhering to social principles, but I'm also not sure if I'm making assumptions out of ignorance and perhaps ageism. So I'd like to challenge that, on a personal level.It could be followed by similar social experiments for various age groups but I feel like younger folks are predictably likely to take advantage of it - the older and elderly I'm more curious about.Because I'm not sure if this bag I have right now has zenes or xlyazine in it, does anyone have suggestions as to how to manage to withdrawal when I run out? I have just over 2g left - weighed, with an empty bag tared, to 2.071. Tapering ofc is an option, but you know we're all shit at that. I'm on MAT, 60ml methadone, but obviously if it's tranq it ain't gonna do owt for that. I could get lucky and it have neither of those, but it is a weird high so I'm apprehensive, especially with that weird stomach bug I had when I ran out of the last bag ... I am a bit suspicious that could have been a response to the Roquefort I bought, bc I am allergic to penicillin, but I've never had a dyspeptic reaction to blue cheese... but there's always a first time, and I ate some more earlier as a test, did start getting the early stomach warning signs like I had the first time, but ate a handful of charcoal tablets before it could develop into anything significant... which kind of rendered the test a bit useless, but I really didn't want to go through that stomach hell again... added some pussy points to my man card, I guess.MmmYeah. I'm in sickness perdition - the liminal demimonde of nervous anticipation. Which means I'm rambling... ***So.*** tldr; dope might have tranq in it, how do I face potential withdrawal?. Wow. I don’t remember another series or movie (or game?) that managed to make me switch from liking a character, to hating that character… and from hating a character, to loving that character, just in the space or one or two episodes… although technically in the space of a couple of instances. And both of those feelings switchings having (mostly) nothing to do with one another. I glanced another thread on here (iirc) that said this show is already 10x better this season… I mean I enjoyed the first season and we’re only three in so I’m hesitant to make a claim that sizeable but I’m definitely feeling that statement. Some genius moments and I’m so mad I have to wait a week for more.God damn it. Goddammit. Fuckity fuck fuck fuck. Heroin is a frickin thief. A wicked heartless purloiner of joy.She stole my hit. With philosophy, I guess. I cracked on with .313 … no gentle beginners dope dalliance, surely, but we’d been knocking out 0.350 the past few days…. No boast, just as reference to point out this isn’t a dose that’d hang me up by the heels and play Magick Roundabout on my cojones.But I did have some revelation… some BS conspiracy feminist epiphany about the murder of THE Woman as a franchise - a corporation — an existential creation - being some ongoing gendercide since the beginning of time (nothing to do with the trans debate i stg or politics, pls) and thought I’d discovered the meaning of life or something like it, butI discovered equanimity and this was incredibly annoying bc i realised I’d been betrayed and my hit had been robbed by this garbage heroin babble, like ffs I don’t want a revelation, I want to dissolve. And be at peace.So there may perhaps be sommat cut in this, i guess.I was doing some research around potential opiate tolerance reduction, and alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonists were named in medical papers, specifying clonidine. Searches on the sub however show discussions mentioning it mostly in relation to withdrawal. What are your guys experience with clonidine and heroin? Have you had any luck using it to reduce tolerance? Or are there any other substances or methods that worked better for you? T-breaks assumed.Not a new user by any means, just a matter of curiosity since I can't find a clear answer on google and these aren't used in the UK... why is dope called boy and coke called girl? It seems counter intuitive to me since heroin is a feminine term and although Charlie is a gender neutral name, it's more commonly used as a boy's name, at least over here. As an aside, afaik cat and dog aren't used (not in the UK anyway) but I always thought they'd make good slang terms for coke and dope, respectively.How in the heck does this sub not have more members? Heilung sound like my soul trying to break out of my body. I figured they would have a much larger community since they seem well listened to. I've been struggling connecting with my spirituality for a long time now but whenever I listen to these guys I can feel the universe shift beneath my skin. Like the Earth reaches up and grabs hold of something in me. Like it used to. Is this just me?. Idk if ‘Westernizing’ is the correct word as it’s more Jake's experience of Earthen culture relative to Na'vi, but for lack of a more appropriate term: there were a couple of moments during A:WoW that stood out to me as out of place, enough that it broke my immersion and affected my suspension of disbelief in a jarring way, so instead of engaging with the story I was in my head for several minutes debating the issue internally.The biggest one I think for me was Lo’ak flipping off Quaritch. Like it was a hilarious moment that really showcased his personality, but are you telling me Jake taught his kids how to swear? If you look at tribal attitudes towards taboo words here on Earth, rather than being casual vernacular like it is in the West, they're taken very seriously and you can become penalized or even outcast for breaking taboo and using curse words. So I find it hard to believe a conversation would come up at any point with his young children asking about alternatives to Na'vi swearing, since they would in all likelihood be considered cursing in the literal sense of the word. And if it ever did come up in conversation in a way Jake might decide to teach them about human culture, wouldn't it be when they were older than they are now? Sure, they're adolescents, but I'm trying to resolve the Na'vi culture with Jakes' cultural psychology having been raised on Earth...Idk. It's possible they were out hunting and Jake got put on his ass by some creature and flipped it off in a frustrated moment, and the boys were like ??? so he had to explain. Maybe he gave some awkward explanation and they started copying it at home so he had to sit them down bc Neytiri was like *what is this...?* I don't know man. Yeah, I'm overthinking, but that's the point; I shouldn't need to be so perplexed by a behaviour here.Another incident that stood out was when they arrived at Awa'atlu. I found the whole interaction between both mates just very off in terms of a tribal people interacting with one another; it didn't feel natural with Jake speaking for Neytiri... I figure it was meant to be awkward with Jake not knowing greeting etiquette, but the spat with Ronal and her and Neytiri hissing at each other emoliated by Jake explaining that 'his wife' is exhausted was like the writers were trying to insert some Western comedic value in a moment that didn't require it.I loved A:WoW but in terms of the writer's decisions, these moments in character behaviour bugged me. In general I found the writing brilliant so none of this is a criticism per se; I guess I'm just nervous about successive films moving further in this direction.Does this resonate with anyone else/were there any moments that stood out for you in this way?. Anish Kapoor is for sure.I continue discovering [Vantablack](https://imgur.com/a/24IC2Ap) in my bedroom.Will Kapoor sue for royalties?. I've done some research into the Na'vi and general Pandora fauna breathing systems, so I'm aware they have a complex gaseous exchange in their respiratory systems and switch between processing methane and oxygen, to water and carbon dioxide through their wichow organs, but my question is more about the functional breathing reflex underwater.With humans, when we're holding our breath (generally, but assume underwater here), we reach breakpoint, which forces us to take a breath whether we want to or not. At multiple points during A:WoW we see Na'vi running out of breath, but instead of inhaling they twitch and lose consciousness, even to the point Col. Quaritch lays out of breath for potentially minutes without trying to take a breath.Do Na'vi just not have this reflex, or is their survival instinct at polar opposite to human breakpoint? Or is it perhaps similar to the diving reflex, which essentially paralyses the diaphragm? I don't have any education in any of this, it just stood out to me as clearly different to the way humans react when running out of breath underwater. And given how exceptionally the biology of Pandora's flora and fauna has been paid detailed attention, I can't imagine this is something that was just handwaved.Edit: I think mods removed the nsfw tag (thanks lol) but I can't edit the title in case that confuses anyone xD. Very late to the show, so I have no idea if this is a theory that’s already been floated, but I watched No Way Home the other night and I’ve been thinking about this ever since. When Dr Strange first suggests the Runes of Kof-Kol, he doesn’t appear to be in the slight bit concerned that he would completely forget Peter, which is in total contrast to Peter’s later suggestion towards the end, when Strange gets emotional and basically tells Peter he considers him a loved friend.Aside from the obvious writers leaning on emotions to evoke a reaction, this just doesn’t sit right with me. Strange was almost flippant when first suggesting and moving into cast the spell, and later when comforting Peter - I believe before casting it the second time - Strange tells Parker quite emphatically that the situation was not his fault.So this leads me to believe Strange already added himself to the collection of people Peter wanted exempted from forgetting, and this already made the spell unstable. Perhaps there are a limited selection of people one can exempt from the spell and since he had already taken one of those slots; it would explain why he got stressed so quickly as Peter’s list grew. Strange should have anticipated Peter would want to keep some people in his life who still remembered him, therefore ultimately the spell breaking was on Strange’s shoulders. But Steven being Steven, he’s never going to outright admit that. So we’re left with a teary-eyed farewell and an implied ‘I love you’ which is weird in itself coming from the guy.Thoughts?&#x200B;. Hey universe ol buddy ol pal… maybe do me something nice for once? This apocalypse and gloom shit is getting kinda heavy. I don’t mean the nightmares. I can navigate those… least I could when you let me swing or fall or slither out of my body. Slide off into outer inner space. Let’s get back into that, baby. Let me bounce off into one of those eye-rolling astral storms. Headwind spewing off solar flares. Some supermassive biomechanical mass of circuit boards and city streets and streaks of neon understanding, a thousand lightyears thick. But my skin is crawlin melting thin in this direction and this time it ain’t radioactivity bc the clicking in my head is not Geiger it is not Morse code and I wish it was Morse code but i think it’s just bugs. Like the way those wasps last summer sounded like scraping and tapping in the walls and I couldn’t tell if it was rats or ghosts and which was worse. Wasps were a lot worse. But I got over it.Was walking my dog home through town just now and there was this middle aged fella leaned over holding the lead of a dog, surrounded by poop. A few other folk were walking past and got into a brief chat, which ultimately turned into this guy saying, ‘I don’t have a bag…’I was about to offer one of mine but one of the lasses pulled one out saying, ‘here I’ve got one,’ held it towards him. And the dude goes, ‘Can you do it?’ Cue everyone staring at him. He goes, ‘Well it’s not mine.’Bro. Are you for real? You hold the leash, you’re responsible for the shit.Mostly I think this is pretty hilarious, but I do end up exasperated when I'm trying to type or text to someone, and I've twaddled off in the ol' brainstem somewhere nonsensical and unrelated. Probably my eyes have gone shut and I've smashed out a few lines of garbled alien textipoop, and it takes like an hour to finish.But oh man, nodding is so weird. Like just now, trying to think about how to describe the wandering madness, I ramble off into the Antarctic to explain to some explorers how to use a breathing apparatus constructed from small plastic pop bottles, then open my eyes when I actually start to say something in response out loud. Which then gives me a right little giggle. (Brain starts telling me about how giggles please the sun god, but this is not the right moment, padawan...? 😂)I say 'just now'; I've been swaying between a variety of spontaneously generative side paths since starting this post. I don't really know what the original point of it is was, but that kind of seems appropriate.... ...Now one about a dude with a chonky cat who keeps disappearing into portals under his kid's beds... or how I keep thinking there are things in front of me that I start trying to use, but they're not and I don't realise because I don't know I have my eyes closed, until I open them and have a reet chuckle.Actually. I do wonder where nodding ends and mental health begins, lol, because I think to any outside observer this behaviour probably just looks like someone experiencing psychosis. Which is also funny af, bc I have psychotic episodes and they are mostly nothing like this, but also they could have more to do with my MH than I realise... Like why am I reaching desperately for the bedroom closet door to shut it... I'm in the living room. Had my eyes closed cause I'd slid into a nod and it made me laugh. But okay bro?Does anyone else experience nodding like this, or is it more likely to be borked brain weirdness?. Sad. Disappointed. Mad. Guy who has been providing first class gear for as long as I’ve been buying (through a mate, so that’s always a risk I know, but he orders off of bunyuns for me since I can’t get crypto, blah de blah) - Had about a month off for a t-break and ordered a 3.5 of Afghan #3. Always beautiful clean punchy stuff with amazing rush. I knew there was something up when it smelled of nowt… hit 0.077 cause that’s what the scoop dosed me and I got sorta noddy but no rush, no tang at the back of the throat that I love. Then I was dozy for hours, no euphoria. Tried 0.150, same again. Probably it was dumb of me to hit a two pointer but I must have fallen out before I finished the plunge bc I came round an hour? Later with dose still in the rig but dark with blood… Went and tested it… maybe I should’ve beforehand bc I feel kinda lucky it didn’t take me out. No fent but bright solid line for benzos. I’m not surprised, given the current discussions around a heroin drought in the UK and the Taliban destroying poppy crops, however accurate they may be. But I was hoping it’d be a little while longer before this affected me. I was actually planning on this being my last hurrah before stepping off, knowing it could be coming and wanting to avoid it, but not being ready to say sayonara yet. Plus I’ve just lost that money. Ffs I’m kinda heartbroken.A couple of weeks back my mate asked me not to order gear for her since she tends to only buy it when she's being impulsive and usually drunk... we both get it from the same guy and she does have his contact details but where she lives is an internet black spot so she sometimes has issues with getting on the app he uses. I've ordered for her before bc of this, which I have no issue with, but obviously I don't want to buy it for her if she feels like she shouldn't be getting it, and/or she's not thinking clearly bc she's drunk. Now she's just hit me up asking me to order for her... she's sober, as far as I can tell, but I said no since she'd asked me previously not to. But I'm feeling like idk if it's fair of me to double down on it if she's changed her mind and she isn't drunk. It's her prerogative to use gear if she wants to, right? It's not like she's made me responsible for it, so I feel like I'm being controlling by saying no. What's the right move here?.
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin\_Bolger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bolger)This man fits right in with the motto, and the ethos of this subreddit. When he was two years old, his family was in a serious accident, and later in his life he decided to use that experience as fuel to make the most of his life. Benjamin has dyslexia, and first graduated with an associates degree, eventually going to the University of Michigan, and going to Yale Law school where he decided to quit because of his dyslexia. But, in true Goggins fashion, he fought his weakness, got more training for his dyslexia, and went on to get several more degrees from Oxford, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. His mother travels with him, and even read his assignments out loud. This story is honestly one of the most inspiring stories I have read, and I think if David knew about him, he too would be impressed. The mentality does not only apply to physical tasks, it applies to overcome genetic challenges in every endeavor. This man used discipline to overcome his inner weakness. Stay Hard!. It's no secret that those with ASPD have troubled lives as a result of their behavior patterns. Dissociality, Aggression, Lying, Cheating, Manipulating, Exploitation, all lead to burning bridges and lead to a reduced quality of life, especially when factoring in legal/social consequences. I understand the legal side of this, and I was wondering about the social consequences aspect. Are there any statistics that relate ostracization(in a school or work environment) to ASPD?Also, I'd love to hear from members of this community about their experiences with this. As a consequence of your behavior, have you been ostracized from a tribe?Thanks!.
    Hmu. Idc how bad you are.Fuck cancer and fuck 2023.I have 6000 auric cells and wanna buy some outfits for killers and maybe just one for a survivor. Chuck some recommendations out!. Some cunt poured faeces on his head live n there is a guy in a maid costume holding him in a headlock rn. Tryna get started out but I gotta get my head around producing so if anyone here does it too hmu or just comment.So I’m 18 and I’ve always liked music so I’m tryna make a hobby out of it but I’d like to just make music I can share.Is ableton a good way to start producing cuz I have it? and any other tips would be appreciated.Ik how to sing so that part shouldn’t be difficult to get around.I only been here for two weeks 😭. I was in highschool when news broke he died and I remember everyone being so shocked. I never liked rap as I was misguided into thinking it was all about drugs, sex and gangs so I honestly didn’t take much notice. From listening to Juice lately, I realise it’s so much more than that and Juice had a one of a kind talent in bringing serious topics into music. I’m honestly in awe at how talented he was and not one song of his that I’ve listened to is bad. This guy was lyrically a genius and the music was incredible too. I can say without a doubt his music will live on for years and I haven’t heard a rapper as talented as him to date. Such a shame he died so young because he was a gem of a person. Rip juice. But like I’ve been listening to Juice Wrld (rip) and Post Malone lately and it got me wondering what the fuck I was thinking. These artists are fucking great.I’m 18, currently on my first year at uni doing criminology. After I’m done I plan on applying for SAPOL. Almost tempted to apply now due to hearing about all the shortages, however, I still think they’d prefer the life experience. I have ADHD if that changes anything, but from what I’ve heard it can be good for this careerWas wondering if anyone here could give me some insight on the recruitment/selection process. Been keen on joining since I was 10 but I’ve heard that it can be quite a handful.Having asked my teacher who used to be a sergeant at SAPOL, he told me it’s a good idea to go to uni first (which I’m doing).Any tips/info anyone could give me that may prove useful in 2 years time? I’ve been working since I was 15 if that would help at all. Pretty much can’t envision me doing anything else in life so I’d be willing to move state if I don’t get in here.Even AFP could be a possibility or ASIS. Cheers. Applied for a visa to the US and within an hour it was approved.Y’all must be speed running these or something.He had all the traits of a sociopathic serial killer, however, they caught him pretty early before he could kill more.Do you believe if he wasn’t so messy with the evidence he left that he would’ve killed more?. Had a job interview today, was really chill.An hour later they call me to offer me the job.Ez. I got an interview at an arcade and they want me to wear a costume to it 💀. Was browsing Reddit when I saw this post of the last image of this influencer and his dog that travelled across the USA together. Last year they both died in a car crash.Now I’m looking at his TikTok’s n shit and as a dog owner I’m sad as fuck.I had my first log book lesson yesterday, and I already have like 60 hours, however, I had to re-learn some stuff as they want you to do things in a very specific order. Just a bit paranoid about getting scammed. He marked 6 tasks off for me yesterday in an hour 30 min lesson which seems okay to me seeming that I could get it done in around 6 lessons at that rate. Does it seem scammy or fine? I’ve heard some people getting scammed by this as their instructors mark em off slowly to get more money. Cheers.It’s a liquor store n they want me to do the interview online but nice. Spent 1.9k on a ticket to the US and I’ve got 209 dollars to my name now 😭. Planning to arrive in LA from Australia, from there go to Las Vegas, rent a car and drive to Albuquerque. Fly out of Albuquerque to Colorado and then fly to New Jersey or Pennsylvania and do some of the east coast such as PA, NY, NJ, flying out back to San Francisco then back to Australia. All this in around 3 weeks. Would this be appropriate or is there anything we should change in regards to the trip? Flights are about 1.8k each return included. 2 adults. We’re prob gonna stay in LA for 2 nights, get one of the travel coaches to NV, spend a few nights in New Mexico or Arizona which is relatively cheap, stay in Colorado in a hotel there for 3-5 days. Then staying in NJ and maybe some other states on the east coast.Might have transport sorted out in Colorado cuz we know someone there.10k AUD btwEdit: skipping NJ, Vegas and most likely PA tooEdit 2: we will probably go in January now as we can’t board our pets in DecemberEdit 3: I am genuinely overwhelmed and extremely appreciative of all the amazing advice I’ve received. You’ve all surely opened my mind to how big the US and where we should spend our time. We will prob get tickets tomorrow and focus on doing the west, driving within California to the national parks, AZ (Grand Canyon), NM (Santa Fe) to Colorado (Denver, Rocky Mountains, then to NYC for a few days then home). Possibly Utah included with its amazing parks. Driving will be done predominantly in the west and we’ll use public transport in NYC.Any advice would be helpful. I’m from Australia.Didn’t even know he died till now 🛎️. Alright boys so one night when i was having sex with this fwb that both my bro and I know about, she let out that "it would be so much fun to have a threesome with you and your brother" because she told me she has a fantasy of being double teamed by two identical twins, and because she knows i have a big dick, so would he. I mentioned this to him for the first time yesterday, in a joking way, but he kinda seemed keen on the idea. Me and my bro are extremely close and have always been open about talking about sex, girls we’ve been with, seeing each other naked morning wood, all the guys stuff etc. and have shared a room for 18+ years, but never actually fucked the same girl at the same time before.Do you reckon this is weird or should we have fun and just go for it ?. Just saw a cop acting absolutely gorgeous to a lady he pulled over to then plant meth in her car in order to ruin her life and arrest her. Another one abused the fuck out of this schizophrenic guy while other cops just stood there. Gotta make u wonder.Especially Morgan Jones and Rick Grimes and Corl and Negan. All i wanted to do was educate you but you called me a dumbass and blocked me 😢 I’m beyond disappointed and hurt right now. Another day another Reddit argument won 😎 on the grind Fr 🥶 💯. Planning to go there in December and looking at towns, not one (except maybe Atlanta) doesn’t look beautiful.I’m in Australia so it would be odd for it to be a gun but I heard a car screeching away so who knows.I can’t see shit. If you have one. Flying 19 hours this December to LA so I needa know.Apparently my 4th cousin was pretty famous in 1940s Hollywood. Interested to know if anyone else here has any too?. She just sent a lude voice message and now she’s fallen asleep 💀.
    I brought 3 electric guitars this month just because I can. Anyone here with an impulsive and stupid to telll us? Don't tell criminal activity (I assume that most of us have stole something this month or something like that). The most random post wins. I know that the common answer for us to burnout would be something like "just quit the job" or "do something stupid to get fired", and I agree with that to some extend, but I also know that some of us struggles with being constant at work. People here dealing with burnout, what is your (good) advice? Personally, I try to be a nice with my colleagues and students (I'ma teacher), so they don't care when I dont do things on time. It have been a better option than lie constantly. ¿What do you think of people with other conditions? ¿Do you hate a diagnosis in particular? I don't usually care about it but I was tired of people with a high probability of having OCD asking here 'Am I a socio/psychopath' 112341313 times a day because of the spam. Today my psychiatrist prescribed me risperidone and valproate. Is anyone here taking these pills? good or bad experiences?. Has any of you left and then returned to therapy (with or without the same professional)? I was thinking about getting back to therapy because I'm having a bad time controlling my impulsiveness. I started to working in a place where everyone leave their shit unattended and I haven't stolen anything yet but I want to and I don't know how much time I'll last until I'll ended up stealing something.P.s. please, don't tell me shit like be careful and you won't get caught or just don't do it.My mother tongue is spanish and I speak english and japanese too. I have problems of dyslexia in both spanish and english, but not reading in japanese. Anyone can relate or have an idea of why this happens? I also learnt ancient Greek in the university (similar but not identical alphabet) but I have troubles with that too. I hate people asking how to manipulate others and that kind of shit like we have a sociopath manual with the secrets of how to do bad things. I dont have a 'strategy' to be an asshole, I am an asshole without even wanting to be one. In some situacions I can plan how to x or y but is more an instinct than a fucking mystical ability that only people with a serious mental illness have. I cannot function without drinking coffee or energy drinks because I feel unmotivated, tired, and without enough concentration or interest in things. I'm on my second Redbull after a few couples of americano. Does anyone relate to this?. I know ASPD is not being 'asocial', but my old therapist once told me that people like us preffer to be alone. What do you think? In my case, being alone is the best for me and my symptons because I don't care about people and my problems begins with my social interactions face to face. Is the same in your case? Are we better alone or not?. What do you think of your comorbidities? I have both ASPD and NPD, but I feel more comfortable with the ASPD diagnose rather than NPD because I don't have the "normal" problems of people with NPD like having self esteem problems or having a necessity of being admirated.can the admins adds a new rule about it? People believe that we can tell them if they have a serious mental illness but here is not the place for it....[not native speaker] I know this is going to sound edgy, but I guess is a real problem for some of us. When I get too bored I begin to think about doing bad stuff like killing someone, etc, because I feel that's the only kind of shit that will makes me feel satisfied in this life, but then I remember that I don't want to go to jail or die. How do you deal with that? My psychiatrist told me that I need to take pills to be less impulsive, but I don't think I should take pills because I'll end up taking the whole pill bottle and dying in a stupid way (more stupid than being shot by the police). In my case, it seems that the few people who knows about my diagnose doesn't believe that I have ASPD + NPD, despite that I have been an asshole with them. Any of you have experienced the same?. It is necessary a Rorschach test to diagnose ASPD? my therapist told me that I have to do one before get diagnosed. Any thoughts? edit after reading your answers: this was after an evaluation by a psychologist and a psychiatrist. Both told me that I have ASPD traits. My psychologist is the one asking for the Rorscharch.
    His character has become vey boring, where’s the toxic, alcoholic and funny Rick that we all love. If I’d wanted to watch a passive aggressive boring comedy, i would watch family guy. Why exactly is Rick apologizing to everyone and trying to be inclusive and respect other’s beliefs etc. I seriously hope this is for a deeper story because this is shit right now.They should make a spin-off series with stories about Rick and Morty, as well as the rest of the cast. Where different things happen that are completely unrelated to the main plot, but is still canon and happening in other dimensions.Maybe this post will come off as cringe, but I had to post this because I gotta know if this is a shared experience or if it’s just me.As the title says, everyday I hope someone walks up on me and gives me a good reason to beat them up. I’ve been in fights, they’re always satisfying when you win, especially afterwards. The thrill and excitement, and the power that comes with dominating someone with extreme violence is so satisfying. I’ve yet to share this with any therapist or psychologist I’ve met, for the same reason I’m anonymously typing this. Violent fantasies are never not gonna be cringe to share. But at least I may find some people who relate here. Do you relate?. I have no problem whatsoever with being touched, and I have no problem greeting someone with a hug, since i view that as a greeting rather than affection. However, as soon as someone touches me in an affectionate way, even in the most normal and platonic way, I get uncomfortable. I usually don’t say anything, I barely tolerate it. I just try to leave and end the conversation as normally as possible and walk away. I don’t like showing affection, nor receiving it. Neither physically nor verbally. I don’t like hearing the words “I love you” I find it uncomfortable as well.I saw a research paper the other day, were they conducted a study on “Women's reproductive success and the preference for Dark Triad in men's faces” and the study found that women are more likely to choose men who exhibit narcissistic or dark triad traits rather than not.Results from the study: “We found that the number of offspring born to women given for their age was associated with women's preference for narcissistic and Machiavellian male faces, but not with preference for psychopathic male faces (Table 3).

Previous studies have found that out of the three Dark triad features, narcissism was associated with physical and psychological health benefits in men as well as social success.”It’s clear to me at least that some traits of narcissism like assertiveness and confidence may offer certain benefits in some areas of life. Don’t get me wrong, this is basically the only positive thing about narcissism, the rest is negative, a debilitating illness for the disordered, and for the people around the disordered.

I don’t think this is one of those “anxiety attacks” people always talk about, they seem to be much more severe, but I do get “attacks” or sudden feelings of severe anxiety that lasts just a few seconds.I could be doing anything, go on a walk, cleaning, working, sitting at my phone etc. and I just start thinking of a memory, where I’ve said or done something extremely embarrassing or shameful, and I just get a sudden and severe feeling of anxiety, embarrassment, anger, frustration and sadness. I literally have to stop whatever I’m doing and try my hardest not to punch or break whatever is closest to me. It’s like first feeling normal, then suddenly wanting to violently bash your skull into a wall until you die, and then go back to feeling normal again. I don’t voluntarily remember things like that, my mind just decides that I should be reminded about all the embarrassing things I’ve done.And mostly they’re not even that bad memories, it could be something simple as saying something slightly weird or inappropriate and getting a slightly bad reaction from someone.Anyways, I don’t think this is connected to NPD, but I don’t know where else to post it since I have NPD.Most people here seem to be on the mild/moderate spectrum of NPD and are still capable of some self awareness and doesn’t have a distorted perception of reality. are there are any people here who suffer from Severe NPD, and how does it differ from other with moderate levels of NPD.Many narcissistic people expect others to be just like them when it comes to behavior and thoughts. Im one of them.I don’t have emotional empathy, but depending on how much I can relate to someone, I will alternate between being annoyed to being understanding. This causes me to sometimes be seen as shockingly cold, and sometimes as extremely understanding. I may look like I have more empathy than neurotypical people if I can relate to somebody. But extremely cold and callous towards those I cannot relate to. And this isn’t just limited to empathy, I may get mad at a persons personality traits if they differ too much from mine. I may get annoyed at a person for being too sensitive, accepting, too much sense of justice or responsibility. I’ve always been lazy, therefore nothing annoys me more than the “don’t stop working until you’re finished” attitude.I’ll believe everyone thinks I’m smart, beautiful, funny and charming. But if someone so much as smiles at me, I’ll assume they’re mocking my entire existence. Or even staring at me for one second. My whole ego will crash and my day will be ruined if someone shows even the slightest sign of negative affect when talking to me.I mean what are you not aware of? You know what you are doing because you are conscious about your behavior. I mean maybe you don’t just connect your behavior with being narcissistic due to the lack of knowledge about narcissism at the time. Please fill me in on this, because I genuinely don’t get it.As the title reads, narcissistic collapses is something we all here struggle with from time to time. Some are minor, some major. Alas, the major collapses can have long term effects and I’m going to talk about them and how to avoid them.When you have a collapse you are most likely experiencing extreme low self worth and anxiety. And it’s easy to just close off yourself to the world, and become asocial. However, this would be a grave mistake. Socially isolating yourself because you are scared of being judged and exposed for your imperfections, is a straight road to developing Social anxiety and depression. Both of which you want to avoid, as they will most definitely have a lifelong effect upon your mental health and personality.And no one likes a socially anxious and awkward person, so developing these traits will only make you experience even more collapses. Soon, you won’t have any grandiosity or self worth left, and what’s left for you, is a life of pure misery without any sweet delusion or confidence. Avoid this at all cost! What you should do once you have a collapse, is to go to therapy instantly. Visit friends and family, try to build up your confidence and get back on your feet. Never isolate yourself from people.Not trying to make anyone feel like changing is a bad thing, it absolutely is not. But I just want to know what your motivation behind wanting to be treated for NPD is. Is it that you want to fit in and have meaningful relationships with other people, or is it something else?I’m diagnosed with NPD, but I’ve always known that I was narcissistic and antisocial. And I’m constantly shifting between being completely indifferent to the chaos and grief i cause, and justifying it to myself when needed. I don’t have much empathy, I don’t seek out healthy relationships with other people.I’ve never seen the appeal of settling down with one person and marrying them for the rest of your life.I need chaos and dis-order in my life for it to be fun and enjoyable. Otherwise, I’ll get bored. And for me there’s no reason to seek out treatment. Collapses can never be escaped, but they’re not that bad for me. They’re small and only last a few days max. I suppose I’m a mild case.Some people with ASPD may drive reckless as apart of the “impulsivity” and “disregard for oneself and others” and this may include: speeding, aggressive driving, risk taking, etc. Do you drive recklessly, what do you personally think causes you to drive this way? Personally, I may drive recklessly if I’m bored or if I get offended by other drivers.I’m not a very manipulative person, I just manipulate people almost subconsciously sometimes. But I’ve noticed that when I’m saying something to a person, either criticizing them, say something passive aggressive or is saying something that would be considered politically incorrect, and it doesn’t land well with the other person, I just lie and say I was joking. Sometimes I even start believing myself that I was joking. I think I picked up that trait from my dad, which used to complain about things or say something mean, and then minutes later would say “it’s just a joke, why are you so mad, can’t you take a joke?”While I do appreciate the effectiveness of this strategy, it can be extremely frustrating if you are on the receiving end of this. And it gives the person plausible deniability to anything they said, while you simultaneously get affected by the things that were said.People always talk about lack of empathy as a root cause of evil, and empaths as the virtuous heroes of goodness. Disregarding the obvious lack of choice of carrying any of these traits, negating the moral responsibility people empaths and people with a lack of empathy have, both traits can have detrimental impacts on your ability to properly function in daily situations.People with extremely high levels of empathy struggle to work in certain professions, such as law enforcement, surgeons, lawyers and other jobs requiring a “thick skin” where you have to put aside your emotions to make rational judgments. While most people with a lack of empathy are often credited for being able to make decisions only including logic and reasoning, the opposite can be said for empaths who often let their emotions and empathy dictate their decisions. While both a lack of empathy and hyper empathy can have its benefits, it undoubtedly does have its significant negative consequences.And the main purpose of writing this, is that you should not feel bad for having a lack of empathy, and being hyper empathic should never be a goal. Same can be said for empaths, who shouldn’t try to take a moral high ground over others. The optimal goal should be to balance empathy, in a way that is healthy for oneself and others around you. With that being said, I fucking hate empaths. They’re so annoying and crybabies.Trying to mask NPD with social anxiety is really hard, and off putting to people. I come across as awkward and disingenuous to people. I have to smile and say it’s nice to meet people will being awkward, but it’s not really nice to meet them and I couldn’t care less. I’m tired of always trying to come off as happy, kind, confident, etc. I’m none of those things. And I’m getting more mad, soon I think I’ll stop masking completely.everyone already dislikes me now, so unmasking isn’t making it worse. I’ll just stop smiling when I’m not happy, which means never smiling in public. I’ll stop fake laughing at people’s dumb jokes, because they’re not funny. Not many are gonna relate here, because not everyone has vulnerable narcissism here, and not social anxiety either, but I felt that this wouldn’t fit in another sub either.
    Am still struggling through the diagnostic process. Was told that I have borderline, schizotypal, antisocial "traits" and would be put on a therapy waiting list, but that the results/report from testing were intended for clinicians and not for me, so I don't have a real copy. Did not feel great about the clinician or process. For most of my younger years, had "adjustment disorder" "problems related to lifestyle" anxiety/depression, etc. throughout medical chart. I am aware that the need for a label is likely unhelpful to me and needing a "catch all" to help explain my whole self/absolve me of accountability is not helpful either. Not sure that I'm even really looking for "help" but at least for a real human to listen to me and maybe understand. Spiraling intensely and not coping well.Did you always know that you behaved/processed/connected/thought/felt different than other people? How early can you trace back your antisocial behavior? Do you have any early emotional memories (shame, anger, other) or thought memories? Also posted in r/ASPD for discussion.Did you always know that you behaved/processed/connected/thought/felt different than other people? How early can you trace back your antisocial behavior? Do you have any early emotional memories (shame, anger, other) or thought memories? Also posted in r/NPD for discussion.How to accurately reflect the scope of the problem when your whole life is lying/mirroring? I believe "you're only as sick as your secrets" and "be sure your sins will find you out." I'm poisoned on the inside and poison everything around me. I'm not a real person. I've used being female to make it easier to hide behind being a "victim." I'M NOT. My whole way of existing is based on manipulation, seduction... taking things I've learned from watching people and mimicking how they act/what they think or say. My entire life is getting my short-term needs met. No matter the cost to others. I go in for psych testing (again... I went years ago) next week. I've told so many lies - my manipulation/lying/anger/sadistic and abusive behavior started when I was very young. I believe that my family has always known but refuses to acknowledge it. I've tried to ask them, and I've told my Mom for years that something is really wrong with me. I "reinvent" myself every few months or years... sometimes from day to day ("delete" people/leave entire periods of my life out as if they never existed/pick up new habits and decide that it'll all be better now) and "start over"/do it all again and try to leave no tracks - I have no ability to maintain my facade for very long because none of it is true. I've gone to therapists before and tried 12 step groups... But the web is so tangled, I never tell them enough or in the right way or get frustrated or feel like people don't understand or maybe just don't want to be really found out and give up. Therapists want to focus on trauma or current emotional distress... But the problem isn't current emotional distress. My "anxiety" comes from the lies I tell and the bad things I do (or the difference between the reality I'm trying to create and the actual truth) and the "depression" comes from losing things I never earned in the first place, fear of being found out, or intense nihilism and anger. The anger comes from being exhausted from hiding all the time or from anger at the rest of the world for being the good that I am not. And I get angry when people try to help me or when I feel like they aren't getting it. My last therapist finally said that she couldn't help me if narcissism or sociopathy was really my problem. And I've been unsuccessful in finding a therapist that says they will work with these issues. I started seeing a therapist two weeks ago and am trying to open up to her. I tried reaching out to Elinor Greenberg and George Simon online. I'm trying to write out my life chronologically so that when I see the psychologist, I can honestly show him the problems. Because inevitably, I leave things out or end up playing the victim when I try to explain my history to new therapists, too. I've been spiraling worse and worse for the last few weeks. This happens like once a year because I just do the same things over and over. I never commit to anything because I feel like I can't, find lots of little magic solutions (new person, building a new self, new activity, etc.) that I'm sure will somehow erase my past and completely restructure my insides and fix me or make me capable of love, and nothing ever changes. I just know it's only a matter of time before all of this happens again... but with more compounded years of pain, more hurt people. The nihilism is real. Work is starting to catch on - I gave up my leadership role because I have nothing to give and honestly am not a person that should be given positions of power anyways. I'm not real or safe - or cannot maintain enough stability for sustained periods to make it right that I be in charge of anything. And I have a tendency towards bullying and abusive behavior and should not be in authority. But now they want to meet with me. I haven't earned it and have done too many bad things, even if they are secrets, to be a role model to anyone. And it's important that I stop hiding from those things. I know that it doesn't happen overnight, but I've never actually made any sustained improvement and I'm exhausted. Has therapy helped any of you? Has anything?. How can you tell what’s happening? How do you tell the difference and what do you do to handle it?.
    Do any of you have friends (or some form of relationship) with others who have aspd?Would you rather have some kind of friendship or companionship with a "normal" person or someone with aspd? And why or why not for whatever your anwser is.Im not sure I could have or maintain a friendship with someone who was like me. (Also, when do I use the question flair vs the discussion flair?).
    I brought 3 electric guitars this month just because I can. Anyone here with an impulsive and stupid to telll us? Don't tell criminal activity (I assume that most of us have stole something this month or something like that). The most random post wins. I know that the common answer for us to burnout would be something like "just quit the job" or "do something stupid to get fired", and I agree with that to some extend, but I also know that some of us struggles with being constant at work. People here dealing with burnout, what is your (good) advice? Personally, I try to be a nice with my colleagues and students (I'ma teacher), so they don't care when I dont do things on time. It have been a better option than lie constantly. ¿What do you think of people with other conditions? ¿Do you hate a diagnosis in particular? I don't usually care about it but I was tired of people with a high probability of having OCD asking here 'Am I a socio/psychopath' 112341313 times a day because of the spam. Today my psychiatrist prescribed me risperidone and valproate. Is anyone here taking these pills? good or bad experiences?. Has any of you left and then returned to therapy (with or without the same professional)? I was thinking about getting back to therapy because I'm having a bad time controlling my impulsiveness. I started to working in a place where everyone leave their shit unattended and I haven't stolen anything yet but I want to and I don't know how much time I'll last until I'll ended up stealing something.P.s. please, don't tell me shit like be careful and you won't get caught or just don't do it.My mother tongue is spanish and I speak english and japanese too. I have problems of dyslexia in both spanish and english, but not reading in japanese. Anyone can relate or have an idea of why this happens? I also learnt ancient Greek in the university (similar but not identical alphabet) but I have troubles with that too. I hate people asking how to manipulate others and that kind of shit like we have a sociopath manual with the secrets of how to do bad things. I dont have a 'strategy' to be an asshole, I am an asshole without even wanting to be one. In some situacions I can plan how to x or y but is more an instinct than a fucking mystical ability that only people with a serious mental illness have. I cannot function without drinking coffee or energy drinks because I feel unmotivated, tired, and without enough concentration or interest in things. I'm on my second Redbull after a few couples of americano. Does anyone relate to this?. I know ASPD is not being 'asocial', but my old therapist once told me that people like us preffer to be alone. What do you think? In my case, being alone is the best for me and my symptons because I don't care about people and my problems begins with my social interactions face to face. Is the same in your case? Are we better alone or not?. What do you think of your comorbidities? I have both ASPD and NPD, but I feel more comfortable with the ASPD diagnose rather than NPD because I don't have the "normal" problems of people with NPD like having self esteem problems or having a necessity of being admirated.can the admins adds a new rule about it? People believe that we can tell them if they have a serious mental illness but here is not the place for it....[not native speaker] I know this is going to sound edgy, but I guess is a real problem for some of us. When I get too bored I begin to think about doing bad stuff like killing someone, etc, because I feel that's the only kind of shit that will makes me feel satisfied in this life, but then I remember that I don't want to go to jail or die. How do you deal with that? My psychiatrist told me that I need to take pills to be less impulsive, but I don't think I should take pills because I'll end up taking the whole pill bottle and dying in a stupid way (more stupid than being shot by the police). In my case, it seems that the few people who knows about my diagnose doesn't believe that I have ASPD + NPD, despite that I have been an asshole with them. Any of you have experienced the same?. It is necessary a Rorschach test to diagnose ASPD? my therapist told me that I have to do one before get diagnosed. Any thoughts? edit after reading your answers: this was after an evaluation by a psychologist and a psychiatrist. Both told me that I have ASPD traits. My psychologist is the one asking for the Rorscharch.

    His character has become vey boring, where’s the toxic, alcoholic and funny Rick that we all love. If I’d wanted to watch a passive aggressive boring comedy, i would watch family guy. Why exactly is Rick apologizing to everyone and trying to be inclusive and respect other’s beliefs etc. I seriously hope this is for a deeper story because this is shit right now.They should make a spin-off series with stories about Rick and Morty, as well as the rest of the cast. Where different things happen that are completely unrelated to the main plot, but is still canon and happening in other dimensions.Maybe this post will come off as cringe, but I had to post this because I gotta know if this is a shared experience or if it’s just me.As the title says, everyday I hope someone walks up on me and gives me a good reason to beat them up. I’ve been in fights, they’re always satisfying when you win, especially afterwards. The thrill and excitement, and the power that comes with dominating someone with extreme violence is so satisfying. I’ve yet to share this with any therapist or psychologist I’ve met, for the same reason I’m anonymously typing this. Violent fantasies are never not gonna be cringe to share. But at least I may find some people who relate here. Do you relate?. I have no problem whatsoever with being touched, and I have no problem greeting someone with a hug, since i view that as a greeting rather than affection. However, as soon as someone touches me in an affectionate way, even in the most normal and platonic way, I get uncomfortable. I usually don’t say anything, I barely tolerate it. I just try to leave and end the conversation as normally as possible and walk away. I don’t like showing affection, nor receiving it. Neither physically nor verbally. I don’t like hearing the words “I love you” I find it uncomfortable as well.I saw a research paper the other day, were they conducted a study on “Women's reproductive success and the preference for Dark Triad in men's faces” and the study found that women are more likely to choose men who exhibit narcissistic or dark triad traits rather than not.Results from the study: “We found that the number of offspring born to women given for their age was associated with women's preference for narcissistic and Machiavellian male faces, but not with preference for psychopathic male faces (Table 3).

Disregarding the obvious lack of choice of carrying any of these traits, negating the moral responsibility people empaths and people with a lack of empathy have, both traits can have detrimental impacts on your ability to properly function in daily situations.People with extremely high levels of empathy struggle to work in certain professions, such as law enforcement, surgeons, lawyers and other jobs requiring a “thick skin” where you have to put aside your emotions to make rational judgments. While most people with a lack of empathy are often credited for being able to make decisions only including logic and reasoning, the opposite can be said for empaths who often let their emotions and empathy dictate their decisions. While both a lack of empathy and hyper empathy can have its benefits, it undoubtedly does have its significant negative consequences.And the main purpose of writing this, is that you should not feel bad for having a lack of empathy, and being hyper empathic should never be a goal. Same can be said for empaths, who shouldn’t try to take a moral high ground over others. The optimal goal should be to balance empathy, in a way that is healthy for oneself and others around you. With that being said, I fucking hate empaths. They’re so annoying and crybabies.Trying to mask NPD with social anxiety is really hard, and off putting to people. I come across as awkward and disingenuous to people. I have to smile and say it’s nice to meet people will being awkward, but it’s not really nice to meet them and I couldn’t care less. I’m tired of always trying to come off as happy, kind, confident, etc. I’m none of those things. And I’m getting more mad, soon I think I’ll stop masking completely.everyone already dislikes me now, so unmasking isn’t making it worse. I’ll just stop smiling when I’m not happy, which means never smiling in public. I’ll stop fake laughing at people’s dumb jokes, because they’re not funny. Not many are gonna relate here, because not everyone has vulnerable narcissism here, and not social anxiety either, but I felt that this wouldn’t fit in another sub either.
    As long as they've interacted with you on a regular basis for a short time or longer, I'd like to know.If you don't mind being as detailed as possible, what were some of the harder problems you've faced in the relationship and how did you solve them? Mainly your perspective.
    Hey. 23F here. Well. Can't say I am really shocked or anything. But what I am really intrigued by is that I was actually diagnosed over a month ago and my therapist didn't even mention it. Stumbled upon my records and there it was, "ANTI SOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER Status: Current , Active: Yes" just staring at me like "hey dumbass! YOU wanted therapy, remember?" Is it common for them to not mention it? Haven't picked up any "vibe" from my therapist, but hey, maybe that's a good thing. Anyways. I guess i'll be lurking here from time to time!EDIT: He's a psychologist. I've been seeing him for 6 months every week but it seems he diagnosed me last month and I wasn't informed.I wouldn't say this news was incredibly shocking, but the way in which I found out was really really weird. You'd think doctors would tell you this kind of stuff lol.I was looking on my psych/therapy portal website trying to pay a bill and stumbled upon the diagnoses. Honestly I hadn't really checked up on it. I have ADHD, depression, anxiety and was made aware when I was diagnosed with those years ago. But glaring at the bottom of them all was something new..."ANTI SOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER, Active: Yes." It's from last month, I guess my therapist labeled me as such. I don't really know how to feel about this. I guess my only response is uneasiness regarding my future. I'm in a long term relationship of 3 years. I can recognize my own flaws and I know the way I perceive things is probably pretty different..., but I know I love him. I immediately wanted to tell him but there's two ideas coming to mind: Can I really claim to love him and justify living with this secret? That's selfish. And the other one is Im not any different of a person than what he knows now, the stigma that comes with it is horrible as it is. Is hiding it really so bad if it just brings him pain? I don't know what is the rationalization and what is the kindness here. EDIT: Take my grandma, she's very religious. Would I tell her I'm an atheist? It serves no purpose. She would be burdened because in her mind, I'll be going to Hell, meanwhile I don't care if I have to just listen to the BS every once in awhile and attend the cult meetings. I suppose my 'grace' begins and ends with my family, but It's the dilemma I'm facing. Overall, I guess don't really feel upset so to speak about the diagnosis itself, I guess, but rather concerned regarding the repercussions because of it... So yeah. I just really needed to get this off my chest. Found out I'm a so called sociopath today. Life is great!.
    its getting colder, and i have an allergy to cold temperatures. i just recently took a dose of my T as per usual, realizing the temperature was too cold for me to inject and i ended up having an allergic reaction to it. are there things i can do to safely warm up my testosterone without having my heater going 24/7. on my last little chunk of fluid. for real im quitting cold turkey. someone be happy for me. my parents are not supportive and also abusive, im an adult and i live with them. I keep being told im making the wrong decision by being put on hormones, but ive been out since age 13. I cant help but to hear a voice in my head telling me that theyre right, i never had this before coming out. ive always known who i am but they have instilled such a strong fear in me and have absolutely destroyed my confidence throughout the years that I fear even if this is the right thing just being myself will make me forever feel unsafe and unsure.i thought it would be just my B.O., nah its my sweat, my pee, my shit man. everything smells different and worse. im perfectly healthy i just got a chronic case of boy smell. i know cause it smells exactly like my brother now. help me!. dont get me wrong, i am a man. but i just hate the way my transition functions. i feel like trans girls just get prettier and prettier while trans men just get uglier and stinkier. the acne, the awkward sounding voice, i want to be born as a man but if im trans at least let it make me look better! lol. ive always had this tenseness in my entire body, like im constantly clenching. sure, could be anxiety, but im not usually a "nervous" person (im pretty brave and bold) but im more so like im on alert all the time. not a cortisol problem either, trauma maybe. either way. only time i feel like myself is when im high. the only time im happy is when im high and that didnt begin when i started using. i just feel like its a more comfortable state than being in this painfully aware state im in all the time. living feels like hell, high feels like what normal should feel like.what is a dose for letrozole that would be good for estrogen blockage, more specifically period stopping?. i was thinking about starting aromatase inhibitors because i have high estrogen. whats your expirences and recommendations?. Sometimes im able to control myself to a point that shocks people, but other times im really controlled by my impulses.I know this is all just symptoms but god its so hard! I wish i was able to have that full control i have all the time about everything. Its like i can start anything but i can never stop myself. Trying to do “scary” things is easy but trying to not do things that i want to do is an impossible task even if its better for me not to do them…. Used for like a week straight 2g everyday. Obviously side effects were coming but at the last day I woke up out of this phenibender super dissociated and its almost like things looked very far away and I had an overwhelming sense of doom. I could tell I was still high but everything felt like hell, I was convinced this was the end and I was gonna seize to death. Anyone else got stories like these?edit: it actually had been two weeks now I seem to have memory loss. I just genuinely dont feel like theres a “me” outside of the abuse I went through. Ive been through a bit of everything, multiple people doing multiple things. Everything has happened to me basically and I just dont see a life after being tortured so intensely.I always preach the “there IS hope, it WILL get better” but for me I just genuinely don’t feel thats true. Its a hard realization to come to but I dont think healing is possible for me because of just how bad it was. Ive been through therapy many times and on meds and it never gets better it actually got worse. Ive been “trauma processing” with trusted adults since elementary, my most recent emotional wound I’ve opened only caused me to start having a nervous breakdown thats now 2 years in the running. I have a nightmare disorder from PTSD, frequent panic attacks, and around 12 I completely became a hermit because I genuinely couldn’t function due to trauma. Im still a hermit with no hope of ever joining society again as even small steps that are successful give me intense panic attacks for weeks. I give up. I can’t fight anymore. Maybe some people are just broken to the point they cant live. Nobody understands what I mean. I am lost. I want to be dead.Only ever have taken like 4 inhalers (not all at once, in my lifetime). I space them out but one time I drank a shit ton after benz and my heart has never been the same. Palpitations, pain in both sides, numbness in shoulders and hands, tightness in chest. What do I do? Whats going on? Its been weeks no improvement. Im fucked. Im in a relationship with a close friend of many years. I am constantly afraid of embarrassing myself in front of them, I feel ashamed almost always around them because I am jealous of them. It started as little awkward moments (that we communicated about) but now I’m just so fully humiliated. It wasn’t even that big of an issue, I was just doing something with good intent that turned out to be uncomfortable for them. Its been driving me crazy. I feel like our relationship is tainted with awkwardness. I cant ever enjoy my time with them without it being so god damn cringey. I want to die. I hate this relationship. Being with them makes me feel like shit about myself and they have been nothing but supportive. What do I do?. NPD causes delusions and paranoia and basically the same amount of distorted views as BPD, maybe even more because we have all of the ones BPD have plus delusion of grandeur. Why aren’t antipsychotics used to treat npd?. I have pretty harsh emotional reactions to things and there are just things that seem normal but will send me spiraling into suicidal/rage mix episode and they are very scary and hard to control. I try to keep people from avoid seeing or knowing about it as much as I can. Some of the things people do that send me into these episodes are seemingly good deeds, and are them trying to be nice. I try setting boundaries and telling them it upsets me and I acknowledge they mean well, but they repeatedly cross this boundary because they think I will feel better after they do it. I don’t, it is a break of my trust. Ive told a therapist and she just told me this boundary was silly and I should be grateful. I just don’t want certain good deeds done to me against my will. How do I explain this to people? How do I get them to stop?. He will “playfully” talk about humiliating moments I had to his friends. I know I talk weird, I know my delusion of grandeur gets me into embarrassing situations and I fail a lot. I know I’m socially awkward & cocky and I get humbled a lot, but this just doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel good when you’re constantly being laughed AT, not with. I don’t see the point to re-humiliate me, I’ve told him to stop and why it upsets me but he doesn’t stop. It makes me feel like I have to be constantly on guard with him, and that I can’t bond with his friends because they only know me for my worst moments. None of my friends do this to each other, just only him with me. Am I really just a loser and have to accept being treated like this?. Dxm and alohcohol :).Not a good mix :/. I cant receive compliments without intrusive thoughts about how bad of a person I am and how ugly I am seep in and make me feel like the people are just being lead by their emotions to tell me good things about me, and once those emotions wear off they will see me for who I truly am. I’m constantly just waiting for everyone to wake up and realize they were only being nice to me because they were caught up in a moment. I feel most valued in relationships where we are casually just talking about shit, I like when my worth is reliant on the things I do because then I could be myself without the knowledge that someone could just “sober up” and stop caring about me. I don’t like my value being based on my personality or anything that I see as a permanent part of me. I don’t want to be loved for being myself, I want to be in control of the things people love me for.Anyone else feel like these can be used to “treat” autism (not in a make someone less autistic way, in a make life more manageable way).ADHDers are under-stimulated all the time, so they are given stims to help fulfill their sensory needs. Autistics shift in a spectrum from understimulated to overstimulated, so in theory if they were given small doses of stimulants and sedatives when they needed it, it could help regulate their sensory needs. And as I found out about myself, maintain my sensory needs for the rest of the day. Even on small doses of uppers/downers it has given me more control of my emotions and made me function in situations that would otherwise have made me melt down. Both of these also alleviate my intense social anxiety and have helped me extremely with my selective mutism because I can finally focus and/or calm down.Anyone else relate or think the same?. Im not the best at cleaning my blade but I try to dry it off before setting it down and clean it with rubbing alcohol every 1-2 uses. I made a couple of shallow cuts but these ones sting. BADLY. They arent bleeding anymore but they are throbbing. I didn’t nick a vein, maybe a nerve ? The initial cut didnt hurt, just a few seconds after it started to burn and itch. Probably bacterial but if this is serious please tell me and tell me how to treat it. Not because I’m an addict I use it sparingly. But if I have a good trip I will feel great about my life afterwards, way more than I usually would and even days after I feel like I can do anything I set my mind to. Im super motivated and it can pull me right out of a deep depression. If I have a bad trip though I will go back to my normal negative depressed self. It will feel like I did nothing at all, maybe awaken some bad memories, and then not much else. Making it worse I feel disappointed by missing the trip I was expecting to help me turn my life around on a whim. Anyone else get this or know how to have better trips more often?. I dont think we are handling disorders like npd/aspd/etc right. I found the best way for me to live is trying to “cure” myself and just learning to realize when Im feeling attacked/scared of closeness and what part of myself am I scared of people seeing, as well as anytime I feel like “I’m doomed to feel this way cause I lack empathy/Im a narc/etc.” I stop and think ‘no I dont have to feel this way’ and instead truly accept I have ‘weak’ emotions about this situation, like I only feel anger not cause theres something in my brain blocking me but because IM subconsciously choosing not to feel sad/fear/love/etc. but its safe now and I can stop telling myself I dont feel those things and instead I push myself past my repulsions and hold my loved ones and be honest even when it hurts. I mimic healthy relationships cause I’m like a baby when it comes to these things, not because I’m incapable (but it would be nice cause that means is never have to admit im hypersensitive and face being allowed to be hurt again). Im still a narcissist, I actually was so bad I was non functional in society at all and I lost everyone, now I’m healing. Idk if remission is “possible” for npd I genuinely feel like thats where im heading. I know I cant be the only one who feels this way.I hate that I enjoy collecting. It feels like my hobby is spending money. I feel happy when I do it but I know its not going to fill a void and potentially be something I just sell, so why am I wasting my time and money? My collection has no functional purpose. Just sits on a shelf. I feel guilty.In the US, I need frequent blood tests to monitor a health condition. I usually avoid my arms to avoid these situations, but I was being stupid & did it on impulse. I’ll wait until its just scars but that specific blood lab knows me and knows these scars must have been recent cause they see me a lot.Non bpd haver hereIf someone has a FP and that FP is very emotionally unstable, will that effect the pwBPD’s emotional state? In this example the person is just constantly stressed about their life, and makes sure to reassure the pwBPD that they are loved and talks to them a lot.There’s so many different recipes of PT from boiling to cold wash to grinding down, and the debate on how long you’re supposed to shake it.But what’s the BEST recipe(s) you have actually tried?.
    I told two close friends about my diagnosis. Yes, I was an Idiot. I did it because I thought it will help them to understand my behavior so there wouldn't be misunderstandings. But I regret every single bit of it. So, did you had any bad experiences or you weren't as stupid as me?.
    First off, if you are part of the LGBTQIA+ or not part of the stereotypically fem crowd avoid this place. They do not deserve your business and there are other gas stations. I need to provide some context to put everything into perspective. This was absolutely discrimination against trans people targeted at my SO who is not trans. I'm not sure how to describe them well but I'll do my best. Her hair could be described as guy-ish. It's shorter on the sides slightly longer on the top. Doesn't care about pronouns much and considers themselves as non-binary. Aside from enjoying shorter hair they like to wear a lot of different vibrant wigs for work. So it's partially out of convenience and comfort. They were wearing a sweater and sweat pants (both from the women's section). At best, they can pull off thin femboy. I am actually a trans woman and I get gendered properly and people have mistaken her I.D. for being mine pretty often (they have a longer auburn wig on in the I.D. photo). We still wear our masks from Covid because of immune system issues so it's not like the cashier could have seen me as being trans and I dress more fem than my partner. Just for visualizing, I'm 130 lbs, 34C, 27" waist, and wasn't wearing a bra with a tight tank. My hair is also long enough to reach past my shoulders, a shag with bangs recently cut.So as we walked into the gas station we immediately headed for the bathroom as we normally do on road trips. The cashier lady said welcome or something but we didn't respond as we normally don't. This has never been a problem before. As we both were in stalls this employee followed us in. Then the following happened:Employee: "Hey ladies"My SO: "Yeah?" thinking someone needed toilet paper or somethingEmployee: "Could you respond when someone says good morning next time" ConfrontationallyMy SO: "No I don't owe you that" Bewildered by what was happeningEmployee: "Then don't, no need to be so rude" Could literally hear the hostility and walked offI'm pretty sure she was literally trying to voice check my SO for any hints of being a guy. Once we left the bathroom we obviously took our business else where and left without buying anything. The employee and her co-worker were very snide and the lady said "Have a good morning, don't come back again"Like this has never happened before and the audacity. There was absolutely no reason for that employee to do what she did outside of hate. We never have experienced anything like that before. To be followed into the bathroom in the first place is creepy as hell. There isn't any possible reason she could have done that aside from thinking she had caught a "Man" going into the women's restroom. What's even more stupid about this is the fact that according to some state's laws my SO if they were a trans man was going to the bathroom correctly according to their AGAB. Not to mention if my SO was recovering from chemo or was a just a vaguely butch lesbian who again, is just going to the bathroom because why would they go to the men's.It's absolutely nausea inducing. I wonder if it's illegal or against Sinclair company policy as well but I'm not a legal expert. Anyways, partially just wanted to vent, ask opinions, and warn people since we just got back. Like do we need to wear the biggest push ups, keep our hair long and wear pink tight fitting dresses just to be valid? Way to police being a woman random employee and betrayer Miss, "we can always tell." Thanks for reading and any help fighting this discrimination would be appreciated. I'm probably going to write a google review to hopefully warn people.TLDR: My androgynous AFAB partner just got harassed by an employee trans checking them in the women's restroom.. The correct answer: Like obviously if you're a transgenderist alpha straight men won't date you unless you say no homo first.The comments: Men suck, my dating life sucks, trust no one ever, t4t me daddy, I will love you😭/uj What is wrong with the trans subreddits today? The amount of silly af questions seems abnormally high. Dating in general is/should be difficult unless you accept trash in your life. Finding anyone worthwhile is hard: cis, trans, straight, queer, etc. I can't believe some of the discussions that people are entertaining and their awful opinions. If you think straight men won't date you because you are a trans woman, you have some internalized transphobia to figure out ffs. Just as appalling are the answers saying \[gender\] are trash. People in general are trash, find people that aren't. Sexism regardless who it's pointed at is gross. Vent over thanks😘. I don't have anyone to share this with IRL and I need to write this down so I don't forget, not that I think I will be able to for a long time but here we go. So it's finally cool enough to wear sweaters again and my SO has these two rainbow sweaters. We decided to go out and have a twinning date. My SO is great with makeup so she helped with a super cute eye look (more rainbows obvs) and the magnetic false eyelashes. I finished with some blush and what not. I was feeling super cute until we got to the doors where all of my confidence evaporated (one of the bouncers called me man last time). I was also a bit high, to hopefully stop overthinking so much.So we get through the metal detector and I had both of our I.D's. My SO had gone in front of me so she was waiting in front of the security guy for me to hand him our I.D's. I give them to the guy and he hands one back and while looking at the other says "nice pic." At this point I was pretty fucking irritated and about to lash out. Like dude, I get it "haha trans person or drag" but you don't have to be a complete dick about it. I bit my tongue though because I wanted to have a nice night and this random asshole wasn't about to change that.So he looks at my SO and is like "what's your birthday?" She says "14 1992" and he is not satisfied since she forgot the month part, That date is also our anniversary so I'm now thinking "how did you forget that date of all dates?" It still hasn't dawned on me wtf is going on. He then asks her for her middle name and I'm high, so it's finally clicking that he has my I.D and is quizzing her for some reason. I whisper "\[dead middle name\]" to her before realizing he can totally see my mouth move and everything. The bouncer just frowns and sighs at me looking incredulous.I finally get what is going on and I'm like "Oh! actually sir that is my I.D" He then does a few takes at me and the I.D and says "Sorry but you know how people are." We get our stamps, go in and neither of us are able to resist bursting out in laughter.That poor bouncer had to guess who the legit I.D belonged to and chose I looked more like my SO's picture than she did. He was actually complimenting that picture. Totally not being a jerk. I guess he then must have either thought my SO was underaged and I had given her someone else's I.D or something because he didn't think that I.D belonged to either of us.I can't imagine what would have happened if I snapped on him for trying to ruin our night just because I'm trans😅 Also the dysphoria in my brain wants to excuse his confusion for the lighting or literally anything else but not only did this guy think I was cis; he actually thought my SO's picture was me. Super validating even if I don't get how he possibly got to that conclusion. This was also the first time that I am undeniably looking pretty good, considering I started HRT a year and a half ago at 30. I never expected to reach this point at 30 without some major surgeries, so I'm ecstatic. Overall, great night and a good start to it, aside from some dude being creepy but I just expect that,TLDR: Bouncer thought my cis(F) SO's I.D was mine.Disclaimer: These calculations are based on my initial findings and seem to work out correctly and do not include OS Tuning for mitigation or increased damage for types although I have a fairly good idea where those are applied. The calculations are probably off minorly.* AP: Fairly obvious, this is the amount of damage a player or enemy can take regardless of specific defenses.* Anti Kinetic/Energy/Explosive: Straight forward this is applicable to each type of damage and acts as damage negation percentage.* Energy is unique in that the generator of the attacker has an impact on how much damage is dealt found by the Energy Firearm Spec. I haven't found where it is specifically at in the formula; however off of testing using a 51 vs 116 is a difference in approximately 30% damage. That is more damage percent modification than 21 OS Tuning chips. So, if you use laser weapons you want that number as high as possible. Melee also may be affected similarly from the arm part of the attacker although I have not tested yet.* Haven't calculated stagger. Stagger is trickier to calculate as I do not have attitude damage values like I did with AP damage from tester AC and the value is not displayed. I assume it follows a similar formula.For the actual calculations. First the damage negation percentage is found roughly by (*anti\_damage\_type* \- 1000) / 1000. Giving us a percentage. Then Round(w*eapon\_damage\_type\*damage\_negation)* giving an integer value, mitigated\_damage. After, *attack\_power - mitigated\_damage,* resulting in damage to AP.For a practical example we can use the Melander full set, same as what the tester AC uses and the Turner assault rifle. Turner is a kinetic weapon thus the value of interest on the armor is anti-kinematic.1. Attack Power = 87, AP = 10550, Anti Kinematic = 12272. ( *anti\_damage\_type* \- 1000 ) / 1000, 1227 - 1000 = 227, 227/1000 = .2273. Round ( w*eapon\_damage\_type \* damage\_negation ),* 87 \* 0.227 = 19.749, Round ( 19.749 ) = 204. *attack\_power - mitigated\_damage*, 87 - 20 = 675. *AP - damage\_to\_AP,* 10550 - 67 = 10483 Direct Hit on a staggered enemy relies on the Direct Hit Adjustment. The value is divided by 100 resulting in a percentage. Using the above:1. Direct Hit Adjustment = 1852. *direct\_hit\_adjustment* / 100, *185 / 100 = 1.85*3. Round ( *attack\_power* \* direct\_hit\_percentage ) - *mitigated\_damage, Round ( 87 \* 1.85) = 161, 161 - 20 = 141* 4. 10550 - 141 = 10409.For Energy Firearm Spec (EFS) and melee along with OS Tuning I assume they are applied to the values before calculation but testing is needed. For instance, taking 15% energy along with applicable generator could result in multiplicative or additive damage. Potential formulas:* ( attack\_power \* control\_tuning \* ( EFS / 100 ) ) = true\_attack\_power* ( attack\_power \* ( control\_tuning + ( EFS / 100 ) ) = true\_attack\_powerPlease let me know if you have anything to add / correct, thanks!. Basically title, I was waiting in line for doughnuts and no one was behind me aside from some dude who walked in. I never looked at him. I didn't even know someone else walked in, until the guy started making like groaning/grunting noises like he was constipated. At first I was like whatever, not different to how some people sound at the gym/locker room/bathroom. Then he goes "oh fuck" as I'm putting money in my back pocket. He proceeds to start making the sounds more and mutters some other things under his breath. As soon as some other guy walked in and went to the bakery's kitchen he immediately stops and starts humming. He didn't do it while ordering his doughnuts either.Absolutely disgusting, can't even buy doughnuts in public without feeling like I'm going to get clocked and glocked. Can't imagine how that ogre would of responded if he did notice I was trans or he saw me alone. I'm so grossed out. I swear the dude was practically standing over me. No one noticed of course because why would they. Part of me just wonders what people like him gain from that. Like keeping your weird sexual fantasies involving me to yourself is a bare minimum of decency. Not like I am going to turn around and be like "oh wow, your revolting dying engine for vocal chords is so hot."I'm ranting at this point but I really just can't believe the audacity of doing that with like 15 people around. Never safe I guess.I'm not sure how to articulate this well or flair, so apologies in advance; when/before I started HRT, I was fairly confident at 29, I wouldn't see the results I wanted. I don't know if it's considered part of the dysphoria or if you would consider it body dysmorphia. Still, I generally don't think my frame is very feminine in the usual ways: hips, shoulders, waist, etc. I've worked quite a bit to go from 155 average weight to my now 130, but I still don't feel great some days.Tonight, my SO(cis F) and I were talking. I don't remember why it even came up, but I was overly confident my under-bust/rib cage was a lot larger than hers, at a bare minimum of two inches or more. Much to my surprise, and being 3 inches taller, my underbust is only half an inch bigger than hers. Along with being a 32D after 15 months of HRT, I'm just bewildered. I'm still working to get the physique I want, but I am forced to admit that I have a very fem physique. Whether my brain wants to acknowledge it or not. I can even fit into her corsets that I absolutely could not fit into a year ago.I know I'm pretty fortunate in this regard, and everyone will have different results and whatnot, but I just wanted to share. I'm flabbergasted and very thankful. Hopefully, I can reach 120 ish lbs in a few months. Now, I can't justify most of my feelings about my body, which is pretty validating.So I went to Ren Fair in a lolita red and black gothic dress. It was hotter than heck so I sat outside on a bench fanning myself while my partner was shopping one of the stalls. A few minutes later a guy came sat down on another bench that was next to mine. It was kind of off the path and not in the shade so not the best spot to sit. After like 30 seconds he had mentioned something about loving to see everything and we chatted for maybe a minute before I got up to check on my partner. As I left I said, "Have fun starring at people." Wasn't the best phrasing but in my head it was kind of funny. Then he said something along the lines of me making him sound creepy. Then I just walked away after telling him I was kidding (which he may or may not of believed). It wasn't until after that fact that I realized he was probably trying to approach me and he probably was already worried about coming off as a creep. Poor guy... Anyways I need to be more conscious of that sort of thing and it seemed fun enough to share.For context, I'm a year and a few months on HRT. I still wear a mask because 1. My immune system seems sensitive after wearing one during all of Covid. 2. Hide masc face features. During most of the year, my SO and I have regularly ordered takeout from a local diner. This means most employees have heard all phases of my sometimes okay fem voice and body changes. So I assume me being trans is pretty apparent, and my SO is AFAB and rarely comes with me sometimes, but we always order two meals.I infrequently talk with the manager for a few minutes, and he thinks my name is Will (it's short for my SOs name). The last time I went, he gave me a 25% discount and didn't say anything. The server was like one minute, got him, and he punched some things in on the PoS and left. I was like that's nice of him and tipped the server the discounted amount.Well, last night, we ordered there again. He talked to me for a few minutes, and then the discount was like 50%. I asked him why and he just said, "Because I can," before disappearing into the kitchen after I thanked him. My SO says it's because he thinks I'm hot, obviously. Maybe it's the dysphoria, but I can't think that is the reason, but I don't have a better one. Now I don't know how to proceed. I could let it continue for the cheaper food until he tries to make advances, ghost the place, or ask him not to.Has anyone been in a similar situation or have a better reason why he would start doing this? I wanted some other opinions since I think my SO is biased AF.Edit: Thanks for the responses, a lot of good insight. Going to let it continue unless it gets problematic.. Just found some research stating that estradiol HRT administered orally is not an effective route for those of us who consume nicotine. Essentially the study involves women on HRT, The study goes on to suggest transdermal as the appropriate method of administration. Some caveats:* Study doesn't distinguish if the oral is ingested, buccal or sublingual.* The study suggests transdermal administration but does not elaborate to my knowledge.* May or may not contain trans people.* Most are probably cis postmenopausal but I don't think that is relevant.My thoughts on the study given I couldn't find other studies related to smoking and HRT. Oral E probably shouldn't be the first choice even if using sublingually. Personally I know I do not absorb the entirety of the pills under my tongue and some amount is getting swallowed. In general avoid swallowing E pills. If transdermal is fine I assume any administration avoiding the metabolic system will be fine, including injections. As stated in the study if you are using orally you will have poor intake of the E; however, increasing the dose is not ideal to circumvent the loss of efficacy for a variety of medical reasons. If you have better information on the subject please share.Source: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15638743/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15638743/). Someone had requested a follow-up on the post, and here is that follow-up for what it is worth. Results unsurprisingly show an aversion to touch in general. My intention with the inquiry was to see if any others felt physical pain from specifically affective touch as clinically defined. I didn't want to specify this, though, because I didn't want people to come in and be like hey, me too, to fit in or whatever.In retrospect discussing attachment theory was unnecessary, but that's what happens when your only piece of literature on the subject correlates to something else that probably has no causal relation. I'll probably do more research on it at some point but literature is lacking and I'm not great at parsing scientific journals. Writing posts while high is also not helpful, but here I am again. Here are a few of my takeaways:* Considering most of us who aren't scrolling Reddit while in prison /s have difficulty with interpersonal relations, I find it interesting that most of you know as little about attachment theory as I do. * The densest of you have helped point me towards self-soothing and helping to describe the specific aversion as a physical manifestation of psychosomatic pain. * What I am describing likely has more to do with interpersonal trauma and less with attachment styles, although that interpersonal trauma can feed into attachment styles.* It seems in the ASPD community my situation is an anomaly. I assumed a few would share this characteristic given the trauma component.* For the least dense of you, the armchair autism diagnosis never gets old. Keep up the excellent work.So I made a Grindr account because why not. Not terrible experience overall except way more attention than I am used to but IDK why today is the day of people referring to me CD etc. and here was my latest gem.L4transonly: Ya I have not played with a male yet. Looking for a good partner.Me: Well seeing me as a male is the best way to get yourself blocked so I suppose you will be looking again.L4transonly: \[laughing while crying emoji\] great dodged a bullet.Anywho you would think someone with a name like that wouldn't be a complete idiot. Like its fine to use grindr specifically to meet trans I think? But to be that way and think you are getting laid? I don't get it. Also the presumption I have anything down there that would be of interest is silly. Thinking it functions like a normal peen is silly. Thinking I want to be touched there equally silly.Made me laugh tbh so figured I would share. Also hope you like fucking yourself dude because you gonna be pretty fucking lonely acting like that. Also funny to see this on a LGBT+ dating app,. So I've always had issues with people stroking, petting me repetitively or simply repetitive caressing with a thumb/finger while holding hands. I recently decided to try to research this but I'm not having much luck. I came across disorganized attachment: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026862/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026862/). I didn't know this was a thing. However, my understanding of attachment was that we are generally dismissive avoidant. I don't relate to the disorganized attachment aside from the affective touch issues but relate to many issues in dismissive avoidant. I can't find anything discussing affective touch and dismissive avoidant though.So questions I want to discuss:1. Do you relate to having a negative reaction to affective touch?2. What is your attachment style?3. Do you have any research regarding Dismissive avoidant and affective touch?4. I am not knowledgeable on attachment theory other than the research I did today. Is it possible for people to relate to all attachment styles to varying degrees?Edit: People don't seem to be understanding this, affective touch in the clinical sense. I'm not talking about being touched by someone who is affectionate with you. If you agreed for instance to them holding your hand. That part being totally fine. The issue I am looking into is if they start to like gently rub your with their fingers etc.**Affective touch:** S**lowly moving, low-force mechanical stimulation which is often perceived as pleasant**.Wasn't feeling the best today and made sure to put on one of my more fem outfits and had my SO help me with eyeliner. Didn't do any other makeup or anything but had a mask on while we went to grab some takeout. As we got out of the car some gal with a guy said, "You both are really cute!" and I had an anime moment of my soul leaving my body. As we got to the other side of the street she was on she doubled down and I think her and the guy she was with was trying to get us to go to the bar they were going to.Really made my day but I had zero response and thankfully my SO could carry that conversation. Normally I just put on my 10 year old coat when I go do errands because meh. I tried brushing it off as them just thinking my SO was cute so they complimented us both but then we got to our usual take out place and the owner who is always at the front didn't recognize me at all either. Usually just asks if I'm getting the usual as soon as I get to the counter but there was a pause before he was like, "What can I get the two of you?" Really has thrown me for a loop tbh. I didn't think a little bit of eyeliner would make such a difference.My opinion on Leo Lines: For reference, I purchased a few pairs of the cotton thongs. The price is fine, I would be willing to spend more if the product was worth it but for me, these are adequately priced and a good place to start. The lack of bulge when wearing leggings or sweat pants is nice but the padding in the front is a bit thick and visible with something like lululemon. The trimming isn't ideal either and is a bit uncomfortable, for me at least but maybe my skin is a bit sensitive. Overall, I would purchase again if I didn't have a better option. With that out of the way.Is there a better seller of mtf underwear? Is there a way to make them more comfortable or did you feel like you got accustomed to the lining?As an aside, Etsy decided to start recommending me sissy related items and lingerie "for men". So thanks Etsy, feels great.This doesn't concern introductory first-year courses. I'm coming from a 300 's class, and as I stated in the title, please write better discussion posts. I understand it can be time-consuming or challenging to elaborate on a topic that may not even interest you. However, when another person or I have to respond, it is exceptionally infuriating to find a post that is relevant to the questions being asked.The amount of posts I've read where OP isn't even on topic is astounding. If you are off-topic along with the other 90%, it's near impossible to meet the response criteria. At least mention a specific of the discussion criteria that we can elaborate on in the reply.Sorry for the rant. It's irritating. I spend way more time trying to find a post to reply to than actually writing a response.Edit: I'm not going to bother responding to all this but a few things of note after skimming. I don't care if you write garbage just write it about the topic. This has nothing to do with length, nobody is talking about an essay. If it's short, great as long as it's on topic.I don't like the discussion posts any more than most of you. I dread them because of the waste of time. At a bare minimum don't actively make it worse for your peers.I see a lot of posts on this subject, and I've done my fair share, so I thought I would share my experience. Equivalent courses are subject to change at any time. Always check with your advisor to ensure you will receive credit if you are currently enrolled. With that out of the way, here is my Equivalencies Table.

You can read descriptions of external courses and the classes of SNHU. Usually, if they correlate, the classes are equivalent. SNHU provides a few lists of equivalent courses; however, many of my classes from study,com were unlisted, so I had to check with the advisor after researching their course list.A few other things worth noting: If you want the Latin honors, you need to take a minimum of 60 credits with SNHU. It may or may not be important to you. If you get a minor, at least nine credits must be taken at SNHU; however, less than 50% can apply to your major. SNHU also requires 30 credits are taken through them for the degree. This means you could potentially only take ten classes with SNHU and do the rest through external sources. Classes also have prerequisites, so it can become challenging to manage which courses need to be completed and time them out. Also, while you do receive credit for the classes, they will not affect your GPA. This means the courses you take with SNHU will weigh heavier on your GPA if you want a high GPAMy experience with these sources can be different than yours. I've found that most can be completed in a week if you are diligent. I don't have any experience with Saylor. I was not too fond that they only provided a textbook and expected you to test it independently.**Sofia:** Courses seem to update their limited classes frequently, so I consider these a high priority. It's hard to argue with the cost; however, they don't provide much for study material. Very independent but worthwhile for the savings. Here is a current list of most of the classes available with their reevaluation date.

I don't recall the course I took with them, but I would have taken more if they were available. The test was pretty easy. The only downside is that many of the courses did not apply to my major. Also note that when I took the course, video lessons had to play all the way through to allow moving on.**Study,com:** The price isn't ideal; however, one of the few sources with abundant CS classes. The two-exam limit is a bit of a downer. I appreciate that you can test out many quizzes and the tests are reasonable. It's effortless to get total points for quizzes.

Hopefully, we can use our collective knowledge to help newcomers.Thankfully we don't go out much due to COVID and haven't received any death threats or violence here in South Dakota but the general distaste is palpable. I just started HRT and my hair hasn't grown out much yet. My SO is gender-fluid with short hair and occasionally dresses like a guy. I've been rocking some femme leaning outfits, high-rise jeans, cropped shirts, etc. Aside from people driving past and yelling out random things the funny bit is how cashiers and other service providers act when they see us. Really showing us who's boss by not bagging our stuff or giving us the silent treatment during check out lol. We have gotten eye-rolls and people giving us a wide berth but what are some of the subtle things these people do to try and be disrespectful to you?. I went in for an HRT appointment on March 29th to do the informed consent route. They complimented my cardigan, took my blood, and were incredibly affirming. I wasn't prepared for any of it. As if that wasn't enough, I was told I could leave at the end of the appointment and not to worry about paying. I asked if they were sure and was told, "Yup, we have plenty of funding right now, so feel free just to walk out."My SO teared up. Not used to compassion on any level from anyone outside my SO, and it hurt a bit. For the first time in my life, I feel like I should make a thank you card for the next time I see them. My SO donates to them annually already, so let me know if you have any suggestions on how I can make that doctor's day better on my next visit.I just wanted to share how awesome they were about everything.Edit: Thanks everyone for the conversation and such. I'm glad this has reassured some and that most of you have also had a good experience with them.. # Intro:Sharing how to get the greatsword from start to finish for those struggling and are wanting a braindead strategy. Since I was experimenting with the new sorceries, I did a lot of unnecessary steps. I will follow this on a new character once matchmaking has been tested and verified. This is a bare-bone setup without anything you wouldn't already want going forward.# Pros:* Does not require leveling any weapons* With respec, you can dump the points needed for str into vit or int* Requires minimal spells* Easy to get the required items# Cons:* RNG reliant >! (Although Astel only took me three attempts) !<* Will have to experiment with Meteorite's range* Still will have to dodge a bit* Needs as many flasks as you can, 5-7 Cerulean (FP)* Will want to get as many Golden seeds and Sacred Tears as possible# The Build:|Astologer Class & Stats:|Sorceries|Gear|Flask of Wonderous Physick||:-|:-|:-|:-||Vit: 20+ (Not required)|Meteorite|Meteorite Staff|Magic Shrouding Cracked Tear||Int: 24+ (Twinsage)|Rock Sling|Radagon Icon|Intelligence-knot Crystal Tear||Four spell slots|Carian Slicer|Graven-School Talisman|||Two talismans|Swift Glintstone Shard|Twinsage Glintstone Crown(optional)||# The Strategy:Use wonderous physick, enter the boss room, summon and cast Carian Slicer, Rock Slinger, or Meteorite until dead. It is that simple. Rock Slinger is suitable for staggering most things, although it leaves a bit to be desired if you need to dodge a lot, which is where Slicer comes in handy. Meteorite is for Astel, Starscourge Radahn, and anything else big and chunky. It's basically a downgraded dark bead from DS1. The range is finicky, but you should be able to hit for 2-4k per volley with the proper aim and timing. I found getting close range worked best and not caring about potentially dying. You need to hold the cast to drain all your FP and do the deeps.\---# Early Setup:Hit some Sites of Grace for torrent and get preferred Spirit Ash summon. I used puppies from Stormhill Shack until getting the mimic. If they can hold agro, you will be fine. Upgrade the summons as much as possible. It should be at least +3 before Royal Knight Loretta. Return to Church of Elleh to talk to Ranni. Level Int to 18 before leveling anything else.Then, rush Meteorite staff + Rock Slinger through Dragon Burnt Ruins trap chest to Sellia Crystal Tunnel. You will use this all the way through and get both before fighting anything.Edit: Getting Radagon's Soreseal after the staff and sorcery should prove useful. Currently doing this on a new character.Teach pumpkin head a lesson for being in your way with summons + Rock Slinger and get the Carian Slicer from Sorceress Sellen. Get the Academy Scroll and give it to Sellen for the Swift Glinststone Shard. Go to all the churches for Sacred Tears and find some Golden Seeds. Visit Oridys's Rise for a memory stone. Take the wrong way at Castleward Tunnel, Rock Slinger Margit, for not letting you leave and skip Stormveil Castle because waste of time.# Mid Setup:Next, get the Academy Glintstone Key from behind the dragon and head into the academy. You will want the Graven-School Talisman and Radagon Icon. The Twinsage Glintstone Crown can also be helpful. Red Wolf might be easier to kill with Carian Slicer vs. Rock-Slinger, your choice ultimately.Find the Intelligence-Knot Crystal Tear. Go to Caria Manor and beat up Royal Knight Loretta using Rock Slinger and summons. Honestly, this was probably the worst fight due to getting roll caught. This is when I finally upgraded the summons to +3 and should have done it sooner.Head behind Caria Manor to Royal Grave Evergoal. Show off your Slicer to Alabaster Lord for his Meteorite sorcery (30 Int required). Use your new RNG powers to humiliate Erdtree Avatar (LIURNIA NORTHEAST) for your Magic Shrouding Cracked Tear.# Late Setup:Follow Ranni's questline and profit, there are plenty of guides for this so I will talk about some of the bosses.**Starscourge Radahn:** Hit all the summons and stay off your horse. After the last summon, ride up on torrent and use Rock Slinger. Once he flies off, resummon the ones that died, use wonderous physick, then get off torrent to Meteorite should be able to skip phase 2 with 1 or 2 volleys depending on how well he behaves. Torrent is a detriment in phase 2 due to the homing gravity orbs of sadness. Easier to just dodge if needed while replenishing FP.**Renalla:** Pretty easy with Rock Sling. This is the only time I used an actual weapon because I was too lazy to switch between Rock Sling and Carian Slicer.**Astel:** Not much to say other than it can and probably will one-shot you with less than 30 vit. It went down in 3-4 Meteorites and made me feel like I was in an Isekai.# Final Notes:* Terra Magicus might be useful since you are standing hoping not to get hit, but I didn't bother.* Night Shard is useful for NPC invaders who can dodge other spells. Otherwise, Slicer works well enough.* More FP is useful but not required if you are trying to keep your level low.* I haven't bothered with any consumables. I will probably experiment with those soon.* Cerulean hidden tear later in the game will only make this more hilarious.* The Opaline tear for damage negation might also be viable.* Meteorite of Astel, Comet Azur, or Zamor Ice Storm are probably the only things that can compete with the damage output. All are quite a bit later into the game.# TLDR: If you aren't using Meteorite, you should be.Edit: Route took on a new character. This isn't well formatted as I will probably make a new post with updated information.

Thank you for your time. I am currently in the process of disputing a 0 on a section for a project. This section is for Error Handling, "Code effectively validates user input." I'm curious about your thoughts on the situation. Note that error handling is the rubric requirement, not exception handling.Per our textbook, zyBook 5.1, "Error-checking code is code a programmer writes to detect and handle errors that occur during program execution. An exception is a circumstance that a program was not designed to handle, such as if the user enters a negative height."To further this, Techopedia defines error handling as such: "Error handling refers to the response and recovery procedures from error conditions present in a software application. Error handling helps maintain the normal flow of program execution. Either the programmer develops the necessary codes to handle errors or uses software tools to handle the errors. Error-handling techniques for development errors include rigorous proofreading. Error-handling applications can resolve runtime errors or have their impact minimized by adopting reasonable countermeasures depending on the environment."This is the function I wrote to handle user input error.double checkInput() { double t_userInput; cin >> t_userInput; while (!cin || t_userInput < 0 || t_userInput > 999999999) { cin.clear(); cin.ignore(std::numeric\_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n'); cout << "Please enter valid number." << endl; cin >> t_userInput; } return t\_userInput;}This code prevents 0 in the one instance that divide by 0 can occur.temp = (int)round(checkInput()); m\_incrementYears = (temp != 0) ? temp : 1;Based on my understanding of error handling, these pieces of code detect and handle errors that could occur during execution. The code also helps maintain the normal flow of program execution. I don't think error handling only includes using try/catch statements. This is without getting into the ambiguous requirements of the project. Am I in the wrong here or is the instructor being unnecessarily difficult?Also, because I am a bit spiteful, I'm debating using try/catch in this function for future assignments. Is this a bad idea?. Goal: Complex 3D terrain with small looping caves inside of a forest dungeon instance. Cliffs would surround the forest instance for the out-of-bounds regions.I want to implement a combination of GAN Cyclic Graph Grammar > Point Cloud > Deep marching Cube. Essentially, the Graph Grammar would define points in the 3D space, and the Deep marching Cube would build the terrain mesh after. I've seen the implementation of graph grammar in 2D and also with buildings; however, these approaches don't utilize 3D corridors capable of traversing height. I could use prebuilt pieces to connect areas, but I don't like the idea of making 30+ cave systems just for variety's sake. Think random MHW Ancient Forest if that helps.I really appreciate any help you can provide.

Then I thought about saying that to an actual kid and gave myself a bit of a chuckle.Edit: For clarification the idea of unintentionally giving my own kid insecurities is what I find amusing about this.This is anecdotal. You may have a different experience. I am going to explain my story. You may find this useful. I would like in return for others who have been diagnosed to share theirs.To preface this I have always felt like a wolf amongst dogs. Same species but different. This is potentially part of the grandiosity however, I felt more evolved than the obnoxious monkeys around me. Two years ago after I yet again burned all bridges including my work relations I decided to find out to what extent that difference is. I eventually thought to comments about my behavior people would say such as "You're kind of a psycho" etc. People drawing comparisons between me and antagonists etc. The more I looked at ASPD the more I found to describe myself including insignificant details such as setting fires in adolescents.On the matter of finding someone to discuss this with you need to understand two things. The first is one ASPD moment does not make you ASPD. ASPD is habitual and a pattern of behavior. If you had some bad thoughts about people who have hurt you welcome to being human. The second is that you will face opposition unless you are being court ordered.It is extremely uncommon for people with ASPD to seek "help" from professionals. I don't know if this changing or if I am that much of an outlier but, this is the expectation that almost all therapists will share. I use language that NTs use to try sound more NT all the time. I understand if someone confronts me about X action then a solid defense is to say that I am feeling a lot of guilt about X action. This language will make the therapists draw the conclusion that you are not ASPD because you shouldn't be there in the first place and now you are speaking on emotional terms. This example is a bit extreme to illustrate what they will hear. They will only care that you just used emotional language. My definition of a friend is a person who either provides entertainment or a purpose. I don't say that to people of course but, the therapist will see the standard use and assume you are not ASPD. For me this was incredibly frustrating. I really had no grasp on how much of my language I used because it was the closest approximation to what conveys meaning to NTsMost therapists have not worked with ASPD and do not know anything outside of what they heard about cookie cutter jailed killers or their holy DSM. Most research is only focused on the incarcerated. I told one therapist I had to attend to my puppy for a moment and her response was "You know ASPD people don't keep dogs they kill them." This is to illustrate how far out of their depths most therapists are. You won't get anywhere with someone like this and they won't be useful.You may also run into therapists who seem open to hearing you out and then after listening to you will understand that you are in fact ASPD and tell you they cannot be of assistance and to find someone else. I found prefacing the discussion with the following to be useful: "I have concluded I have ASPD are you capable of assisting me with X"Last note even if you find an expert they may have little useful information for you. You are an enigma and your problems are going to be outside of their expertise in some situations.TLDR: Most therapists are not capable of assistance with ASPD, some just refuse. Speak to only those with expertise everyone else will waste your time.I have difficulty holding a position for more than a year. Interviews have always guaranteed me the position. Aside from when the employer went with someone with more experience. The last job that I held the owner said he has never hired someone without 3 years of experience, I had 5 months. After by about the year mark I seem to exhaust any empathy and friendliness I generated with co-workers and the employers. I don't think I am behaving any differently most days. I'm not sure if it's small things that build to the inevitable or if they can sense I am off after some time or what. I try to come off as enthusiastic but it's extremely exhausting, especially once I have learned the position and the daily slug of repetitive tasks start.My last employer gave me a 30 minute lecture as to why it was inappropriate to not context an email with **may be**. I said "your client is at risk of heart failure." According to my employer I should of said "your client **may be** at risk of hear failure." I cannot fathom how this simple disclosure was worth 30 minutes of his day considering may be is part of the definition of risk.Any advice is appreciated. I may start seeking psychiatric help soon.To summarize I'll be building a sectional with a chaise. I understand that this is going to be a very extensive project but, that's part of the reason I'm doing it. I've been trying for a few days to find good information and I'm coming up a bit short and was hoping someone could help.I need to purchase wood online being in a smaller town with the only mill working in pine (Black Hills, SD). That being said I'm going for 5/4 soft maple, alder or poplar. I'm just worried that I might need 8/4 for my back and front rail. Also can I rely on the wood I get to be wide enough without knots? Will it be kiln dried from these places? If anyone knows a good site for this I would appreciate it.TL:DR Wood sizes and good online supplier.
    First off, if you are part of the LGBTQIA+ or not part of the stereotypically fem crowd avoid this place. They do not deserve your business and there are other gas stations. I need to provide some context to put everything into perspective. This was absolutely discrimination against trans people targeted at my SO who is not trans. I'm not sure how to describe them well but I'll do my best. Her hair could be described as guy-ish. It's shorter on the sides slightly longer on the top. Doesn't care about pronouns much and considers themselves as non-binary. Aside from enjoying shorter hair they like to wear a lot of different vibrant wigs for work. So it's partially out of convenience and comfort. They were wearing a sweater and sweat pants (both from the women's section). At best, they can pull off thin femboy. I am actually a trans woman and I get gendered properly and people have mistaken her I.D. for being mine pretty often (they have a longer auburn wig on in the I.D. photo). We still wear our masks from Covid because of immune system issues so it's not like the cashier could have seen me as being trans and I dress more fem than my partner. Just for visualizing, I'm 130 lbs, 34C, 27" waist, and wasn't wearing a bra with a tight tank. My hair is also long enough to reach past my shoulders, a shag with bangs recently cut.So as we walked into the gas station we immediately headed for the bathroom as we normally do on road trips. The cashier lady said welcome or something but we didn't respond as we normally don't. This has never been a problem before. As we both were in stalls this employee followed us in. Then the following happened:Employee: "Hey ladies"My SO: "Yeah?" thinking someone needed toilet paper or somethingEmployee: "Could you respond when someone says good morning next time" ConfrontationallyMy SO: "No I don't owe you that" Bewildered by what was happeningEmployee: "Then don't, no need to be so rude" Could literally hear the hostility and walked offI'm pretty sure she was literally trying to voice check my SO for any hints of being a guy. Once we left the bathroom we obviously took our business else where and left without buying anything. The employee and her co-worker were very snide and the lady said "Have a good morning, don't come back again"Like this has never happened before and the audacity. There was absolutely no reason for that employee to do what she did outside of hate. We never have experienced anything like that before. To be followed into the bathroom in the first place is creepy as hell. There isn't any possible reason she could have done that aside from thinking she had caught a "Man" going into the women's restroom. What's even more stupid about this is the fact that according to some state's laws my SO if they were a trans man was going to the bathroom correctly according to their AGAB. Not to mention if my SO was recovering from chemo or was a just a vaguely butch lesbian who again, is just going to the bathroom because why would they go to the men's.It's absolutely nausea inducing. I wonder if it's illegal or against Sinclair company policy as well but I'm not a legal expert. Anyways, partially just wanted to vent, ask opinions, and warn people since we just got back. Like do we need to wear the biggest push ups, keep our hair long and wear pink tight fitting dresses just to be valid? Way to police being a woman random employee and betrayer Miss, "we can always tell." Thanks for reading and any help fighting this discrimination would be appreciated. I'm probably going to write a google review to hopefully warn people.TLDR: My androgynous AFAB partner just got harassed by an employee trans checking them in the women's restroom.. The correct answer: Like obviously if you're a transgenderist alpha straight men won't date you unless you say no homo first.The comments: Men suck, my dating life sucks, trust no one ever, t4t me daddy, I will love you😭/uj What is wrong with the trans subreddits today? The amount of silly af questions seems abnormally high. Dating in general is/should be difficult unless you accept trash in your life. Finding anyone worthwhile is hard: cis, trans, straight, queer, etc. I can't believe some of the discussions that people are entertaining and their awful opinions. If you think straight men won't date you because you are a trans woman, you have some internalized transphobia to figure out ffs. Just as appalling are the answers saying \[gender\] are trash. People in general are trash, find people that aren't. Sexism regardless who it's pointed at is gross. Vent over thanks😘. I don't have anyone to share this with IRL and I need to write this down so I don't forget, not that I think I will be able to for a long time but here we go. So it's finally cool enough to wear sweaters again and my SO has these two rainbow sweaters. We decided to go out and have a twinning date. My SO is great with makeup so she helped with a super cute eye look (more rainbows obvs) and the magnetic false eyelashes. I finished with some blush and what not. I was feeling super cute until we got to the doors where all of my confidence evaporated (one of the bouncers called me man last time). I was also a bit high, to hopefully stop overthinking so much.So we get through the metal detector and I had both of our I.D's. My SO had gone in front of me so she was waiting in front of the security guy for me to hand him our I.D's. I give them to the guy and he hands one back and while looking at the other says "nice pic." At this point I was pretty fucking irritated and about to lash out. Like dude, I get it "haha trans person or drag" but you don't have to be a complete dick about it. I bit my tongue though because I wanted to have a nice night and this random asshole wasn't about to change that.So he looks at my SO and is like "what's your birthday?" She says "14 1992" and he is not satisfied since she forgot the month part, That date is also our anniversary so I'm now thinking "how did you forget that date of all dates?" It still hasn't dawned on me wtf is going on. He then asks her for her middle name and I'm high, so it's finally clicking that he has my I.D and is quizzing her for some reason. I whisper "\[dead middle name\]" to her before realizing he can totally see my mouth move and everything. The bouncer just frowns and sighs at me looking incredulous.I finally get what is going on and I'm like "Oh! actually sir that is my I.D" He then does a few takes at me and the I.D and says "Sorry but you know how people are." We get our stamps, go in and neither of us are able to resist bursting out in laughter.That poor bouncer had to guess who the legit I.D belonged to and chose I looked more like my SO's picture than she did. He was actually complimenting that picture. Totally not being a jerk. I guess he then must have either thought my SO was underaged and I had given her someone else's I.D or something because he didn't think that I.D belonged to either of us.I can't imagine what would have happened if I snapped on him for trying to ruin our night just because I'm trans😅 Also the dysphoria in my brain wants to excuse his confusion for the lighting or literally anything else but not only did this guy think I was cis; he actually thought my SO's picture was me. Super validating even if I don't get how he possibly got to that conclusion. This was also the first time that I am undeniably looking pretty good, considering I started HRT a year and a half ago at 30. I never expected to reach this point at 30 without some major surgeries, so I'm ecstatic. Overall, great night and a good start to it, aside from some dude being creepy but I just expect that,TLDR: Bouncer thought my cis(F) SO's I.D was mine.Disclaimer: These calculations are based on my initial findings and seem to work out correctly and do not include OS Tuning for mitigation or increased damage for types although I have a fairly good idea where those are applied. The calculations are probably off minorly.* AP: Fairly obvious, this is the amount of damage a player or enemy can take regardless of specific defenses.* Anti Kinetic/Energy/Explosive: Straight forward this is applicable to each type of damage and acts as damage negation percentage.* Energy is unique in that the generator of the attacker has an impact on how much damage is dealt found by the Energy Firearm Spec. I haven't found where it is specifically at in the formula; however off of testing using a 51 vs 116 is a difference in approximately 30% damage. That is more damage percent modification than 21 OS Tuning chips. So, if you use laser weapons you want that number as high as possible. Melee also may be affected similarly from the arm part of the attacker although I have not tested yet.* Haven't calculated stagger. Stagger is trickier to calculate as I do not have attitude damage values like I did with AP damage from tester AC and the value is not displayed. I assume it follows a similar formula.For the actual calculations. First the damage negation percentage is found roughly by (*anti\_damage\_type* \- 1000) / 1000. Giving us a percentage. Then Round(w*eapon\_damage\_type\*damage\_negation)* giving an integer value, mitigated\_damage. After, *attack\_power - mitigated\_damage,* resulting in damage to AP.For a practical example we can use the Melander full set, same as what the tester AC uses and the Turner assault rifle. Turner is a kinetic weapon thus the value of interest on the armor is anti-kinematic.1. Attack Power = 87, AP = 10550, Anti Kinematic = 12272. ( *anti\_damage\_type* \- 1000 ) / 1000, 1227 - 1000 = 227, 227/1000 = .2273. Round ( w*eapon\_damage\_type \* damage\_negation ),* 87 \* 0.227 = 19.749, Round ( 19.749 ) = 204. *attack\_power - mitigated\_damage*, 87 - 20 = 675. *AP - damage\_to\_AP,* 10550 - 67 = 10483 Direct Hit on a staggered enemy relies on the Direct Hit Adjustment. The value is divided by 100 resulting in a percentage. Using the above:1. Direct Hit Adjustment = 1852. *direct\_hit\_adjustment* / 100, *185 / 100 = 1.85*3. Round ( *attack\_power* \* direct\_hit\_percentage ) - *mitigated\_damage, Round ( 87 \* 1.85) = 161, 161 - 20 = 141* 4. 10550 - 141 = 10409.For Energy Firearm Spec (EFS) and melee along with OS Tuning I assume they are applied to the values before calculation but testing is needed. For instance, taking 15% energy along with applicable generator could result in multiplicative or additive damage. Potential formulas:* ( attack\_power \* control\_tuning \* ( EFS / 100 ) ) = true\_attack\_power* ( attack\_power \* ( control\_tuning + ( EFS / 100 ) ) = true\_attack\_powerPlease let me know if you have anything to add / correct, thanks!. Basically title, I was waiting in line for doughnuts and no one was behind me aside from some dude who walked in. I never looked at him. I didn't even know someone else walked in, until the guy started making like groaning/grunting noises like he was constipated. At first I was like whatever, not different to how some people sound at the gym/locker room/bathroom. Then he goes "oh fuck" as I'm putting money in my back pocket. He proceeds to start making the sounds more and mutters some other things under his breath. As soon as some other guy walked in and went to the bakery's kitchen he immediately stops and starts humming. He didn't do it while ordering his doughnuts either.Absolutely disgusting, can't even buy doughnuts in public without feeling like I'm going to get clocked and glocked. Can't imagine how that ogre would of responded if he did notice I was trans or he saw me alone. I'm so grossed out. I swear the dude was practically standing over me. No one noticed of course because why would they. Part of me just wonders what people like him gain from that. Like keeping your weird sexual fantasies involving me to yourself is a bare minimum of decency. Not like I am going to turn around and be like "oh wow, your revolting dying engine for vocal chords is so hot."I'm ranting at this point but I really just can't believe the audacity of doing that with like 15 people around. Never safe I guess.I'm not sure how to articulate this well or flair, so apologies in advance; when/before I started HRT, I was fairly confident at 29, I wouldn't see the results I wanted. I don't know if it's considered part of the dysphoria or if you would consider it body dysmorphia. Still, I generally don't think my frame is very feminine in the usual ways: hips, shoulders, waist, etc. I've worked quite a bit to go from 155 average weight to my now 130, but I still don't feel great some days.Tonight, my SO(cis F) and I were talking. I don't remember why it even came up, but I was overly confident my under-bust/rib cage was a lot larger than hers, at a bare minimum of two inches or more. Much to my surprise, and being 3 inches taller, my underbust is only half an inch bigger than hers. Along with being a 32D after 15 months of HRT, I'm just bewildered. I'm still working to get the physique I want, but I am forced to admit that I have a very fem physique. Whether my brain wants to acknowledge it or not. I can even fit into her corsets that I absolutely could not fit into a year ago.I know I'm pretty fortunate in this regard, and everyone will have different results and whatnot, but I just wanted to share. I'm flabbergasted and very thankful. Hopefully, I can reach 120 ish lbs in a few months. Now, I can't justify most of my feelings about my body, which is pretty validating.So I went to Ren Fair in a lolita red and black gothic dress. It was hotter than heck so I sat outside on a bench fanning myself while my partner was shopping one of the stalls. A few minutes later a guy came sat down on another bench that was next to mine. It was kind of off the path and not in the shade so not the best spot to sit. After like 30 seconds he had mentioned something about loving to see everything and we chatted for maybe a minute before I got up to check on my partner. As I left I said, "Have fun starring at people." Wasn't the best phrasing but in my head it was kind of funny. Then he said something along the lines of me making him sound creepy. Then I just walked away after telling him I was kidding (which he may or may not of believed). It wasn't until after that fact that I realized he was probably trying to approach me and he probably was already worried about coming off as a creep. Poor guy... Anyways I need to be more conscious of that sort of thing and it seemed fun enough to share.For context, I'm a year and a few months on HRT. I still wear a mask because 1. My immune system seems sensitive after wearing one during all of Covid. 2. Hide masc face features. During most of the year, my SO and I have regularly ordered takeout from a local diner. This means most employees have heard all phases of my sometimes okay fem voice and body changes. So I assume me being trans is pretty apparent, and my SO is AFAB and rarely comes with me sometimes, but we always order two meals.I infrequently talk with the manager for a few minutes, and he thinks my name is Will (it's short for my SOs name). The last time I went, he gave me a 25% discount and didn't say anything. The server was like one minute, got him, and he punched some things in on the PoS and left. I was like that's nice of him and tipped the server the discounted amount.Well, last night, we ordered there again. He talked to me for a few minutes, and then the discount was like 50%. I asked him why and he just said, "Because I can," before disappearing into the kitchen after I thanked him. My SO says it's because he thinks I'm hot, obviously. Maybe it's the dysphoria, but I can't think that is the reason, but I don't have a better one. Now I don't know how to proceed. I could let it continue for the cheaper food until he tries to make advances, ghost the place, or ask him not to.Has anyone been in a similar situation or have a better reason why he would start doing this? I wanted some other opinions since I think my SO is biased AF.Edit: Thanks for the responses, a lot of good insight. Going to let it continue unless it gets problematic.. Just found some research stating that estradiol HRT administered orally is not an effective route for those of us who consume nicotine. Essentially the study involves women on HRT, The study goes on to suggest transdermal as the appropriate method of administration. Some caveats:* Study doesn't distinguish if the oral is ingested, buccal or sublingual.* The study suggests transdermal administration but does not elaborate to my knowledge.* May or may not contain trans people.* Most are probably cis postmenopausal but I don't think that is relevant.My thoughts on the study given I couldn't find other studies related to smoking and HRT. Oral E probably shouldn't be the first choice even if using sublingually. Personally I know I do not absorb the entirety of the pills under my tongue and some amount is getting swallowed. In general avoid swallowing E pills. If transdermal is fine I assume any administration avoiding the metabolic system will be fine, including injections. As stated in the study if you are using orally you will have poor intake of the E; however, increasing the dose is not ideal to circumvent the loss of efficacy for a variety of medical reasons. If you have better information on the subject please share.Source: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15638743/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15638743/). Someone had requested a follow-up on the post, and here is that follow-up for what it is worth. Results unsurprisingly show an aversion to touch in general. My intention with the inquiry was to see if any others felt physical pain from specifically affective touch as clinically defined. I didn't want to specify this, though, because I didn't want people to come in and be like hey, me too, to fit in or whatever.In retrospect discussing attachment theory was unnecessary, but that's what happens when your only piece of literature on the subject correlates to something else that probably has no causal relation. I'll probably do more research on it at some point but literature is lacking and I'm not great at parsing scientific journals. Writing posts while high is also not helpful, but here I am again. Here are a few of my takeaways:* Considering most of us who aren't scrolling Reddit while in prison /s have difficulty with interpersonal relations, I find it interesting that most of you know as little about attachment theory as I do. * The densest of you have helped point me towards self-soothing and helping to describe the specific aversion as a physical manifestation of psychosomatic pain. * What I am describing likely has more to do with interpersonal trauma and less with attachment styles, although that interpersonal trauma can feed into attachment styles.* It seems in the ASPD community my situation is an anomaly. I assumed a few would share this characteristic given the trauma component.* For the least dense of you, the armchair autism diagnosis never gets old. Keep up the excellent work.So I made a Grindr account because why not. Not terrible experience overall except way more attention than I am used to but IDK why today is the day of people referring to me CD etc. and here was my latest gem.L4transonly: Ya I have not played with a male yet. Looking for a good partner.Me: Well seeing me as a male is the best way to get yourself blocked so I suppose you will be looking again.L4transonly: \[laughing while crying emoji\] great dodged a bullet.Anywho you would think someone with a name like that wouldn't be a complete idiot. Like its fine to use grindr specifically to meet trans I think? But to be that way and think you are getting laid? I don't get it. Also the presumption I have anything down there that would be of interest is silly. Thinking it functions like a normal peen is silly. Thinking I want to be touched there equally silly.Made me laugh tbh so figured I would share. Also hope you like fucking yourself dude because you gonna be pretty fucking lonely acting like that. Also funny to see this on a LGBT+ dating app,. So I've always had issues with people stroking, petting me repetitively or simply repetitive caressing with a thumb/finger while holding hands. I recently decided to try to research this but I'm not having much luck. I came across disorganized attachment: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026862/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026862/). I didn't know this was a thing. However, my understanding of attachment was that we are generally dismissive avoidant. I don't relate to the disorganized attachment aside from the affective touch issues but relate to many issues in dismissive avoidant. I can't find anything discussing affective touch and dismissive avoidant though.So questions I want to discuss:1. Do you relate to having a negative reaction to affective touch?2. What is your attachment style?3. Do you have any research regarding Dismissive avoidant and affective touch?4. I am not knowledgeable on attachment theory other than the research I did today. Is it possible for people to relate to all attachment styles to varying degrees?Edit: People don't seem to be understanding this, affective touch in the clinical sense. I'm not talking about being touched by someone who is affectionate with you. If you agreed for instance to them holding your hand. That part being totally fine. The issue I am looking into is if they start to like gently rub your with their fingers etc.**Affective touch:** S**lowly moving, low-force mechanical stimulation which is often perceived as pleasant**.Wasn't feeling the best today and made sure to put on one of my more fem outfits and had my SO help me with eyeliner. Didn't do any other makeup or anything but had a mask on while we went to grab some takeout. As we got out of the car some gal with a guy said, "You both are really cute!" and I had an anime moment of my soul leaving my body. As we got to the other side of the street she was on she doubled down and I think her and the guy she was with was trying to get us to go to the bar they were going to.Really made my day but I had zero response and thankfully my SO could carry that conversation. Normally I just put on my 10 year old coat when I go do errands because meh. I tried brushing it off as them just thinking my SO was cute so they complimented us both but then we got to our usual take out place and the owner who is always at the front didn't recognize me at all either. Usually just asks if I'm getting the usual as soon as I get to the counter but there was a pause before he was like, "What can I get the two of you?" Really has thrown me for a loop tbh. I didn't think a little bit of eyeliner would make such a difference.My opinion on Leo Lines: For reference, I purchased a few pairs of the cotton thongs. The price is fine, I would be willing to spend more if the product was worth it but for me, these are adequately priced and a good place to start. The lack of bulge when wearing leggings or sweat pants is nice but the padding in the front is a bit thick and visible with something like lululemon. The trimming isn't ideal either and is a bit uncomfortable, for me at least but maybe my skin is a bit sensitive. Overall, I would purchase again if I didn't have a better option. With that out of the way.Is there a better seller of mtf underwear? Is there a way to make them more comfortable or did you feel like you got accustomed to the lining?As an aside, Etsy decided to start recommending me sissy related items and lingerie "for men". So thanks Etsy, feels great.This doesn't concern introductory first-year courses. I'm coming from a 300 's class, and as I stated in the title, please write better discussion posts. I understand it can be time-consuming or challenging to elaborate on a topic that may not even interest you. However, when another person or I have to respond, it is exceptionally infuriating to find a post that is relevant to the questions being asked.The amount of posts I've read where OP isn't even on topic is astounding. If you are off-topic along with the other 90%, it's near impossible to meet the response criteria. At least mention a specific of the discussion criteria that we can elaborate on in the reply.Sorry for the rant. It's irritating. I spend way more time trying to find a post to reply to than actually writing a response.Edit: I'm not going to bother responding to all this but a few things of note after skimming. I don't care if you write garbage just write it about the topic. This has nothing to do with length, nobody is talking about an essay. If it's short, great as long as it's on topic.I don't like the discussion posts any more than most of you. I dread them because of the waste of time. At a bare minimum don't actively make it worse for your peers.I see a lot of posts on this subject, and I've done my fair share, so I thought I would share my experience.

It may or may not be important to you. If you get a minor, at least nine credits must be taken at SNHU; however, less than 50% can apply to your major. SNHU also requires 30 credits are taken through them for the degree. This means you could potentially only take ten classes with SNHU and do the rest through external sources. Classes also have prerequisites, so it can become challenging to manage which courses need to be completed and time them out. Also, while you do receive credit for the classes, they will not affect your GPA. This means the courses you take with SNHU will weigh heavier on your GPA if you want a high GPAMy experience with these sources can be different than yours. I've found that most can be completed in a week if you are diligent. I don't have any experience with Saylor. I was not too fond that they only provided a textbook and expected you to test it independently.**Sofia:** Courses seem to update their limited classes frequently, so I consider these a high priority. It's hard to argue with the cost; however, they don't provide much for study material. Very independent but worthwhile for the savings. Here is a current list of most of the classes available with their reevaluation date. The courses may still be available after this time.|Sofia Reevaluation List|Hum|SCS||:-|:-|:-||ENG-122: 03/31/24|Art History I: 05/31/24|Macroeconomics: 07/31/22||Eng-123: 07/31/22|Art History II: 04/30/25|Microeconomics: 07/31/22||HIS-100 / US His I: 02/28/23|Ancient Greek Philosophers : 05/31/24|Introduction to Psychology: 10/1/23||HIS-200 / US His II: 05/31/23|Approaches to Studying Religions: 05/31/24|||MAT-243 / Intro to statistics Expiration: 09/30/24|||**OnlineDegree:** Again, the price is exceptional. I don't recall the course I took with them, but I would have taken more if they were available. The test was pretty easy. The only downside is that many of the courses did not apply to my major. Also note that when I took the course, video lessons had to play all the way through to allow moving on.**Study,com:** The price isn't ideal; however, one of the few sources with abundant CS classes. The two-exam limit is a bit of a downer. I appreciate that you can test out many quizzes and the tests are reasonable. It's effortless to get total points for quizzes. This means the final exam only requires a 56% to receive credit. I also like the provided video lessons when available.

This post isn't an exhaustive resource as I had to research a lot of it and still am finding out new information on the subject. If you have any questions or have experience, please share them below! Hopefully, we can use our collective knowledge to help newcomers.Thankfully we don't go out much due to COVID and haven't received any death threats or violence here in South Dakota but the general distaste is palpable. I just started HRT and my hair hasn't grown out much yet. My SO is gender-fluid with short hair and occasionally dresses like a guy. I've been rocking some femme leaning outfits, high-rise jeans, cropped shirts, etc. Aside from people driving past and yelling out random things the funny bit is how cashiers and other service providers act when they see us. Really showing us who's boss by not bagging our stuff or giving us the silent treatment during check out lol. We have gotten eye-rolls and people giving us a wide berth but what are some of the subtle things these people do to try and be disrespectful to you?. I went in for an HRT appointment on March 29th to do the informed consent route. They complimented my cardigan, took my blood, and were incredibly affirming. I wasn't prepared for any of it. As if that wasn't enough, I was told I could leave at the end of the appointment and not to worry about paying. I asked if they were sure and was told, "Yup, we have plenty of funding right now, so feel free just to walk out."My SO teared up. Not used to compassion on any level from anyone outside my SO, and it hurt a bit. For the first time in my life, I feel like I should make a thank you card for the next time I see them. My SO donates to them annually already, so let me know if you have any suggestions on how I can make that doctor's day better on my next visit.I just wanted to share how awesome they were about everything.Edit: Thanks everyone for the conversation and such. I'm glad this has reassured some and that most of you have also had a good experience with them.. # Intro:Sharing how to get the greatsword from start to finish for those struggling and are wanting a braindead strategy. Since I was experimenting with the new sorceries, I did a lot of unnecessary steps. I will follow this on a new character once matchmaking has been tested and verified. This is a bare-bone setup without anything you wouldn't already want going forward.# Pros:* Does not require leveling any weapons* With respec, you can dump the points needed for str into vit or int* Requires minimal spells* Easy to get the required items# Cons:* RNG reliant >! (Although Astel only took me three attempts) !<* Will have to experiment with Meteorite's range* Still will have to dodge a bit* Needs as many flasks as you can, 5-7 Cerulean (FP)* Will want to get as many Golden seeds and Sacred Tears as possible# The Build:|Astologer Class & Stats:|Sorceries|Gear|Flask of Wonderous Physick||:-|:-|:-|:-||Vit: 20+ (Not required)|Meteorite|Meteorite Staff|Magic Shrouding Cracked Tear||Int: 24+ (Twinsage)|Rock Sling|Radagon Icon|Intelligence-knot Crystal Tear||Four spell slots|Carian Slicer|Graven-School Talisman|||Two talismans|Swift Glintstone Shard|Twinsage Glintstone Crown(optional)||# The Strategy:Use wonderous physick, enter the boss room, summon and cast Carian Slicer, Rock Slinger, or Meteorite until dead. It is that simple. Rock Slinger is suitable for staggering most things, although it leaves a bit to be desired if you need to dodge a lot, which is where Slicer comes in handy. Meteorite is for Astel, Starscourge Radahn, and anything else big and chunky. It's basically a downgraded dark bead from DS1. The range is finicky, but you should be able to hit for 2-4k per volley with the proper aim and timing. I found getting close range worked best and not caring about potentially dying. You need to hold the cast to drain all your FP and do the deeps.\---# Early Setup:Hit some Sites of Grace for torrent and get preferred Spirit Ash summon. I used puppies from Stormhill Shack until getting the mimic. If they can hold agro, you will be fine. Upgrade the summons as much as possible. It should be at least +3 before Royal Knight Loretta. Return to Church of Elleh to talk to Ranni. Level Int to 18 before leveling anything else.Then, rush Meteorite staff + Rock Slinger through Dragon Burnt Ruins trap chest to Sellia Crystal Tunnel. You will use this all the way through and get both before fighting anything.Edit: Getting Radagon's Soreseal after the staff and sorcery should prove useful. Currently doing this on a new character.Teach pumpkin head a lesson for being in your way with summons + Rock Slinger and get the Carian Slicer from Sorceress Sellen. Get the Academy Scroll and give it to Sellen for the Swift Glinststone Shard. Go to all the churches for Sacred Tears and find some Golden Seeds. Visit Oridys's Rise for a memory stone. Take the wrong way at Castleward Tunnel, Rock Slinger Margit, for not letting you leave and skip Stormveil Castle because waste of time.# Mid Setup:Next, get the Academy Glintstone Key from behind the dragon and head into the academy. You will want the Graven-School Talisman and Radagon Icon. The Twinsage Glintstone Crown can also be helpful. Red Wolf might be easier to kill with Carian Slicer vs. Rock-Slinger, your choice ultimately.Find the Intelligence-Knot Crystal Tear. Go to Caria Manor and beat up Royal Knight Loretta using Rock Slinger and summons. Honestly, this was probably the worst fight due to getting roll caught. This is when I finally upgraded the summons to +3 and should have done it sooner.Head behind Caria Manor to Royal Grave Evergoal. Show off your Slicer to Alabaster Lord for his Meteorite sorcery (30 Int required). Use your new RNG powers to humiliate Erdtree Avatar (LIURNIA NORTHEAST) for your Magic Shrouding Cracked Tear.# Late Setup:Follow Ranni's questline and profit, there are plenty of guides for this so I will talk about some of the bosses.**Starscourge Radahn:** Hit all the summons and stay off your horse. After the last summon, ride up on torrent and use Rock Slinger. Once he flies off, resummon the ones that died, use wonderous physick, then get off torrent to Meteorite should be able to skip phase 2 with 1 or 2 volleys depending on how well he behaves. Torrent is a detriment in phase 2 due to the homing gravity orbs of sadness. Easier to just dodge if needed while replenishing FP.**Renalla:** Pretty easy with Rock Sling. This is the only time I used an actual weapon because I was too lazy to switch between Rock Sling and Carian Slicer.**Astel:** Not much to say other than it can and probably will one-shot you with less than 30 vit. It went down in 3-4 Meteorites and made me feel like I was in an Isekai.# Final Notes:* Terra Magicus might be useful since you are standing hoping not to get hit, but I didn't bother.* Night Shard is useful for NPC invaders who can dodge other spells. Otherwise, Slicer works well enough.* More FP is useful but not required if you are trying to keep your level low.* I haven't bothered with any consumables. I will probably experiment with those soon.* Cerulean hidden tear later in the game will only make this more hilarious.* The Opaline tear for damage negation might also be viable.* Meteorite of Astel, Comet Azur, or Zamor Ice Storm are probably the only things that can compete with the damage output. All are quite a bit later into the game.# TLDR: If you aren't using Meteorite, you should be.Edit: Route took on a new character. This isn't well formatted as I will probably make a new post with updated information. Should be easy to follow and coincidentally ends before meeting Ranni in Three Sisters.Church of elleh , Gatefront Ruins, Talk to maiden.Dragon ruin, Sellia crystal cave, Staff & Rock Slinger.Sellia Shore should be able to level Int now, Seed on the path to Redmane castle.Sellia shore get seed, Fort Faroth get soreseal and medalion.Third Church of Marika for sacred tear and wonerous physick, teleporter behind church to other seed in caelid. Back to Third Church, fort haight for seed and medalion.Gatefront ruins to Stormhill shack for seed, Church of elleh talk to Ranni get summons, head to Waypoint ruins.kill pumpkin boi, get royal academy scroll before peninsula hit first site of grace.Back to Waypoint for Carian Slicer.Back to Penninsula, get map and golden seed, Oridys's Rise for memory stone.

Need a minimum of 3 Cerulean, beat up Margit.Circle Stormveil from the shack, Church of Irith Sacred Tear, Academy Scroll.Go west and into the lake, get map, academy town seed, hit the site of grace at the academy door.

The ones cause bleed and neither are worth going out of your way for.Back to start of lake llumia following the east, Church of Vows for Magic Glintblade if you want it.Blackknife Catacomb for grave glovewort 3 & 4 back to hold to upgrade puppers.Go back to the academy, golden key, run to the grave-school talisman, kill hell doge. Rock Slinger worked fine. Only needed one attempt mileage may vary.Golden Seed, get Radagon Icon and Twinsage Crown.Academy entrance, examine seal, Bellum Church, up Grand Lift of DectusGolden Seed, Dodge and weave to capital, more golden seeds.Stormcaller Church, Optional Sainted Hero's Grave for Grave Grovewort 5Grab another seed either by the Erdtree or west of the Lift.

Just a reminder that every time you miss an opportunity to further the cause, someone is paying to ensure that you don't get another chance.It's not an all-or-nothing between unionizing and a strike. 10% of the workforce on strike is better than none. Why not ensure both happen. As someone with ASPD, I get how easy it is to assume it isn't or won't affect you or how easy pessimism can set in. Some simple things that every one of us needs to do.* Start Organizing or joining a Union.* Post about it on all social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Insta, etc.)* If you have talents, use them (Youtube, Tik Tok, Infographics, etc.)* Tell everyone you talk to regularly and stress why it's important and how they can help.If a post furthers the goals, then at the bare minimum, upvote it to get as many posts on [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all) as possible, even if you don't entirely agree. More attention is a benefit to everyone. Why care about stupid internet points when your lively hood is on the line. If you are going to comment, provide resources that can benefit everyone. People keep talking about needing to give those on strike with funds. How can we as a collective address this, Reddit strike GoFundMe or a website for donations and application for funds?

Thank you for your time. I am currently in the process of disputing a 0 on a section for a project. This section is for Error Handling, "Code effectively validates user input." I'm curious about your thoughts on the situation. Note that error handling is the rubric requirement, not exception handling.Per our textbook, zyBook 5.1, "Error-checking code is code a programmer writes to detect and handle errors that occur during program execution. An exception is a circumstance that a program was not designed to handle, such as if the user enters a negative height."To further this, Techopedia defines error handling as such: "Error handling refers to the response and recovery procedures from error conditions present in a software application. Error handling helps maintain the normal flow of program execution. Either the programmer develops the necessary codes to handle errors or uses software tools to handle the errors. Error-handling techniques for development errors include rigorous proofreading. Error-handling applications can resolve runtime errors or have their impact minimized by adopting reasonable countermeasures depending on the environment."This is the function I wrote to handle user input error.double checkInput() { double t_userInput; cin >> t_userInput; while (!cin || t_userInput < 0 || t_userInput > 999999999) { cin.clear(); cin.ignore(std::numeric\_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n'); cout << "Please enter valid number." << endl; cin >> t_userInput; } return t\_userInput;}This code prevents 0 in the one instance that divide by 0 can occur.temp = (int)round(checkInput()); m\_incrementYears = (temp != 0) ? temp : 1;Based on my understanding of error handling, these pieces of code detect and handle errors that could occur during execution. The code also helps maintain the normal flow of program execution. I don't think error handling only includes using try/catch statements. This is without getting into the ambiguous requirements of the project. Am I in the wrong here or is the instructor being unnecessarily difficult?Also, because I am a bit spiteful, I'm debating using try/catch in this function for future assignments. Is this a bad idea?. Goal: Complex 3D terrain with small looping caves inside of a forest dungeon instance. Cliffs would surround the forest instance for the out-of-bounds regions.I want to implement a combination of GAN Cyclic Graph Grammar > Point Cloud > Deep marching Cube. Essentially, the Graph Grammar would define points in the 3D space, and the Deep marching Cube would build the terrain mesh after. I've seen the implementation of graph grammar in 2D and also with buildings; however, these approaches don't utilize 3D corridors capable of traversing height. I could use prebuilt pieces to connect areas, but I don't like the idea of making 30+ cave systems just for variety's sake. Think random MHW Ancient Forest if that helps.I really appreciate any help you can provide.

Imagine an actual person with diagnosis’s ASPD and narcissism. They would be literal human garbage, Ted Bundy level. How can you be a social activist while having some of the most outrageous personality disorders lol "Not suggesting to harass this individual just saw this and thought I would share. What a crazy thought that is people with their silly comorbidities and being all Ted Bundy.Our puppy was attempting to to be polite for treats. Considering she also just attempted to chew on my hand seconds earlier I said "As if, you're cute but, not as cute as your mom." In reference to my SO. Then I thought about saying that to an actual kid and gave myself a bit of a chuckle.Edit: For clarification the idea of unintentionally giving my own kid insecurities is what I find amusing about this.This is anecdotal. You may have a different experience. I am going to explain my story. You may find this useful. I would like in return for others who have been diagnosed to share theirs.To preface this I have always felt like a wolf amongst dogs. Same species but different. This is potentially part of the grandiosity however, I felt more evolved than the obnoxious monkeys around me. Two years ago after I yet again burned all bridges including my work relations I decided to find out to what extent that difference is. I eventually thought to comments about my behavior people would say such as "You're kind of a psycho" etc. People drawing comparisons between me and antagonists etc. The more I looked at ASPD the more I found to describe myself including insignificant details such as setting fires in adolescents.On the matter of finding someone to discuss this with you need to understand two things. The first is one ASPD moment does not make you ASPD. ASPD is habitual and a pattern of behavior. If you had some bad thoughts about people who have hurt you welcome to being human. The second is that you will face opposition unless you are being court ordered.It is extremely uncommon for people with ASPD to seek "help" from professionals. I don't know if this changing or if I am that much of an outlier but, this is the expectation that almost all therapists will share. I use language that NTs use to try sound more NT all the time. I understand if someone confronts me about X action then a solid defense is to say that I am feeling a lot of guilt about X action. This language will make the therapists draw the conclusion that you are not ASPD because you shouldn't be there in the first place and now you are speaking on emotional terms. This example is a bit extreme to illustrate what they will hear. They will only care that you just used emotional language. My definition of a friend is a person who either provides entertainment or a purpose. I don't say that to people of course but, the therapist will see the standard use and assume you are not ASPD. For me this was incredibly frustrating. I really had no grasp on how much of my language I used because it was the closest approximation to what conveys meaning to NTsMost therapists have not worked with ASPD and do not know anything outside of what they heard about cookie cutter jailed killers or their holy DSM. Most research is only focused on the incarcerated. I told one therapist I had to attend to my puppy for a moment and her response was "You know ASPD people don't keep dogs they kill them." This is to illustrate how far out of their depths most therapists are. You won't get anywhere with someone like this and they won't be useful.You may also run into therapists who seem open to hearing you out and then after listening to you will understand that you are in fact ASPD and tell you they cannot be of assistance and to find someone else. I found prefacing the discussion with the following to be useful: "I have concluded I have ASPD are you capable of assisting me with X"Last note even if you find an expert they may have little useful information for you. You are an enigma and your problems are going to be outside of their expertise in some situations.TLDR: Most therapists are not capable of assistance with ASPD, some just refuse. Speak to only those with expertise everyone else will waste your time.I have difficulty holding a position for more than a year. Interviews have always guaranteed me the position. Aside from when the employer went with someone with more experience. The last job that I held the owner said he has never hired someone without 3 years of experience, I had 5 months. After by about the year mark I seem to exhaust any empathy and friendliness I generated with co-workers and the employers. I don't think I am behaving any differently most days. I'm not sure if it's small things that build to the inevitable or if they can sense I am off after some time or what. I try to come off as enthusiastic but it's extremely exhausting, especially once I have learned the position and the daily slug of repetitive tasks start.My last employer gave me a 30 minute lecture as to why it was inappropriate to not context an email with **may be**. I said "your client is at risk of heart failure." According to my employer I should of said "your client **may be** at risk of hear failure." I cannot fathom how this simple disclosure was worth 30 minutes of his day considering may be is part of the definition of risk.Any advice is appreciated. I may start seeking psychiatric help soon.To summarize I'll be building a sectional with a chaise. I understand that this is going to be a very extensive project but, that's part of the reason I'm doing it. I've been trying for a few days to find good information and I'm coming up a bit short and was hoping someone could help.I need to purchase wood online being in a smaller town with the only mill working in pine (Black Hills, SD). That being said I'm going for 5/4 soft maple, alder or poplar. I'm just worried that I might need 8/4 for my back and front rail. Also can I rely on the wood I get to be wide enough without knots? Will it be kiln dried from these places? If anyone knows a good site for this I would appreciate it.TL:DR Wood sizes and good online supplier.
    Are there any asian (or general POC) with ASPD here? I’m curious on how it may present itself differently in comparison to white folk— or if your experience was different compared to white people with ASPD.I’d like to preface this post by saying that I am currently writing a Korean american character who has undiagnosed ASPD, and while he generally follows the diagnostic criteria in the DSM5, I feel as though race may play a part in how ASPD is presented within individuals. Thank you.coming from a mercy player here. is it because other healers are “better”?. You know those talk therapies people have where they discover their traumas and figure out why they are the way they are? I would really appreciate something like that especially because I think some of my behaviors aren’t just OCD.I did ERP for a couple of months before and while it was fine I felt like I was missing out on some other stuff.Has anyone gone through therapy that isn’t JUST ERP that is effective? Thank you so much! (I have heard about CBT as well).Title is self explanatory. If I need to add context I'm trying to pirate Omori.I'm still pretty new to the pirating scene--- but I know that with torrents a VPN is recommended(?) but I'm not sure if I should take the cautionary step of getting a VPN for csrinru. Thanks!. Currently identifying as f(18), I’ve occasionally thought about presenting masc. I think it was more of a fun experiment and like a “what if I tried looking like an attractive guy” (it was a trend on YouTube), and occasionally I would ponder on the idea of being a guy but it wasn’t anything super profound(?). I have been very comfortable and embraced my femininity and female identity— but recently I’ve been thinking about what it would be like to be perceived as a guy— but rather through my voice rather than my appearance.Of course I love sounding feminine too, but sometimes I want to have a lower vocal range/sound masc. Maybe genderfluid? I don’t really know— but I’m afraid this is a phase/seeking for attention/seeing transgender as a “trend.” Thoughts?. I don’t know what these bumps are on the back of my hand 100% but they look like flat warts, and I’m worried I’ll spread it to my roommates. Especially showering and having them touch things that I have.I honestly don’t know what I should do 🧍‍♂️ I want to talk to a dermatologist soon to officially figure out what’s on my hand but idk I need advice maybe? Unless this is a chance to practice ERP..Does anyone else have this problem? Taiko Pop Tap (the app from apple arcade) keeps loading and then giving me a black screen. I have already contacted support and I have tried restarting my phone, redownloading the game by:a) deleting b) offloading I know other people have this problem but I haven’t gotten any successful solutions. Please help!!I have an iPhone 12 and I’m currently running iOS 15.6 (latest). First and foremost— I am not trying to seek for reassurance/diagnosis.I wanted to know if anyone on this subreddit has OCD and ASPD and could describe what it’s like to have it, how you figured out you have both, and/or what is different about solely having OCD vs OCD+ASPD. I am currently working through a lot of emotions and introspection and wanted to know if I relate to people that have other disorders outside of OCD— specifically those with ASPD+OCD— although I don’t mind people sharing their experiences/two cents about other disorders and comobordities. For background I have been diagnosed with ADHD and OCD. Thank you!. Before I start, I want to preface that I am NOT advocating for academic dishonesty.So a quick background:For admissions I was tasked with submitting a portfolio that consisted of 8-12 pieces. I did get accepted into this college somehow, and I was ecstatic. I came to the realization that I may be guilty of academic dishonesty, however, and it does have to do with my portfolio.I used to have an art teacher that has this habit of fixing/altering my art once I was finished with them...? I would say it's around 10-20% of the art piece, but as the artist I can definitely tell a difference between my art and the piece after my teacher finished with the "touch-ups."I ended up submitting 3 pieces out of the 9 (I believe) that my teacher interacted with. 1 of them is arguably the most noticeable in my opinion, while 2 of them are very minor. I ended up erasing and redrawing an aspect in my drawing that my teacher did for me (for one of the 2 pieces with the minor changes), but I'm not sure if that's enough.I want to tell my admissions counselor or the school. I plan on making my own pieces and replacing them but I already took out loans and I'm financially stuck to this college now and I'm terrified I'll be expelled before I even get to attend.I need advice! Please help! Quick EDIT: I also have some sketches in my portfolio that I did in my art teacher's classroom. I think they were all done by me but it could be possible that my art teacher attempted to fix them as well.. I’m doing a project for a class and I decided to talk about censorship in Japan— both to the citizens and the global public. I have a good feeling that generally a lot of people in America have little to no knowledge on the political tension between Japan and several countries— and the face of Japan has become anime and other sources of media. I wanted to make a theory/thesis that anime has contributed to (and maybe even directly utilized) to distract the public from Japan’s corrupt government and controversial history. I would love to hear what other people think of this— and if you have any sources/links please comment them below!. To preface, I am a first generation Korean American. My parents are both Korean and they own a dry cleaning business. I’m currently writing a story, (to be honest it’s more of world-building), and I have a small cast of characters in a zombie apocalyptic scenario. One of them is a Korean immigrant who came to America. He’s a dad with a kid that got infected. I was working on his backstory, and I thought it might be interesting to give him a job in dry cleaning— not only because I roughly understand the dry cleaning business, have a personal connection with my parents owning a dry cleaning business, and to make a social statement about the trend in careers with POC/immigrants. Though I understand there are several factors, I suspect immigrants in America are statistically more likely to have certain jobs due to the systemic oppression and unavailable resources to get a higher education. My parents have worked hard to put me where I am. They didn’t imagine to be where they are today. They are *people* with ambitions. They don’t like to work a mundane and repetitive job that’s physically taxing. They do it to be able to put food on the table and a roof over our heads. I suppose that is the message I want to convey. It’s not necessarily a brand new idea, but I don’t see it in media often. (Maybe I don’t consume enough media). I’m also aware that asians working/owning a dry cleaners is a stereotype, and I don’t want to contribute to that— thus coming to my conundrum. What are your guys’ thoughts?. When Il-nam was on top of the stack of beds yelling “stop it I’m scared,” he was talking to the masked soldiers because he didn’t want to die in the chaos.Idk if this was obvious but my mom pointed it out and I can’t stop thinking about it.여름에 한국에 여행을 하기로됐어요. 한국에 갈만하는데 뭐 있어요? 제작년에 가봐서 제주도, 명동이랑 인천은 가봤어요. 이테원 가보고 싶은데… 재밌어요? 먹을거도 레코멘드 할수있으면 얘기해주세요. 감사합니다 :). I know how to say anxious and to be worried, but what is the medical term for anxiety in Korean?. Hello! I’m a first generation Korean American. I joined this subreddit because I thought I could learn more Korean but I’m not sure if this is the right place.I’ve lived speaking Korean my entire life, and I can confidently say that I’m fairly fluent. I can read proficiently and I can hold a conversation. However, it’s hard to keep up with Korean in America— especially in a white neighborhood with little to no POC (nonetheless Korean speakers). I’m in a place where I can relatively understand Korean— but I’m not sure how to really learn more? I read Korean manhwa on occasion but other than that I don’t know how to really learn, and language apps don’t really help since I’m kind of ahead of that.I’m curious to see your guys’ favorites/least favorites. I’ve only dated/married Shane, so I don’t really have much say in this.I was playing a game and something really good happened, and I got really excited. I started to stim (shaking my fists side to side near my face). I was aware that it was stimming, and I’m not sure if it was involuntary or voluntary. (I just remember feeling really happy). I don’t know if I naturally stim. I’m pretty sure I stimmed that day after seeing videos about stimming, and I’m very ashamed because now I feel like I was just trying to be “quirky” or something. I’m pretty sure I did it more than once, and I don’t know if I still do it.Has anyone else consciously/unconsciously stimmed here?. I know the definition. I understand, but sometimes I feel like certain thoughts don’t traditionally fit the definition but are still intrusive.So I’m starting a new game because I wanted to start fresh. I know what I’m doing now, and I can have a better run. What I’m worried about is which bachelor to go after. I really like Shane, and to be honest I’m not that interested in the others. I married him in my old game, but I deleted the file .What I’m worried about is the moral side of going after Shane? I’m not really talking about being afraid of having a savior complex, but more so going after someone that clearly wants to be left alone. I’m probably putting too much meaning into a video game, but it does matter to me.So before I even get into my diagnosis how are psychiatrist meetings typically supposed to go? I think because of COVID my psychiatrist appointment was forced to go virtual— and I ended up having to call the psychiatrist instead of meeting in person. It felt a bit informal from the get-go (probably because it was on a phone call), and I didn’t even get told what I have until I asked directly. They just prescribed me some medication.I asked the doctor if I had OCD, and they told me I had generalized anxiety disorder and that I’m “pure O.” They said that I had to have compulsions or else I don’t have OCD. Isn’t pure O a form of OCD? I eventually told the psychiatrist about my persistent need to wash hands— but idk if that’s an OCD thing bc it’s usually only triggered when I go to the bathroom or touch something gross/dirty or think I touched something weird.Hey! I don’t know who to tell this to so why not turn to reddit because I am cool. So this was a while ago, but it resurfaced in my brain and I feel like I should confront it. Like the title states, my sibling just randomly asked me who my “ugliest” or “least attractive friend” was. I wasn’t comfortable with answering at first— but they kept asking me so I felt compelled to answer so they would stop asking me. At least I’m pretty sure that’s what happened (it was a while ago).I ended up answering truthfully, and said a friend’s name that is very dear to me. I regret saying anything or answering at all, and I feel really guilty. Appearances doesn’t matter to me at all, and it has never gotten in the way of my friendship. I love my friend to bits, and I feel awful for what I said. Should I tell my friend? What do I do.
    I took MDMA a recent bit ago with my girlfriend. Was a very lovely time. I was wondering how 2c-b would compare in terms of empathogenic effects, or euphoria? Is the euphoria reliable? I'm also curious how the visuals are, as I know high dose MDMA, as well as MDA visuals tend to be realistic, cartoonish, and just all around beautiful.I'm also curious what a good first time dose for me would be if I'm looking for a dose that would be beautiful visually as well as euphoric. Here are the highest doses I've taken for a few chemicals (that I have done several times before).LSD - 300μgMushrooms - 4 gramsWeed edibles - 50 mg oilMDMA - 150 mgDXM - 700 mgBesides these heroic doses, I've also had experience with LSA,4-aco-dmt,MDA,ketamine,5-meo-mipt, and DMT, as well as some over the counter medications and some scheduled prescription anxiety medications.guys my friend did xtc 125 times in the span of four days do you think he'll be okay!! edit 1: what do you mean he has brain damage? will he be okayedit 2: we took him to a psychedelic therapist. he's doing good.edit 3: he redosed again on 800mg? any help guys?In all seriousness, please stop. The answer is yes.When I took DXM, DXM pretty reliably induces euphoria, right, but LSD is obviously a pretty challenging psychedelic. Does taking them both reliably induce euphoria and a "good trip", as DXM does, or does your headspace greatly influence whether or not you'll have a good experience?. Some background: I have helped people emotionally my whole life. Kids, littles, and I particularly have a lot of experience helping borderlines with their feelings. I find them very easy to support because I don't think it takes much if you know what's going through their heads. I'm a veteran caretaker and protector alter from before my system integrated, for context.I have been dealing with SO many emotional people recently that it's starting to piss me off, particularly borderlines. I feel like they're being dramatic and stupid and self destructive and it's odd to say that I feel responsible for these people even though I know I'm really not. It's so hard for me not to tell them to just shut up and stop whining and deal with it. Does anybody else experience this?. I've heard some people say shame does no good, and I can agree, but the thing is that I sometimes feel like fear of judgement is the only thing that's stopping me, and deprogramming myself makes me do anything I want to. Now, this sounds good on the surface, but this is creating lasting holes in my relationships and my life, even though I believe it is a step in the right direction. I fail to see how asserting and protecting yourself by any means you have necessary would be considered bad, but some people seem to disagree.Regardless of this, I still feel as though I do feel a limited amount of remorse but am generally able to talk myself out of it by rationalizing.What do you guys think?. This is the r/researchchemicals jerk subreddit. I am bipolar and I am in the process of being taken off of lithium carbonate. ( (450mg morning+450mg night) -> (450/300) -> (300/300) -> (cold turkey) )Currently I have not taken my lithium in about a week and was wondering how long I should go without it to trip on psychedelics? I know life threatening seizures are very much a real risk when lithium is still in my system.I am also being put on Lamotrigine, a bipolar medication that also makes it harder to have seizures. If anybody has any insight or any resources to this then I'd like to know.(i took about 50 dollar store gelcaps and this is several hours into the experience when plat 3 happens)it was pouring rain outside in what i thought was a hotel room at the edge of the universe listening to the dark side of the moon and my ceiling light turned into a dragon and came towards me at full speed. also, my phone was falling down in my hand, even though it was completely still, and my ego died as i sat in my bed for what felt like two days tripping balls.10/10 experience. Let me preface this by saying I love my mom to death, even if she's acting a little different.Me and my mom have been very close my whole life and she is generally pretty fine with me going out with whoever as long as she knows what's going on. I'm a good kid as an honors senior in high school that gets good grades and generally has a bright future.Another thing to note is that this year, I am coming out of my shell quite a bit and it is very rewarding. I have made quite a few friends this year and I actually got another boyfriend and I am talking to another girl to become my girlfriend in addition to the boyfriend I have had since last January. (I'm polyamorous and everybody's cool with everybody else).While this is happening, I'm almost an adult (I turn 18 this Thursday) and I'm out quite a bit. While I'm supposed to be at my mom's, my mom has noticed that I'm moving away soon and has made it clear to me making comments such as "you guys are abandoning me *laugh*" and stating that both me and my little brother shouldn't go out with friends as much anymore because she wants to see us, which she's never had an issue with before. Also, when we're supposed to go back to my dad's at 6pm, she has said recently that we should wait until 6:30, another half hour, or sometimes until 7pm to go back under the pretext of spending more time together.I love my mom, but this just feels forced. Any advice? Thanks.I have had quite a few mental health issues and specifically trauma disorders, in my childhood, seemingly for no reason as I could not remember any trauma until around last summer. Last summer, I remembered getting raped by an abuser in my early childhood, causing me to develop long term depersonalization-derealization and dissociative identity disorder.I have unfortunately remembered another incident in my early childhood, which I'll now recount. This is disturbing, reader discretion advised.I remember once I was with my grandparents on vacation, of whom are both Mormons. My immediate family is exmormon and my extended family are all current mormons, so to be polite to my grandparents me and my immediate family went to mormon church this one day.If you didn't know, Mormon church schedules usually start with a sermon called sacrament, then you go to a classroom to learn about god and afterwards you're in another smaller bible study room, usually led by various parent volunteers.During the classroom time or the study time, I remember I asked to go to the bathroom, and for some reason one of the middle aged gentlemen teaching the class followed me there. I think this kind of supervision is actually somewhat normal in the mormon church but what follows is certainly less ethical. I remembered this man following me into the single use boys restroom and he pulled down the baby changing station. I don't remember the next few minutes, but I do remember him afterwards wiping toilet paper between my legs and on my butt wiping it off. I think I may have been raped again.TL;DR more memories. I have a modded minecraft world with a few hundred mods and I've played modded minecraft for seven years or so, so it's usually pretty easy or possible to fix crashes, but this one has me completely stumped.There are a few ticking block entities in my world, which are draconic evolution reactors. I removed them manually from my first backup but that caused the world to become corrupted. This would be an issue but I had another backup, so it's all good. I used McEdit 2.0 to manually remove these blocks, but I still receive the crash as upon the world launches up because the removed ticking blocks are automatically regenerated upon the world being booted.Attached in the comments is the crash report and an mcedit 2.0 screenshot of the ticking blocks that cause the world to crash that are automatically regenerated upon the world being loaded up.Quitting Benadryl is so hard initially but it feels better after a week or so and it slowly gets better. 1 month clean off an addictive drug I used weekly/biweekly is giving me noticeable improvements in my life and I am so glad I don't need to feel horrible like I was when I did Benadryl.I am going to be intentionally vague about this because I don't know who could see this. Hi, I'm a teenager in my late teen years. I still live at home and I have many dissociative issues such as long term depersonalization and dissociative identity disorder due to an abuser in my home from my early childhood.The other day, (I believe around two weeks ago to be exact), I was masturbating, and I touched my breast accidentally in a very specific spot, and I got a familiar feeling I'd had most of my childhood whenever I'd accidentally touched the same spot. It was just an uncomfortable feeling. It felt like a flashback or something as I had memories of being touched there. I stopped and cried for hours afterwards. I felt like my whole body image and its issues were just that I was to be used and then thrown aside, or my only use was for sex. Recently, I've been having dreams that I've been in sexual situations with the abuser from my early childhood, but I don't know if it was really them and I'm scared of accidentally falsely accusing somebody. I guess I'm just not sure where else to turn. This whole thing is really scary. I think I might've repressed a few memories, or I'm not really sure what's going on. Has anybody else here experienced anything like this?. I have like 21 followers why. I experience delusions of persecution during my episodes and they're very strong when they come. I think everybody is trying to kill me and when they tell me they love me or are scared or that I should get some sleep, I think they're lying, manipulating me, or trying to make me sleep so they can kill me, respectively. I take quetiapine fumarate (seroquel) and that helps and is noticeably worse when I'm off my meds. Do you guys have any ideas on whether or not this could be psychosis, bipolar, or just delusions? I'm a little lost. Thanks.I'm extremely bored right now. I'm on suicide watch at home and I can't play with my friends. I can't do school work. I can't leave the room without a parent. I can't use knives or scissors. What the fuck do I do while I'm bored here 😭. /uj I understand the sentiment, but come on, isn't that kind of insensitive to what I'm going through?. some of y'all are so ugly and i'm tired of pretending that you guys are pretty. I'm a trans girl and I have quite a few cis girl friends. Is this a normal consensus or are they outliers?.
    Hi. I just wanted to see ask how many of the level4 modules you must have to do level 5 courses. I'm thinking of applying for RPL. Hello I was curious as to whetherr or not occupational therapy might help someone with aspd. I don't know anything about occupational therapy but I got referred to one by a psychiatrist. I'm especially interested if it can help someone be less impulsively irresponsible. I have code to open a file QFile file(fileNames\[fileLoop\]);but it gives me an unknown type name even though I added the #include<QFile> Directive. I'm from Joburg but I went to stay in Cape Town for the past few years.I'm back here and I really want to go out but the friends I have just keep going to Greenside and I find it so boring there. The clubs I remember when I was here were ToyToy and Truth but people were going there in high school and I don't want to groove with teenagers. I don't want to go to Onyx or Tabbo but not even google will help me out here.I really want to go to some nice clubs (not bars or lounges) That'll play music like Drake and stuff. Anyone have some suggestions? Preferably in the north but maybe also the west.Hello.I'm new to android studio and I am trying to do a simple tutorial of jetpack compose and I have spent about 6 hours just dealing with fixing issues and updating files and running builds that can go on for thirty minutes and I've only written 2 lines of code from my tutorial. I can't get anything done and it is frustrating. I want to work on my projects but I've spent 99% just dealing with this environment. How can I get this to stop? I am absolutely hating working with this IDE. HelloI 24M ,5,7", 63kg, black got a nose piercing a 2 years ago and when they did it I felt weak, nauseous, I was sweating and this also happened when I got stitches on my wrist 5 months ago and when they took them out. I seemed to find out about Vasovagal or ‘reflex’ Syncope on google. I want to change my nose stud and pierce my own ears but I'm scared that I might have this reaction or is it not so bad in the ear? Any advice on what I can do?. Hi I’m currently on an ssri called Citalopram(Celexa) and I really want to trip on acid and shrooms. Every time I’ve taken Molly or shrooms while on this I don’t get much of an effect. Could I maybe take molly the day before the acid and shrooms to get my serotonin low so then maybe it’ll work? Any tips to help me trip will be appreciated.I have single variable calc skills and basic data structures knowledge what can I do to get into post quantum cryptography and quantum cryptography and to know which is better for the quantum age. (21m) 5ft8 64kg wants to take psychedelics but I am on an ssri. I love psychedelics and I was wondering if I skip a dose of my ssri and take Molly I know I won’t really trip on the Molly but I will have the depression the next day. My question is if I do this and take other psychedelics like acid or shrooms the next day will I be able to trip? I’m thinking of this cause I feel like my serotonin will be nice and low. Please don’t tell me how unsafe this can be safety is not my concern I just want to know if this can work.
    Need to vent, sry if this the wrong placeI was diagnosed with conduct disorder end ADHD at 15-16 years(I’m 20 now). Got treatment fore both end put on medication fore my ADHD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy barely worked fore me, I just know how to behave better end not self-destruct as much. But instead of taking my anger out on others I turned to self harm, end got addicted to it. At that point is just ridiculous The psychologist I have now can’t really fugue out where too start with me. Like I can’t continue going to him without getting a diagnose. But if stope going to therapy i literally forget how too not do stupid shit end like care fore others. Like it just doesn’t make sense. I’m an adult who pays bills end cut her self because my body dysmorphia get worse. I swear I don’t want too deal with this anymore, I’m tried.
    So I’m a guy in his mid 20s and my background is narcissistic sort of because my dad is a text book narcissist left us when I was about 10. Had other family members that were narcissistic, cold, self obsessed, paranoid, and apathetic. The thing is I want to be a narcissist because I want to use people and I try to be the worst person ever and i probably don’t have empathy. But I hate it when so much of the world is narcissistic and when others are more successful narcissists it makes me mad. Obvs idk if I am a narcissist. I might be a covet one. My self esteem is extremely low and I hate it I want others to love me and admire me. I have a girlfriend and my mental state has been ruining it. I started to believe she’s a narcissist and I’ve been horrible to her and do I feel bad? No. I cheated on her just so that if she ever betrays me I’ve done it first. I’ll call her out on being a bad person even though she does everything in the house, she cooks, cleans, etc I don’t do anything. I’ll manipulate her, make her feel shit on purpose, if we get into an argument I’ll say the worst things to her and I don’t feel any remorse and I’m proud of it. But the one thing I don’t want people to use me I’m not getting mugged off I rather be the one that uses people. All my life I’ve dealt with messed up people, I’ve had murderers, ex gangsters close to me that are bad men and then there’s me who’s such a pussy my own father is probably embarrassed. I didn’t lose my virginity until I was 23 because I couldn’t talk to girls, and when I could I couldn’t get hard because of the fear of it. I was thinking about it 24/7 my friends made me feel shitty about it and trying to embarrass me infront of girls, I had to leave all my friends. But some of them admired me and looked up to me, even feared me because they saw through me. I’m no longer a virgin but it’s not fixed me. I still get periods when I’m socially anxious and quiet. I still feel worthless at times even though I thought losing it will fix me. And even though I’m so vulnerable and feel so weak people tell me I come across as confident even too confident, vain and cocky.I feel like I’m going through narcissistic collapse I can’t have people look down on me or put me down I’m better then that. I missed the days when I had people that would buy into my persona, but currently I just have my girl who I suspect is a covert narcissist (her family is very narcissistic, and even more ASPD, they’re literally a mafia but somehow they accepted me in and even though they do horrible things to others, they treat me reasonably) but I don’t have close people other than her and I feel so shit. Her family are too much for me so I don’t count that I have them. I want to be the main focus of my social circle. I cheated on her and if anyone found out they’d kill me and that’s the only thing that worries me I don’t feel bad.I don’t know what to do with my life, am I just extremely insecure and anxious or am I a covert narcissist? My empathy died out completely and I’m glad I don’t want to feel bad for others but as kid I was so sensitive and empathetic but things changed me. I don’t know but I just feel like running away abroad.So I’m a guy in his mid 20s and my background is narcissistic sort of because my dad is a text book narcissist left us when I was about 10.

I don’t know but I just feel like running away abroad.I’m a male in my mid 20s and I know I have a lot wrong with myself and I’m having a phone call with a mental health practitioner on Monday.I know I have had some childhood trauma, my dad is a narcissist he doesn’t care about anyone but himself, never been close with him, violent, etc. not really in my life much but I know it’s affected me a lot and I sometimes use that an excuse for my horrible behaviour.I know I’m either NPD or BPD. I like people adoring me, I like being the centre of attention, I want a small group of people and me being the centre of it. I have grandiose fantasies and I want people to adore me, fear me and sometimes even hate me. Like for example with people like Donald trump people adore him and also some hate him. I’m in a relationship for about 2 years and she is codependent and she thinks I used to be better but got depressed and that caused me to become selfish and horrible. But in reality that is the true self that probably started to come out. I treated her friends badly because I was jealous and didn’t like her giving attention to any other males other than me. It made me anxious and I get fear of abandonment. So yeah I am a bad partner but I don’t care about it that much. I know I try to lower my girlfriends self esteem, I hate it when she gets attention from guys it literally makes me mad. I think I have no empathy I used to when I was a young kid but that empathy has died. Even though I have this jealousy and fear of her cheating on me and leaving me I still want attention from other girls. I even cheated on her twice because I met girls from tinder and I met her after it and she had no idea, and I feel no guilt. If anything it made me feel better because atleast if she does it I’ve done it already. The thing is alot of it is about girls. In high school I was a bullied guy, short, socially awkward no girls were interested in me. After high school I became different, dress extremely well look after myself became better socially and I became better with girls. I do come of as too cocky sometimes though. I do try and get sympathy though so I’ll do fake vulnerability to get people to feel sorry for me. With males I have had childhood best friends that were themselves narcissistic that I had to abandon because they would sometimes make me seem weak infront of girls and I didn’t feel sad even though we had good memories I think I did the right thing because I know I can’t associate myself with people that might make me look weaker or less than them. So I’m aware that I probably don’t have much empathy, I am self obsessed, I am extremely insecure but also at times very confident. And this self esteem issues manifests in mood swings sometimes I feel so weak like a ugly no one sometimes I feel like the top dog. Reason why I think I might be BPD is because my self esteem really depends on girls attention and if a girl shows me love I feel great but if my girl seems to not care much about me it hurts me a lot. I want to speak to the therapist about it but I want to stir them to the right disorder. I would much rather be NPD than BPD because BPD just seems like a cringe teen girl disorder. I rather be someone malicious, apathetic,cold and even feared because it helps me with my inner feelings of weakness so I think if I get diagnosed as BPD it will hit my ego alot. Can people relate.I’m a male in my mid 20s and I know I have a lot wrong with myself and I’m having a phone call with a mental health practitioner on Monday.I know I have had some childhood trauma, my dad is a narcissist he doesn’t care about anyone but himself, never been close with him, violent, etc. not really in my life much but I know it’s affected me a lot and I sometimes use that an excuse for my horrible behaviour.I know I’m either NPD or BPD.

I’m in a relationship for about 2 years and she is codependent and she thinks I used to be better but got depressed and that caused me to become selfish and horrible. But in reality that is the true self that probably started to come out. I treated her friends badly because I was jealous and didn’t like her giving attention to any other males other than me. It made me anxious and I get fear of abandonment. So yeah I am a bad partner but I don’t care about it that much. I know I try to lower my girlfriends self esteem, I hate it when she gets attention from guys it literally makes me mad. I think I have no empathy I used to when I was a young kid but that empathy has died. Even though I have this jealousy and fear of her cheating on me and leaving me I still want attention from other girls. I even cheated on her twice because I met girls from tinder and I met her after it and she had no idea, and I feel no guilt. If anything it made me feel better because atleast if she does it I’ve done it already. The thing is alot of it is about girls. In high school I was a bullied guy, short, socially awkward no girls were interested in me. After high school I became different, dress extremely well look after myself became better socially and I became better with girls. I do come of as too cocky sometimes though. I do try and get sympathy though so I’ll do fake vulnerability to get people to feel sorry for me. With males I have had childhood best friends that were themselves narcissistic that I had to abandon because they would sometimes make me seem weak infront of girls and I didn’t feel sad even though we had good memories I think I did the right thing because I know I can’t associate myself with people that might make me look weaker or less than them. So I’m aware that I probably don’t have much empathy, I am self obsessed, I am extremely insecure but also at times very confident. And this self esteem issues manifests in mood swings sometimes I feel so weak like a ugly no one sometimes I feel like the top dog. Reason why I think I might be BPD is because my self esteem really depends on girls attention and if a girl shows me love I feel great but if my girl seems to not care much about me it hurts me a lot. I want to speak to the therapist about it but I want to stir them to the right disorder. I would much rather be NPD than BPD because BPD just seems like a cringe teen girl disorder. I rather be someone malicious, apathetic,cold and even feared because it helps me with my inner feelings of weakness so I think if I get diagnosed as BPD it will hit my ego alot. Can people relate.For the longest time I knew I needed therapy and that there is something wrong with me. I’m in my mid 20s and my father is a narcissist and I guess things in my life messed me up. I have been messing up in life a lot and I don’t know what will come out in therapy. Am I a narcissist? Psychopath? Borderline? I guess I’ll find out. Spoke to a general doctor and they know I’ve called in before regarding depression and anxiety and had a little chat with my doctor. She said it could be something to do with my personality because I have a loving girlfriend and good job. The only reason I don’t think I’m a psychopath is because I can be very anxious. I’m up and down a lot when I’m down im socially anxious and quiet even awkward. But also I can be very charismatic and good at social interactions if I put my head into it and I feel good about myself. I have a lot of vulnerability, I’m scared of being seen weak, incompetent or worse compared to a different man especially when it comes to women and my girlfriend. She needs to think I’m the top man. I’m very scared of being abandoned or betrayed. But at the same time I don’t think I have much guilt or empathy. I’m scared of being hurt in that way but I can do it to someone else without feeling awful about it. I might feel shame, disgust in regards of myself and I realise I’m treating others badly but I wouldn’t say I feel actually bad for doing those things just feel disgust but I’m not sad about it. I always seem to be able to make people feel for me. I’ll do some bad things and then make it out like I did it all because I’m sad and miserable and that way I get peoples sympathy so that they try and stick around. Like with my girlfriend I want myself to be her everything I don’t want her to get any attention. The only attention she gets I want it to be from me. I want me to be the main thing in social events not her. But then I want attention from other girls but I get very jealous and paranoid about her with other guys and accuse her of wanting attention from other men even though she says she’s never been like that. My happiness depends on how I view our relationship but also this relationship is so one sided, she does everything for me I do nothing for her. That’s why idk if this could be BPD because I’m just so obsessed with myself and when I feel like we are good and she loves me I am happy but also I’ll just talk about myself and feel good about myself. But also I’ll get a kick out of getting compliments from other people and if I feel bossy at work and important as if I’m the boss I’ll feel great about it. I feel great when I’m adored by others, feared by others and more powerful by others. I realise I might be an awful human being, I’m manipulate and stuff but I don’t even care about it. I’m just scared about myself being to hectic and impulsive like if I’m sad I’ll just start drinking or doing drugs and end up doing bad things like breaking car mirrors or breaking windows to show others how much I’m hurting. I have moments when I feel like I’m the lowest human being, I’m unable to be successful, I’m worthless, I won’t achieve anything everyone’s better and I’m just so weak. But also I get moments when I feel great about myself, feel like I can achieve anything, I will be successful others look up to me and want to get my approval. Do you people relate to me?.

But also I get moments when I feel great about myself, feel like I can achieve anything, I will be successful others look up to me and want to get my approval. Do you people relate to me?. Im in my 20s and my life is constantly up and down. For couple weeks I’ve been so down, which makes me miserable, my confidence is low I feel so alone. Feel like I can’t do anything wrong. But these past two days I’m finally high again like this feeling amazing about myself. I can get everyone to like me I’m doing amazing at work and I feel like I’m on top again. The thing is I have been down for couple weeks and I’ve done some stupid things, got drunk went on a rampage upset my girlfriend, etc. When I’m so down I get jealous and I fear abandonment from my girlfriend and I think I might have BPD and NPD. I feel a bit bad that I upset my girlfriend so much like she said I made her feel crazy and I haven’t treat her well. The thing is she is like my safety from being lonely but I don’t know if I am BPD because even though I fear losing her I want to see her as below me. I want me to be the main person. I don’t think I have much empathy and I can be very cold and callous. Like I try and lower my girlfriends self esteem on purpose I feel more in power that way. If she feels amazing about herself she might cheat or leave me. I want to be the confident one and atm everyone’s liking me so much like it’s crazy I must be charismatic when I’m in a good mood like this. The thing is I am unstable and I will drop back down and I think it’s to do with my self esteem.My dad is a narcissist do you guys relate with me. I know I have either BPD or NPD but I’m starting to think I have both.I’m in my mid 20’s and I have some issues which I tried to find out as much about it as possible by myself and I’ve came to the conclusion that I probably suffer from NPD. I’m going to be contacting therapist and I want to tell them of my suspicions and I want to see if people agree with it. When I was a young teen I thought I was bipolar due to my mood swings but after researching and reading on this stuff I’ve noticed that it’s my self esteem that fluctuates. When I feel low about myself I’m shy, depressed, socially anxious and awkward. And when I feel highly of myself I’m cocky, confident, outgoing and I just feel euphoric I feel like a king. And often it depends how people perceive me. It’s like I want people to fear me as that means they see me as scary, powerful which gives me more control and they see me as more powerful than them. I don’t care about being seen as nice or good in fact usually I don’t want people to think these things of me because I don’t want to be too nice so that people use me. When I was a kid and a teen I was completely awkward and socially anxious and I hated myself for it. Can’t stand it and I could never go back to it because I hated what I was. It’s like now I’ve revamped myself, go to the gym, wear expensive clothes and jewellery and people complement me saying I look like a drug dealer and stuff. Like people know my obsession with my appearance and I love it. I’ve also become more confident than what I was when I was younger so I can talk to others and feel a lot less awkward. So it does feel like my old self is kind of dead and I’m glad about it because I hated it. I’m scared of being the same I was when I was a kid and teen I want nothing to do with that pussy. At work I’m quite and shy even awkward but at home I’m confident and cocky. At work I don’t seem to believe in myself because it is a good job so I struggle because I’m worried that I’m not good enough for it. But outside of work I brag about my job. I’ve got a good girlfriend she does a lot for me cares a lot about me which is good. I have a reputation of being a jealous, possessive and a controlling boyfriend to some degree. I want all of my girlfriends attention I want me to be all her life. And I think I’ve been able to achieve that. I can be toxic in a way because I am worried that she’ll leave me so I try to sort of lower her self esteem, for example when a friend of mine tells me something good about my girlfriend I’ll usually assess it if I should tell her or not depending on how that will benefit me and I don’t want her self esteem to be high so I won’t tell of anything good my friends say about her. I’ve gotten into troubles with people due to the way I act. I don’t know if I have empathy or not but I think mostly it’s shut off. I want for people to love me but most of the time I don’t believe it and I’m suspicious. But then I make out to people that everyone loves me. I’m confident and cocky but at the same time I’m shy and socially awkward depending on how I feel about myself. I’m assuming this is narcissism? I know my dad is a narcissist.I’m in my mid 20’s and I have some issues which I tried to find out as much about it as possible by myself and I’ve came to the conclusion that I probably suffer from NPD.

I’m confident and cocky but at the same time I’m shy and socially awkward depending on how I feel about myself. I’m assuming this is narcissism? I know my dad is a narcissist.I’m glad 25 and pretty sure I’m some kind of a narcissist. My dad is a narcissist and a sociopath however he left home when I was around 10.I have these crazy mood fluctuations where one day I feel so weak, like a no one, feel like the most socially awkward person in the world. When I’m so low I can’t even have grandiose fantasies because they don’t hit the same. When I was a kid and a teenager I was in this state constantly. Since becoming an adult I got a lot more confidence changed up my style so I don’t look like that weak kid anymore I look like a coke dealer probably but people notice my style and everyone knows that I’m obsessed with expensive clothes and jewellery. When my mood is up I feel great I talk a lot, laugh a lot and I can be quite horrible to people. When I’m in this grandiose state I feel on top of the world and I am truly happy. I sometimes feel like I may be bipolar due to this. But when I am this grandiose I feel like my real personality comes out. When I’m low my thoughts: I’m socially inept, weak, that little weak kid is still in me who am I kidding, everyone around me thinks I’m weak. I’m also in a relationship with a girl and she’s great to me, she does a lot for me and cares about me a lot. I think I do genuinely love her but she knows something is off with me and I sometimes feel like maybe I’m faking my emotions. Like I want her to emotionally support me but at the same time it’s like I can’t do the same for her.At times I have huge abandonment anxiety around my girlfriend but in recent days it gotten a lot less. Now I think maybe I could survive without her and I would be free but deep down I know I need to keep her as she is great for me and I can’t hurt her. I think I do genuinely love her but at the same time sometimes I feel like all my emotions are fake. Like I think she is picking up on that I am a narcissist or sociopath because she has called me those names. Sometimes I try really hard to be emotional even though it probably is fake. We don’t argue a lot but she says I am paranoid, jealous and possessive. When we go out to the clubs I don’t want any guys talking to her because I usually start arguing with the guys. I also recently got angry at her friends to her because they are annoyed that she doesn’t see them as often because she does see them very rarely, I see my friends a lot more often than she does. And I got angry and started calling them names and said I’m not gonna let some nerds dictate my relationship. She said I’m paranoid and said that she needs some friends as well. I know I get paranoid thoughts about her cheating or her friends trying to turn her against me because me and her friends are completely different. They’re sort of nerds and geeks and I’m like the opposite. I do have some kind of fear of abandonment because I would deal bad with her cheating, leaving me or turning against me. I’m worried that she saw past through me and knows that I might be a narcissist or a sociopath. The thing is even though I’m scared about that she is not a girl that is obsessed with attention from guys. I’m obsessed with attention from people. Like I want girls to notice me I would love for a girl to come up to me whilst being with my girl and asking me for my number or Snapchat as that would make her jealous and she’d know she needs to take me for granted because yeah I do look amazing. I’ll sometimes just want to leave the house just so that people notice me and I’ll look at girls on purpose to see if they notice me. I’ve had situations where girls have came up to me giving me compliments and asking for my Snapchat. So do people relate to this? Because I know it’s not normal and I am probably a narcissist.I’ve been told things about my eyes by the closest people in my life so there must be something about them. My mother, best friend, sister and girlfriend all have had comments about my eyes. I do believe I’m probably a covert narcissist and I know many people in my life know that. I’m just very unstable with it, one day I might be very low self esteem, quiet and awkward. As a kid I was very shy and awkward and felt the worst of myself. Now I still feel down sometimes and feel very low about myself. Then the next minute a comment sets me off and I become a grandiose psychopath, someone tells me I’m fucked up, I’m a psycho, I’m evil and I light up. The reason is because my worry is being used by people by being too nice as a kid I was too nice and I saw nice people get used advantage of and that made me want to be a horrible person instead and never get used for being too nice. When I’m so up I literally feel like a psychopath feel so confident I can throw digs at anyone and I feel like the most powerful psychopath and I just am so confident. Now can you tell a narcissist by their eyes? These close people don’t really talk to each other or anything but all are close to me, and all of these people have noticed things about me and have commented on it. These people tell me about my eyes, they say sometimes they turn crazy, mad or evil. Like I have this scary look in my eyes sometimes, especially when I’m angry or confrontational with someone. My girl likes it because she says my eyes are cheeky. I know my dad has that coldness in his eyes as well like there’s something deep behind them, especially when he gets angry it is scary to see.I’ve been told things about my eyes by the closest people in my life so there must be something about them.

Feeling powerless. Is that weird for a narcissist?. So I am a covert narcissist and often in social scenarios I become very grandiose and I show power, confidence, throw digs at people and feel like the boss.However in bed what gets me off the most is being dominated and not in control. Feeling powerless. Is that weird for a narc?. When does narcissism develop? As a kid and teen I was very quiet shy, and would often be bullied and always felt bad about myself. I felt like I was the the lowest of the low. I’m my friend groups I was always the quiet one that would be picked on. I was empathic somewhat especially when it came to my family, for example always felt bad for my grandparents and my mother so I would always be nice to them and appreciate them. Now I’m 24 and a completely different person. I’m now longer reserved, people in my life always say I’m a psychopath (half jokingly), big ego and they say I lack manners because often I’m seen as rude even though as a kid and teen I had a lot of good manners. It feels like I’ve killed that sensitive little kid and became a different person. I have a younger brother who I was close to because he was really shy and quiet as well and I liked that because I felt like I’d always have him to myself as a back up when I get lonely and never liked when he was close with friends and I would get angry with him when he went out with friends. Well now that he is 22 he is very social and outgoing and I kind of turned against him. Recently I smoked a joint and I heard stories from my mother how he still looks after me and worries me and then I remembered he had chances to get me in sh*t with my parents with the things I’ve done such as he never grassed on me doing drugs and even once my mother found a bong in my room and our mother asked my brother what it was and he made up a lie to save me. Whenever he did something bad he’d tell me about it, I would go to my mother and tell on him straight away. So when I smoked a joint recently and thought about it deeply I felt like an awful brother. Next day the same thoughts kept going through my mind and I started crying and messaged him to say sorry. I genuinely felt empathy and felt bad for him as I have been awful and cold towards him, even though I always said bad things about him to other people, I always told my friends and mother how he’s a psychopath and he’s an evil person even though I always knew I’m worse than him. I’m in a relationship with a girl, and she’s got an amazing heart always does nice things for me she has done so much for me and I never do nice things for her because I can’t be bothered. I’m somewhat controlling, don’t like her meeting her friends I prefer when she stays at home on her own even though when I’m out with my friends and even when she needs me I ignore her to get drunk or high with my friends. But she never would ignore me if I needed her. I just think about myself because I wanna have fun and I tell her we don’t need to see eachother all the time and that she can wait. I always tell her if she ever cheated on me I would off the guy and I do somewhat mean that because if someone would take her from me idk what I would do. My best friend from childhood sees through me as well and always says I’m a psychopath and that I have low empathy and I like that because I never want to be a nice guy as they always get used and I never want people to use me for being nice but I’m not even nice to anyone because I don’t care. Is it possible to go from a quiet sensitive kid/teen to become a narcissist in adulthood not caring about other people. My dad is a full blown narcissist and a sociopath so could it be genetic? As a young adult I heard stories he was definitely shy around girls but now he’s literally a sociopath that doesn’t get stressed about anything. Ps I’ve never been close to him my parents separated when I was around 10.When does narcissism develop? As a kid and teen I was very quiet shy, and would often be bullied and always felt bad about myself. I felt like I was the the lowest of the low. I’m my friend groups I was always the quiet one that would be picked on. I was empathic somewhat especially when it came to my family, for example always felt bad for my grandparents and my mother so I would always be nice to them and appreciate them. Now I’m 24 and a completely different person. I’m now longer reserved, people in my life always say I’m a psychopath (half jokingly), big ego and they say I lack manners because often I’m seen as rude even though as a kid and teen I had a lot of good manners. It feels like I’ve killed that sensitive little kid and became a different person. I have a younger brother who I was close to because he was really shy and quiet as well and I liked that because I felt like I’d always have him to myself as a back up when I get lonely and never liked when he was close with friends and I would get angry with him when he went out with friends. Well now that he is 22 he is very social and outgoing and I kind of turned against him. Recently I smoked a joint and I heard stories from my mother how he still looks after me and worries me and then I remembered he had chances to get me in sh*t with my parents with the things I’ve done such as he never grassed on me doing drugs and even once my mother found a bong in my room and our mother asked my brother what it was and he made up a lie to save me.

Ps I’ve never been close to him my parents separated when I was around 10.My moods suck so much and idk if it’s due to narcissism or maybe like borderline. Most people in my life would say I’m a narcissist. A covert one as I do get bad anxiety.I wanna see if people relate to this. One day I can feel grandiose, like I’m the king, I’m better than everyone, I just feel like showing off my confidence and I become very obnoxious. I pick on people on purpose, I don’t care about others feelings, etc. my views are superior than others and I know that. I become so confident and take pics all the time, and videos and people do find my annoying but this just gives me such a buzz. Then I get states when I’m down so I become quiet and I don’t speak much and I’m just a completely different person. And I hate it I always want to be grandiose. I hate feeling like this I wanna feel like a king all the time. One simple comment can set this off.My moods suck so much and idk if it’s due to narcissism or maybe like borderline.

One simple comment can set this off.So I think I may be a covert narcissist, my father is a narcissist definitely but I never really lived with him, but I’ve heard bad stories of him and whenever I meet him I see that he’s obviously an overt narcissist he only cares about himself. I think people are slowly noticing that I’m a narcissist. My mother and brother say that I’m weird, I show no emotions and empathy and I don’t care about anyone. I’m engaged to a girl and we’re different, she’s really smart, wants a family with me, has a good job, does everything for me, whereas I give her no attention. I want the same things as her, however, I always choose partying and friends over her. A week ago, she was having a bad day at work and wanted to spend the night with me, I told her that I’m busy doing something. Well then she called me that she needs to seriously talk to me as things aren’t good. I was with my group at the time getting high, I got a taxi back to my girls house and we had a talk. She said she wants to break up with me because our relationship is so one sided, it seems like I don’t care about her because my words don’t match my actions, I say all the right things but don’t give her anything. Well usually when she gets upset and we have a serious talk like that, I get upset (even cry)and tell her how important she is to me and how much I love her, and I’m even better at this when I’m drunk, I can easily get upset and tell her how important she is to me and I can cry drunk easily.Well when I came to see her and I was high, even though I was anxious about it as weed gives me anxiety. It just felt like I couldn’t show my emotions I just felt like I don’t care and it made things worse. Like I couldn’t cry and I could only say generic things. Is this because I fake my emotions towards her and I don’t actually care? Like I do love this girl and want a family with her but I also want to be a free man doing my own thing. Like I might be unfair as I always demand her to be there for me no matter what but I don’t really feel like being there for her when she needs me. When I’m high it feels like I can’t be bothered faking my emotions so I just sit there emotionless and say the most generic things as showing emotions seems to difficult. So is this something to do with being high, with my personality or maybe I have such high anxiety on weed that I’m scared to not show any emotions which makes me so anxious that I don’t show any? During our first months of the relationship when we had these talks they would give me so much anxiety and I’d feel awful, but now that we’ve been together for over a year I’m kind of used to it and I still worry she will leave me but I’m definitely much less anxious about it. If she left me I would be lost, she’s such a pure soul that has shown me true love and no one’s ever done so much for me. I just want to know if I’m actually faking my emotions and pretending or is this real? She says when she sees me it feels real because of the things I say but my actions just doesn’t match what I say when I’m away from her. I do have fear of abandonment real bad though so I think could possibly be a boderline?. So as the title says. As I have this girl that is very understanding and she knows I have anxiety, etc so I’ve shown her massive vulnerability. I don’t even know if I am a narcissist but I am probably, my dad is a text book narcissist. I seem to be a covert narcissist as I have anxiety, and can seem really quiet when I’m feeling low but when I’m feeling good and not anxious I probably seem like more of an overt narcissist. I think I’m a narcissist as many people claim for me to be one, I seem not very empathic, I don’t do nice things for people, people do nice things for me I like everything done for me, I can like someone and when they do something against me I’ll just hate them and discard them. I seem egotistical very often. With this girl, we’ve had 2 goes. The first time we got together it didn’t workout because I didn’t really want to be emotionally available to avoid getting myself hurt. So I gave her no attention, and didn’t take her seriously as I was just blocking my emotions as I was convinced it won’t workout. Even though she was really into me, she adored me and I still thought it won’t workout. We broke up due to me acting like a prick at a party. Well we continued talking and after couple months, we got back together and this time I told her I will actually use my emotions instead of just trying to not feel anything. However, this required a lot of work from me to be able to slowly open up and show my vulnerable side, talk about my feelings of anxiety, fears of abandonment. And she has been great, she herself sufferers from anxiety but she’s definitely not a narcissist she does nice things for me all the time. I’m surprised she’s still so into me even though I hurt her once already with my lies and dishonesty.She’s really good at reading me so when I lie about something she knows, but depending on how stressed I am about the lie. If I know she could find out the truth easily such as she could find out by talking to my friends I’m not good at lying and she can tell. But if it’s a lie that no one knows about I’m much better at hiding it.So as the title says.

But if it’s a lie that no one knows about I’m much better at hiding it.So my best friend and I often meet up and smoke weed. And I am addicted to smoking it with him because he gives me a massive source. Recently our relationship changed a lot and even though we are close it’s as if he saw through me and he knows I’m a narcissist. I’m not diagnosed or anything but many people make comments like saying that I have a big ego, etc even though I probably have really low self esteem. When I was a child and a teen I was really quiet and shy and just didn’t feel well about myself. Now I’ve became more confident and sometimes I become very arrogant and love to flex on people with my style, I always wear expensive clothes, and just look after myself. Also to add, my dad is a definite grandiose narcissist and maybe a sociopath but he left us when I was around 10 so I don’t speak to him too often by my mom always says how awful of a person he was. When I talk to him or see him though he always talks about himself and what he has. I’m not a grandiose narcissist more of a covert one but I get states when I’m feeling low, and I get really quiet and shy and times when I feel euphoric and become very arrogant and obnoxious. Now about my friend, when we smoke he gets really anxious around me and maybe it’s because when he smokes he gets anxious, and there were times in social situations that he gets so anxious when stoned he does something funny and I start laughing and he’s clearly embarrassed and then he becomes really uncomfortable. When we have eye contact he becomes visibly uncomfortable, and he’s told me before that I sometimes do too much eye contact. The reason he gives me a source is because I’ve always liked the idea of being a psychopath, I’ve always been intrigued by them because they have no empathy and no remorse which sounds cool to me. And he often calls me a psychopath, the way I act sometimes could of made him think that, I talk about messed up things sometimes as a joke and he’s clearly disturbed by it. When he gets anxious when stoned I just feel great about it that he thinks I’m so messed up that he’s anxious around me. Sometimes when I am feeling great I do become very hyper, confident and obnoxious. Like sometimes like a prick, when I see someone clearly weaker than us on the street I might shout something at them as a joke and look at them. Just because I’m a prick. He does seem to know I have low empathy and my mom and sister say the same. The thing is I do believe I have some empathy as I do feel bad for people sometimes when they do something nice to me like my mom does so much for me and I don’t do anything for her and I feel bad but I still never spend time when her because I always put my needs above others even though I feel really sorry for my mom as she is a bit lonely. And like I feel bad for dogs in like videos showing them abused and like really skinny. And I feel bad for people in Ukraine, losing everything and like especially the poor elderly people. The thing is when we’re sober my friend usually decides what we do, he’s more of a leader, however, as his mental state worsened due to the weed I’ve became kind of stronger than him and can sometimes become the leader. but often It’s not me that decides what we do with other people as well like if I go a concert it’s usually the other persons idea, unless I really want something then I try to get my way. Recently though I’ve noticed I’ve always been very submissive so I’ve tried to become more of a leader and get my own way. Also to add, I have a girlfriend and I only ever meet her when I’m bored, but usually choose my friends over her and prefer to party and smoke weed, even though she does everything for me, picks me over everyone. Recently she’s been really depressed and I had to meet her over my friends because she was really upset and needed someone to speak to and even though I didn’t want to meet her because I did say I’m going out, she got more and more upset and I had to meet her to make her feel better even though I didn’t want to. And that got me kind of mad, but I didn’t take it out on her but I was visibly off with her because I would rather meet my friends rather than deal with her. Could I be a narcissist or do I just have low self esteem?. Male, 22. Height 5’10. Weight 60kg. And noMedicationI’ve had these symptoms for a while and I did have an MRI however doctors only did it of my lower back mainly. It showed very mild disc bulge at T12/L1 however it isn’t meant to be touching any nerves apparently. My worry is that i have a herniated disc in my upper back however doctors don’t wanna do an MRI because they’re saying it’s very unlikely. My symptoms are: constant sensation in my upper back on the right side, it’s this kind of weird feeling like a spot with numbness and I had it for years but it’s gotten bigger. Occasional sensations in the upper back that feel as if a water drop just dropped on my back which is really weird and I get that usually when I do some sort of movement it usually doesn’t happen when I’m still. The worst of all is the muscle tension and it seems to be mainly the right side as well. It’s mild usually but the worst thing is I used to be able to workout but now I can’t even do that. When I workout, after a couple hours after the workout the muscle tension gets very painful and it affects the whole of the right side of the body. Even my jaw, legs, back, etc. It’s so weird and uncomfortable and it lasts for days after the workout usually. I’m so lost I don’t know what it is. Could this be a problem with my spine or maybe caused by my anxiety?. Male, 22. Height 5’10. Weight 60kg.

Could this be a problem with my spine or maybe caused by my anxiety?. So I either get a really depressive mood which makes me want to commit suicide or when I’m in a good mood I feel very arrogant, amazing, etc. My mood does depend on different factors and my current situation. It’s never at random, there’s always a reason behind my mood. I love being in a good mood though, as then I’m very extroverted, love to be loud, arrogant and just like to catch people’s attention. When I’m in that mood I just love myself so much I love it! Also my second thing is for some reason I’m always jealous about my sister. We both still live at home and she wants to move out and I’m trying my best so that she stays. I feel like it would be painful for me if she left and I always try to manipulate the situation so that she can stay at home. I hate it when she goes out often with her friends as well. I guessI’m just scared of not getting her attention and getting left behind and being less close to her. When I’m like that I feel like a strict parent but I don’t care. I’m pretty sure I’m a narcissist but I’m wondering if these two things are caused my narcissism.So first off my dad is definitely narcissistic and maybe a sociopath but I’m not sure about that one. But he is annoying to talk to, always brags about the things he has and everything he has is the best and he is the perfect human being. Also he has a criminal past and doesn’t seem to get stressed about doing things that might be risky, such as lying, cheating and so on. Also he does get aggressive and likes to fight peopleWell I’m a 22 year old male and I’m wondering if I myself do suffer from NPD however I’m definitely not a sociopath or anything like that. Also I do suffer from bad anxiety. I daydream a lot about being successful, rich, impressing people, etc. Impressing people is a big thing for me probably I love to make people think I’m cool, rich, successful, etc. However when I know someone is more successful than me or has achieved something I haven’t I don’t like being around them, and if I am then I tend to be quiet. However when I’m around people I know that I have achieved more than them, then I tend to be a lot more talkative. Also when I daydream I often listen to music, yeah I know cringe. I am asking if I gave NPD because I kind of deep down want to have a condition like that. I’m fascinated with psychopaths and sociopaths because they’re different and they’re fearless. People such as Charles Manson, I love to watch videos of him but I am not a sociopath or psychopath that’s for sure. However reading about narcissism I think that fits me possibly. I hate when my friends are successful or achieve something but I thrive when they fail, yeah I know I’m a shit person probably. Another thing is I am bad with girls, but I did have a girlfriend and I only asked her out because I knew she was into me. I tried to be all good to her, treat her well and impress her until we became official. When we became official she’d be very clingy, and I became very distant and uninterested in her and always came up with excuses not to meet her. It just felt pointless to me because it’s as if I achieved getting her and after that I became very unmotivated to pursue her. Obviously in the end the relationship ended and I felt great because I felt free, however, I heard she was depressed for 6 months after the relationship ended. Also my ego is very unstable sometimes I feel ugly, sometimes I feel like the most good looking guy ever. When I’m feeling depressed and ugly I tend to be very low energy. But when I’m in good mood and feeling good looking I’m a lot higher in energy and arrogant and just feel amazing and talkative. However, I do love any sort of compliments that definitely make my mood better. The only thing I’m confused about is that I can’t think of any childhood trauma I had. Like yeah my parents would argue a lot and as a kid that was a very scary thing but that doesn’t make someone a narcissist. My dad never had time for me but my mum was a good parent even a bit strict I’d say. So could I possibly be a narcissist or am I just a shit fucked up person lol. So I’ve got an iPhone 7 and I’ve had it for over 2 years now but I’m really getting sick and tired of iPhones. After 2 years they seem to slow down also the battery after updating to iOS14 is awful. Literally a full charge will last me about 2 hours maybe, it’s really bad. Samsung s20 fe is much much cheaper plus there is an offer where I’d get a Samsung galaxy watch active for free. So for the S20 FE 4G version plus the watch it is £599. For iPhone 12 128GB it is £849. I’ve however heard about some issues with the S20 FE regarding some screen issues. I’ve got such a big dilemma and really not sure what to go for and which phone will be more solid in the long term and which phone is better value for money. Also to add I have AirPods Pro however you can use them on an Android.Ive had an MRI of lumbar and sacral spine, and I have a prolapsed disc in the T12/L1 area, however, it doesn’t really match my symptoms. I have pain mainly in upper back with a numb spot on the right side of my upper back. When I workout or carry something heavy after a while the whole of my right side of the body goes completely tight which is very unpleasant and painful. It even affects my jaw on the right side of the body. It’s such a weird case that literally all muscles on the right side go so tight after any sort of workout or carrying something. I’m literally so lost because I have no idea what this could be, and I’m only 22 btw and a male. Does anyone have an idea what this could be, could this possibly be caused by anxiety/stress?. So today I was told my back isn’t too bad (I’m only 22 btw). There’s some herniation on the levels t12/L1 and the physiotherapist said it isn’t too bad and I could go back to working out. Well when I workout I get really bad pain so I can’t really do that in my opinion. Also what confuses me is that majority of the symptoms are in my upper back, the pain is in upper back and sometimes chest and I also get tight muscles in the upper back. Also I got a numb spot in my upper back. Now I’ve got huge anxiety that I got a bad herniation in my upper back as the MRI was mostly of the lumbar spine so maybe it didn’t check much of the upper back?Like when I turn left or right the sharp pain seems more upper back.So I’m a 22 year old and I’ve had a passion for working out for some while. I’ve just found out that I’ve been living with a herniated disc for 4 years. It gave me weird sensations and numbness in my upper back but I still worked out and ignored it.When doing bench presses recently it got really painful to the point that I couldn’t do them because everytime I’d do it my whole body would be in crazy pain and my muscles would feel very tight. I assume the herniated disc is in my upper or mid back because that’s where I feel the pain. I can feel sharp pain when I rotate my torso in the spine in my upper back. I tried working out even doing some biceps curls but can’t even do them because it causes so much pain later on that day. I’m honestly so lost right now working out was the only thing that kept my will to live alive.I’m a 22 year old male and I always knew there was something up with me and it could be narcissism. My dad is definitely a narcissist or a sociopath like I’m 100% sure, so maybe this could genetics.I’m a bit different than him though because I do have anxiety, and also social anxiety. But I love it when I’m not anxious and I can be loud around my friends and then I’m usually a massive cunt especially to other people. Like when I’m not anxious it’s as if I like to boast and show how confident I am. I have empathy but usually it’s only towards my family and animals. I often daydream of myself having massive success, being rich, and seeing people’s reaction to my successes. Also I’m not sure why but I want to be a psychopath kind of? And if I am a narcissist it would make me feel even better about myself idk why, I guess I always wanted to be fucked up. Like in films I love psychos and I wanna be one, and this could be do to my ego? I’m definitely not a psycho because I do have anxiety and I am extremely patriotic and psychos usually don’t feel such strong connections to their heritage. Also I had one serious relationship and once we became official I became more distant with her because I felt like I achieved what I wanted and after that I just couldn’t be bothered to really meet with her or try. I didn’t want to but I just became very uninterested in her. Eventually it ended and it felt good because she always wanted to meet up and it became annoying, from a mutual friend I heard that she was very depressed for like 6 months whereas I was fine. When there is someone that I hate I sometimes daydream about like hurting them in a painful way, sounds fucked up but I wouldn’t ever do it. Lastly I kind of enjoy seeing my friends fail or see something bad happening to them. Like if a friend gets addicted to gambling, or like even cigarettes it makes me feel happy because I know these are stupid addictions and I don’t have these so I won’t have to spend money on these stupid things. Makes me feel better I guess. Could you tell me if I am possibly some kind of narcissist? And what type of narcissist? Or am I just a massive cunt lol. So this might be odd but I’ve been interested in Ukraine for some time now, I love the Slavic culture, the architecture and the cold weather which may be odd but I really like it. I’m a Slav myself because I’m Polish but most of my life I spent in UK and I’m just very bored of UK and want a life change. Personally I don’t like big cities, I prefer smaller towns, but I’m unsure if there will be many job opportunities in the smaller towns. I have just completed a degree in Business which covers many areas such as marketing, HR, management, economics, operations and accounting.So I’ve been dealing with this issue for years and it’s just making my life so not enjoyable. It’s like constant pain in my back mostly on my right side. I used to have a lot of pain in my neck however I don’t have much of it now. The pain can be near the shoulder blade, mid and upper back as well as lower back. I also have an area in my mid back on the right side that feels like a numb spot which is really weird it feels like ants are walking in this spot. About a year ago I had a neck MRI and it hasn’t shown anything.Can this be due to bad anxiety? Also whenever I workout the pain becomes much worse. I’ve been looking into stocks and forex and I’d say I like the look of forex because its more short term trading and less capital is needed.I know Forex is different than gambling but it has some similar aspects. It’s either a sudden win or sudden loss, and you don’t always win you’re going to lose as well. Obviously successful traders have got strategy’s that win a lot more than lose. Now I’ve always hated gambling, I tried it and it just gave me anxiety due to the sudden rush you get from it and I got anxiety because of it due to being worried that I’d get addicted as that shit can ruin people’s lives. Now can someone help me to figure out if forex is for me or not based on personality and things. Like what kind of personality characteristics make a good trader and what characteristics make a bad trader.(I’m a 21 year old male) It seems like I can never do bench presses as it’s always painful afterwards. It was usually resulting in lower and mid/upper back as well as stiffness on the whole of the right side of my body. But then I started doing the bench press with my feet on the bench which helped the lower back pain. Even though I don’t get the lower back pain I still get extreme upper/mid back pain that feels horrible and stiff. It’s mostly on the right side of the body that hurts and it can affect my shoulder and chest as well but the pain is worst in the back.I do suffer from anxiety which causes tight muscles which sometimes can be painful. Not sure though why after doing the bench press I get such horrible pain but it’s usually an hour or two after the workout and persists for couple days after. Could it be due to muscle imbalances due to not doing enough pull exercises or what as I’m so nervous because of this as I want to be bench pressing but the pain afterward makes it very bad.It seems like I can never do bench presses as it’s always painful afterwards.

Or go for the more expensive players like mbappe Rashford gnabry?.
    I haven’t been able to feel anything at all for two weeks. My fp triggered me last night bc we got into a fight and I feel like she hates me now but I also don’t even care…? I’ve had stints of it but never this bad, part of me feels like if anyone left I wouldn’t even care which is very very peculiar. I’ve also been dissociating and have had terrible identity issues. I can’t act like myself and I don’t feel like a real person and it’s scaring me.Hello this is a much more informal question less related to the disorder itself and more of a by-product of larger symptoms. For the past week I’ve been obsessing over my ex bc it was pretty clear to me they still had feelings. Anyways 😭 they only sort of do and they don’t know what they actually want but I’ve been going crazy bc once I kinda figured out they had some sort of feelings I immediately started going nuts and imagining us getting back to together and I expected something out of them ig and had all these breakdowns about them and anxiety about all the ways our relationship could go wrong once again and made up new problems in my head that I thought would naturally come along if we got back together. But I didn’t stop to realize that these aren’t my actual feelings and that I do like them but don’t know what I want either and so now I look back at how I acted and am embarrassed bc I wish I didn’t have to take everything run yk. How can I be more chill?. I’m looking for albums similar to this one in that it covers the reality of death and the reconsidering of life and that philosophy. Thank you!. I’m a high school dropout and I have no clue how I’m going to surviveSo basically im 17 and in a year my dad will kick me out. I’ve been beating the pavement for months trying to find even a simple fucking fast food job and nada. I dropped out for a lot of complicated reasons, pretty much bc my parents are abusive and ruined my life and future and bc my house burned down and ever since then I’ve had severe mental problems including being diagnosed w a personality disorder. ANYWAYS bc of all this I can also no longer focus in the classroom, I tried to go back to school recently just to take a ged class and I quit in a week bc I hated having to interact w the people there and the class setting in general. I don’t wanna go into trade as I’ve always been more academically inclined but bc I can’t be in school I feel I have no options left. Please try to give me some guidance here I’m so lost.I don’t know exactly if this is the right place to ask, but after hearing some of y’all w aspd explain your feelings on empathy, I have a bit of a question. It seems like for the majority of you empathy can only exist in the form of how other’s actions effect you, but then what is the purpose of existence if the ego is all there is to you. If all your world is what exists inside of yourself then how do you see living as having any sort of purpose at all? Hypothetically, if you were to say you were passionate about some special interest, I could see that, but only by a narrow lenses, one that would ostracize you from that very thing bc your interest is inherently meaningless, the subject is inherently meaningless, everything is inherently meaningless without connection to other existing things. In other words, to exist only inside yourself is to not exist at all.I feel like I can never escape this unbearable feeling that I am utterly broken and unlovable and everything in my life always seems to prove that right and it hurts so badly bc I love everyone so deeply and they never do, and I don’t mean romantically, I mean my chosen family of friends. They don’t even see me as their family or love me and they’re all i have. I feel just like when my biological family abandoned me, it’s like my worst fear is happening all over again. I just wanna be loved and I constantly feel like this I literally can’t go more than an hour without obsessing over it and breaking down. I feel so helpless. What can I do?. So recently I’ve been feeling this weird thing where I think that I’m not the real me but an imposter, or that my very existence has been tainted recently by my bad actions so I’ve been severed from myself by some sort of god and now I’m compulsively changing my behaviors to match what feels okay in the eyes of this god based off my disgust levels. I also believe others are being controlled by this god for my punishment. I’ve been having severe brain fog too and can’t keep up with conversations. I also compulsively do good deeds to get on this gods good side. Does anyone else have themes like this or am I crazy?. Hello, I’m 17 and a high school dropout looking to test for my ged in the next couple of months to be able to attend college. I’m still getting my footing on where to start w it all and applied for a free class but I’d like to chat w some people to study w eventually and get an introduction to it. Hmu if yk of any or all interested in talking about anything ged related! Don’t be a creep 👍. I bought a t tip and it said it would work but it’s too large and I’m literally crying because I’m completely broke and I need a computer for work and now I’ve wasted money and I don’t know what to do.
    So I imagine you as the animal in The cage next to mine. The Reaper does not trust us to get Along Together. So we, in turn, are: two out of one. We take turns barking at the hollow People watching us. You say “There is no more where this came from, and there never will be!” I say “I hope we’re not the sum of all we’ve seen.”. I was wondering since there are few results on Google for said inquiry. I know flashes in Soros and Keynes, but that's it.Will: Fear of abandonment? Is that why I broke up with Skylar? Sean: I didn't know you had. Will: Yeah, I did. Sean: You wanna talk about it? Will: No. Sean: Hey, Will? I don't know a lot. You see this? All this shit? \[Holds up the file, and drops it on his desk\] Sean: It's not your fault. Will: \[Will shrugs\] Yeah, I know that. \[Will averts his eyes to the floor\] Sean: Look at me son. \[Will locks eyes with Sean\] Sean: It's not your fault. Will: \[Will nods\] I know. Sean: No. It's not your fault. Will: I know Sean: No, no, you don't. It's not your fault. \[Sean moves closer to Will\] Sean: Hmm? Will: I know. \[Will stands up, trying to keep distance\] Sean: It's not your fault. Will: Alright. Sean: It's not your fault. \[Will closes his eyes, he's fighting for control\] Sean: It's not your fault. Will: Don't fuck with me. \[Will shoves Sean back\] Will: Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you! Sean: It's not your fault. It's not your fault. \[Will breaks into sobs. They hug\] Sean: Fuck them, ok?.

Part of the issue in fully transitioning was that women's T-Shirts were of thin fabric and whose necklines plunged too much. If there is a thicker fabric consistent in men's t-shirts for women's casual tops, I would have no qualms with women's tops, yet the difficulty of finding an equivalent challenges me.Does anyone have an equivalent in their lives for clothing sensitivities?EDIT: Please let me know AspieLadies if you gals know of thicker fabric tops (brands, stores, etc.). Hello. I was wondering if there were a list of books that explained the history of discredited viewpoints of the idea of Gender Dysphoria, such as the past belief that transitioning was seen as a sign of Psychosis, or sexual inversion. I am looking to understand how the theory of gender dysphoria has transitioned overtime; and would like to see the perspective on why the idea of Psychosis used was theorized and rebuked. For myself, openly trans, it is understanding why psychologists and culture believed in transphobic ideals (if interpreted today) rather than striking down without research.. Hello. For a long-time, I have owned a significant amount of physical books in my library, in which is now being converted into Kindle and EPUB methods. In regards to the Physical books, however, since I do not need them anymore, I was wondering if in the Twin Cities area therein exists a book store in which accepts books to be sold to the book store. I have a variety of books, such as textbooks, biographies, pretty much anything I can get my hands-on I will read in my spare time (I estimate about 300-400 books in my library that are physical at this point). Is there any good recommendations?. Hello. So, I recently got a name change and a gender change court order. For myself, I was told that the office (to submit the replacement card change) for my Zip Code is in St. Cloud, Minnesota. However, since I will be in Brooklyn Park that day, I wondered if one could submit the replacement card application to the Minneapolis office rather than the St. Cloud office due to time and costs?. As noted in the text above.. I remember growing-up, about a decade-ago, I was about twenty at the time. I would write in my spare time when not at work essays on life, ranging from business to political science. Over the years, however, no-one actually read my work, be it in my job, where I lived, family, etc. It got to the point to which I had become flustered. In fact, that was the theme in life.Everytime, I had looked for them to read to critique, that to see how my work could improve. I've had no qualms with criticism as long as I am able to see how I can improve. However, if no one reads ones writing, how can one grow. It is this catch-22 that consumes myself. It would be equivalent to asking someone to improve their social skills; and yet be unable to have said inidvdiual obtain a social environemnt in which to improve said lack-of-foundation. I don't believe in College; and thus a writing class cannot entail myself. I just wonder how one goes about if there is no peer who is able to sit down and actually read said papers?How do you all, in particular, live with that similar state-of-existence?EDIT: Besides online writing groups, what do you suggest I do to improve my chances of someone someday reading my writings? I am open to constructive feedback.. As a supplment, what books would or research papers would you recommend for further research on the subject?. Hello, I am new to the subreddit. This month is the twelfth anniversary of my first purchasing his book on the September 11, 2001 attacks, with the study of Noam's other specialty, linguistics, helping me speak and write in higher quality in the past year compared to years prior. I have a quick question in regard to Noam's presidential choices. I am cognizant that many of Noam's choices were enrooted in reluctance (such as denoting his endorsement of Walter Mondale in a 1992 article, as well as referring to John Kerry as "Bush-Lite" in 2004). In addition, Noam was one who believed that if the laws of Nuremberg's guidelines were used in application to American Presidents since World War II, the United States would try nearly all of the said Presidents. If Noam was able to endorse an ideal candidate (meaning said candidate is not a guarantee, but rather one that Noam simply favored, regardless of being on the main Presidential ballot), which candidates from 1952-2024 would Noam have favored to become President if he was not bound by a choice of 'the lesser of two evils?'. Hello, I have a question in regards to medication options for increase arousal-and-drive of sex. Currently, I am on HRT, which said drive-and-arousal would be equivalent to when I was presenting as male. For myself, however, a part of said self wants to have a relationship; yet the quandary is that while the mind may be willing to give it a shot once-in-a-while, I am not sure if therein exists medication to alleviate said issues. I understand the concept of Viagra and Cialis, although for myself, the issue is not enrooted on increasing penile size (myself not wishing to desire); but rather drive-and-arousal. Would there be a medication available in this regard that one could take?. There seems to a fluidity in terminology in regards to certain words. For example, one who uses the term "sociopath" can now refer said term to someone they disagree with. However, for myself, the term "manipulation" is one I do not understand due to interchangeable . I remember once, I attempted to pick up a cab. The cab's supervisor said I could call the driver. Said driver than calls me manipulative. Does that mean I possess the trait of manipulation? My question to those in the ASPD community is, how would you define "manipulation" using your definition with examples if desired? Discuss.. Hello ladies, quick question.I know that an Orchi is generally safe before GRS. However, since the PPV method requires a more complex approach, could one for example, have Orchi and then three years later complete GRS-PPV?.
    I started investing in 2019 with $500 and a dream. But I was a gambler then and I’m still a gambler now. I wanted money fast, and that led to my slow and painful downfall as I attempted damage control by pouring more of my hard earned money to average down on my bleeding portfolio. Fast forward to June 2020 and I was down over $3000. By November it was $6000. And by March 2021 it was 8-9K. I stopped counting after that. It was just ugly and I felt ashamed.I had just played Target’s Q4 2020 earnings report even though I knew Wall Street might not be impressed. I was employee at Target at the time and typically during the holidays we sell big ticket items for lower profit margins to attract and retain customers. Target shat the bed, down about 13-15% at the lows in a matter of days. Target hadn’t had such an ugly drop since 2017, and I had been caught in it. I was so angry and disappointed.See my philosophy is that I can technically afford to lose all the money I play with now because I don’t need to work through college, meaning most of the money I have is a surplus for the time being in return for doing extra stuff, like side quests in a video game. My tuition is $7,600 a year and my parents pay for it as long as I perform well. If my grades slipped below a 3.0 GPA I’d expect to be on the hook for that bill. My mom was having trouble with money during my first semester of college in fall 2019 because she made some poor irrational decisions I won’t get in to, I loaned her $720 to cover a bill she couldn’t afford to pay which was about 33% of all my money at the time. When Christmas came around I told her that she didn’t have to pay me back and to use that money to purchase gifts for my siblings.When the stock market crashed in March 2020 my dad who works as a nurse was ready to jump the gun on the stock market after I spoke to him about investing. I set up his account and he decided to purchase the stocks that had been obliterated. His greatest buy was purchasing 30 shares of Moderna at $31. I personally placed the order for him. Later on I advised him on future purchases and he has turned $4000 into $22,000 as of this week.So I believe that I earned my college being paid for 110% as I supported both my parents during a dark time in our lives. My parents invest in me as investors would in a company, and I will give them a return on their investment as they age.Now back to where my own portfolio finally turned around.The $TGT Arc:So I vented my mom about what happened with Target while I under-stated my losses so she wouldn’t panic or be too upset with me. She told me “if Target is down, then buy it. It’s at a discount isn’t it?” So I asked myself, “did anything drastically change about Target?” At the time it was trading at $168 a share and I concluded that the answer was “no, nothing has changed”. I like the company because millennials love to shop there, as a former employee I can personally attest to the success of target in regards to breaking into urban environments. Even today everywhere I go I see a re-usable Target bag, I bet they give them away for free so people walk around with them and function as walking advertisements. Because of the way that Target traded, call debit spreads were the best way to capitalize on a slow bull run. Invested an initial $800 or so even when I could have loaded $3000 in call spreads at the time. But I made about $4000 in profits from target. They killed earnings and I sold my calls spreads early June when it hit an ATH at $236 a share. Had I held my original July 16 230/240 spreads I sold before earnings to go further out into October 260/270 calls as a risk management strategy I could have made upwards to $18,000 on this stock alone. It trades at $262 today. Oh well. The reason why I took profits on Target was because it just had an impressive extended bull run leading up to and following a stellar earnings report. I didn't want to be greedy and took profits at 236 early June as the stock had jumped about $70 a share from it's March lows.The $NEGG Arc: I had a stock in mind after I sold my largest position, for the time being I was done trading options. My mentor is bearish on the market so having him talk to me about how the market is a bubble scares me sometimes. So I went on the hunt for pure value plays. Then I stumbled on an IPO of a household name for PC gamers that nobody knew about because of the unconventional way that they went public, through a reverse merger. My investment thesis was that had they gone public through a traditional IPO, they would be worth much more than 3.75 billion dollars. So I loaded 500 shares at 10.45. The OG group on stocktwits was filled with intelligent like-minded people that were all in unison that this e-commerce stock was grossly undervalued to competition ($WISH, $GME,$BBY). Combine that with a low float and we had a ticking time bomb just waiting to explode to the upside... just needed a little spark. So I got proactive and posted my investment thesis on WSB....I got laughed off the fucking sub. The original commenters tore my post to pieces because I dared to say that Newegg was what Gamestop wanted to be. One person said that because of my post they would short sell it at $10 a share and proceed to buy more $GME with the profits. People tried to tell me Newegg which has been around for 20 years was a SCAM... literally have friends that ordered from fucking Newegg and when I bought the stock I immediately asked everyone I knew that used Newegg about their experience as a customer. What gamestop wants to be is an e-commerce gaming company that pivots to cater PC as well as console gamers.. Newegg was already there. That was the spark that was going to ignite the flame. So a few weeks later it squeezed just like GME, the people that laughed at me like the people that laughed at Noah building the fucking ARK before the flood probably hate themselves now. Had a flood of new people comment and congratulate me for being right.Unfortunately I was forced to sell at $25 a share, a 150% gain but shy of the top it hit at around $70. The reason this happened was because I didn't buy the stock to go to Mars, I bought it so I could make some side income on covered calls, my days of trading risky were over.. or so I thought. The day after it ripped to $19 a share I decided to sell the $25 call for $100 a contract on all 500 of my shares expiring 2 weeks out. Those OPTIONS I SOLD RAN 5000% but hey.. profit is profit right..? Totally didn't consider $ROPE for a second there hahahaThe $MVST Arc:I had fumbled the bag with $WYNN, probably took a few sorry souls with me that bought the dip after I advised giving it a look even after it lost steam from the dead cat bounce to from $100 to $109 and dropped back to 103 and then fell to $93. Blame the Chinese and anti-maskers/vaxxers bruh, pent up demand was looking fire until the stupidity of half of America and the authoritarianism of Winnie The fuckin Pooh took hold. Having made some fire trades I knew I was going to fuck up. Trading options and stocks is like playing Russian roulette which is why I do not go all in on options anymore. I have $10,000 worth of shares in Unity Software $U that I don't plan on selling. So 10 days ago I noticed that $MVST was trending on stocktwits. I liked the stock at $20 when it was Tuscan Holdings so you better believe that I knew this company was a fucking steal at $9.30.. and it had momentum?? It was just perfect, I had to get in that. The only problemo??? I was all out of ammo. So I said fuck it, I was already paying for robinhood gold so I decided to use 1K worth of margin to buy calls. Then some Morgan Stanley fuck decided to downgrade the stock. I was a little worried about losing money on margin ngl, but it was margin I could afford to pay back... then I got a lil balsy. I borrowed 2 grand to yolo on WMT calls 2 weeks out and another 3K to buy LVS calls for October. WMT was looking like it was about to break out and LVS is just insanely oversold trading at March 2020 levels over short term worries. I couldn't help myself. By the grace of God I was blessed tendies on MVST,WMT, and LVS.My portfolio on Robinhood hit $21,400 at today's close and my TD ameritrade has $2,900. I literally have $200 in my checkings account and use a credit card that I pay off every month to avoid interest/ build credit for when I buy a lambo (*probably will buy a cheap hybrid to save money when I need to upgrade my car*). I try to live frugally and use the time I have as a college student with little financial responsibility to my advantage. So this is my story. As always, if you have any questions feel free to shoot me a message. If I made some typos plz forgive me cause I type fast, probably will go and fix em later on.Is it possible to come back to the same life to do it over and make better decisions? I think it’s possible. Is it possible to come back to the same life with a different gender to live a desired reality? No. Because that past never existed. The desire to live a life in a different scenario like a gender change is possible if you come back in the future…. But it’s kinda wild to see people delusional that they can reincarnate to the past with extremely specific details. That’s literally shifting type rhetoric. Like I get it. People wish things were different but if you can’t be happy with yourself then simply do not chose to return to this life.Say that you were extremely close with someone for many years…. worked out all your problems and really loved each other…. But a black swan ruined the relationship and pushed them towards another guy. What are the odds of getting a second chance with them? I’d love to re-live the same life again to do it better, but I also wouldn’t mind a different life where I meet them again to do it better. I’m only 22. I’m in a lot of pain. I truly believe in my heart we were soulmates and I want to see them again… in this life or the next.Say that you were extremely close with someone for many years…. worked out all your problems and really loved each other….

Making myself marketable enough to get a decent job? I did it for you. 4 years of our connection is gone because of my lack of trust in your love for me. And it hurts so much knowing that I have to live the rest of my life without you. For others that messed up relationships that were so deep and intimate… how did you find meaning in life again? How can you keep on going? It feels like my world has ended and the only thing that remains is my consciousness but every day waking up hurts.I mean it when I say that. She was my best friend. She didn’t want to leave…. We were together for almost 4 years. From when I was 18 to almost 22 and 15 to almost 20 for her… My mental issues and lack of trust in her pushed her away. I accused her father of raping her…. In front of her house…. with a sign… it was based off nightmares she said that she had and feeling like someone had done it in her sleep but it was still a horrible thing to do that was caused by my mental instability. The reason why I did it was because I messaged her after she had blocked me to say I wanted the best for her even after all the trust issues she gave me and the things I had believed she had done behind my back. She said she’d always love me but was annoyed I made a new number to keep looking for her. She didn’t want the chaos and destruction that my mental instability was bringing. So I snapped and made that sign in a last ditch attempt to protect her from harm figuring I had nothing left to lose… but that was the worst decision I could have made. Even after everything… she texted me on my birthday a few days later. She said she couldn’t legally talk to me because of what I had done. The stress got me into a car accident. I tried to stay strong… but I was so upset that I lost her and I didn’t know how to express my feelings. So I texted her cousin about everything until she told me to stop and move on…. So I met another girl for a while who distracted me for a bit. However… after my ex got with another guy… she admitted that even after everything she would have taken me back had I been honest about my feelings for her and how much she meant to me. I feel destroyed. This happened in mid April and she got with the new guy in late May. I hate knowing that the time I spent forcing myself to like a rebound should have been spent trying to apologize for what I did. Now it’s too late. I hate myself for what I did. It literally feels like I killed my other half and what remains is a sad lonely soul who will struggle to fall in love again because of how deep our connection was…. I committed suicide in April. It really feels like my life is over. I’m meeting another girl soon but it hurts so much knowing that my soulmate fought so hard to stay with me until I pushed them away. I would wait several decades just to reincarnate with them again. That’s what I keep telling myself in order to keep on going. That our souls will meet again when we are stronger and that in the next lifetime we’ll follow through on everything we said we’d do…. But I know that in the meantime I have to live my life and try to love another person… even if she will have my heart forever. This wasn’t a normal break up. I killed it because of mistrust over things she had done in the past that helped to trigger mental issues within me… she didn’t stop loving me until mid May. And I wish I had known I still had time…. I’m 22 years old and from Long Island. My ex broke up with me 3 1/2 months ago and she was my world. I gave my entire life to her pretty much. Especially due to covid. Anyways. She was my best friend. She went with an ex from high school who was praying on my downfall about a month after the breakup. I haven’t been able to find a solid relationship as quickly. I wake up everyday with thoughts of emptiness and regret over the actions that made me lose my best friend. How can I keep living like this? I have so many years ahead of me. And it’s scary because I fear many of those years could be spent alone. Can one eventually become happy living alone? The more and more I think about what I did I hate myself. She was hardworking. I supported her dreams, and she made it really far. I was so proud of her at the end. Anyways. I wish the best for her. But I struggle every time I think about how I’ll manage to live the rest of my life knowing I ruined something amazing over trust issues.It’s been about 3 1/2 months since the break up and 2 months since she started dating another guy. Her and the guy have had an amazing relationship. Before she decided to permanently block me, she told me that he got along well with the parents, that she really enjoys sex with him, and that they talk a lot when they aren’t together. She got really lucky because this dude was waiting on the sidelines during the 4 years that me and this girl were together. I’m seeing a new girl but she works 6 days a week and she doesn’t text as often. She’s indicated she’s very interested in me but she lives about an hour away and has strict parents. So I wouldn’t be able to bring her over as easily. I’m moving a little bit closer to her but I’ll be living with my grandpa so I doubt we’d get much alone time together. In a nutshell… I had a relationship with someone I met in high school where I could see them several times a week and text them pretty much all throughout the day.. and when we would meet up we had a lot of opportunity to be alone. I can only see the new person once a week if I’m lucky and they only text me a handful of times throughout the day. How can I cope with this relationship that has a different pace? I want to be happy but I can’t keep missing the deep relationship I had in the past.A little over 3 months ago… a near 4 year relationship ended. She was the only woman I ever felt sparks with when we kissed. She really cared about me. Our love was deep and intense… hell… her parents even let me go to Disney World with them last summer. But I struggled with mental illness and eventually began to accuse her of things she didn’t actually do. It became too much for her to handle and she left. Afterwards… I got into a car accident. My car was in the repair shop for 2 months and time pretty much stopped for me. I did Uber a lot in the rental. On my birthday late April she texted me… and because I had been in recovery from the accident and had been doing Uber.. I let her leave again. My mom invited her over for my birthday but she declined because of what had happened before. But I really loved her. Even on the last day I saw her while we were together. I hugged her, kissed her and said. “I don’t know when I’ll see you again.” I mustered up the courage to contact them again late June. But they informed me that they were with another man. I really want to reincarnate with her. I really want our souls to try again. I’m telling you… she really loved me. She’s in a new relationship and I’m still stuck. Eventually I will move on and hope to settle down with someone else but… my heart will always have a place for her. Is there any hope that we can reincarnate together and have a second shot at a life together? Or is this simply wishful thinking. I’m only 22. I have my whole life ahead of me. And I really wish that I could have had this life with her. But it gives me a little bit of comfort that it could be possible that our souls reunite one day to try again. I truly believe we are soulmates but that bad energy was thrown our way in order to destroy our relationship in this timeline.A little over 3 months ago… a near 4 year relationship ended.

I made a lot of mistakes due to mental instability and pushed her away. She proceeded to tell me that her and her new boyfriend showered together and made love. That he bought her mom flowers. That her little brother likes him. I’m in so much pain. I wish I could do everything over. I pushed her away. And I regret it so much. This pain is unbearable. I don’t know where I’ll meet new people. I’m starved of human touch. The imagery of her and her new boyfriend is engraved in my mind. I don’t know how much longer I can take this pain.Graduated from Baruch on Tuesday. Gives me street cred to go toe to toe with Shrkeli one day. Woo hoo https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/dell-and-nvidia-bringing-generative-ai-to-the-enterprise/$NVDA and $DELL are working together to bring generative AI to the enterprise market.Essentially what this could mean for the earnings call after hours is that Dell could raise guidance in a crazy fashion the same way that NVDA did last week. While Dell’s business model has taken a hit due to the slump in the PC market… interest in new computing technologies that can support AI will help their business.The stock dropped in symphony to legacy hardware company $HPE… most of their revenue is shitty printers that don’t work and lack luster PCs/Laptops..Dell on the other hand has a better product lineup, owning Alienware and many other high performance PCshttps://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/30/better-buy-dell-vs-hp/According to this article, Dell has been investing in data centers significantly more aggressively than Hewlett-Packard…As such, the shares seemed primed for a pop. Don’t expect PC sales to knock the results out of the park. They would have to essentially say AI 200 times. Jumping in at these levels. Buy monthly calls in case there is a delayed reaction in the stock price to good news. I share both traits of the neurodivergence. I believe that Psychopaths and Empaths are similar in the way their brains are different. I was also told an autistic person can’t be a primary psychopath… only a secondary one as a result of extreme trauma. Does the same apply to autism and being an Empath?. I am a 22 year old male graduating from college. I drive a great car, I’ve got great grades, I’m attractive, I’m extremely relatable to most people I interact with in my age group….. but I’m alone. I am a loner. I just don’t fit in with anyone in particular. When I see girls in my age group.. I notice that many of them don’t have the same struggles that I do. When they get upset… there are usually guys in line waiting to be their shoulder to cry on in hopes that they’ll get a shot with them whether that be companionship through friendship or a romantic relationship. From my perspective, it feels like many attractive women are alone by choice. To be alone by choice is significantly different than being alone because nobody acknowledges your existence. Being alone when you have 50 unread messages from people interested in you is much different than being alone waiting for a notification to pop up from…. Literally anyone. I feel attention starved. I don’t want to come off as paranoid. But it feels as if there is a lot of fear mongering against me behind the scenes meant to manipulate people into feeling that I am the problem, and that in order to protect themselves from me.. that they need to ignore me until I die alone of old age. A sad, slow, and agonizing death appears to await me. Even though I am not suicidal.I am a 22 year old male graduating from college.

Unfortunately. Life happened. She got jealous over my friends and wanted all of my time. We started having more problems and she cheated on me even after isolating me socially. It felt like nothing was enough for her. In the end, we broke up. I’m alone. Having focused on work, school, her and her family the entire 4 years… all I have is the car I got from working, and now I’ll have my degree. Aside from that. I lost everything. And although she lost a few things too. She had her cake and ate it too for most of the relationship. She hooked up with guys and gaslit me when I asked her about it… I just… I feel miserable. I know I’ll be able to meet someone down the line. I know I will. But I’m drowning in the last few assignments I have to do before graduating while suffering from extreme heartbreak and loneliness. One girl got me so far. But in the end. It goes to show that there is no perfect way to go about doing things. Life always catches you off guard. Don’t let go of your friends like I did for a girl who can always just find another dude in 5 seconds…. When a girl breaks up with a guy… she’s always got options…But the guy? He’s usually too depressed and his options are either non existent, busy, or extremely shy/uncomfortable.I’ve had an extremely unique childhood. Suffered from extreme trauma from childhood sexual abuse and violent behavior with my mom and my stepdad at the time. It all came crashing down in the middle of 3rd grade and I cried. Threw a massive temper tantrum until my mom quit her job and homeschooled me for 2 1/2 years from 2010-2012. During this time. I immersed myself with independent research in regards to history, science, religion, politics, and technology on the internet. We had a family PC that had no usage from 8:30-3PM as everyone else in the house was at school. It was a swimming pool of knowledge. I had 2 years of unrestricted access to the internet. I learned of conspiracy theories. I ended up on various different forums. The knowledge was immense to take in. I read a forum that explained Jewish people don’t consume pork because the pig is a human boar hybrid that was genetically engineered to stop the Annunaki from eating humans out in the open and help them develop patience for when to consume their prey. I returned to school in the 6th grade. I had terrible social skills. I was two years behind socially. But in terms of academic knowledge…. I was probably at least 2 years ahead and that’s a conservative estimate. The only subject I had trouble with was mathematics, because I sucked at math and was above average at everything else.. I never got bumped up a grade like normal prodigies. So I always felt lost. Like I didn’t fit in with the rest of my grade. For a long timeframe, I failed with girls who threw themselves at me. I had to give up the whole…”I want someone with the same experience as me when I turned 16.” There was a girl who did. But I missed them. Ended up dating their friend who pressured me into a romantic relationship. They ended up cheating online several times so I dumped them. After a few other romantic moments…I ended up dating the girl I had missed. We were really happy. Her parents were horrible people but they put up a front since there was a boy around the house for the first time according to her. Little by little. I gained their trust and respect. However, I never forgot about the red flags my girlfriend at the time had said about her parents. My best friend wanted to remove them from their household and have her parents take them in. The girl objected because she didn’t want to abandon her parents or her little brother. I spent about 3.5 years with them. They took me in. They were extremely kind and caring for the most part. However. When they became worried about their retirement… as they are not US citizens… they started to come up with ways to monitor and monetize their daughter. They noticed we were having some problems. I met up with an old friend twice who was a female, we hung out as friends and caught up. I suspect they followed us in order to convince my girlfriend at the time I was cheating. A few weeks later. They made my girlfriend dress in Very revealing clothing. She was and still is a very attractive, beautiful, and intelligent woman. So to her parents… they saw dollar signs. They never let her dress revealing around me. But when they brought her to a boy’s house whose mother had money… all of a sudden that didn’t apply to him. He sexually harassed her. A few weeks later. He and his mom came to her house behind my back and he raped her. Nobody cared. They thought it was just a fling. Even though she had blatantly cheated/got raped. As the year went on. She began to drown in self hatred. She spoke of how she felt her father had been raping her in her sleep. She confessed she had found ways to sell herself. She tried to take her life several times and I had to get down on my knees and beg her to live to get her associates degree. She successfully graduated. But when I called out her parents for what they did. They refused to apologize or acknowledge what they did. Instead. They forced her to never speak to me again. They also tried to use fear mongering tactics to convince my now ex girlfriend, and my parents… that I would snap and start killing people.Truly the parents from hell.Look. I get it. Humans are horny horrible animals with no shame most of the time. We do horrible things then go to church, mass, donate money to a charity… or whatever the hell helps ya sleep at night. In my personal opinion. I think that it is extremely healthy to accept yourself for who you are in regards to your sexuality. Many religious people are in denial and in the worst cases actually USE religion to get away with sexual crime that involves underaged children/ forced marriage/surrogacy etcHowever I am appalled that sexual relationships with the significant other of a parents child is normalized on subreddits like these. Yes. Your marriage may not be happy. Yes. You may want something new. Yes your boyfriend’s dad might be hot and has more money than little chuck because he has less life experience. But think about when YOU marry and get old. Would YOU want little Chuck to start cheating on you left and right to get back at the fact you fucked his dad two decades ago? Are you gonna just lie to yourself your whole life and blame Chuck? Goes both ways by the way. Cause I know some of y’all women be down bad for your daughters boyfriends. Before you act on your horny desires… just think about the potential consequences of your actions. Especially if you live in a state where it is extremely hard to get an abortion. I do not think it’s wrong for a 40 year old and a 20 year old to fuck. But I think if you wanna fuck your son’s girl, your daughter’s man, or if you young folks wanna smash your girl’s mom or your boyfriend’s dad… Idk what to tell y’all.. y’all fucked in the head if you actually do it. Thinking and doing are two completely different things. Dear God… for an area of predominantly “normal” people… the general area surrounding Tenafly is INCREDIBLY toxic!!!People have cursed at me for not wanting to leave my car in places it could be towed. Security guards have been abusive. Restaurant owners have laughed at me… specifically the men mostly… and I’ve had a few people give unclear information and get their money back… and complain to me while I am driving so they can justify free food… Andddd GH just rolled out a new system. So I probably won’t be a premier driver for long…. This is my only source of income. I will keep doing it for as long as possible until I graduate and can get another job. I just need money right now to survive… my mom and her boyfriend robbed me blind because they were in love and unfortunately my mom didn’t find work….I have no money… I am extremely stressed out… and nobody seems to care…. The world is so toxic and traumatized right now….Several students… along with myself have complained about the lack of help and communication we received from staff at the dean’s office, finance department, and many other places at baruch. We live in a post 1st amendment world where one can be accused of slander and racism for speaking about issues completely unrelated as a result of gaslighting.There needs to be change. I was treated horribly by the dean’s office and completely disrespected. We the people are paying tax dollars for this type of staff and behavior??? Enough is enough. I think we all have a story of baruch’s staff not helping us much. I am graduating. But for the rest of you guys. This is a problem. Plenty of people happy to take these great government jobs in their place.https://on.soundcloud.com/spBWrZspWKDRpPN16. $EMAN more tech than MVIS. The dollar amount doesn’t matter. The technology does. EMAN should be worth at least 5 billion dollars based on the government contracts alone. In addition. A 5 billion dollar market cap would enable them to leverage their equity to establish a foothold to retain talent and grow even further as a business. This a very. VERY underrated company. Given the economic conditions.. I want something to be optimistic on rather than short.https://on.soundcloud.com/Bp4dVadaHaXtc5nB9.

[(19) Video SparkNotes: William Golding's Lord of the Flies summary - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tXpA3dIEtI) For anyone too lazy to watch the movie or read the book here is a 10-minute video to explain what I mean by “Lord of The Flies Tactics” This book is meant to represent what happens to children who are neglected by their parents. Although some of these children survived on their own.... playing manhunt, hurting people and never facing the consequences of their actions…This became a societal problem because they took these things and brought them into the professional world, business, politics, religion, and most importantly…. the home where future generations are supposed to develop….
    If self justification of behaving in anti social ways is the issue. How does one decide to go to a psychiatrist voluntarily. And how would they portray their issues properly. Wouldnt they not see their behavior and world view as wrong or something that needs fixing.So to you people who got diagnosed by voluntarily going to a psychiatrist, how did it play out?.
