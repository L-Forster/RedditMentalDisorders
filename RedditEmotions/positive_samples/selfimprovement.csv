l**Have you ever thought about this?**
  

  
In a hundred years, in **2123**, there will be none of us, not even our relatives and friends.
  

  
Strangers will live in our homes that we built with a lot of effort and failure. They will have all the stuff we have or throw it in the dumpster. Even the car, for which we spent a fortune, will be lying somewhere in a dump, Our descendants will not remember us and only a few will know who we were. Who among us knows their great-grandfather?

After death, they will remember us for a few more years, then we will be just a portrait on someone's bookshelf (if at all). A few years later our photos and actions will be forgotten. We will not live in the memories of anyone anymore. If you just stopped to think about it one day, you might understand how pointless it is to walk for more and more.
  

  
If we thought and understood that we are just a dot in the history of mankind, let alone the earth or the universe, we would certainly look at our lives and other people differently.
  

  
We always striving for more and more and no time for what really matters.... the moments and the relationships. If we thought about and spent more time HERE AND NOW, we would really enjoy life.
  

  
We would enjoy walks we never had time for. We would love a hug. We would enjoy kisses from our children. In the moments that really count, but we ran out of time. Those would certainly be the most beautiful and best moments to remember and imprinted deep within ourselves. This is how we would fill our lives with joy. And now we fill it with greed, intolerance and hate.
  

  
There is still time. Think about it.1. **Hard-work alone won’t guarantee success — some poor people work harder than all of us.**
  

2. **If you are an adult — your life situation is your responsibility. You made the choices, you face the consequences.**
  

3. **If you want love or approval from someone — you must be okay without it.**
  

4. **Your brain is evolved to keep you safe yet miserable — not happy and content.**
  

5. **Money is hard to earn — you are desperate and miserable because you won’t have patience.**
  

6. **People can be toxic even when they love you — you have to live for yourself.**
  

7. **Negative people don’t have any ill intent— they are just running on autopilot.**
  

8. **Pain is necessary for growth — there is no way around pain.**. 1. **Read: Spend time every day reading books, articles, and other materials to expand your knowledge and vocabulary.**
  

2. **Exercise: Regular physical activity helps to increase brain function and improve overall mental health.**
  

3. **Learn something new: Challenge yourself by taking up a new skill or hobby that requires you to learn and think in different ways.**
  

4. **Write: Keeping a journal or writing regularly can help you organize your thoughts and improve your writing skills.**
  

5. **Meditate: Meditation has been shown to improve focus, attention, and cognitive function.**
  

6. **Get enough sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for memory consolidation and brain function.**
  

7. **Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help improve cognitive function and overall brain health.**
  

8. **Eat a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and other nutrients can help boost brain function.**
  

9. **Challenge your brain: Engage in activities that challenge your brain, such as puzzles, riddles, and brain games.**
  

10. **Surround yourself with positive people: Positive relationships and social support have been linked to better mental health and cognitive function.**. This is a cry for help as it only gets tougher.1. Nobody cares about you, your plans, your goals, or your little dramas. So stop pretending they do, or getting upset when they don't.
  

2. When it comes to reaching your goals, discipline is more important than motivation. If you don't have discipline, you'll never stick to anything.
  

3. You are the only person capable of changing your life; no one can do that for you. The easiest way to change yourself is to change the things you do each day.
  

4. The biggest threat to your progression in life isn't something or someone around you; it's you.
  

5. The key to a successful life lies not in what you know, but in what you do with what you know.
  

6. Failure is just a stepping stone on the road to success.
  

7. You can't change the past, but you can still fuck up your future if you repeat it.
  

8. Success is not about what you accomplish, it's about who you become in the process.
  

9. Your comfort zone is a barren place. Nothing ever grows there.
  

10. Anything in life worth achieving will not be easy to get. If it were, everyone would get what they wanted. Most people give up on their goals when things become too difficult. Don’t be like most people.1. Stop posting everything on social media.
2. Most people don't love you, it's just a symbiotic relationship.
3. Don't force ANYTHING -relationships, conversations, meeting up with someone, etc.
4. Get up every day and find your drive then use it to propel yourself through the day.
5. Money does NOT give you true happiness; just an illusion of it.
6. Most people don't even know what true happiness feels like.
7. Don't outgrow your youth. Live it, at the right time.
8. You can sacrifice a lot for someone you really care about, but they'll still leave you.
9. Pilot your emotions most of the time. Don't let them control you unless need be.
10. Whether you believe in science, religion or nothing at all, death is NOT the end.
11. Invest in good memories whether you have money or not. You'll need them as you grow old.
12. It's all in the mind.
13. Love yourself, but don't forget to reciprocate it to others. Treat everyone with kindness even when they are mean to you. Kindness is strength not weakness.
14. Do good to others and expect nothing in return. It's not a trade.
15. Keep your heart, mind and body clean. Always avoid negative energy.
16. Drink a lot of water OFTEN.
17. Eat healthy - veggies, fruits, yams, etc.
18. Exercise often. Go for a run or hit the gym.
19. In the end, you will realize it's all meaningless. Our endless endeavors to get rich, getting worked up, wanting attention, life and the likes. As we say in our language, " Yote ni vanity."
20. Do not chase anyone who wouldn't do the same for you.
21. Just because she/he looks at you, doesn't mean they LIKE you in that way.
22. That girl/boy that dresses funny, looks funny and talks funny...that "uncool person" in school that nobody wants to hang out or be seen with, ....hate on them now, but you won't believe how good-looking they'll be in a few years.1. ﻿﻿﻿**The less you care about the opinion of others, the more powerful you become.**
  

2. ﻿﻿﻿**Smiling is modern-day magic. Many opportunities will come from the energy you radiate.**
  
﻿﻿﻿
3. **When you know what you want, have a plan to achieve it, and do the work consistently, nothing will stop you.**
  

4. ﻿﻿﻿**When you get loads of rejections, you stop fearing it. This makes you unstoppable!**
  

5. ﻿﻿﻿**Watch how people treat service workers. It'll show you their true colors.**
  

6. ﻿﻿﻿**Seeking out adversity will help us grow more than being in a comfort zone.**
  

7. ﻿﻿﻿**Knowing what you want in life gets you far more than if you didn't.**
  

8. ﻿﻿﻿**Investing in yourself isn't selfish. It's the most worthwhile thing you can do.**
  

9. ﻿﻿﻿**The power of focusing on one thing at a time will change your life.**
  

10. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**The sooner you stop lying to yourself, the quicker you'll be unstoppable.**
  

11. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**Less friends = deeper relationships.**
  

12. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**People who accept suffering achieve greatness. Those who avoid it go nowhere.**
  

13. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**It's not what happens, it's how you react that matters.**
  

14. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**Your life can change tomorrow, if you make the choice to change it.**
  

15. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**The more sacrifices you are willing to make, the more successful you'll become.**
  

16. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**If you believe in yourself as much as you do the people you admire, you'll be unstoppable.**
  

17. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**To be great at anything, you must be consistently good for long enough.**
  
﻿﻿﻿﻿
18. **You are what you say to yourself - change the words you use.**. 1) Stop telling people everything.
  

  
Most people do not care, and some secretly want you to fail.
  

  
2) Choose your friends wisely.
  

  
The fastest way to become better is to surround yourself with better people.
  

  
3) Expect nothing, appreciate everything.
  

  
Be grateful for the little things in your life to find inner peace.
  

  
4) Do your best and trust the process.
  

  
The harder you work, the luckier you will get.
  

  
5) Control yourself, not others.
  

  
Being able to control yourself is true power.
  

  
6) Learn to react less.1. Don't argue, take action.
  

  
2. Don't be smart in front of others.
  

  
3. Don't depend on anyone.
  

  
4. Don't tell your secrets to anyone.
  

  
5. Don't trust everyone.
  

  
6. And value time.

THANK YOU FOR READING. I wanna hear your answers.Mines minecraft prob 6k hours. 1. **Not everyone will like you for being a good person.**
2. **People will hate you just because other people likes you.**
3. **If you don't learn to say no, you will keep doing the things what people says.**
4. **Life will only give you what you deserves.**
5. **If you are talented then also you have to work hard.**
6. **No matter who you are there will always be someone who will hate you.**
7. **You will repeat your own mistakes many times.**
8. **There will be someone who will love you no matter what.**
9. **Relatives can be your enemies sometimes.**
10. **Age doesn't defines maturity.**
11. **Situation will force you to leave everything but that time defines you.**
12. **Self love matters a lot. If you love yourself then you don't need anyone else for anything. You can make yourself happy.**. 1. **Always carry a few coins in your pocket….If someone confronts you with a knife you pull the coins subtly from your pocket and drop them on the floor. The attacker will always look down to the floor upon hearing the coins drop and this will buy you a second or two to turn and run. This can also be used if someone is intent on fighting you and you know you need to land the first blow, it’s a distraction technique.**
2. **Never use an ATM while wearing headphones and if wearing a coat/hoodie, never havethe hood up, both will affect your awareness and makes you more likely to be robbed.**
3. **When entering any room, work out where every available exit and hiding place is. In the event of an emergency you will react a hell of a lot quicker if you have planned scenarios in your head, it will make you far less likely to freeze up. This was something explained to me by an ex-special forces guy I was chatting to at a conference (he was head of security). He was sat at the same table as me, one of those big round ones with 10–12 people on each. I noticed his eyes were never still and he was always glancing at each door, window etc, basically any entrance to that room. I got chatting to him after the conference and asked him about what I had observed. He said “imagine you are at a public event and an armed terrorist storms into the room and starts shooting, most people are going to freeze for the first couple of seconds and that can cost you your life, plan for it to happen and although incredibly unlikely it ever will, you’ll react instantly and it could save your life”**

**(EDIT)  Just a few points in relation to some of the comments, point 1 is more about anangry attacker intent on hurting you not just a mugging, the idea of dropping coins is tocause a distraction in order to turn and run, of course there are a lot of variables but thefew seconds it will buy you could be the difference. I’m also in the UK where it’s extremelyunlikely that the attacker would have a gun. Running away from a knife attacker isalways preferable to trying to disarm them however confident you are in your own selfdefence skills.**

**Point 2 is about awareness (as is point 3). In the UK the most common way to be robbed atan ATM is for the thief to wait until you withdraw cash then they will grab the money andrun, not stand there making demands for you to hand over the cash. You will more bemore likely to fall victim to a grab and run if your peripheral vision is blocked and youcan’t hear a would be thief behind you.**

So I struggle with building connections because I take everything very seriously, I overthink what to say and this is backpilling thing I have since birth literally, If I talk to someone better than me (Looks and some other things If it's clearly presented) and they even say the smallest diss at me I take it very seriously as I subconsciously think this person knows hes better than me, and I get insecure about my worth. but with less attractive people if i they try shit like that i either ignore it or if they piss me off i can literally make them cry. i genuinely believe i have a mental disability, i can't control this shit but when i try to it seems unnatural to me. idk where this horrible mental state came from this weird conditioning, maybe from negative self fulfilling observations. im extremely observed.. **What are the lessons people most often learn too late in life?**

Question Im the only one in my family without one and im just shook, only found out people have one 5 months ago. Im the only one in my family without one and im just shook, only found out people have one 5 months ago.We all know someone who is extremely charismatic, confident, extroverted?, and the most popular and loved person when they enter a room and everyone just wants to be around them!
People who are like this NOW but weren’t always like this, what’s your secret?

Update: THANK YOU TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. You have no idea how much I needed to hear this, I’m almost crying thinking there’s a whole bunch of people online who are willing to help a brother out with no judgment! Thank you.Just got a bike and I wanna take it to gym. What is the best lock? Or is it just better not to park bike in public at any time.Hi everyone! So a rat crawled up under the car and it is somewhere near driver seat side (not inside the car) but under the car where all the cables and mechanical stuff is. 
Only after reaching to work I found out as something stank really bad and I saw a tail hanging. 
How much does it cost to remove this thing (located in Vancouver , Canada) and will it just dry out eventually so I don’t have to worry about spending bank?
Please advise. Thanks!. I just moved here from Toronto. Always loved cycling and since there’s so many nice trails around, I wanna go mountain biking. I’m intrigued to invest $800 on a good MTB but is it even worth it? 
How’s the fall and winter here? I think I’ll love cycling here in the rain (imma be in my feels). Do you all spend thousands of dollars worth of bike and only use it for 4 months?. I seem to avoid disagreements or discomfort aura - hence often end up agreeing without even mentioning my point. Basically, how to stop being people’s pleaser?

Let’s hear it from y’all’s experiences!. So I’m amazing at one on one conversations with people. I ask questions which make people think and easy to connect with on an interpersonal level. HOWEVER, last night after work, we all went for some drinks. (I’m still new to the company so I’m slightly shy already) but I was hardly able to utter any word. 
I had the same things to say and ask like others, but I still could not speak as much as I would have wanted to. This made it easy for others to talk over me (even if they didn’t mean to). And I don’t wanna be the guy who just observes and listen when everyone is having a great time. Please help!. Hi! I wanted to ship my car from Toronto to Calgary and just wanted to hear from people who would have done the same. 
How much does it cost?
How long does it take? 
Is it safe? Your car doesn’t get dents/scratches?


UPDATE: Actually just drove it myself. It honestly wasn’t as difficult as you’d think. If anyone is looking to move and like roadtrips, you can do this! You save so much money + good views!. How’s the Horse riding scene here in Vancouver. Is it affordable?. So I like to smoke some sativa and really grind out on any work I might have. School/chores, anything productive. However, once all that is done, it’s very very difficult to not get hungry and keep craving Nutella and all which makes me fat and miserable the next morning. 

Can anyone please suggest how to stop and also would also like to hear if anyone here smokes and lifts weights and how was your experience with cutting calories and getting high?. I haven't been bullied a lot, but there are times when people have fun of me and clearly taken me for granted. Do you know those kids at school who are very charming and confident that even the bully holds respect for them? What is it that makes them like that? How can I be like that?. What are some of the daily habits that I can practice which will make me a better, successful and confident person?. I really wanna get better at consistency with reading! I thoroughly enjoy reading these books as there's so much to learn! A great tip I have received is to carry it with me at all times (backpack, car, bus, etc). Are there any other tips that will make me read books without feeling like a task? 

I have one of my closest friends whose life I have seen drastically change for the better! All because of reading books! I really look up to him for this.Does anyone have a perfect schedule? What's it like?. I am curious to see if there are people who smoke weed on daily basis and it has a positive effect in life? Like are you living the ideal life, making enough money, are you happy? are you organised? 

Do you workout on a daily basis too? What's it like to have a balanced life like that?.Not much else to say. Lost my bestfriend and the girl I thought I was going to marry in the same day. Already cut them both off pemanately. I am an amateur MMA fighter, full-time student, employed, and actively go to therapy, so I have plenty to do to keep me busy. Looking for helpful advice on how to keep my mind healthy, genuinely feel like I am going insane when everything is quiet around me.Looking for sauna suit recommendations, need to cut about 10 lbs short notice for a tournament and would love to get one. I like the boxraw and fighthaus suits at $110, but was looking to see if anyone knew a cheaper yet similar alternative.

Thanks in advance!. I am looking to purchase my first BJJ gi, and have been looking into Hayabusa’s. They have a few different options (lightweight, ascend lightweight, goorudo 3, ultra lightweight). Anyone have any good recommendations for any of these? If not for Hayabusa, any reccomendations from other companies like Sanabul? Looking for something light and breathable.

Thanks in advance, cheers!. MMA requires a crazy amount of gear, and I am looking for a large duffel bag to fit all of my needs. I have two sets of gloves, shin guards, shoes, and the usual smaller equipment. Will soon have headgear as well.

Anyone have a good experience or have recommendations on solid gear travel bags? Would prefer if they were sold on amazon.
Thanks in advance.i’ve (39M) recently posted about how my wife (37F) cheated on me with a 19 year old girl and how she’s known her since she was 15. (it’s a very long story if you want to hear it go to my profile). lots of people have brought up the fact that they believe my wife was grooming her and that i should take it to the police and get full custody of my 2 seven year old daughters. i’m here to see what i can do with the very little proof that i have. the only proof i really have is that when i intially caught my wife cheating i asked her how long they’ve known eachother and she said for 1 year. after going through her secret second phone i found instagram messages between the 2 of them from 2019. the messages aren’t sexual, it’s mostly just small talk but they do end up exchanging snapchat handles and never talking on instagram again.i found my (39M) wife (37F) cheating on me. a we’ve been married for 13 years and have 2 girls together (7 year old twins). i’ve known for a while things weren’t right. we haven’t had sex for around 8-9 months. at first, everytime id come on to her she’d push me away and say she wasn’t “in the mood right now”. after a while i mentioned this to her and it turned into a huge argument in which she flat out told me she didn’t want to have sex with me anymore. i was intiallly devastated but kinda of brushed it off as something she said simply out of anger. (i had believed she wasn’t having sex with me because she was too stressed to orgasm. she’d done this previously)


 a couple weeks later tho, i found her second phone. although i wasn’t able to get into it because it had a password, i knew at that moment that there was someone else. it broke my heart but i didn’t bring it up with her. in the following weeks i became extremely suspicious. especially since she works from home and i do not. i started lying to her about when i had work so that i could see if she was having another guy over. 


days later a silver benz pulls into our driveway. around 10 minutes later my wife gets in. i couldn’t see the other person because of the tints. they drove off to what i later found out was a hibachi restaurant. i didn’t follow the car like i had planned on. after i saw her get into the car i couldn’t even bring myself to drive. i sat there and just cried. i cried in the car until they pulled back up. the car sat parked for a few minutes in my driveway and i walked up and opened the drivers door. i want to say this, i’ve always been a person who thought it was stupid to get mad at the mister/mistress when it was your partner that cheated but i didn’t know how to react and in a cloud of anger i pulled the driver out of the car, ready to fight. then i realized that it was a girl. 


it didn’t click for me at that moment. i just stood there confused. my wife was screaming at me to stop and she got out of the car and immediately started crying and apologizing to me. i pulled my wife inside of the house and made her explain things. she basically told me she was gay and she was going to tell me but she didn’t know how to/she was too ashamed to. everytime i tried to ask about the mistress she started deflecting my questons and pretty much said it’s not important.


 i told her i knew about the second phone she had and asked to go through it. she got extremely defensive and said no. things got loud and ugly very fast. it was a lot of screaming and crying and i will admit we both put our hands on eachother. i ended up getting the second phone from under her night stand and she attacked me. i grabbed her by her neck and told her to open the phone or i would tell her family she’s been cheating on me with a woman. (for some context: her family is extremely conservative and does not support or allow that in the family. which is why i did understand why she’d be afraid to tell me but that does not excuse leading me on, lying, and cheating on me) 


she gave me the password when i started calling her dad from my phone. i sat going through her phone for almost 2.5 hours. to keep things short she was messing around with a 19 year old girl named Dallas. yes, she cheated on me with a teenager. i asked her when they met and she said a year ago but i actually found instagram messages between them from 2019 meaning she’s known this girl since she was at least 15. 


they sent eachother nudes pretty often. but what hurt the most were the messages where they’d be planning to meet up. my wife would literally just send this girl a photo of my schedule. and oddly enough that hurt way worst than all the nudes and all the dirty talk. in messages from earlier this year they talked about how she was going to tell me everything, and how they were going to get married after Dallas had graduated. the photos were even worst. 70% of the gallery was nudes. there were vids of them doing sexual things in MY house, in MY bed. there were photos of this girl with my kids at bowling alleys, malls, skating rinks, parks, you name it. she was even with my kids when i went away to see my sick mother back in february.


 a couple hours later, things start to simmer down. i told her to leave the house because i couldn’t look at her face anymore. she called Dallas to pick her up and over the next few weeks she moved in with her. we’ve been separated since april but aren’t divorced yet. her family has no clue about any of this as i’ve made an agreement with her. as long as she doesn’t allow her gf around my kids i wouldn’t tell her family. we have been recently trying to get a divorce and do it as smoothly as possible. 


like i said before i don’t want my kids around her girlfriend but i’ve brought her up around them and it’s clear that they rly like her. i can’t tell them what happened without making my wife look like a villain so now my kids think i’m the villain. it also doesn’t help that Dallas is doing pretty well for herself. we are very different ppl.


 i’m a white guy who grew up pretty poor and worked for everything i have. she’s biracial with a blk mom and white dad and all she’s ever known is money. i’m not sure what she does for a living but i do know her and her family are very wealthy people. she often buys my girls toys and things they ask for which is why i believe they gravitate to her. i don’t like it. i don’t like her. and i wish she would just go away. i wish i could just have my family back. even though it was my wife that cheated it feels like everything is Dallas’ fault. i wish my wife would’ve never met her. sorry for the length of this. i just need a place to vent.i found my (39M) wife (37F) cheating on me. a we’ve been married for 13 years and have 2 girls together (7 year old twins). i’ve known for a while things weren’t right. we haven’t had sex for around 8-9 months. at first, everytime id come on to her she’d push me away and say she wasn’t “in the mood right now”. after a while i mentioned this to her and it turned into a huge argument in which she flat out told me she didn’t want to have sex with me anymore. i was intiallly devastated but kinda of brushed it off as something she said simply out of anger. (i had believed she wasn’t having sex with me because she was too stressed to orgasm. she’d done this previously)


 a couple weeks later tho, i found her second phone. although i wasn’t able to get into it because it had a password, i knew at that moment that there was someone else. it broke my heart but i didn’t bring it up with her. in the following weeks i became extremely suspicious. especially since she works from home and i do not. i started lying to her about when i had work so that i could see if she was having another guy over.

There’s this romance movie I’ve watched but I can’t remember the name. 
 
Basically, two teenagers fall in love, but the guy has to fight for the fathers approval. The Girl’s Father takes him out to determine his approval of the boy. The father makes him shoot a glass bottle, and if the bottle broke, he would approve of him dating his daughter. The boy shoots it and it doesn’t break, and seems to be disappointed. The father goes over to the bottle, and notices that the bullet went straight through and didn’t break the bottle, so he approved of him. 

I’m pretty sure the guy and the girl end up growing old together in the movie, but I can’t remember for sure. 

THIS MOVIE USE TO BE ON NETFLIX!!. Okay so like, i’m trying to connect with more people (in-person&online) but i’m struggling. I do online school so I don’t get out much, so online friends it is I suppose. 
  
  I usually spend my free time crafting or watching TWD, and I’m a masked men lover like oh my 🤌🏻 I’m also interested in sport bikes!! Also, I live in usa.This event happened about a year ago, but there’s something about it that makes me go back and think about it.

  My mom went into my room to put something in there about a year ago, and came out with a notebook. I didn’t think much of it, so I let her use it. She went through it and got rid of any pages that I had used, but stumbled across a page where I wrote four words. It said ‘I love you mom’ in big letters, and there was nothing else to it. 

  She had no clue, but I remembered writing that note because I thought I was about to end my life. I was only eight years old when I wrote it, and suffering with some of the worst depression I’ve ever battled. She still proudly hangs that note on the fridge, but it brings back memories that have scarred me. 

 I was mentally abused by my mother, yet she was the last person I thought about before trying to end it when I was eight. I (16F) sometimes really wish I just got it over with when I was young.I found a picture of me as a baby and I told her I love her. Something awoken in me and I felt years of strife and self hatred leave me. I imagined her alone, screaming, in pain as her parents neglected her and yelled at her. I told her I found why she was in pain and that I am healing her every second of the day now. I told her I promised I would help her and see her for the struggling child she was. I told her how she deserved a mother that cares about her and that I would never create another child to suffer like she did. I told her why her cheeks were puffy, her belly bloated and in pain, why her head hurt, why she was always anxious and paranoid. I told her it wasn't her fault and thanked her for persevering and allowing me to help so many others now. 

I love you baby girl. I'm your real mom. 

Love,

Momma Sarah <3. This guy I went on a date with and hooked up with was a huge red flag the entire time. I was terrified to say no and felt coerced into having sex with him. The whole situation was bunk. His car got towed while we were walking in the park. We walked back to my place which was close and he was gonna spend the night. He had no money or ride to get his car and guilted me when I said I'd catch an Uber home and didn't want him over. He slept in my twin bed while I stayed awake. Eventually, I got the courage up and had my taser and pepper spray in my pocket when I told him to leave my home at 6 a.m. Luckily he left. I blocked him on all SMs and my phone. He called (I could still see his calls in my recent calls) multiple times for the past week. Tonight at 9:15 pm he showed up at my door and rang the doorbell not once. Not twice. But EIGHT times. I didn't answer and was dead quiet. My cat was frozen in fear the whole time, she knew what was up. I could see him through the peephole. Once he left, I called the police. They said next time to call them if I see him near my apartment and they can issue a criminal trespassing on him and he won't be allowed here again else he gets arrested. What's the scariest part? My apartment has a key card/app that ONLY residents have access to. Either one of my neighbors left our downstairs door open or they let him in. I'm going to GRIPE to management tomorrow morning to get on to these idiots who leave the door open/ let anyone in. 

The dude could not take a no. To make it amply clear to him, I called on *67 to never come to my apartment again. Like hell, I wasn't unblocking his unhinged ass. I'm done dating men at this point. I can't stand the manipulation any longer.

Day 1 Update since stalker boy showed up: It's approaching 9:15 p.m. I feel my heart racing. I was able to have a very productive day due to this heightened anxiety giving me energy. But now that it's about my bedtime again, I'm starting to get very adrenal. He has not shown up since, thank the Lords.

Day 2 Update: Very pissed today. Trauma response I assume. He still hasn't showed up.

Day 4 (or 5?) Update: The dude called again at the ripe old hour of midnight. Also got a call from a private number (not sure if it was him but I never get calls from private numbers). Both were automatically blocked. He left no voicemails. I will update again if he calls more or shows up. I still have not seen him around my place. I am starting to calm down and feel better.

Day 6 update. Psychotic episode

Day 7 update: over the hardest part. I'm never dating men again. Anyone else have dreams of eating gluten and then feeling horrible in the dream? They are recurrent nightmares for me and I'm sick of them. Gluten has thoroughly traumatized me I think. And its always donuts or cake. ALWAYS. Why donuts or cake? I don't want them irl but in the dream its like this craving from outer space takes over and I can't control myself. I have been very happy being gluten free and impressed with the options in my area. Yet brain still has these nightmares. Idk if there are any tips anyone has but I am open to suggestions to fix this once and for all.I have a work gap since 2017 and employers keep asking me why. Its from disability. Idk if I should disclose i was disabled? For reference, I'm in a very conservative state. Lots of boot straps that apparently never pulled me up here. I'd rather not go through some organization but I will if the rejection continues. I currently tell them I was in school (true) the first two years, then gig work after that. They ask more about the gig work and I kinda freeze and fumble my way through it. 

Advice needed. Thanks.How do I add LOTD to Vortex manually since there is only a manual install option? I have come across ZERO other mods that only have manual install and have no clue. I tried selecting every last file in the LOTD download that is in my Data folder and Vortex keeps telling me that they aren't the right file. 

&#x200B;. Does anyone know when it'll be updated? Or have the admins abandoned it? I use the one on Steam, should I use the zip file? 

Thanks, Dovahkiins.. No one will ever know your struggle, your joys, your experiences. You can try to bring a child here in an attempt for someone to know you but most parents I see have kids end up with an entirely different set of mutated fucked genes and different fucked experiences. We are very much different from our parents, thus our kids will be very different from us. There is no "mini me". You're just creating someone to suffer the 9-9 grind just to pay for an overpriced apartment and never ever own a home like you may have been privileged to get. And thats for first world countries. What about the third world countries where you have even less? Life is filled with strife and there is literally no point to force someone else here to suffer with you, at your hand. Does it fill you with emptiness, dread that you'll die alone? Well who's to say your kids will thank you enough for making them suffer here to even be there for you when you finally get relief from this hell? Who's to say they will even care about you at all? Many people I know despise their cruel parents for forcing them here to suffer and do everything they can to go no contact. You have no guarantee. 

So no, society, I'm not fucking excited when new humans are popped out. No I don't want to put on a fake smile because lying is super hard for me and drains me to no end. No I'm not happy my brother is having twins. Lets change the subject. Its finally chilly here in the south, let's talk about something we all can enjoy, ok? Because being an aunt is not something I give two shits about and you reminding me of that reality does nothing but drain the life out of me. 

I am codependent no more and will not people please and walk on fucking eggshells. My feet are bleeding as is. 

Rant *the fuck* over. Thanks for coming to my heated Ted Talk.I went vegan two years ago. It made me an entirely different person. I have never quite been the egotistical type, always hated myself due to BPD. But when I went vegan, I switched into what I can only describe as a moralistic narcissist. I remember (barely, I do NOT have the genes for a vegan diet) telling my brother how much better I was than him. I just spoke with him over the phone and his wife is pescatarian with twins. They're healthy (according to doctors, so grain of salt) as of 20 weeks now. But I'm so scared for them and now feeling overwhelming guilt and shame for ever telling my dear brother I was better than him and shaming him. He has eaten less animal products since and now that I'm firmly anti vegan and eat half my plate as meat, I feel beyond disgusting with my vegan self. 

Just ranting. I'm in tears over this, it breaks my heart how disgusting I've behaved in the past due to my mental health issues. I just want to not feel 10000x what everyone else feels. Its isolating.Can't find any childfree INTJs irl. Yall are my favorite. 

-Lonely sad CF ENFP. I'm a recovered addict who still smokes cigarettes. I heard a lot that marijuana is the gateway drug but I see most addicts smoke cigarettes and not all have done weed. I wonder if cigarettes are the true gateway drug.Schizophrenia is acting up. The patch seems to not be working well for warding them off like cigarettes used to do. Probably this awful insomnia. Itd be worse if I took the patch off so please stop coming at me about it ok? We are supposed to respect those who use NRT. 

Anyways I did make it a week I guess. Wish nicotine wasn't so fucking helpful for me.Just wondering if there are any actually reputable supplements for shrinking benign tumors.I have tried all the vitamins, minerals, herbs I know of (thats over 50 yall) and nothing is knocking this insomnia. I take the patch off an hour before bed and still can't sleep. I do not drink caffeine. I do not eat before bed. 

I still. Can't. Sleep. 

Argh.Yay! 4 days down. Its getting easier. Might try going without the patch sooner than later.Still using the patch. Cravings are really minimal. I think this will work. 

Def not losing my mind and already broke the hand to mouth habit.Round 2.I've been a smoker for 10 years now. I had an MRI of my pituitary and it is enlarged. Doctors ignored me. I went to a functional doctor/medical doctor (she is both) and she tested my pituitary hormones. All were in range but on the far lower end. But my IGF-1 was very elevated. I have yet to speak with her yet, I saw the results myself. But that scares me so badly, I read it increases cancer growth. I broke down into tears and threw out every last bit of nicotine in my home. I know that this may be a bad test read or something relatively harmless but I don't care. I'm done being scared that my f-cking smoking is causing my health issues (physical and mental). I'm done with the excuses. And I'm f-cking sick of being sick. Enough is enough, addict mind! Good the f-ck riddance! 

My clean date/time is 9/24/23 6:00pm on the dot. I'm at an hour now and the stupid obsessive hyperfixated thoughts are already torturing me. But I tell them I don't know whats wrong with me and it could lead to or even be cancer! So shut the f-ck up and make me a b-tch then. Idgaf I am not dying to a f-cking cancer stick. NOT TODAY. NOT EVER. 

Sorry for the rage, I've damn near had it!. I'm in a flashback right now, our apartment fire alarm just went off for the 3rd time in a few weeks. Firefighters say its some wiring issue. I live with my sweet older cat and her meows trigger me into a full-blown panic attack when these go off. I had to take her down three flights of stairs and out into the public and she was shaking, screaming, crying. It hurts me so much. I almost lost another cat in the past to a fire and every time these damn things go off, my heart is pounding like a drum in a marching band. I'm sick to my stomach, about to throw up, but trying not to. 

I'm so sick of these big corporate apartment complexes not giving a shit about us residents and not fixing blatantly obvious, terrifying issues. There's so many layers to unpack here. They should have to pay for the therapy I'm gonna need if this shit continues. I'm livid.. "Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding. The cretins cloning and feeding."

Never heard a song like this. 

Thought I would share it with yall. I wonder if there's more songs like this? Have a good day! 

https://youtu.be/sVt1Dy_LblQ?si=3fxFcU19yFpg8578. I have a date tomorrow with a woman. We are going to a drag event. I have never tried dating women despite being bisexual. Wish me luck. 

Any advice is incredibly helpful. I've only been with abusive men so this is very new to me, and scary. I really don't want to bring my trauma with men into a relationship. I have been through therapy and am better now, but I still can't shake the self doubt and anxiety.

Edit: date got canceled. But thanks for the advice. :). Maybe my search has ended? He is getting a vasectomy.. I am overjoyed. CF men do exist!!! Yay!!! 

Sorry just really fucking excited. Okay so hear me out. If you don't have an Aldi's near you, then skip this post. Nearly every Aldi's I've been to has the best prices on GF products around. They also stock a ton of them in comparison to other grocers. They don't really advertise and rely on word of mouth. I know that if there is a greater demand for GF products, then prices will slowly come down. If you can do it, I say we protest everyone else and exclusively shop at Aldi's (or Costco because they're great too) for GF products at least, and all groceries ideally. Aldi's is German owned and I can actually walk out of there without selling my left kidney and inflating like a balloon even during the roughest inflationary periods during the pandemic. 

Don't forget to bring a quarter and your own shopping bags.

Edit: for reference, I'm in Dallas TX. If your store doesn't have any products, then I would chose elsewhere of course.“Don’t wait for motivation to do something, just do it and the motivation will come” - a book I read

I don’t know if these quotes will help anybody, but maybe they will, please comment any advice or good quote’s you’ve heard in your life, they can come from anywhere, even if it’s something everyone has heard before, share it!.I’m 36f and I always wanted kids & a family. I live in a city where it’s nearly impossible to meet a likeminded partner. Life is the same everyday; I go to work, and come back, and occassionally hang out with the colleagues after work. I feel hopeless as I’m old and probably won’t meet a proper partner ever. I kinda want to “quit” this life because it has been the same, and it’s been boring. I feel like I failed at the most fundamental part of life, which is having a lifelong partner, and therefore there’s no point in going on.I've been working on my alignment with the Universe and consistent with my meditation & visualisation practice. However, I've seen a lot of my wishes fullfilled for other people. I even saw the person I liked dating someone that looks just like me. I am clueless why all of these are happening all of a sudden and what the universe is trying to tell me. His has been a big mysterious question for me. I think I am doing something wrong, and those manifestations are not happening to me, but not sure where I'm wrong. I'd greatly appreciate your insights.I have long hair that’s damaged but not bleached. My hair is extremely dry, crisp to touch, tangles a lot but doesn’t have split ends. I read a lot of horror stories about olaplex 3 where people lost their hair. Someone commented it was because they had undyed hair and olaplex 3 was made for bleached hair. Any opinion on that?.

I read a lot of horror stories about olaplex 3 where people lost their hair. Someone commented it was because they had undyed hair and olaplex 3 was made for bleached hair. Any opinion on that?. The type of acne caused by sebum production (with a level of hormones in the healthy average) can be cured by exfoliating the dead skin cells to open up the closed comedones and we have AHA/BHAs and Retinoids to do that. Do we have any other options to open up the cc's? I have been using retinoids (I used tretinoin and tazorac) and it's been 2 yrs. Both acids and retinoids still peel my skin even though I  moisturize the hell out of my skin. I use LRP cicaplast, I slug my face with Vaseline at night, I also use a rich moisturizer (bioderma) prescribed by my derm. What do you suggest to open up cc's and get rid of the sebum stuck in there?. Hi, I have hyperpigmentation prone skin and my derm told me to use a tinted sunscreen (light color) from bioderma and it’s looks too warm/bronze on my pale skin. I tried Avene, La roche posay, and other tinted sunscreens as well but they are all too warm. I think that’s because they all oxidize on the skin dur to iron oxides. Although I don’t want to put a foundation everyday, this color difference makes me put on foundation on top of the sunscreen. Mu foundations are not heavy coverage so they don’t help much either. I also don’t want to put on a heavy coverage foundation everday. I am clueless please help. Hi!

I don't shampoo my hair very often (shampoo every 4 or 5 days and do the mask after shampoo, wait, and rinse).

P.S: I don’t wash them with hot water.Hi! I still have closed comedones after a total of 10 months of retinoid (tretinoin then tazoretene) use. Is it normal? I recently started salicylic & glycolic acid exfoliation (LP effaclar serum) and that may have given me the closed comedones with some of them with inflammation but in theory, my comedones should have been pretty clear and exfoliated after 10 months of retinoid use and shouldn't have closed comedones with these acids, no?

Is it normal to still have closed comedones or is there anything wrong?
Thank you!

One night Tazoretene, next Azelaic acid (20%), next night nothing

I very recently started LRP effaclar serum for exfoliation, once a week.I don't find myself attractive and don't have confidence in myself. People always tell me how I am unaware of my beauty. I see women suggesting fake it till you make it. How do I fake a self-confidence? What should I do to act like I think I'm beautiful? Apologies, English is not my first language.The girl that blocked me apparently unblocked me everywhere, shoulld I message her asking why she blocked me?. So from all the comments, I get it, it was mistake on my part to chase after her but the fact that we agreed to meet there and she made that "disgusted" face the moment she saw me makes it clear that she blocked me due to my ugly face, not because I chase after her. I'm sure she would love it if a good looking guy was chasing after her. Looks matter the most, it always has been. How do I move on with this situation and get my shit together?. So, this all started when I messaged her on instagram. We started texting each other regularly, she hadn't seen my face completely and so she asked for meeting irl. We met near a coffee shop, and guees what happeneed the moment she saw me, she made that "disgusted" face and tried physically running away. I had good hygiene and everything but god damn when this happened I knew I was ugly. Still, I somehow catched up to her and started a conversation, she made an excuse saying she had works to do and again guess what happened next, she blocked me, and people still say it's not about looks and all about confidence. Life sucks being ugly, I feel hopeless after this incident, what should I do?. I am considering plastic surgery for my unconventional face, this face has made me suffer so much, people tease/bully me, girls ignore me and the list goes on. I'm planning to soon have otoplasty for my protruded ears, rhinoplasty for my big nose and jaw surgery for my weak jaw. Is it worth it?. I am considering plastic surgery for my unconventional face, this face has made me suffer so much, people tease/bully me, girls ignore me and the list goes on. I'm planning to soon have otoplasty for my protruded ears, rhinoplasty for my big nose and jaw surgery for my weak jaw. Is it worth it?. I think I'm really ugly, and people have confirmed it too. This ugly face has ruined my life, people tease/bully me, girls show zero attention to me, I feel lonely. I get so depressed seeing some of my close friends easily get girls and hookup regularly while I'm  here struggling to even approach a girl due to this hideous face. Seriously, life sucks being ugly but there is still some part of me that says that no matter how hard it gets, I won't give up. How do i fix my problems and self-improve?. Were they rude?.So, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little over ten years now. And we have a daughter who is 6y. A couple of days ago I noticed she was starting to get cold against me so I thought that I should be a little romantic and spontaneous. So I ordered a huge bouquet of flowers, and crafted a little note book wich she could redeem "free massages" from me, i even bought some massage oil. 

She came home later that day and I gave her the bouquet and the notebook. Not even a thank you..
After maybe an hour she came and gave me a hug. I suggested that we could watch a movie and be cozy on the couch. Yeah sure, she says. But doesnt even sit near me the whole movie. Later I grabbed her and hugged her. And asked what it was. 

"-My coworkers and I have so much in common. And you and I are so different from each other. We don't even like the same things. And I don't have feelings for you anymore"  

I got so heartbroken I can't even describe it. My heart sank to the bottom of my stomach, and all I could think of was that I really don't want our daughter to be raised in two households. 

 I have not eaten anything in 4 days now. I've dropped 8kg weight, and my hunger is nowhere to be found. I don't have any friends to talk to. And I dont have a job to go to. Cause I hade some mental illness a year ago. So I was pretty much already at rock bottom when she dropped the nofeelingsnuke. 
My only way now is up, I have to be strong and try to see the positive in this. 

This is not the whole story only a part of it. And this is the first time I vent about anything to anyone. I don't seek attention or help. (Tho kind words are always welcoming) 

I'm sorry for broken sentences and words. English is not my first language.
Thank you for reading my confusing post. I don't plan to harm myself in anyway or anything like that. 
Have a great day whoever you are ❤️.I used to be worrying a lot. Worry about whether or not I'll make it. But in front of my partner, I was always "yeah we're going to make it man", it's definitely going to happen but at the back... Shit man, are we going to make it?

It took me a long time before I discovered the power of voice journaling. I know it sounds stupid. Who the hell wants to talk to themselves weirdo. I had the same thoughts as you. When I tried it out myself, I didn't *just* kill my anxiety (most of the time), I also managed to fall asleep faster.

This is honestly probably the fastest way to accept something that happened or may or may not happen. I hear they always talk about you have to learn to accept it. But how? How the hell do you accept something, you know you have to but how the hell!?

If you're anxious about a kidney transplant, whether or not you're going to be successful, whether or not you're going to make it... You probably won't make it. I say that not to be discouraging but because I really don't know. Nor do you.

You don't have to be passive about it either. You know you'll make it but u can't predict whether or not it's 100%, all u can do now is to just grind N know u done your very best. Voice journaling may help you accept that.

**Tip**: If voice journaling doesn't help, u may want to look for a community whom u feel connected with everyone in there. It's hard to find one these days, if u can't, create your own 1 like what I did.

**Edit**: Just to note though, the kidney transplant is not an analogy lol, I got it from a member from my community. She literally told me she was going to give her kidney away to her *ex-husband.* N I'm like woah... N she posted a question in the discord asking help to manage her anxiety.

N that's when I was like huh, maybe this might help her? N her reply was:

"So far so good! I feel a lot less troubled!
 Thank you for the really good advice!"

Definitely warmed my heart to see that. Such a small suggestion but such a big impact...**The Habit Loop**. This small principle dictates why you're not able to stick with meditating. Why you're not able to go to the gym and pump the iron. It also dictates why you're not able to stop playing games, watching porn (To a certain extent of course.)

* **Cue** (The indicator of a reward)
* **Craving** (The wanting of a reward)
* **Response** (The moving to get the reward)
* **Reward** (The reward itself)

Read an article about the habit loop, understand it. It will change your life. It goes something like this, when I wanted to stop using \[insert ur addiction\] as a stress release, I had to slowly reprogram my brain. I had to ask what was the cue, which in our example is stress. N the craving is to release stress. Then the response is to get the reward of releasing stress through \[whatever addiction\]

Then you change it. Instead of doing what u want to do, pre-plan exactly what you would do when you become stressed, in my case, it was put on headphones N listen to my fav music, at first ur brain will ask you wth r u doing, u should be doing \[Addiction\] N when u actually released stress, u have started to have ur brain understand... Oh... So listening to music releases stress...

*In summary to make something a habit, just ask yourself*:

**How do I make it obvious?** 

**How do I make it attractive?** 

**How do I make it easy?** 

**How do I make it satisfying?**

You do NOT need to satisfy all criteria, but the more the better of course, this takes time to learn how to be fast at building habits instantly for example, I found out I keep forgetting about my pillow when I go down to meditate, so I just placed the pillow in front of my door - easy. I will never forget it anymore.

Or maybe apples, just put them outside so you will actually eat it since it's right there and perhaps eat it after brushing your teeth, it makes it more satisfying imo.

**Note**: I wrote this post because a member of my community told me he also red about Atomic Habits and it changed his life. N that's what inspired me to write about this post. N even on Reddit, I hear many people say it changed their lives.It always took me 1 to 3 to 4 hours for me to fall asleep each night. Not anymore.

1. **Externalize your thoughts** (I have to say Journaling didn't help me at all, writing on hand just didn't work for me... Even if I did it for an hour... So I just started talking to a recorder... For maybe an hour and when my head hit the pillow, my head felt like an empty bin... No thoughts whatsover)
2. **Relax after your externalize** (There was another problem, I still couldn't fall asleep because after no thinking for 5 mins, I will still be too tense to fall asleep - thus making me be awake from overthinking again... Either Progressive Muscle Relaxation or Meditate before you sleep ATLEAST 10 mins... There's no other way - no cute answers here sorry.)
3. **Relax your fears** (Idk about you but... I feel unsafe in a black out room... That's y I leave some soft background calming piano music to allow me to feel safe and not tense as if there's something else in the room... Not too loud otherwise it will keep you awake)
4. **Don't allow your body to wake you up** (Don't drink any form of liquid before your sleep for at least 2h... You save yourself from having to wake up because you need to pee.)
5. **Marshmallow Strategy** (Take a **warm** ass shower right before you sleep... You will feel blissful and fall asleep much faster than usual)
6. **Shh....** (Mute everything, no notifications, no distracting devices or any sort of distractions in your room... Only for sleeping... No lights...)
7. **Falling to heaven** (Fall to your bed ONLY and ONLY when you start feeling tired... I noticed sometimes I will stay up till 1am because I am excited about reading something... Then stay up whatever - You trying to fall asleep will be impossible if you fall asleep thinking... Taylor Swift Taylor Swift Taylor Swift.)

And if you want more tips on sleeping better - look at u/Hmm_would_bang comment, recommend it.

**If you still cannot fall asleep fast, no problems.**

Just take a piece of paper, write. Ask yourself "**WHY**" multiple times. That's how I discovered my main problem was not being able to externalize my thoughts fast enough since overthinking is the main problem.

Why can't I fall asleep?

Because I overthink a lot.

Why do I overthink?

I overthink because there's a lot of things in my mind.

Why do I have a lot of things in my mind?

Because I have a lot of responsibilities and things to do.

Okay... Then how do I stop overthinking?

**Then you ask yourself... What's the root cause?**

What's the underlying solution of overthinking?

Oh well... Externalizing your thoughts? Okay then - move on to what are you doing to externalize your thoughts. You may just be using the wrong **form** of the solution. I know I was. (After a long time)

I was using Journaling and what was the main **function** of Journaling...?

Right... Externalizing your thoughts... So what are the different forms of externalizing your thoughts...? Right... Talking to someone... Voice Journaling... Sketching your worries...

**Oh.**. * **Books are kings**

If you seriously SERIOUSLY want to obsessively (like me) improve your life... Please... Understand that Youtube, Courses or whatever the hell on the internet is... Incomparable towards... Books... I've learned 10000x more from a book than Youtube, Articles, Courses **combined**. And I know why you don't want to read... Because it's boring... But that's also why they're king, it's because no one wants to read... (Some people in the comments were saying it depends on the learning style of someone... But honestly... It really doesn't matter what your learning style because... If you truly read a book "*Ofc not just any but good ones*" VS 5 YT videos on the subject... U would see the difference yourself... Ofc u can only do this experiment if u implement everything)

u/ExaltFibs24 mentioned I didn't mention about taking notes while you're reading and that's absolutely correct, you must note-take while you read and actually do something with it otherwise it's pretty much the same as watching Youtube. (Thanks for mentioning it!)

* **When you get rid of all addictions... Life starts going YOUR way**

This - I know is hard. I've struggled with Porn, Gaming, Anime, Netflix and K-Drama etc etc so I know bro. It's **hard** but. But after you cross the stage of getting rid of all distractions.. Ho... Everything starts to shine... Suddenly the hard work becomes easier... Suddenly the book on your shelf looks enticing... (For serious enthusiasts... Atomic Habits Book is your best friend to help you break them.)

* **Taking Action was honestly my biggest problem**

I'll be serious here. The reason you watch Youtube to improve yourself is because you're too lazy to exert the effort to read a book on it. (Ofc I know not everyone) How many Youtube Videos have you watched and how many have you implement? Once you answer that - you will understand what's going on here. Honestly if I'll be real - even though u din read books N just implemented from YT videos, your life will still improve massively.

I've watched thousands of Self-Improvement YT videos myself - Implemented them once N then forgotten about it. I've also red hundreds of articles and never implemented any of them either. It shows it wasn't the knowledge that was the problem here - it was my inaction. I didn't have a system to organize that information (Those serious guys can look into Personal Knowledge Management Books to start with - I recommend How To Take Smart Notes or Building A Second Brain as a starter)

N u need to also understand that Youtube is a money making machine... They profit from you staying on their platform and every Youtuber knows that - so that's exactly what they do - keep you stuck in the platform (Ofc I know that there a couple Youtubers who are genuinely wanting to help people like Thomas Frank is one guy I like - makes really good stuff)

N I know this very well because I am a Youtuber myself - I know that when I make boring introductions... The analytics shows the evidence. But when I change my thumbnails, titles and add stories... Woah... What's going on here...

* **Lone Wolf VS Tribeship Self-Improvement makes a HUGE difference.**

During my first 2 years of self-improvement. I was alone. I was a lone lone wolf. No one supported me and no one cared about me. I was improving myself quietly. Days where I felt like crap - no one was there for me to talk about with. Days where I succeeded - no one was there to celebrate with... What about friends in school...? Haha... Funny you ask.

But year 3 of self-improvement - after coincidentally meeting an old enemy of mine in my old school. We noticed we both changed, we both red the same books and that's... That's when I seriously seriously started improving immensely... Having someone you can trust your back to... Feels... Very different. You have someone to suffer with, someone to celebrate with... Someone to... Just talk your heart out.

It's really made me feel emotional about it because I still remember those very lonely days where I ate alone while everyone was sitting with their friends or girlfriends while I am just at the corner... Eating... And... Ignoring... Day by day... 300 Days later it was still the same. I tried sitting with "friends" once or twice... It feels like I was forcing myself to joke around and... It just wasn't me... Best test to know if his actually a "friend" or not is I call.

*The Friend Connection Test*

Don't talk for 3 seconds and see if it feels awkward (for yourself or for her/him) or not.

If you're trying hard to think what to say next and you spout out something like:

"The clouds are black huh..."

*yeah... Awkward...*

I am not a fan of these 3 tips to self-improvement videos on Youtube nor do I like them in article format like over here - because they were way too generic. So I highly recommend you find a post I did called "Ultimate List on where to start self-improvement" and actually start taking **action** and doing something with your life.

Also, do you think **creating my own subreddit is a good idea?** I always dreamt of creating a community where we all can just obsessively privately improve ourselves while helping each other out... A tribe u could say. Everyone's got your back. You may have no real friends & family irl... But you got a whole tribe that's got your back - every. single. time.

Also I know my english is pretty ass as u/Dahappychap said, I really am sorry if it's hard to read and I am hoping I am not sounding egotistical - it is not what I am trying to do, disagree and agree as you shall, I am totally happy about it.

**Edit 1**: It seems there is a minority of people that disagree a bit with what I wrote, I do apologize if I said anything you don't like as I know everyone has a different view of the world. And it would be very egotistical to think MY way is the best way - I don't believe there is a best way, THESE are just my personal experience that worked best for *me.*

    

**Major Update**: The promise of the tribe has been completed after contemplating for a long time. None of you guys have to be alone in this journey anymore, we are all in this together. I made sure everything is catered towards supporting everyone's journey of self-improvement.  
You shall see it for yourself. But I do want to apologize pre-hand that things are going to go wrong for 100% sure so bear with me brothers.You know the pain of hitting the sack at 1 am and waking up closer to noon than morning? That was me. An unintentional night owl, trapped in a cycle that made 6 am wake-ups seem impossible. But here’s the twist: I cracked the code (In a very unhealthy way) in just 4 days, and I'm about to spill the beans.

I had a personal commitment to start waking up at 6 am. With my messed-up sleep schedule, it felt like climbing Everest. But I didn't back down. Here's my 4-day strategy:

**The Brutal Wake-Up**: Yep, I did the unthinkable. Despite sleeping at 1 am, I forced myself out of bed at 6 am. Sleep deprivation? Oh, it was real. But it was also the jumpstart my body needed.

**Morning Meal Magic**: The moment I was up, I had a hearty meal. This wasn’t just to fuel up, but to reset my internal clock. Eating early signals your body it’s the start of the day, pushing it to adapt faster.

**Push Through the Pain**: The first two days were, not gonna lie, VERY painful! My body begged for naps, but I resisted for the greater good. Keeping active and engaged throughout the day made it easier to fall asleep at night.

**Consistency is Key**: Day 4 was the magic number. By sticking to the routine, my body caught the drift. It understood who the real boss was. Now, 6 am wake-ups feel natural, with no hint of sleep deprivation.

For anyone struggling with sleep schedules, this method is a beast. It’s challenging but effective. Remember that blender that could turn anything (yes, even iPhones) into dust? Think of this method as the 'blender' for your sleep issues. It’s powerful, remarkable, and gets the job done.

**Note**: A community member of mine suggested this to me as well. A pain in the ass that member! I did it coz I had no choice! But... Shit did I not regret it! Thank you bastard!

**Note #2**: Yeah I used ChatGPT to help me write coz I suck at writing. I'm not an adult so I don't have a job, I did not know that people who have a job is dying from sleep... Man the world needs help...Have you ever felt that wave of frustration wash over you? The one that comes from staring at your to-do list and feeling like it's written in another language? One day, amidst the chaotic clutter of my vague tasks, I had an epiphany: Enough is enough.

I looked at my list: "Work on project", "Sort out finances", "Plan trip". Every item was a cloud of ambiguity. No wonder every time I tried to start, I felt paralyzed. Every task felt like a mountain because I didn't even know where the base was!

Then I came across the concept of Next Action from GTD (Getting Things Done). It was a game-changer. Instead of "Work on project", it became "Go to Hostinger and using inspiration from Jamesclear's blog, create a home page.". Suddenly, the fog lifted. My tasks had clarity, a defined purpose, and most importantly, an actionable step.

But here's where the emotions come in: Think about all the time you've lost, staring at that vague list. Feel that anger? That’s hours, days, maybe even weeks of our lives we'll never get back. And the stress? The constant nagging feeling that you have "something" to do but not knowing where to start? It's a weight we've all unknowingly placed on our own shoulders.

Now, imagine the sheer power and liberation of knowing exactly what your next step is. That clarity not only saves time but eradicates the overwhelming stress of indecision.

I urge you all to look back and reflect. Are you being vague with your life? Are you setting yourself up for procrastination and stress?  Embrace the power of the 'Next Action'. Give your tasks a purpose, a direction. Remember. Always ask. What's the next physical concrete next action to move this project to a closure?

**Note**: A community member of mine that I was working on a project of environment change got me to wake up. Got me to stop messing around with the tasks and got me serious about changing my workflow forever. Forever it changed it did!. Spoiler Alert! Don’t read if you don’t want me to spoil Ep 2 of Death Note!

Remember that heart-racing moment in "Death Note" when L, the enigmatic detective, turns the tables on Kira? In Episode 2, L uses a cunning tactic, leaving fans (like me) both awed and slightly anxious. The tool L wielded? Inversion.

When L wanted to know if Kira could kill without being present and pinpoint his location, he didn't just follow the usual detective spiel.

Instead, L aired a televised trap targeting Kira, but only in a specific region. Kira took the bait and acted, inadvertently revealing that he was in the Kanto region of Japan. Clever, right? By thinking about what Kira would do, rather than what he won’t do, L inverted the problem and found his answer.

So, how can we channel our inner L and apply inversion in our lives?

**1. Think Opposite**

Instead of merely focusing on how to succeed, ponder how you might fail. This method helps identify potential pitfalls before they happen.

Let's Dive Into Examples:

Personal Health:

**Goal**: I want to be healthier.

**Opposite Thinking**: What habits would deteriorate my health?

**Insights**: Regularly consuming junk food, avoiding exercise, not getting enough sleep, and ignoringmental well-being could harm my health.

**Action Plan**: Limit junk food intake, establish a workout routine, set a regular sleep schedule, and practice mindfulness or meditation.

Business Success:

**2. Work Backwards**

Envision your end goal, and then reverse engineer the steps to get there. This approach helps you chart a clearer path.

**End Goal**: Publish a bestselling fiction novel.

**Working Backwards**: What defines a bestseller? Engaging plot, relatable characters, crisp narrative. How can I achieve that? Research popular genres, create detailed character profiles, take a writing course, set aside dedicated daily writing time, seek beta readers' feedback, and finally, approach publishers or consider self-publishing.

Inversion, though a simple concept, is a potent tool. Whether you're outwitting fictional villains or plotting your next big move in life, turning your thinking upside down can offer valuable insights. So, the next time you're stuck, think like L. Flip your perspective, and the answers might just surprise you.

**Note**: Thanks to one of my community members for allowing me to share this very interesting connection!. Three years ago, at 14, I faced one of the most crushing moments of my life. My own father cast me aside, banishing me to a boarding school where I was the odd one out. The chilling wind of loneliness wrapped around me, and every corner echoed of isolation.

Each day was an emotional battlefield. Picture this: A sea of laughing faces in the cafeteria, while I sat in a far-off corner, trying to be invisible. No, that's not right. I couldn't even muster the courage to face the cafeteria. I'd often run, run away from lunch, from dinner, trying to escape the burning glances and whispered remarks.

And most importantly, from the pain of seeing the love of my life sitting with a guy...

Night-times weren't a solace either. My escape? Immersing myself in virtual worlds. Hours of gaming, endless anime episodes, and fapping. It was an escape, but also a trap. It wasn't healing; it was a mere numbing mechanism.

But there’s a limit to how much someone can endure. The weight of solitude, the pang of isolation, and the fakeness of friends were my daily companions, but they also became my motivators. A voice within me whispered, "You have to get the fuck out of here."

The journey wasn't easy. Through tears, through struggles, I started to do something. This crucible of pain refined me, teaching me emotional control.

I learned to understand human nature better than any textbook could teach. And oh, did it build resilience in me. Every fall, every setback, only made me tougher. After all, it's the fiercest storms that forge the strongest souls.

Looking back, I realize that while my father might have cast me away, life was molding a warrior out of me. A warrior with a broken heart, with scars, with stories.

To anyone reading this and going through tough times, just a small reminder: Pain is the greatest teacher. Embrace it, learn from it, and let it mold you into a beast. You're not alone; we're all on our unique journeys, battling our demons. But always know, it's these battles that shape our stories.

>You will never hear a successful person without a ridiculously shitty backstory.

**Note**: Joining a community of tight-knitted people can really make your life change. I've created mine after finding a true friend after all the midst of hell. You don't have to be alone fighting the demons.I'd come home, filled with so many emotions, so much suffering. Eager for solace, for understanding, I'd recount my day to my mom, every detail, every struggle. And after pouring my heart out, I'll look at her after pausing and I’d hear these words: "*Sorry, can you repeat EVERYTHING you just said?*"

It wasn't just a request to repeat words. It was a confirmation of my worst fear: My pain, my feelings, my existence in that moment was *background noise* to her.

The ache of being unheard is profound. It isn’t just about not being listened to. It’s about feeling invisible, insignificant, as though your feelings and experiences don’t matter.

Then, I stumbled upon Habit No.5 from "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People": *Empathic Listening*.

Empathic listening is about truly hearing someone, not just with ears, but with the heart. It’s about understanding their perspective, feeling their emotion, and giving them the space to be truly seen and heard.

I began practicing it, not just because I craved it from others, but because I realized the transformational power it held. Every conversation became a bridge, a connection, a chance to heal and to bond. Empathic listening transformed my relationships, bringing me closer to the ones I cherished, and healing the wounds of years of being unheard.

In a world filled with distractions, let’s be the sanctuary for someone's voice. Stop saying "uh-huh" and pretending to listen. Stop typing to another friend when your FRIEND is right in front of you. Stop listening with the intent to reply.

Listen. Listen with your whole heart, listen for feeling. Stop jumping to conclusion, question his feelings and what his trying to express. You'll feel different. He will too.

Remember, sometimes, the loudest cry for help is the one that goes unheard.

**Note**: A community member of mine forced me to take a look at my character. It was flawed. I had character problems and he told me he wasn't feeling heard anymore from me. That's when I had to go back to classic character building book. 7 Habits.You know that gut-wrenching feeling when you're on top of your game, crushing habits left and right, only to eventually stumble back into the same old pitfalls? Yeah, been there, done that. But I had a crazy realization recently that shook me to my core. Seriously, this was a game-changer. 🤯
  

  
Imagine your self-improvement journey as if it was a graph. Most people's graphs look like a roller-coaster – a few ups and then a steep plummet down, especially when the motivation wanes. What if I told you, with a tiny tweak in the way you approach self-improvement, your graph could be soaring upward, week after week?
  


  
Now, hold up. Before you roll your eyes, let me break the usual pattern. You've probably read some dope books (shoutout to "Atomic Habits", "Deep Work", etc.), and they feel life-changing in the moment, right? But after a while, the initial hype and motivation fades and you fall back into old habits. It's not about reading the books. It's about **re-reading** them.
  

  
You see, reading a book once is like trying to remember every person you've ever met in passing. Sure, some faces might stick, but most will fade. Re-reading is like spending quality time with a close friend, digging deeper, understanding their quirks, and really, really understanding them. When you re-read, the core concepts become etched in your mind, acting as a constant guide on your journey.

    



To be frank, *there's no difference between reading a book and not reading it if you don’t ever go back to it*. It's like hitting the gym once and expecting a six-pack. Ain't happening bro. And I know I know, you may be thinking but! I take good notes so I don't need to return it.

To be honest with you, I sympathize with the do it all at once and never have to do it again mindset. But as a person who has tried all kinds of note-taking methods and read many good books... You just got to drop that ego for 2 seconds and it's like a new book. Seriously.


  

  
Remember, it's not about the number of books you've read, but the depth to which you understand them. Let's soar together. 🚀
  


  
**P.S.** Shoutout to my community member that got me to find this incredible finding! You rock! 🤘🏻. Ever felt caught in the whirlwind of self-help mantras, swallowed by the vast sea of "you should do this" and "try that"? That was me, floating adrift in an ocean of advice, until I discovered the anchor of First Principles Thinking.
  

  
For those who never heard, First Principles Thinking is about getting down to the basics, the fundamental truths, and building up from there.
  

  
**Example 1**: Making Tea (Simple Application)  

  
Let's say you're trying to make the best cup of tea. Instead of searching for the 'best tea recipes,' start with the basics. What's tea? It's hot water + tea leaves. From there, you can experiment. What happens if the water's too hot? Or if I steep it longer? By understanding the fundamentals, you refine your process.
  

  
**Method**: *The 5 Whys*  

  
This method is about digging deep to understand a problem. Faced an issue? Ask 'Why' five times.

Let's use the tea example:
  

  
Why does my tea taste bitter? - Steeped too long.
  
Why did I steep it too long? - Forgot about it.
  
Why did I forget? - Got distracted by my phone.
  
Why was I on my phone? - Checking social media notifications.
  
Why was I checking notifications? - Habitual distraction.
  
Result: To make better tea, perhaps I need to reduce distractions while making it.
  

  
**Example 2**: Journaling (*Advanced Application*)  

  
I struggled with traditional journaling. Writing felt slow; my hand couldn’t keep up with my brain. Instead of accepting "writing is the way to journal," I questioned it.
  

  
What’s the function of journaling? To externalize thoughts. What’s another way to do that? Speaking. This realization changed mine and members of this subreddit and my community's life, leading me to voice journaling, a method that felt natural and fluid.
  

  
**Method**: *Form vs. Function*  

  
Strip away the form (how it's usually done) and focus on the function (what you're trying to achieve). In my case:  

  
*Form*: Writing to journal.
  
*Function*: Externalizing thoughts.
  
*New Form that meets the Function*: Speaking my thoughts.
  

  
**Note**: Using first principles won't just change your life if you understand how to use it. I won't lie to you... It's not easy. It took me a genuine 1 month of constant obsession of trying to understand how to use it... I did that by writing examples and looking for examples hundreds of times. N it didn't just change my life, it helped me change members of my community too. That's beautiful...
  

  
Stay grounded, be curious, and never forget the power of starting from scratch. 🌱🚀📓🎤. For those who think that they cannot run 5km... I was you man. I totally understand the instant dread you feel in your head when an event for running happens at school. My process of running always started the same no matter what I do.

Whether it's with music or not. Doesn't matter, this always happens:

I am motivated, I get out of bed and start running. I first feel like a king in the morning and then slowly, mr.leg starts playing tricks on you. It starts hurting. The motivation starts to get transferred from your head to the legs.

Your legs start hurting, you start wheezing and you *feel* oh no. You're about to die. I don't want my legs to be broken because \[Insert your excuse\] and I have to do \[Insert your task\] tomorrow. So I have to stop now!

Then I stop. And never ran a 5km ever in my life. I *believed* that I couldn't. That I was born with shitty stamina and I can't do no shit about it. Can't run, well boohoo, blame genetics. 

But I was wrong.

When I read "Willpower Instinct", she talked about how fatigue is an emotion. And I was like huh? Fatigue... Is an emotion? What the hell do you mean? And she says that your mind actually is making you hurt and feel pain so that it can *motivate* you to stop running so that it can save energy as our brains are actually stingy bastards.

So I started pushing myself. I first could only jog for literally 5 mins N I'll die. Just so you know, I'm a 17 year old and skinny. And I can't even jog for 5 mins. SLOW jog btw! But then one day I wanted to try it out. I started pushing that limit... And wtf?! I suddenly am doing 15 mins?? And after the jog, my legs are always fine after that... 

Now today, yesterday actually I went for a jog without our shirts with my best friend under heavy ass rain, we ran from one station to another station 5km away. I bet we looked like crazy people literally running while the rain is heavy as shit.

There was even once, a police car was looking at me, I was like oh shit (I din have my shirt on soo... I'm in a muslim country...) and he just left, I was like hoo, thank gods... And somehow ran the 5km, never believed in my life I could do that... Of course my legs actually did hurt when I woke up.

But nothing so bad. I didn't break my leg like how our thoughts would be like. So... Go out there and test it. Trust me. You will *shock your ass.*

**Note**: I wanted to let you know, 5km is actually nothing... A member of my community, AKA my best friend... That mf ran 17km! 17KM! Without training btw! He read David Goggin's Book and absolutely shocked my ass when I saw that shit...I used to read a lot of manga back in high school. It was so bad it was affecting everything. I was seriously addicted to that shit and I couldn't do anything else. It felt like I was in this safe world that I wished will never end.

For the 576th I was sitting down outside and telling myself, this is the last time I am reading manga. I will be ending it soon. It was 12am actually and I was sitting alone in nature reading manga on my phone.

Someone called me and told me about how he managed to solve this and that problem by just sitting down and writing his thoughts down and asking, why? Why? Why? Why?

Why do I keep doing this one. What's the underlying reason behind it? How do I fix it. And he managed to fix it is what he told me. Of course do note I was still reading manga just before he called me so I was a bit annoyed. Sorry, very annoyed that I now have to listen to that and not just that, he kept *highly recommending* to do it right now...

I was stuttering and stuff but I had to do it. I sighed back to my room and sat down. Just said yeah whatever and started writing and kept asking why... 30 minutes later, I managed to find out why I read manga and how to fix it. I did not fix it completely all in one shot, that's just unlikely.

This was the time when I noticed (obviously duh.) that I did it to run away from life. And to solve it, I needed to do something different this time. So I became very uncomfortable and went out to build a self-improvement club in my class. I went to their houses, talked to them, convinced them.

It helped a lot. I stopped running away a lot more. I faced the issue head on as much as my legs were shaking most of the time. I know it's hard man. We're all human at the end. We all know we need to face \[Name your enemy no.1\] but we keep running away to \[Pick you preferred choice\] and never solve shit.

    

**Note**: Thank you to a member of my community for recommending me this, it really helped me push through a lot of hard times and figure out my head to complicated problems like solving addictions like this one.

Oh... You're still reading? Might as well go deep journal right? You're strong if you are able to sit down and do what everyone else reading this wouldn't do. I respect that.I used to always read a book from cover to cover. I would always see oh... This book has high ratings and is very popular and a lot of people are talking about it. I should read it... And then... What the hell dude.

Trash. Unsuitable. Unrelatable and absolute garbage. For me at least. That's when I noticed something.

The introduction. Almost every book you find, WILL and should have a introduction that *talks* about how the book is organized and what the hell this book is about and why you should or shouldn't read it.

When I found that out... Gods of hell... I was wondering why I spent so much money and time on books I didn't need or are just plain unusable for me. At first I doubted it. I was like dude, no one told me this. Even after watching thousands of "self-improvement" YT videos, no one told me this shit.

And I never heard anyone talk about reading the introduction. I looked into the book "Deep Work" and saw this: 

    

This book has two goals, pursued in two parts. The first, tackled in Part 1, is to **convince** you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second, tackled in Part 2, is to teach you **how** to take advantage of this reality by training your brain and transforming your work habits to place deep work at the core of your professional life. Before diving into these details, however, I'll take a moment to explain how I became such a devotee of depth.

    

Do you see it? If you already want to know HOW to deep work, why the hell are you spending 100 pages reading WHY you should deep work when you are already want to deep work?? Man oh man... I feel refreshed after letting this out...

**Note**: The partner of my community was the first person I told this to and I had to show him multiple times with multiple books before his like no goddamn way... I was reading the women's section for Way of the Superior man N I didn't even need that shit!. Almost every week, there will be a moment in my life where everything ceases to be interesting. Everything in life suddenly felt... Boring. It's not like I was bored actually, but it wasn't like I was sad or depressed or anything like that... To describe it... I felt nothing.

I actually thought I was depressed. And maybe I was. Maybe you are. Since emptiness could be a symptom of bigger issues. Of perhaps mental health issues. But what could I do right now to face it? Rather than run away by watching Netflix or scrolling to infinity and beyond?

It's a very simple solution actually. I got out of my room. I got out of the house. And went out into... 

Nature. Har? Nature? How will that fix emptiness you may ask? I thought it stupid too. I was wondering what the hell is being outside going to do shit... I walked. Walked walked walked... And looked at the sky.

Hmm... Feels... Peaceful? Tranquil? How do I describe it? The clouds slowly moving... The trees practicing dance moves... The birds preparing for an Opera... Hmm... Somehow I feel kinda better? I stayed there and walked through the woods and... Hmm.

I felt refreshed. But it wasn't over yet. I knew in my heart, I would still feel empty and most definitely will be watching anime when I go back upstairs... So instead I took out a book and a pen. And started writing. I know, huh? Journaling... Sigh, seen that done that. Doesn't work shit bro.

But I continued writing anyways. I started by asking. Why. Why was I feeling empty? Then a bunch of thoughts continued. I kept writing. Paused. Write. Paused. Write. I found out why. I seem to have forgotten my why. Why I work. Why I wake up in the morning. Why I do what I do.

I forgotten about that. It was so that I can be free financially. Oh... Okay. Let's get back to work shall we?

    

**Note**: My community, whom my best friend is the founder of, told me that he was feeling empty. He said his been reading for days and days but doesn't feel anything. But always 4h later he calls back and tells me, he went out into nature and journaled and tells me "bro, u have no idea man, I goddamn need to go Japan man..."

*Huh...*. Many times I would read a book and a thought flies by "Oh yeah... I need to text Jessica." and then I text her. Then I sit back down and 20 seconds later "Oh yeah... I have to go get that new book from Marcus Aurelius."

I got sick of it honestly. I would be outside in nature and my thoughts would be looking at the sky and thinking... "What a nice... Oh shit, I forgot to get the book." Honestly Idk how I survived my life without having an Inbox.

You download the app TickTick \[Insert whatever to-do list app\] on your PC or phone whatever you use the most.

Then whenever you are reading, outside or wherever. (If you are like me - reading and hate distractions then just keep a seperate notebook purposefully for inbox reasons) Just write down any tasks or to-do's you FEEL like you need to do or are just wondering.

**For example**:

\- Is there any other books on habits?

\- Is there books on Hypnosis?

\- Oh yeah - I had to text Jessica...

\- Mother's day next week

\- *Oh shit... I got to text a member of my community.*

Anything that has an **action** basically.

THEN you continue life normally and you will **MUST** remember to always ALWAYS clear that INBOX every single night. No matter what.

*Why?*

Because of trust. Once you trust that YOU will clear that Inbox every single night... YOU will start to have clarity and stop worrying about which tasks is for which task - You just KNOW it's going to be taken care of tonight.

*I mean I personally wouldn't trust a president that says:*

"*I do solemnly swear that I will SOMETIMES faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will SOMETIMES to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States"*. 1. **Reading Great/Good Books**

I know you've heard this at least 500 hundred times by now if you've been in self-improvement for at least a few months. Youtubers say it, Redditors say it, heck even my dad says it. I've said it many times but I got to keep saying it. 

You got to have to slap this into your head. Books - sorry. *Good* books will change your life, it's the no.1 productivity thing u can do that actually doesn't just *feel* productive but actually also *is* productive. U can argue with me that podcasts, courses and articles are also productive, heck yeah they are. But a book like Atomic Habits can't compare with a article on James Clear's website.

3. **Shutdown Ritual**

I understand that you want to work all day all long. It' every productivity fanatic's dream. Heck I was one of those crazy dudes. "I HAVE to work 12 hours every day. It's all in or out." That was me every day. Though I was more of all out then all in.

Enforcing to stop working at 5 o clock forced me to work harder and get more done in less time and allowed me to consistently produce at a high rate. It wasn't a audio wave anymore.

3. **Voice Journaling**

I used to overthink a lot. Worry a lot. I was always thinking this scenario, what if this happens what if that happens and what if this doesn't... Sound familiar? The problem with this is that we are imagining things that hasn't even happened yet N heck we can't do anything about it rn.

With my trusty voice recorder, I managed to externalize my thoughts by uh... talking to myself for 20 mins and externalize every. single. little. worry. Thank me later.

4. **Meditation**

I bet you *also* have heard meditation at least 300 times. But this time, you're not going to hear go sit at a chair and do nothing. You don't need to. The purpose of meditation isn't being on a chair and thinking... Inhale... EXHALE... N repeat like a broken recorder.

Rather, the purpose is to just be present and lose focus and come back. That's meditation. Does that mean that \[Insert activity that requires being present with something\], yes it is. (make sure to check though).

5. **Helping People**  
I've built my own **discord community** and started what I dreamt as a loner back in my boarding school. Every day, during enforced tuition time, my classmates (3 guys N 1 girl) will cluster together while I am at the back just... Hoping no one sees me.  
It's tough being on this journey alone. Even worse if you have no one to trust. You only can keep things to yourself and have to put on a robotic smile and act like a different person. After escaping that school, I set my eyes on creating a community that actually helps people and not Mr.troller. Give what you never had. You'll be a better person than them.Everyone believes that it takes BIG changes to get BIG achievements.

And that's true... At least in the front covers. What many people I noticed (myself included oopsies) is that we tend to look at \[Name any billionaire or successful person u know\] and say, OMG, that guy literally had an overnight success blablabla etc etc.

But honestly, what you don't see is the years of small progress day to day to day. That person has been doing a lot of work at the back and all of a sudden, overnight success happens.

However, that overnight success paradoxically is not a overnight success. It was rather a over many years success.

I just want you to remember that as much as you want to start big. You have to start small if you want big changes. Those who read Atomic Habits know the 1% tiny gains rule. 365 Days and you get 37x better in a year!

I know I know. You are in the downs period and you suddenly want to change everything... But where are you next week? You got to just understand that you just got to start small and slowly build your way up there.

You can't build a empire in 1 day. Heard it but hear it again but this time... Actually get it in your head.

Stop making big changes N going back to "normal" and just start to improve slowly. You'll get that "overnight" success u see so often.

I know I did.

    

By the wayyyy I've started my own **small changes to my fear of starting an online community of self-improvement** because oh no... everyone already is in big ones, whats the point of starting a new 1...? But I did it anyways and made it unique, everyone's connected with one another and no general chats at all because I was serious about keeping it high quality and filtered. But hope that inspires someone out there! (Not tryna be egotistical!). **Books**.

You've heard it before. Every CEO reads a book a week. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Elon Musk etc etc reads reads reads. So what's really up with reading a book and changing lives?

I can tell you why because I'm one of those guys who had his life changed from books.

Not just any books though. Don't go ahead and read one of those nonsense crap books from the self-improvement market and then start arguing with other people... Oh books sucks... They're trash.

If you want books that will actually change your life, look at **Atomic Habits, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People & Willpower Instinct.**

These are starter books that changed my life completely. Of course, as usual. They also give you a saying where you keep hearing but don't do.

**Action.**

How many times have you heard this word? You hear it so many times that you are already bored of it. But why not actually do it then? I used to be just like you. Yeah yeah take action, doing that already bois. Am I really?

It took me 3 years to learn about this but you don't need to wait 3 years to learn about this and actually do something about it. I was submerged in articles, courses & Youtube for many years.

Mindvalley, Coursera, Masterclass, Youtube.

Don't get me wrong, they're not trash, they're great... But. It depends on your needs.

I hope this post helped and please don't think I'm being egotistical here.

**Edit**: What the heck, I was writing this post in the middle of a sleep deprived day lol, thank you for liking it! 

    

Btw, do you guys know how to grow a self-improvement community? I've made one recently because of the demand from the post called "4 years of self-improvement in 5 mins" and was wondering how do I find members that are active N really wanting to improve themselves? Any tips would be really helpful!. Passing our genes & survival is the top priority of our brains. Porn is artificial sexual stimulus, which basically means your brain *thinks* that u must continue to pass on your "genes" to every "women" u see on the screen.

&#x200B;

* **You're telling yourself every day that this is going to be the one last time...**

You know yourself it's not the one last time. Rather than thinking that shit man... 90 days NoFap... That's impossible... Say "no" just once now. It's not easy. But it's a mindset shift that will help you much better than looking at streaks. Don't count days. Count "no" now.

&#x200B;

* **You're not changing the cues even 1 bit... All you're saying is "I will change tomorrow..."**

U must not forget that Dopamine is a big thing about Porn for sure which is why u have such huge cravings but if u can't *see* it and u make it *impossible/very difficult* to do it, then u will have a much easier time. It's just the first 2 weeks such like ass, but ur gonna be fine after that.

Delete every bookmark, history. All of it, ur dedicated to getting it out of ur face. Don't hangout with friends who are *cues* for ur Porn use. Go outside way more, don't stick to ur screen N slouch a lot either, it's again cues.

Move your environment around, the "Fapping chair" u have, throw that out. Ur "Fapping Device" also throw that one out or install a blocker. (Cold Turkey Blocker is the most powerful one to use.)

&#x200B;

* **You find ur urges and cravings overpower u so badly that u don't even have time to remember ur "Why".**

This is quite simple solution honestly. Writing papers on ur walls don't goddamn work man. It's literally backed by science that if we keep looking at the same shit, it literally disappears from our sight. Literally.

Rather instead, use these as what I call "Emergency Buttons", Go to NoFap community or something N find ur 3 favorite success stories that will be noted as your "Why" u wana get the hell out of this Porn Addiction. Then print them out.

Print them out N DON'T u dare put it on the wall, rather, put it near u. Somewhere easily accessible where if u feel those URGES, go take a look at those papers. Trust me. U read half of it, ur urges will disappear. U will be like 'Oh shit I forgot'.

**1 final tip**: You can try to build a community (like what I have done) because for some reason, pride is a big factor in the game. When ur a leader, ur forced to not fail. Worked pretty well for me honestly.

I hope I don't sound egotistical or anything, I just am hoping this post will help out someone out there as I know very well how destroying a Porn addiction can be to anyone... Especially younger people... I was stuck there for 4 years before I got out of it... N never looked back.

*You don't need Porn. Porn needs you.*. * **Do you always say ah... Workout is good... Porn is bad...?**

BIG mistake. This is exactly why you're not consistent (Of the many reasons). You see, we when label something as "Bad" or "Good". When we become a lil good... We worked out for an hour...! Now... I deserve watching a bit of porn right?

It's an actual trap. It's called Moral Licensing. I did not know this during my early years until recently and it's such a big trap that I fell into constantly that I'll be repeating it many times in this post.

&#x200B;

* **Do you always say well... I've recently gotten good grades so a lil gaming is fine right...?**

Anything that makes us feel good of ourselves can literally *license* us to give in to temptations and enjoy them guilt-free... A lil gaming is fine... If you understand what you're doing to yourself.

&#x200B;

* **Do you always say look man, I coulda done 0h of work, but I still did an hour! Time to watch anime...?**

Oh no... Sounds ridiculous but a lot of people actually do this unconsciously. I did NOT know about this when it was happening, I categorized all of them in my head as just excuses I didn't want to look into. But anything that you moralize by saying "I coulda done that but I didn't!" is a HUGE trap for procrastinating.

&#x200B;

* **Do you always sit down and look at your laptop and say well... Only today I'll watch Netflix and tomorrow I'll grind all day long... N next day comes... Ur still on Netflix.**

What happened over here? Didn't you promise yourself you were going to work tomorrow for the entire day? Well... For some weird reason, we always moralize doing something NOW by delegating it to our future self N hoping that our future self will be motivated N we can indulge guilt-free now!

&#x200B;

* **Then do you always say things like bruh... What an useless idiot I am, can't even work, what's wrong with you lazy ass hole! N start beating yourself over all those failures?**

WRONG. Did you know beating yourself up with stress and shame actually MAKES you fail more? N if u forgive urself, u ACTUALLY fail lesser?! Ridiculous isn't it? But it's true. When you feel stressed or trash, your fight or flight system actives and u start becoming more impulsive and basically means u will fail more often.

In the 4 years of my self-improvement journey, these are the biggest traps I fell for myself WITHOUT even knowing it existed. But once u know what ur dealing with, u have a much higher chance of beating it. As we all humans at the end only fear one thing:

**The Unknown**.

Also random question but what do you guys look for in an **ideal community**? Coz I'm hoping to improve my own community so that I can genuinely build one that's catered towards *actually* getting people connected... Unlike my first 3 years of self-improvement... Where I sat alone, ate alone while a guy is just sitting with my crush...# 1. Reading Great Books.

**Don't just read a book a week. Use it.**

# 2. Going to the Gym.

**Don't just go the gym alone. Find someone.**

# 3. Practicing Journaling & Self-love.

**Would you beat your friend up if he fails?**

# 4. Start a new hobby so you don't feel like a zombie.

**Stop procrastinating on that piano. Research the best websites and start already.**

# 5. Find a community of like-minded people.

**Go find an online community or build an online community yourself like what I did.**. * **I stopped manipulating**

I was a hardcore manipulator. I always made it my way by manipulating other people's weaknesses. I knew what would make them guilty. I knew what would make them do what I want. I was controlling everything in my life. I was in control.

But I forgot that to be truly in control was to control **myself**.

&#x200B;

* **I started being consistent**

How many times have you heard the sentence: Oh... I failed again... BUT I am trying harder tomorrow.

I've at least heard that 10000's times from my own mouth. Porn. Anime. Netflix. K-Drama. C-Drama. Music. Gaming. Unhealthy food. I failed many many times. But it was all gone. I've started being consistent with ALL my good habits and never failed even *once* again. (Okay *maybe* sometimes.)

&#x200B;

* **I built a community of like-minded people**

Last year in my school, I tried to build a community of self-improvement people. I had 6 guys from my class join N I wanted to change the school... IGCSE came and... I graduated. I became lazy and was like whatever man... I'm the only one that's serious anyways.

This year, I built an **actual** community of like-minded people from discord. And it's much better than last year. I learned from my mistakes, I wasn't a good leader and am still not. But I understand I can improve.Don't think about going to the gym.  
Don't think about meditating.  
Don't think about reading a book.  
Don't think about working on your project.  
Now.. Can you stop thinking about it?. # 1. No One's Going To Help You

I learned this the hard way. Many people in the front will say they support you and say it's very good you go to jog in the early morning! Then... At the back. They leave you when you need help. I had a teacher I thought was in "Self-Improvement" coz he jogs in the morning. But you need to understand

That no one's really going to want to help you. Almost everyone wants dopamine from you. I'm not joking. Look around you. Everyone's on their phones and the most popular kids are either the funniest kids or rich kids.

# 2. You Need To Find Someone

Being alone sucks ass. Being the AKA Lone Wolf isn't as cool as it seems... Especially as something as tough as self-improvement. Can you imagine trying to workout, jog and stay healthy in an environment that eats magee mee, wakes up late as shit and games all day long?

You have to at least find a community where you could trust you back on and at least... At least when you succeed you'll have *someone. Somebody* out there that genuinely supports you. Not *fake* support. It's why I created **that** community. Find your own one, it's going to seriously help you.

# 3. You Don't Need To Be In A Relationship

I don't even know how many times I've seen couples in my school and feel the itch in my heart. But know that you don't have to be in a relationship to continue self-improvement. I used to say bs excuses like Oh... I need a women to be with me in this journey... Not now. 

If you can't even take care of yourself, how can you take care of others?. No text required. Exactly what's mentioned in the title.

&#x200B;. All those who have looked at **What I learned in 4 years of Self-Improvement... I teach you in 5 mins...** post know I promised that I was going to make a community where we all can just obsessively privately improve ourselves while helping each other out... A tribe u could say.

Everyone's got your back. You may have no real friends & family irl... But you got a whole tribe that's got your back - every. single. time.

Well... That was 4 weeks ago.

Now we're done. At last.

This post is going to be pretty long as there's going to quite a lot of information you need to know about this community before thinking of joining - It's not the type of "community" where you can just simply troll around and feel like you're progressing without actually progressing.

When I promised where we all are *serious* about self-improvement, oh we are going to be serious alright.

&#x200B;

**Purpose of the community**: Set people free from suffering of their addictions and build them up into normal happy human beings.

**Benefits of you joining**:

* Strict Accountability Buddies (Based on groups) "Soon"
* Questions will always be answered in detail & personalized (No short BS answers like 'Live life bro')
* Everyone that joins **MUST** create their own 'About Me' page where everyone gets to know their new brother (And share your suffering if you have)
* Only 4 types of post are allowed (Success Story, About Me, Tips & Tricks & Question) and that also means, absolutely **NO general chats**. (I do not want to keep you in our server, you got better things to do outside of it)
* There won't be people writing things like 'I suck ass, I want to die.' If you suck ass, please talk to someone in the community, like *talk*. Not keyboard warrior please.

Oh yeah - all this is free for everyone, so don't worry about it. The only thing we are trying to ensure is quality. So that's why we plan to grow by word of mouth heavily. (Basically we put our trust onto you guys to bring in brothers, not trollers.)

I do want to note, I'm absolutely new to this, so I apologize for anything that goes wrong (Because it definitely is going to.)

I also do want to note, don't join if you're not going to commit. It's going to save each other's time. We're all being serious over here.

**Tribe**: [https://discord.gg/Z7MyHyFxEk](https://discord.gg/Z7MyHyFxEk). I keep hearing J Pop Songs usually are using the royal road progressions so does anyone know how to step by step structure my way of practice to be able to play that?

Whether it's this or that chord.I am confused. I don't understand why I am learning chords or chord progressions to play such songs like L's theme or Sparkle from Kimi No Nawa.

I can't wrap my head around why I need to learn chords as when I see the sheet music for the beginner unravel song. I see (Maybe wrong for sure) no chords but can someone please tell me what's up with chords and J-Pop Music?. I always hear people talk about self-improvement here and there. But is there an actual definition of self-improvement and what can be categorized as "self-improvement" and what does it mean to be in self-improvement?

I've always wondered that. Is me improving my interior design skills or math skills - self-improvement? Or is only going to gym and meditating self-improvement?

I'm very curious what everyone thinks "self-improvement" *really* means.* **Year 1**: The dawn of YT self-improvement

I started self-improvement first through Youtube. I was watching hundreds to thousands of videos, saving *probably* tens of thousands of videos but never watched a single of them. Because I was always fearing the *latest* videos were better. After watching a motivational video on waking up early - Billionaire morning routine. I was excited.

I thought I was following what every billionaire does - Sleep at 10pm and wake at *4am.* How many hours of sleep is that?! That's goddamn 6 hours! I always heard the saying 'You're young, so it's okay to sleep deprive yourself, grind more!' but that's one f upped advice. I always knew I was tired and deprived of sleep but I just went for a jog to wake myself up and coffee.

For an entire year, it was a cycle of Youtube Self-Improvement. Focused more on '6 pack abs workouts' in Youtube and was following very ridiculously hard routines that I thought was needed to become strong. Honestly full of bullcrap, wasted my 4 years on Youtube... Full of absolute crap.

By the end of this year, I was burned out, sleep deprived, Reward Circuit systems was malfunctioned. I was still addicted to porn at this time, still took my tablet from time to time and enter the toilet to fap. I lost to gaming a couple times during this year and I found out about Anime during this year as well which led to a *new* addiction. I was failing no fap once a week as if it was a routine.

* **Year 2**: Life threw hot ass water onto my face

Year 2, after a kick off from the family and sent to a boarding school forced me to open my eyes. I was even more stuck in porn, gaming and anime during this year. I had no friends, no family (basically) and was alone the entire time. I had no one to trust and even though the environment was utter trash, people eating magee mee and everyone gaming and shit, I somehow managed to be in self-improvement (though super badly).

I still woke up at 6am when everyone woke up at 7am to go job and of course, to grab a cup of green tea and walk down a hill with the cool weather. It was nice. I still went did calisthenics (still doing the bs 6 pack abs workout from yt) and started meditating more consistently during the mornings.

Mid-year started and we had online classes. During this time, I dropped off self-improvement fully. Completely dropped out. I lost all control over myself, I was depressed and felt super trash. I gamed all day and slept at ridiculous times. I watched anime at night till 4am and woke up at 10am to watch more. I was a living zombie, living day to day without any memories of yesterday.

By the end of this year, I was devastated. I had to do something about my life. So I got back into self-improvement and started doing some weird life planning on Clickup. I started wasting my time creating a life plan for 10 years doing Courses and shit. I wanted to do better next year.

* **Year 3**:  I am sick and tired of falling off consistently

Before year 2 ended, I was doing some intense planning to escape my school - which happened. But of course legally. I managed to not just escape school, I managed to *drop out* of high school. Call me crazy then, I was truly crazy then, I discovered Coursera & Mindvalley during this time and convinced my mom (super difficult) that I could get the degree u wanted from Coursera without going to University.

She accepted it and I started doing Coursera every day in my room (With some amount of Anime from time to time. Basically for 6 days I would be doing 10h of work and then the 7th day, I would be doing something I called 'Dopamine Intox' which is just taking in as much dopamine as possible to recharge... What a baloney strategy, full of crap honestly, I look back this year with a sneer.

This continued for 2 months before I burned out for real and just couldn't do Coursera anymore and I told my mom... Yeah... Let's go back to high school. I was going to finish my last year of high school during this time. I slowly during this mid year became acquainted with 3 good friends and got into roblox development to make money (I failed miserably) and then after some break up happened, I was left with 1 friend.

I started to be more consistent with meditation, working out, jogging and reading. I still read nonfiction books consistently every day and of course, I was taking absolutely no notes and whenever I started reading a good book (complicated of course) I would throw it out saying it's trash. Used to just read a great book in 10h and said I finished this book. I did not use it. I red over 40 books this year and last year and didn't use them at all. Nothing.

I used to take notes that was 10,000 word long and chugged it into RemNote and forgot about them but I felt as if (like most people) I knew it at the back of my hand (the contents). This year, I was absolutely sick and tired of me failing my addictions week to week. I began creating a self-improvement club after deep journaling about why the hell did I keep falling off.

3 months later, the club flopped because I noticed a big flaw (me). I was a very crappy leader. I didn't know what I was talking about, I had no exact strategy to help them out, I was still stuck in Porn at this time (I quit anime and gaming already during this time) and I was telling them to speed read a book.

*Speed read* a great book. Now I look back. I cry. Why the hell was I trying to marathon great books for?? I was supposed to sit on my ass and analyze them and use them! 

**Year 4**: The rewards of suffering.

This is the time where I finally truly shined and reaped my rewards of all that stupid struggling and inconsistent crap. I broke out of all my addictions at last, found out I loved reading books and wanted to do that for life.

I started finally working out properly by going to my friend's gym, had a best friend now that I trusted fully and life was much much better now. I became no more manipulative and fake anymore and was genuinely a much more better person. Removing all your addictions truly is a liberating feeling.

It felt like I was walking through life with huge metal chains on my back. 8 of them. N one by one I managed to crack them out and now I felt truly free. I could finally be myself. I didn't need to beat myself over everyday because I failed no fap every 2 days just a year ago.

This is where I am now. No distractions, no nothing. Every day I just think of ways to help out anyone, anyone out there is fine. This is also one reason why I try to write a post every day on this subreddit - to see how exactly do you help someone.

    

If you red until the end, thank you. I hope this little story made you feel a bit better about where you are. Whether you're suffering now or is wondering when's life going to get better, it will get better. As they say, when you keep going down till you hit rock bottom, you can only go up after that. 

Adios.Age 13, I was on top of the world. I was the king. I was in the same school for 9 years now and know just about everyone and was in command and respected by many. *Feared* more actually. I had a group of people that listened and feared my every command. I lived life like the king and no one could stop me.

Age 14, my dad kicked me out of the family and sent me to a boarding school. 10 years of my life I was comfortable in my environment - now I was entering the unknown. I entered the boarding school with a stoic expression and entered the classroom like how I would enter my old classroom.

I sat down after a (self-proclaimed) cool 'yo' introduction and... No one came to talk to me. Ever since that day, I became the most popular kid in school to becoming the most invisible kid in school. That year was when life threw a bucket of hot *ass* water on me. I *had* to change and to cut it all short, these books turned my life around completely and I hope it has the same effect to you.

    

1.  **Atomic Habits**

This book is the bible for behavior change. That means you *should* be able to build any habits & break any habits if you really understand the book. This book really changed the game for me, I used to always have a lot of friction to doing the good habits like meditation, working out and all the shit. But after reading this book (4 times) and 2 years later... Wow. I managed to create an environment where I don't use willpower at all to do the hard stuff. Plus it was one of the big reasons how I quit all my addictions.

*To give you a taste of it, get a piece of paper NOW! Write down just 1 or 2 of the good habits, small ones should be fine, now think how do I make it:*

* Obvious?
* Attractive?
* Easy?
* Rewarding?

Let me give you an example that utilizes all of these. Let's say I wanted to stretch every day so how? I first made it obvious by keeping the towel (for stretching) on my dinner table to remind me and the fact that I would be able to read my favorite book made it very attractive. I made it very easy by only needing to stretch 5 \~ 10 minutes and because it feels good to stretch, it's automatically rewarding.

2. **7 Habits of Highly Effective People**

You probably heard of this. The very infamous bible for building our character. Rightfully so it's on the top, this book is complicated, I red this I think like... 7 times already? But I still do not fully understand what the book is talking about. Every time I suddenly became selfish or had problems with my best friend, I always come back to this book. I especially love Habit 5: seek first to understand then to be understood. 

It always reminds me of the quote from a stoic: 

'2 ears, 1 mouth - respect the ratio'

This book is seriously a game changer, I changed from being a very selfish person who didn't even know how to NOT be selfish into someone who is now obsessing over on how to build a community of obsessive self-improvement intellectuals.

To give you a taste of 7 habits, think about this for a moment:

Look around your (Social) surroundings. Who are the people you trust the most? Who are the people that you just don't know why but feel very safe that he/she won't shit on you or share what u said with others. That should be enough for you to understand why 7 habits is so vital.

3. **Getting Things Done**

If you have been in the productivity space for a while, there's no way you haven't heard of the bible of productivity, GTD. I swear I was guilty of skipping this book because I saw the cover a man with a business suit and I was like 'yeah... I'm not a office worker so no thanks'. But oh boy oh boy... How wrong was I. I've always struggled using calenders on Notion and to-do lists every single day. 

I was super freaking frustrated every day. I could not get shit done at all. I was busy having stress trying to figure out which task was for which day and which to-do's need to be done today... F it all. I knew that I needed to change my workflow or I'm never going to be productive.

And that's when I read this book. This book changed my life. I seriously wished someone told me about this long ass time ago, I genuinely am stress-free now when it comes to my productivity, I can get shit done without worrying about 100s of things going to happen tomorrow.

To give you a taste of GTD:

Take a piece of paper right now and write down what is the task you have been procrastinating on for a long time. Then write down from the start what's the next *concrete physical next action* that you need to do to move the task forward. Physical next action means what's the literal next action like, I have to write a blog article; I have to open my laptop then I have to go click scrivener to write the blog article, prepare first draft from notebook etc.

Do you feel more *relaxed* now? The reason why so many people procrastinate is because (me too.) your task list is full of vague tasks like call mom. Call mom about what? Or even worse, Call. Who the hell are we supposed to call??  

    

Please do not think I am boasting over here. I wrote intellectual because I have no idea what other word I could use that signifies what I am right now, I definitely do not think I am an intellectual - far from it. I still know I have a lot to improve and am growing steadily day by day.

Also, imagine this. In this world you only can choose 1 community with you to live till you die, you won't have any other communities in this world. What kind of community would that be like? What kind of people are there? What kind of activites happen there?

For those who read the post *What I learned in 4 years of Self-Improvement... I teach you in 5 mins...* Hi again and you may notice that I sneakily am asking what is an ideal community for self-improvement so I can use it for our community. (Let us know man!). 1. **Train your body so your mind will be able to control it**

Imagine you have a car. This car is a very expensive model of BMW and it's over hundreds of thousands of dollars. You drive it on the highway and put your foot heavily on the pedal - hoping to go over 200km/hour but behind you, you hear noises at the back of your car but you don't mind. You continue pushing the pedal till it goes to 150km/h and then

*Crash*

The police enter the scene where you died. They were trying to figure out what was the cause of the crash and noticed that at the back, the engines were very old and it was definitely a second hand.

Everyone seems to try to train their mind (the car) and seems to less emphasize on the body (the engine). For you to utilize the car's potential fully, you must have a strong engine and that means strengthening your body and making sure that it will listen to it's mind when tough situations happens.

2. **Birds are born somehow knowing how to navigate the skies & knowing how to build a nest. Squirrels who were born before winter gathers nuts during spring even though they never experienced it.** *Do you think we humans were born to scroll on social media & be comfortable - we, who are the highest on the hierarchy?*

You see a baby. You seen it grow up ever since it was a baby and now his a man - 18 years old. He uses his imagination to fantasize about video games and uses his body to satisfy his cravings. 

*Do you think we were born with the gifts of dreaming, imagination, language & creativity just to live like a zombie?*

3. **How would you comfort a friend?**

You walk into the classroom and you see your friend with his neck lolled on the table and you notice that there's something wrong with him. So you go to him and ask him what's wrong? He turns to you slowly and started blabbering about how much of a loser he is and how he doesn't deserve to live anymore.

You immediately tell him no his wrong, he is the most ideal, helpful and considerate friend you ever met in your entire life and that he is absolutely exaggerating his failures and he needs to see reality properly. You encourage him and you sooth him and make sure he doesn't feel that his a failure.

*But then when we fail, what do we do to ourselves?*

Don't beat yourself up - Build yourself up. Think about why you failed and how do you rebound back faster. Beating yourself up just leads to making you feel even worse.

4. **To Be or To Do?**

You are in your room and you see a poster - a poster of this role model that you love. This person is a very successful business man and you really admire and strive to become like him, to build a business that will change the world and lives of millions of people.

Every single day you make sure to dedicate 3 hours of work to build the business you have always dreamt about that will change millions of people's lives. You stayed humble and never told anyone about your idea and while in your job, people were treating you like shit, you looked down and accepted it.

3 years of suffering later, you made it. You managed to build a business that became public and you are now where you wanted to be. You start feeling prideful about yourself and you start to do public speeches and chase the fame. You want everyone to know who you are. You start taking credit for yourself and never delegating any credits. You go back to your old company and enjoy the expressions of their shocked faces and you shout at them, "I made it! What's up?!".

1 year later, your business goes bankrupt and you jump of a building. When we want success, we always get obsessed over becoming *someone*, the amount of fans you have, the title you have, the amount of authority you have and we forget that to be truly great, we should rather be focusing on doing *something* for this world and not becoming *someone.* But no one wants to do something for this world.

Because you would have to suffer not having any recognition, not having any fans and not having much money. It's what it takes to become Great. The question is:

>To Be or To Do? Which one will you choose?. I am so in pain to find out a week ago that school never actually taught us how to stretch *correctly* \- rather they didn't just not do that, they instead taught us *wrongly*.

I always remembered seeing everyone in my school very loose and competing against each other - who can touch the floor and who can do the splits while I am at the back just... Just acting cool. I was always very stiff. I never felt *flexible.* I never felt like flowing like water - I always felt like a walking stick man.

Nor I am flexible now but I am much more flexible than I was a week ago. Because I now just noticed that the reason you are NOT enjoying stretching is because school taught you "No pain no gain" and you think you're supposed to stretch till it *hurts*... But that's wrong. You're actually *tightening* the very muscles you're trying to stretch! (I know - what the hell right?)

>I'm not teaching you step-by-step HOW to stretch, I'm only telling you what's wrong and what's correct. (If you want a simple step-by-step guide - Get the Book "Stretching" by Bob Anderson, his book opened my eyes to create this post and highly recommended.)

    The correct way to stretch (However you stretch):

1. **Stretching is supposed to be easy & fun (It's not a competition of ego. It's less pain, more gain)**

Oh man... School never made it fun. It was always a competition of ego. It's always who can touch the ground. Who can do the splits, Oh you - why are you not stretching? Well... Coz it hurts bro. I need to repeat this: Stretching is **NOT** supposed to be **PAINFUL**. It's rather paradoxical, it's supposed to be less pain, more gain.

You're actually supposed to stretch to the point of feeling an *easy* stretch, just a mild tension and just *feel* it. Then only after 10 \~ 30 Seconds (Depends) that you move a bit further and feel a bit more tense and develop into a *developmental* stretch. (10 \~ 30 seconds again)

2. **Stretching is supposed to feel good... Like a slow massage (You're NOT supposed to BOUNCE!)**

You're not supposed to be bouncing. Yeah, no touching the toe and then moving back and touching the toe again - you're actually straining your muscles and activating the stretch reflex (which tightens the muscles you're trying to loosen)

If you feel pain - it means you're doing something *wrong.* If you are always stretching to the point of pain, no wonder you don't enjoy it - that's like going to a massage parlor and she has concrete made hands, heck you're never going there again.

If you don't trust me btw, try to bounce stretch while trying to touch your toes and then 2 minutes later, come back and stretch again - see if you're actually doing worse or see no improvement at all or not. (No joke, when I tried this, I didn't believe it... I actually *deproved*!)

3. **You're supposed to be breathing bro**

Please. Please do not stop breathing. If you stop breathing, you're doing it wrong. You must be able to breath *normally* when you're stretching. I did NOT know this, I was always holding my breath (This is also a mistake in weightlifting)

4. **You actually improve flexibility when you properly stretch**

If you think that there's something wrong with you when you can't seem to improve your flexibility and for some reason, you feel stiff as usual and you see people around you doing splits and shit? If you want to do those, start with correct stretching, it'll get you there (N you will actually feel & SEE improvement in just a few weeks, for me - in 1 week I could suddenly do the full lotus position which I could never do!)

5. **There's no set time limit for each stretching (It depends on your tightness)**

Remember how school always does the nonsense - Everyone get to a circle! And there's a guy in the middle doing some stretching for the hands and counting 1,2,3,4... Until 8? Or sometimes they yell 1,2,3... 'Oh teacher not looking' 7,8! And then everyone never even gave 2 crap about whether or not they actually *felt* more flexible.

You do not need to count till 30 seconds or whatever. If that particular muscle feels especially tight that day, okay. Just stretch as long as you want. You'll feel good, seriously. I sometimes stay on the same spot for minutes without even noticing because it *feels* good.

Oh also, remember to stretch your tightest part first rather than the more flexible parts - this will help you limber up.

>Don't think you don't have time to stretch, we all do. It literally takes 5 to 10 minutes a day for minimum benefits. You can literally do it anywhere and anytime - even when you're sitting.

Most importantly, I beg you to **implement** this. Seriously you will feel a bit stupid at first but trust me - I fell in love with stretching after trying out the REAL thing for a few days and felt *so* good. N of course that's not even the real benefits, other than feeling good - *who doesn't want to flow like water*? (N for those who workout... You may be interested in seeing how it *could* make you lift more.)

For those who read the post on *What I learned in 4 years of Self-Improvement... I teach you in 5 mins...* Do not worry - I am still very focused on building the community I promised, I will not fail you guys. It's just I fear I will not be competent enough to help all of you - so please be a bit more patient!

And do note that I'm not trying to boast any greatness from me, these are NOT my ideas, all are from Bob Anderson so please do not credit this as my ideas or think I am trying to do so. Absolutely not my intentions and I just wanted to share it because I was absolutely shocked I was doing it all wrong for 17 years of my life!. I basically have been lucid dreaming seriously for 18 days now and after wearing earplugs, I managed to get my first lucid dream 2 days ago.

And now the problem is I can't enter the DreamWorld. Btw, I'm not sure if this is normal or not but is knowing when you're in a dream and easily entering a dreamworld normal? (Like it's so obvious, it's like hyperspace into my head coz it's very similar to sleep paralysis)

Becoz when I was 10 years old to 11 years old, I experienced sleep paralysis for 30mins - 1h, which may explain why I could and ofc it may be very normal but I was very curious.

I keep failing to enter the dream world becoz my heart goes a bit too fast and my breathing makes my chest muscle move and cancels the rem sleep which is frustrating me, what can I do about it? (BTW, I stretch before I go induce a dream to relax the tension from my body)

I tried just not thinking about lucid dreaming when I'm trying but I seem to be always knowing it's a lucid dream when it comes (the transition). Have you ever just sat down on a chair with a great book and you were just absolutely overwhelmed with how much practical information you would get that will change your life! If - only you would use it. But somehow you forget about it or you just read the entire book, smile and feel good for 2 days. But your life still stays the same but you felt you have been productive.

Idk about you but that's me. I used to sit down and read a good book in 5 hours and then smile and feel "enlightened". I'll be like woah... Deep Work book was so good, I am so going to implement it once I go home. Yeah... Not happening. I struggled with this ever since I started reading self-help books from 13 years old until 16 years old, I was searching widely for a note-taking method that focused more on grabbing the practical takeaways from a book and apply them into my life quickly.

Frustrated, I had to create my own one, it took me a long time to experiment every day and really kicked myself in the ass for failing this and that until I managed to create a rudimentary way of doing so, if anyone knows someone who has created a method to implement books, do let me know! I would love to know about it!

After noting at the back of my head that I've at least wasted 1,000 hours+ just consuming and applying absolutely nothing. I have to say to you guys, it's not you guys don't want to apply (Okay well maybe some of you are lazy but I know most of you guys aren't) it's just that you don't know *how* to apply. 

I seen many Youtubers and articles talking about *apply* this information but I don't see anyone *talk* about HOW to implement it. And after regretting wasting thousands of hours, I hope that this will help you even a little bit.  


>I do want to note that this doesn't just apply strictly to books, it could definitely be applied for just about any medium, as long as it's practical information to be used.

**There are about 5 types (from what I experience) of Practical Knowledge you need to know before you apply anything:**

**Habitual** **Practical Knowledge** (Just integrate these Practical ones using the habit loop into your life "Habit Loop is the main principle when it comes to changing any habits btw") U can learn more about this either by the Atomic Habits book or an article. "It's to be deeply understood not memorized btw, it's like a math formula."

*But in summary to make something a habit, just ask yourself:*

1. How do I make it obvious?
2. How do I make it attractive?
3. How do I make it easy? 
4. How do I make it satisfying?

You do NOT need to satisfy all criteria, but the more the better of course, this takes time to learn how to be fast at building habits instantly for example, I found out I keep forgetting about my pillow when I go down to meditate, so I just placed the pillow in front of my door - easy. I will never forget it anymore. 

Or maybe apples, just put them outside so you will actually eat it since it's right there and perhaps eat it after brushing your teeth, it makes it more satisfying imo.

    

**Procedural** **Practical Knowledge** (Put into Procedural Booklet - Procedural Booklet is basically just a A4 or A5 notebook where you have a table of contents right in front of your book and first page will be your morning routine & night routine where you do daily reviews and to add new habits for example - when I wanted to add stretching to my morning routine, I just put it in my morning routine & that's what I mean by Procedural - following a procedure. 

Of course the only problem here is being consistent, but that's why you need to use the habit loop and make it obvious, attractive, easy & satisfying to stick with your flexible morning & night routine.

So it also means that any procedures can be placed inside this book for example: how to implement a book - write it in there and use a table of content at the front page to navigate with sticky notes - Basically if table of content says '2. Book Implementation Procedure', the page for that will have a sticky note that writes 2 and all it should take is one look at the table of content and one flip to get to where you are (For those who already use BuJo, you can just add it in there.)

    

**Experimental Practical Knowledge** (Experimental is basically practical knowledge where you are not sure whether or not you want to use it... So u want to experiment with it. On a piece of paper - U write down the *date every day on the left side* and write down on right side "*Like a table*" Variable Experimented N the other right side *results -* Basically 3 columns, first column is date today, second column is variable experimented and 3rd column is results and maybe 4th column for additional comments if neede. A bit hard to explain but hope u understand, it's like A/B Testing but only 1 or multiple variable to find out the best variable for the best results.

And then every day, you just check what you are experimenting (If there is a need to do so), for example, I was trying to figure out whether or not eating 8 times a day (By eating half a meal and then coming back later 1.5h to eat the other half) going to save me time and make me work better - it did so that's what I needed to experiment with but there wasn't any variables needed so I just wrote it as being experimented on the next page.

    

**Avoidance** **Practical Knowledge** — What you want to avoid (Daily Reflection/Weekly Review) "Daily reflection is basically another thing I do where every night I will reflect on a Notion Page or u can do on a mini book where you have prompts asking you whether or not you did this or not... N of course writing the practical point on your hand could help as a reminder.

*Weekly Review* is something I do every week to review if I need to review N check something for example, if I wanted to check if I was doing spaced repetition for my learning sessions or if I was falling for Dunning-Kruger effect or not. (It's to reset and make sure you don't fall for very serious traps for example, Was I being egotistical this week? Is a question that could help a lot)

Also one good thing about weekly review is - you can put anything in there, whatever you are unsure of doing or you just want a decide-not-to-decide system (For example, should I get that new phone or not? Should I text my grandma or not?), it's a great tool, I love using it.

    

**Theory** \- Put into Flashcards (Basically any theory that u need to memorize. At the moment, I am figuring out how to use a Zettelkasten (Second Brain) to make the theory much better stored as it grows by itself but I am still figuring it out - U can check out *How To Take Smart Notes Book* if ur interested) 

"Btw, U can use RemNote for flashcards if u want to memorize it N if u r more interested in having the recall of knowledge right in ur fingertips, I recommend the book *Unlimited Memory* to use the *memory palace* to keep everything in ur head and recall very easily but this takes hard work I won't lie."

    

Basically you have (probably) covered about all practical points u will ever meet in any book (Of course this is not exhaustive I am sure) and of course most importantly, u can just write down the **Page Number** of the book (on another notebook) of where the *practical point* was at so it's easy to refer back and figure out how to implement it straight away from those categories of practical knowledge.

All of a sudden it felt like 1 book opened a whole new world and I got to keep *everything*... What a wonderful sensation I felt.

So stop reading widely and start reading *deeply* \- that's what an intellectual is. (Hope this helped you out)

**Let me know you implement what you consume!**

I do want to note that I am hoping I don't sound *boastful* that this is a superior technique or whatever, it's just what worked for me but it may not work for you. (So please don't take this in a, "this is the best, you should definitely use this, everything else out there sucks ass" way)

    

For those who read the post on *What I learned in 4 years of Self-Improvement... I teach you in 5 mins*... **Hi again** \- I am still reflecting deeply how we can offer value to our near future community, not sure where to mention it at when it is done but looking forward to meet more mind-like obsessive intellectuals. (WIP - Very soon to launch as requested from you guys). I'll teach you how to be **anti-social**. (Skip to the end if you don't want to hear the story)

Yeah, you heard that right, not social but *anti*\-social. I was a social butterfly my whole school life until I was kicked out of my family and sent to a boarding school. That's when my confidence or (ego) got hit really hard. I lost all my friends, lost all my confidence.

I was forced to mirror my classmates and people in my dorm - I was forced to talk like them, do what they do, game with them - even though I was on self-improvement. Which meant I was NOT supposed to eat magee mee, not supposed to eat chips, not supposed to watch anime and porn but still did anyways.

I was alone there anyways, what did it matter? That's when I started thinking carefully about what I really wanted to do there - first of all I wanted to read more, talk lesser. So what I did was I became anti-social.

It was really hard at first, it's like telling a gamer to stop gaming when his in the middle of a Valorant match. It's in our human nature to literally mirror people because we all want to fit in. But what was there for me to "fit in" when everyone was the complete opposite of who I was?

That's when I started being unresponsive, I started acting depressed. Whenever they came to talk to me, I'll just respond like how girls used to respond to me in text.

"Huh? Oh... Ok."

"Really...? Ok."

And... They slowly backed off. They knew something was up and they did not talk to me anymore - but what I did wasn't just to get rid of all social interaction N become a hatred of mankind or some crap like that. I made sure to give hints to them that I'll talk when I feel like talking, so when during a day I do feel like crap and want to have some fun talking to "friends", I'll talk to them. They're all generally nice about it (Of course, your social environment may very well not be like that and if you ignore them all, they'll all ignore you.)

There are pros and cons to doing this honestly, you can't blame anyone but yourself when you do feel lonely but at least the pros are you get to read more, you don't get disturbed with distractions anymore and I honestly was just happy being myself.

**So in summary - sorry for the short story, just do this:**

* **Act unresponsive no matter what**. (This will be VERY hard at first but you must resist mirroring their expressions and their body language, just act like your mom when you pissed off your mom.)
* **Be monotone, talk like a robot** (Have you heard of Google Assistance voice? Yeah, you want to copy from them but drop the voice to an even more robotic voice. Like a machine)
* **Don't try to correct them if they ask you any questions, just answer yes and don't look at them if possible** (Just act like you're having a depressive mood for a long long time or act tired)

That's literally all, it's just practice that matters. Just so you know, if you still like to talk to a friend or two, act okayish with that person so that you're not totally deprived of social interactions.

I am not recommending this unless you really just despise mirroring people you hate and you want to just be alone and do your own shit - whatever it is. But I do warn you - once you start being like this, you have to stay like it for a long long time... Again, be very careful if you do want to do this. I was only doing this because I was seriously wasting my time pleasing people I hate and that's why I started doing this.I have a hard time falling back to sleep and staying on the bed for far too long trying to induce a CTB and I keep giving myself insomnia.

Is there any suggestions to stay asleep or not get too excited?. I noticed my old classmates have problems with being themselves.

I also noticed quite a lot of people here talking about problems in self-esteem, would anyone like to vent here?

I would like to know more about what's going on in everyone's head and their life situation.

What makes you insecure?

What makes you want others to make you feel secure? Even though you know yourself very well that it's just going to come back and hurt you anyways if your self-worth is based on such fluctuating fragile things.

Let us know what's going on in your head - genuinely very curious.

N no judgement please everyone. As Confucius said:

"Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof when your own doorstep is unclean". Personally, the reason I am asking this question is because 4 years ago me when he wanted to start self-improvement, he went to Youtube to figure out where to start.

And for 2 years he was on Youtube, watching hundreds or videos on Productivity, Self-Improvement, Billionaire Morning Routines and of course only last year I noticed that... It's just full of nonsense. (Of course, I know there are some great guys there like Thomas Frank)

But if now you just search up Self-Improvement on Youtube, it's just full of "5 tips to this" or "3 ways to this". Most of the videos there are just at best a bit valuable and mostly entertaining. Let me know man whether or not people actually go there to improve themselves or just to entertain themselves?

Coz that's actually the reason I created a channel myself - because I despised, absolutely despised videos like those. It absolutely delays progress and destroys motivation to be on Youtube N thinking they are improving.

I actually quit self-improvement 2 years ago mostly because no one told me where to go next or just a bunch of single advice or methods that are generic as hell. I still remember last I talked to one of my classmates, he told me that isn't dopamine detox - that iman gadzhi said - can do 1 hour of instagram a day?

I was like what the hell... Don't goddamn listen to those guys... THESE "guys" are basically who teenagers look up to for advice on self-improvement... N these guys just give out a bunch of crap advice (ofc again not all Ik) and the teenagers listen... I find that absolutely disgusting. 

An actual dopamine detox means absolutely abstain from any dopamine activities... 1 hour of instagram STILL F's up your brain... Like what's the reason you did a dopamine detox for? To detox your brain from dopamine... So why the 1 hour?

Let me know what you guys think about the current status of self-improvement in Youtube. I do apologize if I sounded egotistical or annoyed you or something - just my honest thoughts, do disagree.As this post title suggests - I'll be hoping to change your mind. On what?

On well - whether or not you're wasting your life or not. Whether or not the path you are going on right now is going to lead to mediocrity and depression. If you so humbly want to seriously think about your life direction for a moment... Continue on. Though you want a writing material and a paper.

Now - there's this thought experiment I found very interesting from the Bullet Journal Method. (Spend at least 10 mins on each, Ik sigh... Lazy... But come on bro - you can do this, it's just 20 mins, that's the equivalent of you eating lunch)

**It goes like this...**

Write down on this page a life of most least resistance. Just you writing a biography of a "you" that went on N continued life with the most least resistance, doing only what's comfortable N write down how that life would have went. N then write down you he/she died.

Then the next page you write down a page of most resistance, doing the uncomfortable work N hard work N seeing where do you go and what do you do N what successes happens. N by the end of this life, what happens? Do you die with a loving family and legacy? Do you die with a smile on your face?

Now after you are done.

Where are you going?

What do you REALLY want for this life of yours? Do you want to despair or be happy?

Do you want to die with a smile on your face or die without anyone noticing you died?

If you got your answer - do something then. Anything. Start actually taking action rather than staying complacent - You seriously only live once. If you know someone going down your first path - that should scare you. Scare you into knowing that...

Page 207 - Atomic Habits was almost completed. I was about to finish the YT guide to Habit Building and Breaking. Then - a thought.

*Huh... Wonder if there's any other books on habit...*

I shook my head quickly and slapped myself. I had to focus - after few more pages - Another thought.

*Huh... What if there's a better book on habits...?*

I slapped myself and pushed myself to focus once more... 3 hours later - 50 similar thoughts have already occurred.

*Does this sound familiar to you?*

If yes, perhaps this tip could help you out - it did for me. I am going to take a page from GTD (Every Productivity King has red this bro) and give you a taste for it. If you're like me and clicked that back button when you saw that smiling business executive thinking it was for business executives ONLY... Yeah you may need this.

# Inbox

That's one main concept you'll see in there. It's simple really - so simple that it's ridiculous. You download the app TickTick \[Insert whatever to-do list app\] on your PC or phone whatever you use the most. 

Then whenever you are reading, outside or wherever. (If you are like me - reading and hate distractions then just keep a seperate notebook purposefully for inbox reasons) Just write down any tasks or to-do's you FEEL like you need to do or are just wondering.

For example:

\- Is there any other books on habits?

\- Is there books on Hypnosis?

\- Oh yeah - I had to text jessica...

\- Oh shoot 

\- Mother's day next week

Anything that has an action basically.

THEN you continue life normally and you will MUST remember to always ALWAYS clear that INBOX every single night. No matter what.

*Why?*

Because of trust. Once you trust that YOU will clear that Inbox every single night... YOU will start to have clarity and stop worrying about which tasks is for which task - You just KNOW it's going to be taken care of tonight - simple.

*I mean I personally wouldn't trust a president that says:*

"*I do solemnly swear that I will SOMETIMES faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will SOMETIMES to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States"*

Your brain starts to learn that and is able to relax and delegate those tasks or actions to TickTick or whatever you are using.

# Someday/Maybe List

Perhaps you want more? 

You want to take things to the next level?

Then welcome to Someday/Maybe List - My favorite part of GTD.

All you have to do now if you're in TickTick - just create a folder.Then write down the category of lists you usually have that will be added into this someday/maybe list.

For example - I have different categories called Books to read, Unused Tasks, Unused Ideas, Hobbies, Shop. (These are my most common categories)Now what is this for? It's for another main concept of GTD.

# Weekly Review

I love this. Absolutely LOVE weekly review - so good. As the name sounds like - You just review weekly. 

Review what? Review all the things you have placed into someday/maybe list. Whatever books you wanted to read, whatever research you wanted to do. All placed in here becoz ur unsure of needing it YET.

This is where creativity and clarity of mind happens - I knew mine when I first tried this out. At first it feels tedious - useless. But once u do it a couple times... OH SHI! Why do I feel so much more... Idk...

*Zen...*

N when I meant different categories - I literally just mean a way to commonly categorize most of what you input into the someday/maybe list. It could be - Dogs to buy, What to shop, What to Journal about. Anything that you know you will review every week.

It really gives clarity of mind bro - seriously. I never knew such a simple thing could feel so... So LIBERATING.

N of course, this is just the tip of iceberg of GTD - I highly recommend it. The **Bible for Productivity** suits its name for real.

*Why are you promoting GTD?*

I'm not - It just changed my life that's all. I just wanted to share an Intellectual's Mission.

Do let me know how it goes for you - N if I made any mistake for those GTD fans out there (I would gladly accept any critcism please). As you can see from the title - I am trying to create an ultimate list of exactly how many areas could you start self-improvement in. N honestly the reason I want to do so is because I noticed many people seem to... Misunderstand self-improvement. Which is - when they hear of self-improvement they instantly imagine people in the gym, people jogging outside, people meditating like monks in their room.

I would like to shake that stigma you could say - And also at the same time hopefully inspire some ideas to explore different areas of self-improvement when they feel stuck or feel demotivated.

**PLS** do comment any disagreements or anything to make the post better, I really am hoping this post will help *ONE* person out there - I'll be happy. (Also for the areas I know of - I'll give a little resource tip on how to start)

THIS is not final remember pls - I want us to make this the actual *ultimate* list.

Alright let's get into it:

1. **Working Out**
   1. Muscle Building (Bigger Leaner Stronger Book - Bible for this)
   2. Cardio (Swimming, Jogging, Cycling etc)
   3. Stretching (Stretching by Bod Anderson is most likely the Bible for this - easy and simple. I red it a bit before N can't say I know about it but it's a option)
2. **Meditation** (Perhaps *Wherever You Are, There You Are* Book is an option - Though I've never red it)
   1. Zen Meditation
   2. Mantra Meditation
   3. Tai Chi
   4. Progressive Muscle Relaxation
   5. Body Scanning
3. **Rapid Learning** (*Ultralearning* \- Bible for that) and some examples of what can be rapid learned...
   1. Public Speaking
   2. Social Skills
   3. **Language Learning** (Yes... Fluent Forever is the Bible though I've never red it; but seeing the introduction... Yea... But I can't promise whatnot... He talks about becoming fluent in idk... KOREAN in 3 months or something and I'm like... In self-improvement anything is possible man...)
   4. \[Insert whatever is in your head - 99% it can be rapid learned\]
4. **Effective Learning** (Similar to Rapid Learning but this is just more specifically to how to effectively learn anything rather than intensive rapid learning something) and the Bible for this? *Make it Stick: Science of Successful Learning* is VERY highly recommend - it is 80/20 for Effective Learning.
5. **Habit Changing** (Atomic Habits - Bible for this no questions. Yes this is the bible for any habits you think was impossible to stick with... This will help you... Oh, incase you have an addiction, this could help you a bunch - it sure very much did for me!)
   1. **NoFap** (This... Has it's own area since so many people have problems with Porn... Past me included... Best book I know that helped me was - *Your Brain On Porn* 'very practical N useful'.)
   2. **Gamequitters** (Another one area very famous is gaming addiction... I never used any resources myself to stop gaming so... I have no suggestion except heard good things on Gamequitters ebook but I can't confirm anything!)
6. **Memory Improvement** (Hahaha... I am not joking... Our memory CAN be improved... I am as mindblown as you... I started this last year N I was flabbergasted to be able to remember the first 50 digits of Pi... I was like tf... This is real... N ofc this area of self-improvement can be obsessed over for years or even decades) "For the Bible... Well I am not sure honestly coz I haven't red *Unlimited Memory* yet but that's an option for you guys because to improve my memory I did a MindValley Course called Super Brain and that was a really good introduction towards memory improvement)
7. **Lucid Dreaming** (No... I am not trying to start a cult and no - this is not a mystical spiritual thing where everything is very weird and godly... No this crap is real. It's also one of the most underrated self-improvement areas imo. For those who don't know what this is... It's controlling your dreams and being aware you are dreaming and being able to do whatever you want... WHATEVER you want... Yes... That celebrity you're thinking about... Yes you can... Those old memories of your high school... Yes you can... That dead grandfather... Yes you can revisit that in full senses - Though it takes practice I won't lie, need to be very patient with this process) "For the Bible of this... I say Are You Dreaming?: Exploring Lucid Dreams by Daniel Love or you could try the classic Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LeBarge though for more of a modern look - do Daniel Love and his course on Youtube is only like 4$ and it's very good."
8. **Willpower** (The worst case scenario - this is when you need willpower. When you feel like trash, when your mom slapped you, when your dad kicked your gf, when your room got flooded - You have the willpower to push through anyways. "Not sure if I got the definitions wrong" BUT be very careful when dealing with willpower - most people I know or heard of is all about the stigma of Discipline and all that crap about be more disciplined. But if I'll be honest here - I've very rarely used willpower and I did a take in habit changing, changed my entire environment to support my goals and - BAM - Never needed to use willpower as it was EASY to read, it was SATISFYING to read, it was OBVIOUS to read and it was REWARDING to read.)
9. **Productivity** (Ah yes... Back to basics huh? It means getting more done while doing less; Bible for this? Hard to say... and hard to define productivity... So let's break it down)
   1. **Getting Things Done** (Absolute Bible for Productivity; After reading it multiple times N implementing it and re-reading again... WOW... I avoided this book for years because I saw the cover a business man and it looked... Old... N as a teen... I'm like do I look like an executive bro? Oh man... How wrong I was... After seeing THIS book mentioned like 5 times from my favorite authors like Cal Newport... I was done... I had to see what was this "Bible" and oh my gawd... Bible it is... It teaches you the Art of Stress-Free Productivity and having clarity of mind and basically teaching you how to deal with tasks like a monk. Trust me - this is the first book you should analyze and live to understand what I am saying)
   2. **Bullet Journal Method** (Absolute Bible for Organizing ALL your to-do's, calenders, planners, trackers and diaries ALL in one book... Literally. I've only used this for a while but it's a great addition towards GTD and both are very very good - really good.)
   3. **Deep Work** (This bad boy talks about focus. So you could say this is the "Bible" for Focused Work and it's really good - I never believed I could finish a task that I thought would take 4 hours in 1 HOUR! Like wha.... Most people don't even know they're distracting themselves nor did I. But this book really teaches you to hone in your focus and get crap out of the way)
10. **Mental Visualization** (Now WAIT... Don't skip... It's not boring nor is it as hard as you think it is... I never liked visualizing... NEVER did... Still don't... BUT. If you are interested in changing your entire character/self-image and become a new person... Literally programming yourself... Then Psychocybernetics... is your Bible for that... Am still reading it right now actually lol but just seeing how you can mental play your piano without HAVING the piano to me is just like... HUH?? N you still improve almost just as much if you were playing it... Is what... N the fact that a lot of Olympic Champions uses it.... Uh.... Yeah...)
11. **Social Skills** (Well... Any introverts here? If so... Bible for that at least the one I know of is How to Win Friends & Influence People... Do NOTE that it says INFLUENCE not MANIPULATION... This is your bible to improve your social skills by a lot... Oh yeah... Don't follow it so religiously especially when it comes to high school or Uni friends... It's... Hard to say... It's not really best to follow it religiously when it comes to teenagers I should say but still definitely your Bible!)
12. **Character Building** (NOOO... Don't SKIP... This is very important! This is you as a person... This is how people be friends with you for a week and at the back tell their friends "Yo... This kid can be trusted... His very open and just... Idk I feel safe with this kid..." and for Character Building means becoming a good human being... N it's hard not to mix philosophy and spirituality into this... But. For now, just know that Character is our identity, it's hard to explain honestly coz I am not an expert on this. But the Bible for you will be "*7 Habits of Highly Effective People*". Great book on not just character building but there's a very good chapter on Emphatic Listening which has been SO helpful in making me realize I don't actually listen to my best friend properly and I am just listening to reply, not UNDERSTAND.)
13. **Emotional Intelligence** (Yes - Your emotions can have intelligence. I believe this to be a big area that most people lack and really need to look into. Everyone I know (I only have 1 friend and 1 mom) has a good degree of emotional intelligence. They understand how to control their emotions and not let ego "Another interesting topic" to stray them from their path which is why it's why I believe it should be UNDER character.) I sadly never red any books on it BUT what could be an option is **Emotional Intelligence 2.0**. OR **The School of Life: An Emotional Education** recommended by u/BobbyWeasel "Thank you!" (Another Option could possibly be *Emotional Intelligence* by Daniel Goleman... But. I didn't like how unpractical the book was but it was good theory book on it I could say - But don't take my word for it, I didn't exactly read it properly!)
14. **Sleep** (NO... Pls don't skip this... It's not boring! It's something that you do 4 months every YEAR... How can it be boring??! It's fascinating... VERY fascinating... **Why We Sleep** shall be your bible... Why We Sleep tells you.. Just how amazing the benefits of sleep is... If you workout... If you learn stuff... If you play the piano... YOU need the most sleep... Talks very detailed and NOT confusing theory on sleep and of course on how to improve your sleep...)
15. **Masculinity** (Now.... THIS book according to my best friend... Is YOUR Bible to being a MAN... The book is called The Way of the Superior Man... Great book he says... N this is not the typical testerone booster, you gotta grind book on masculinity... It's very... Philosophical...)
16. **Spirituality** (Very hard to talk about... I don't know much about this field... BUT... If you want to reach for Spiritual Enlightenment - basically finding your one true self and want to rise above your level of thinking... Then "**Power of NOW**" should be your Bible...) "I know there are books like Bhagavad Gita and Wherever You Go, There You Are and many others. BUT I never red any of them so I can't help you... Apologies mate.)
17. **Mental Models** (Ah... One of my favorites... Mental Model determines the quality of your decision making and thinking... It's highly fascinating and there are a lot of mental models out there but for a GREAT Introduction... Pls read The Great Mental Models Volume 1. I red it - Multiple times actually. It's super good... I especially loved First Principles Thinking & Inversion - Highly recommended N his other volumes... haven't red yet so I can't say!)
18. **Philosophy** (This is honestly a way of life... It's very... Hard to explain... It's to do with character and living a good life and many things that I don't know how to explain... *Meditations* is a great introduction towards it... Created by the Roman Philosopher Emperor.)
19. **Breathing** (Yes... This is an area... I know WHAT?! Breathing?? Yes... Believe me... You're not breathing correctly nor am I... I haven't red any books on it but... What looked very promising to me was Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art seemed very promising to teach you - but again I never red it so keep that in mind)
20. **Personal Knowledge Management** (Oh yeah... It's an actual thing! I've tried to enter this field before N try to figure out how to organize my knowledge but until now I am still trying to decipher what's going on! 2 Books I can recommend is "How to take smart notes" and "Building a Second Brain". Those 2 books are great introductions!)
21. **Skincare** (Yeap! This is self-improvement imo for sure! I never red this book but according to my researching skills - This book "*Skincare: the Ultimate No-Nonsense Guide*" seems to be the best according to Goodreads.)

Now I know you may be wondering... Why are they all mostly books?? Why are there no like courses or videos or whatnot?? Well my answer to that is to be really honest with you, books ARE the way to gain knowledge N deeply understand the world or whatever it is honestly...

Youtube genuinely can't teach you to think for yourself... Most videos out there are "5 Tips for Productivity" or \[Insert recent video you watched on Youtube\] and I know this because I own a YT channel myself. I was wondering why the hell was I following all of them?? Why AM I making those 3 signs you're not progressing on self-improvement... Like... IS that really going to help anyone??

No - it will not. This is why I highly highly N only suggest books and sometimes very rarely courses if it's actually that good but books 99% of the time.

*Also - I do know this list can be overwhelming for SOME - But just start with the ones you are either most interested in or are struggling the most in* (Take your pick)

**This list is not completed, I will update it from time to time if anyone has any suggestions!**

Edit 1 - 18/8/23 (Am adding a side towards willpower & emotional intelligence). So I am trying to know if I am doing something wrong here... I have made a unique mnemonic for each of my clefs line and have been drilling them into my head... But I can't seem to get them to play on my hands... Can anyone tell me how to memorize them?

But after using the mnemonics... Or should I be practicing like crazy?

My unique mnemonic meaning is I attached for example line 1 of F clef is Ground N line 2 is Balls - N so on.

Is there a faster way to memorize this with accuracy?. So I was wondering, after being on Pianote Level 4 now. Am wondering just when the hell am I able to play intermediate level songs like L's theme or something.

&#x200B;

Does anyone play anime music and had to learn like for example; Arpeggions, C-Scale etc or something like that.

&#x200B;

I want to know like exactly the path to playing most anime music. What exactly are the components, scales and whatnot do I need to be able to learn?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bOruXptlg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bOruXptlg). I was just curious, are people interested in gaining muscles, like looking lean and strong type of muscles by just going to the gym like literally 4h a week only and genuinely just the laziest way to gain muscles. Like in 3 months, some life-changing stuff going on type of improvement.Just really curious, what do people think and are confused about when it comes to speed reading?. Hi, I am planning to make a mini-course about an entire system that will pull out every practical point from a book easily implement everything in to your life and automatically filters what's needed and what's not.
  

  
Because I noticed after being reading nonfiction books for 3 years, I've been doing nothing about. Until a month ago. And the growth I saw was insane. All a sudden it felt like I was on steroids for self-improvement. Everything started going right and my addictions that I suffered for years fell off like it was nothing...
  

  
Will anyone be interested in buying something like that?.Anyone gets super anxious, cold and dizzy, and feeling faint when their heartrate is lower than usual?
Normally, my resting HR is around 70-75, and when walking around 100-120. Today my resting is around 58-65 and active 80-100. I'm super restless, shaky and scared. I think of the worst, that my heart is failing, giving up, or that I have some electrical issues. Does anyone have any words of encouragement or advice?  I'm so upset that I feel so physically unwell from these paradoxical symptoms that are opposite to how anxiety manifests itself.I'm 30 and I feel like my life is over.

Recently, I turned 30, and was looking back at my life. I'm not where I want to be, but I feel like it's too late now. I was a very quiet kid, bullied at school, taught at home that if I just study and be nice and proper, that's all that matters. I missed out on a lot, because of the sheltered upbringing. Also battled depression through late teens and early adulthood because of feeling like i don't belong, lack of socialisation. I do not know, how to have fun, go out places, it gives me anxiety, I feel like I'll make a fool out of myself and everyone will hate me just being there. 2 years ago I finally moved out, got a well paid job in a big city and fell in love with a coworker, who didn't reciprocate in the end. Yes, I know, work and romance don't mix, and before that I'd tell you the same. But sometimes you can't help things. After being rejected, I developed an anxiety disorder. I treat it with meds and I tried therapy, but I didn't feel like this therapist was right for me, so I resigned after 6 months. 

I'm still very much in love with someone who doesn't want me. And no, i cant switch jobs, the marker is very volatile right now and i do not have enough experience just yet. I feel like it's all downhill from here,  that I'm aging, that I'm broken and no one will ever want me, because I'm getting older,uglier and fatter. And I've always been ugly and boring, so... And now I also have a mental  disorder. And who needs someone like me? I've almost run out of time as a woman anyway.  I've been in relationships before, but I've never felt so strongly about someone. I don't even know, why I'm writing this. Just to vent maybe?. There's not a single second without that thought. Maybe I'll stop breathing. Maybe my heart will stop suddenly. Maybe I'll choke on food I'm eating. It restricts me so hard. I can't eat, moving from couch to the kitchen is terrifying. I can't breathe. I can't swallow foods or liquids. 
I'm on meds, I tried therapy, nothing really helps. I get the whole slew of physical symptoms, sometimes better sometimes worse. Going to shops is like climbing Mount Everest. It's been like that for so long. Does anyone have any tips?. I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder 2 years ago, after a horrible weakness,palpitations and dizziness at work, which was chalked up as a panic attack by an ambulance crew. Since then my health seemed to deteriorate despite me going on medication, therapy,gym, healthy eating habits. What is worst, my anxiety is purely physical, I have bouts of vertigo, breathlessness, numbness and aches in limbs, dysphagia and choking on liquids, fatigue, I sleep 15h a day. I finally paid out of my pocket for a battery of tests. Nothing came out of it, except low D3 and undetectable B12 levels. I went to a GP, he seemed quite concerned, he prescribed me b12 tablets, d3 tablets and referred me to a neurologist. He said, to him it does not sound like anxiety, what would be on his list is deficiency, lupus, multiple sclerosis or arthritis. Now I'm distraught. Anyone has ever been in a similar boat?. I'm lonely, I'm awkward, I'm alone. No friends, almost no family, no spouse. Work was the only place I interacted with people at. I know coworkers aren't friends, but these were the only people I felt comfortable around and my only social interaction during the day. Now it's all being taken away from me. I hate remote culture. I hate social media and virtual contacts and friendships and whatever. I hate the modern technology, even though I actively work on it.Today I unpacked Kobo Elipsa 2E, set it up through WiFi and then went on to connect it to PC via original USB cable. There is no prompt for PC connection, I tried 3 other cables, 2 computers, all ports available and 2 operating systems. Whenever the reader is connected either to a PC or a wall charger, the screen freezes and becomes unresponsive. I tried factory reset too. Is mine just faulty?. This is going to be long. 
I will be 30 in a few months. And my life is heading nowhere and I gave myself a heartbreak. 

2 years ago I finally found a dream job, as a software engineer, it pays well, people are great and I love it. However...
At the beginning I was working remotely and living two hours away in a dead end city, with my mother, my father passed away a few years earlier from lung cancer and it hit us pretty hard. 3 months into my job, there was a work social I decided to travel for. I had a blast, I felt like I was living finally, I felt accepted and proud of how much I accomplished. My plan was to have a few drinks and go back home by train. I lost track of time and stayed way too late. All the trains have already departed. My plan was to just go to the train station and wait a few hours until morning trains resume operation. A man from my team offered that I could crash at his place, because he was concerned for my safety.  I have taken quite a liking to him the moment I met him, so I agreed. It was very nice, we drank tea, listened to music and talked a lot that night. I never felt such a connection to anyone ever before. Then we just slept next to each other. 

Then the next morning, I did something that was the biggest fuckup of my life. I cuddled up to him and offered that we could... get closer if he wanted. He said that I'm lovely and pretty and he likes me, but he doesn't do one night stands because it always ends up in sadness and has no depth to it. He also had an issue with me being 13 years younger. The irony is, my whole life that's been my stance too. I just had some system overload, looking back, where I suddenly felt very strongly about someone emotionally and physically and I couldn't handle it. 

Of course I immediately withdrew my advances and apologised,we laughed it off. 

A few weeks later, during another social I stayed up late purposefully and stayed at his on purpose. Again, it was lovely and I've learned a lot about him and we talked about our issues and life baggage and all that. Whole night I was playful and I teased him and we ended up doing sexual things to each other, even though he warned me again and again that I may hurt myself. But I was blind and deaf. The issue probably was also we both weren't with anybody for a few years at this point. 

We accepted what happened and that was that. I was on cloud nine, I felt divine, confident, attractive. I freaking moved to the city a few weeks later. He, however was getting sadder by a day and began sulking. He said he feels horrible for what he did to me. We talked about it all, I was saying how I didn't care one bit that he was older, and that I'm willing to give it a shot. But he said, he doesn't have any feelings for me even though he really likes me. And that after his partner ended their 10 years long relationship, confessing she doesn't want or love him anymore, he hasn't been the same. I was hurt, but I understood. 
I thought I was strong, that I'm coping. A year went by, I started having a lot of physical ailments, genuinely felt like dying, apparently I developed anxiety disorder from all the prolonged stress and aching. Now it's 2 years after all this happened and I'm broken. I'm still in love. I barely function, I can't move on, I can't meet new people  I tried but they all pale in comparison. I effectively fucked myself up and I can only blame myself.So, I have been having panic attacks and anxiety for more than a year and been diagnosed with anxiety disorder. 
Point is, my anxiety has been purely physical, no anxious thoughts, just dizziness, numbness, headaches, vertigo, pins and needles and shortness of breath, feeling out of it. (So of course that made me scared and uneasy!)
 
I recently joined a gym and happened to be talking to a coworker who is a sports and wellness freak, and mentioned my ailments. She suggested testing for vit B deficiencies, because often when people start working out they burn through the resources in their body. 

So I did, and lo and behold, my B12 levels are undetectable, all I know it's below 148 (the machine won't go any lower) with normal range being 187-883

Now my questions are (of course I'll go to a doctor, but I want to know what I can expect)
1. Did anyone have similar symptoms as well or was misdiagnosed with anxiety?
2. Are shots my only option? Are they painful? Will I have to administer them myself?
3. What the hell happened here, I have a varied diet, I eat red meat, white meat, veggies, fruits, wholegrain products and milk products. 

Thanks in advance!. So, I'm a nearly 30yo woman. About a year ago I suffered a mental breakdown and I'm still healing from it, I am trying to apply good habits, but it's close to breaking me. 

I have been attending therapy, joined the gym recently, but it all feels just like more work and no satisfaction. I live on my own and I have nobody where I live and I never go out because I'm either too scared of strangers or too tired. My blood tests are all good and my meds well adjusted. My day most of the time looks like this:
8:00-9:00 wakeup, breakfast, get ready for work
9:00 leave home, go to the office
9:30 start work
13:00 lunch break 
13:30 - 17:45 work
18:15 get back home
19:00-20:00 workout at the gym
20:15-21:00 rest, have supper
21:00-22:00 have a shower wash hair, go to bed
23:00 sleep

I am just breaking. I have no substance in my life, its all a grind, I'm always sleepy and tired, even if it feels like I should have had a good sleep. On weekends I'm too exhausted and depressed to do anything. I'm so done. I thought gym, therapy, would give me more energy, but it is the opposite. 
Now I even have problem working at the office, because i hear all these conversations of people who have friends, do stuff, and I start having tears in my eyes, wondering what the fuck is wrong with me.As the title states. I know it was my decision and my fault. I used to be purely f2p so I had to disenchant to keep up, now past 2 years I've been better off and buying expansions. I really love this game and the idea of Twist format, but I'm just sad for all the cards I used to have and that I won't be able to participate. Tbh, I'm considering quitting to cut the losses. Sorry for the rant.I have been going to the gym for 3 weeks now. I thought that would help me, but it only peaked my health anxiety again, after I seemed to get better. I feel like I was run over by a bus the day after workout. That dull ache in my calf? Must be a blood clot. My calf no longer hurts? I'm sure it now moved to my lungs and going to kill me. Every random pain scares me shirtless.  And my oxygen today dipped to 92-95 and doesn't want to go up, where I normally am in 97-100 range and I don't know why and it's freaking me out.Hi, a fellow health anxiety sufferer wants to share her experience!

I have an anxiety around my heart and breathing and this was my first time at the gym ever. Few things I noticed:

I was more short of breath changing into gym clothes and waiting for my trainer, than when actually working out.

I got my HR up to 160 full on working out, and it didn't bother me at all. Meanwhile I can be grocery shopping or going to work and get it to 120 and feel like I'm dying and can't handle it. No ectopics either, not once. 

Not once was i short of breath, yawning, unable to take a deep breath when working out. Meanwhile, I can be sitting at the couch watching TV and suddenly feel like I am having a full blown asthma attack. 

I only felt dizzy once, and was fine after a few minutes break, and it was because I was changing positions a lot from horizontal to upright. It was all fine, I knew why it was happening, so it did not freak me out. 

When I got home and cooled down, I was soo relaxed. The sore muscles felt so good, I felt connected with my body, I appreciated how hard it is working for me and understood finally how much I neglected it and that my lack of fitness is dire and my poor body is crying out for help simply. No wonder even a simple walk kills me. 

Why am I writing all this, you may ask. First to show that anxiety is A NASTY PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. Don't engage with it. It's like that annoying coworker, you simply nod while he babbles nonsense, simply to not engage with him and go about your day ASAP. Treat your anxiety the same, nod politely, when it spews out its nonsense, then do what you want to do anyway. 
Second, love your body, take care of it, it loves you and protects you, it's just very lost in these horrible, stressful times. It needs your help.I finally got the courage to sign in for a gym membership with a personal trainer. I want to be healthier, lighter and counteract sedentary work.
But I have health anxiety centered around my heart and breathing. I'm scared and my brain has been screaming at me, that gym will kill me. I'm scared some sneaky arrhythmia will pop up and I'll drop dead. I don't know, once I'm working out, how to tell the difference between my anxiety and something serious. I've had ekg, echo, holter and a ct scan, but nothing eases me. I'm also in therapy, and without it, I wouldn't even dare to try. Any tips from someone who was in a similar situation?. So we had a rotation, got new cards, and yet it all still feels so much the same. Blood DK unchanged, undead aggro priest, face hunter etc. Like,  we get new cards, new mechanics and yet I feel like we've been playing the same uninspiring crap past few years. Even off meta decks don't feel engaging.  
I remember dragon mage, dragon priest, LoE, it was so much fresher and more fun. Even overpowered decks like cubelock or hardonox druid were much more fun.Hello you beautiful people.
I have been taking 20mg of escitalopram for close to two weeks. I've been fine upping my dose before, up to 15 mg, but this last jump has been tough for me. 
Past few days I've been:

Constantly nauseous, especially after eating. Also I often have a stomach ache that makes me feel faint. 

Been having dizzy spells where I feel very weak and can't focus my vision for 10 to 15 mins at a time

I'm generally very slow and very out of it,  world feels like a dream and it's hard to do intellectually challenging tasks. 

I have GAD and health anxiety, and somehow despite feeling like crap, I don't feel super anxious, normally I would be a ball of panic with symptoms like these. So that gives me hope. 

My question is,  did anyone have similar experiences upping to maximum dose? How long should i tough it out? Is it irrational to think that these symptoms may be hyponatremia? 
 Thanks in advance.I have seen plenty of people here showing off their glittery inks and I frankly felt quite overwhelmed when I started to Google. So, I have a few questions:

•Are there any ready-made inks, or you have to infuse them with glitter yourself?

•Can the glitter destroy the nib?

•Does it clog fine/medium sized nibs?

•Where to buy anything I would need, being a person that lives in EU?

•And finally, slightly off topic, what would be the best one... I don't know how it's called in English, but that refillable cartridge so you can use ink from bottles, for waterman hemisphere? The one waterman sells?. Hello. I'm a 29 years old female. For almost a year I've been suffering with anxiety disorder. I'm medicated and I'm going to therapy. Now that we have that out of the way, let's focus on what's bothering me. 

Every minute, every second there's an alarm in my head going off telling me I am close to dying. Every chest tightness, every pain, every vertigo, every moment when I feel I can't breathe is interpreted as my body dying. I'm scared of going out, I'm scared of excercise, I'm scared to get off my couch. Now, I'm not afraid of being dead. I'm not afraid of the prospect of dying in the future. I'm scared of a sudden death, specifically the process of dying. Of laying there, knowing no one can help me, because I live alone and the very few people I know are far away. I believe all the time, I'm minutes away from a deadly arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. I'm scared of the embarrassment of dying somewhere public. Would anyone help me? Or ignore me or rob me? I'm scared that I didn't do everything I could, to protect my health, even though I've been to a cardiologist, had an MRI, chest tomography and tons and tons of bloodworm.

My life is difficult. On one hand, it's going the best ever, I have a well paying job that I love, a nice place to live. On the other, I'm very shy and lonely, scared of going out, feeling like my life is slipping through my fingers. I have a crisis knowing I'm almost 30. There's so many things I want to do and experience. But the anxiety is gripping me with its iron hands. 

Can someone give me an advice? Or at least tell me they feel/ felt the same?. Hello. I'm a 29 years old female. For almost a year I've been suffering with anxiety disorder. I'm medicated and I'm going to therapy. Now that we have that out of the way, let's focus on what's bothering me.

Can someone give me an advice? Or at least tell me they feel/ felt the same?. I (29F) recently have changed my psychiatrist. The new one switched me from one generic brand of pregabalin to another, saying he believes it's the one that gets absorbed best. I take it for anxiety, 75 mg in the morning and evening, along with 75mg of venlafaxine in the morning. 
I took it for 3 days and noticed that my resting heart rate dropped from 70 to 50 and my heart rate generally would not go up above 100, while brisk walking and similar activities. I didn't think much of it, but today I had to run for a bus and couldn't, felt short of breath and with slight chest pain. My HR would not go up above 85 even though I was actively attempting to run. 
I then was switched back to the previous brand of pregabalin, waiting to see, if things go back to normal,but I'm insanely curious what happened there? Couldn't find anything on the internet.For context, I suffer from anxiety. I have been experiencing shortness of breath for about a week, decided to do a ddimer to put my anxious mind at ease. It came back elevated, at 1400. (Norm 500) I was referred to an urgent care unit, spent 6h there, they run various blood tests, a chest CT scan. All came out clear, except ddimers were still at 1200, they didn't know why, but didn't seem concerned. After that visit I woke up with a pain in my knee radiating both to thigh and calf, very mild and I've had it for years, but I'm still freaking out. I really don't want to go to ER again, it puts a gigantic strain on my mental health. What should be my next step? I'm worried now, that the clot isn't in my lungs, but leg.Title. She makes everything revolve around her, I need to even tell her what I wore to work and for example she gets mad, if I wear sneakers, because she says it's sloppy and unwomanly. She's been taking care of me past month, because I went through a mental breakdown and have been suffering deliberating panic attacks and high anxiety, but now she turns everything against me, saying she deserves to know, because she's been caring for me. I'm a 29f. I'm so tired, I've already so much to deal with.I have started taking Lyrica again on my own accord after I started having multiple, heavy and prolonged panic attacks everyday again (been free of them for many years) due to stress at work and horrible heart break. But this time, I was having a few side effects - dry mouth, constipation, bad breath, being generally out of it and mentally slow, blurry vision. But pregabalin helped me a lot generally. But I wanted to be responsible and consulted with my psychiatrist. He switched me to trazodone and I'm starting to really regret that. I'm taking 50mg at night, it's the second day, so far, I had the worst panic attack, I feel both drowsy and tense and stressed after taking it, my mood significantly lowered, im angry, I feel like I'll never be able to feel happiness again. And it is really hard to wake up in the morning. Anyone else experienced something similar?. I've been depressed on and off for 12 years. I'm spiraling down again. Past year I made it far,  found a well paying job, doing what I always wanted, escaped poverty, only to find out it doesn't matter at all,  i mean nothing to anyone, I have no one, my zero social skills and inability to connect with people is killing me, I'm ugly, lonely, and very, very, very tired. I take no pleasure from living anymore.So, I bought myself a Merula XL, because I loved the idea of cups and my period is heavy. I have a very high cervix also.  I tried it twice, had some issues inserting it, so I kinda irritated myself down there. The problem is, I had issues with making it open up, because once it was inside, there was no space left to insert a finger and check the rim, but I managed,  it opened up and imnediately felt excruciating pain from the suction, I could literally feel it physically pulling down my cervix when it was inside and even more so, when I was taking it out. It was yesterday and I was bleeding a normal amount after taking it out. Today though, I'm bleeding really heavily, like never before, passing huge blood clots. I'm not in any pain, though, but I'm scared that,  I don't know? Dislodged something while trying the cup? Is it even possible? Did anyone experience something like this?. So, a little background. I've been struggling with social anxiety since I was 13 and depression from 16 to 24. I'm 28 now. I was a very sheltered, isolated kid. From year 20 I started working on my social anxiety, through the years I used absolutely not be able to leave the house alone without having a mental breakdown, not talk to anyone, keeping absolutely to myself, skipping school to avoid people. I learned how to navigate through the world, slowly, currently I'm living alone, having a well paying job,  going to the office. I basically learned how to function. But I feel, that's it,  that's as much damage as I could repair and there's the limit. I just keep casual, forced office relationships, but I'm very lonely. I find it hard to connect with people, it's very tiring for me, it's like wading through the same scenario every time. And it's a paradox, because I really crave human contact and lack of it really hurts me. The problem is,  while I was able to become functioning, I'm not able to be in social situations for pleasure, no matter how much I try. I tried going places alone, parks, cinemas, pubs, you name it,  but it always makes me feel uneasy, scared, wanting to cry, it's like it's too much to process. I don't have that problem, when I'm in these situations with someone I know and like,  but as I do not have ANYONE to do stuff with, it creates a vicious cycle. I'm really lost and wanting an advice. But something more than 'just keep trying and it'll work' because it's clearly not the case, it doesn't work, I tried. Like I said,  I hit the wall in self development years ago and I feel like that's it.So,  I've had my ears pierced when I was 12, by a piercing gun (didn't know any better) but never ever had any issues with them. Suddenly, after 16 years, they just opened up and bleed a lot every time I take off my earrings. I don't have any allergies, but still I wear good quality jewelry, silver and surgical steel. What can be the reason of this sudden change? I didn't injure myself, didn't wear any new jewelry, didn't wear anything heavy.Hello, I am a recently graduated computer science engineer, second class honours. I know there is a long way ahead of me, so I am holding my horses, but I am curious how would I go about getting myself involved into medicine-related projects. I am especially big on genetic disorders and neurobiology, read a lot on these in my spare time. Any insight is highly appreciated!. Hey, I just finished the game and I just have a few things to say, if this post seems useless, feel free to delete, I just need to vent. :)  


So, I loved the game, the story, the atmosphere, so oddly serene and yet tense, great puzzles, open-ended ending, but it is kinda bothering me that these days a lot of games seem to always drift towards these bittersweet endings, I feel like Rolf's death was unnecessary, I feel like the game would have only gained from him surviving all this, it would leave me much more satisfied with the game. That's all folks!. Hello.  As the title says, I am a graduate. I am a Computer Science Engineer. I  know C# and .NET fairly alright, I know a bit about DBs, I know how to  work  both on an agile and waterfall projects, have a firm grasp of OOP.  Are there any open source projects I can contrubute to? Or a way to  earn a small amount of money without leaving home? (2 unrelated  questions). I was supposed to start a job, but due to the outbreak, I am  stranded sadly and feel pretty useless.Hello. As the title says, I am a graduate. I am a Computer Science Engineer.

I was supposed to start a job, but due to the outbreak, I am stranded sadly and feel pretty useless.So, my life is in motion right now, I have a great relationship, I'm about to start a new job and move to a new place. Basically, I'm 26, and finally starting the adult life. But I have this looming feeling, that it doesn't matter, because it's already too late, I'm aging too rapidly and my youth is gone and all my goals are insignificant. Does anyone else struggle with such thoughts? What are your ways to cope?. I have been put on Ortho Evra by my ob-gyn, after I stopped tolerating Midiana pills. It's my 6th day, the patch is kinda nasty on the edges and it is wrinkled, I have it on my upper arm. Is it still effective in such a sorry state?

But there is something that worries me more, apparently you are more likely to get a blood clot and I told my obgyn I am specifically afraid of that side effect, but she said it is a safe and convenient method.

I am 26 years old, slightly overweight, my dad had a heart stroke at 50. I dunno if I should continue it... I would opt for a non hormonal IUD, but I never had children, so it is a no go for me.I've been taking 75mg of Effexor for 6 years, haven't been depressed since, never had a need to up the dosage. My family keeps pestering me, that it's time to taper, but I'm not sure. Are there any risks of lifelong Effexor medication?  I feel good and I don't feel the need to change anything. Anyone with similar experiences?. So, I've been exposed to PCs my whole life, spent countless hours typing and used multiple tools on and off to learn touch typing over the years. 

I still cannot touch type and I want to hear your opinions on whether I'm not dedicated enough or is it my physical problem. I can kinda touch type, but i make a lot of typos and my speed is not satisfactory. The point is, I have poor coordination due to a lack of depth perception caused by a lazy eye. I also noticed my hands are kinda stiff when I attempt to focus on touch typing. I'd love to hear your insight and tips on how to get better!. As the title says, looking for a club with chill, friendly folks. :) NuclearMoonCat is my nick.I know it is not much AT all, but I was happy to climb even this far with my non-meta jank. I made this to beat monored, focused on lifegain synergy, put in lots of removal to help me survive to mid and late game.

&#x200B;. Like the title says. I have an important university project that is going to fail and all I know that my mother will be angry and scream at me and hate me. I don't know why my depression is back. I tried telling my mom, she says it's all because I sit at home all the time and I just need to focus on work and work more and that I'm the one to blame and that I cannot be depressed because I take meds every day. I'm feeling the worst I have ever felt. No one understands. I just sleep all the time or stare into nothing. I just don't care anymore about anything.He dumped me bc I won't sleep with him or convert to my religion.. and I won't move to his dream place. Also he loves to make lies.

We have no common ground. But I love him. 

I want to be with him and just pray he will be nice to me and change. I really like him for some reason. I like talking to him and taking his negging and abuse. I feel it's love.

I just want to explore his world and be with him. I'm not done with him. Doing my work and back my sanity 
Too many problems dating the wrong guy 
Your goals and life style loses track 
Health goes bad 
That man just wanted sex and someone to go with him around the world. He was pretty cold 
I think he just wanted sex 
When he didn't get any 
He was out. i had suspicion he was after sex.. during the phone call.. he asked me what do you think will happen when we meet.. then in the car ride.. he knows i won't fuck him unless he commits to me.. he says what if each time we have sex.. he says sorry? I said no. when we were at the restaurant, he looked at my cleavage and he touched my ankle. i let him do that as i thought we were going to be a lifelong partner but we just met for a hour and already a lot of touching.. then the next day he was disgusted at me. and third day.. he ended it all.. now he's telling lets be friends and saying we are not compatible. i don't think i'll hear from him again and if i did.. it will be something bad.. i think he hates me. I dont wanna talk to him anymore as he won't commit to me. I hope he doesn't reply. He keeps hurting my feelings.He keeps denying me but wants to come back. It won’t be a good time. I am starting to talk to other ppl. Each time he rejects me it hurts. How he makes me feel is biting a piece of brick. It’s hard and painful. But he keeps pulling me and I keep biting. Soon all my teeth will be gone. 

I want to leave him now. Since he won’t give me what I want.He made me very horny. He asked if we can sleep together and I told him only if he commits to me for life. He denied me and told me we are not compatiable and he wants to leave the country. I am hurt as he negged me. He held my hand and touched my leg. I felt he practically owned me and didn't want me anymore. 

After he ended things with me. I told him I love him and want to have sex with him if he commits to me for life. He told me lets be friends. I told him i want to call him daddy. He never responded.

Update: we never had sex. First night he was touching my ankle and looking at my cleavage. I saw him looking at my boobs and he looked at my eyes knowing I caught him. I wanted to have him. I was turned on. 

Then he kept saying he didn’t like false eye lashes and how my voice was deeper in real life than on the phone. He didn’t like how I wasn’t a book nerd. So many things. 

Second day complete disaster. He didn’t like my fashion and how I ate. Didn’t treat me nicely. Asked me if I can sleep with him a few times I said no. 

Third day he called it off. I am still sexually attracted to him. But I hate his critical ness and how he likes to lie. Makes me not trust him and makes me not like him. 

I want to improve on all these areas.

Update: today is my first day of no contact. Im feeling sad but im movin on. I thought he came for me and was genuine in being with me. Turns out he was just after sex and doesnt care about me. He wants to find someone else. He is just another guy like my exes. Selfish horny and nasty.I didn’t have sex with him bc way too soon and he won’t commit to me for life. He was trying to convince me to have sex with him. 

He ended things with me saying we are not compatible. He was a weird guy. Loves to lie and eat bugs that may have diseases. 

My therapist told me since he loves to break rules he will cheat in marriage. Not a good guy. 

Also he needs help on his own since he is sad. 

I felt I wasn’t attractive enough for him and his personality was too different for me. We were automatic incompatible. The way we dress and think. 

He made me horny that’s about it.I am hoping to be on this for 30 days to preserve my self worth. After the man rejected me I did not cut him off and asked if I can call him daddy. I feel I’m sexually deprived and lonely & desperate. I never kissed him or had sex with him. This was an emotional connection. 

As the days go on. I am hoping to achieve my weight loss goal and financial gain. Also the other things I needed to work on.I did a psychologist appointment... I know the guy is not genuine now.. I thought he was genuine and wanted to love me but I wasn't enough.. Turns out he was only looking for sex. I don't care about him anymore. As I was drawn to him for his status, colour, and height. But not him as a person.

He always lies. He had a great profession and how he reads and interprets things is really good. I felt we talked and understood each other. The conversation flows. But he likes to do fraudulent things and lies.. This can get him into jail or trouble that is why I don't trust him.. he wants to fck me and leave me 

against my faith 

but I kept saying no

thank god we live far away so this can't happen. Ofc i know this is true.. our faith is different. Where we want to live is different. He thinks I lack education and cleanliness. I think he lacks morals and ethics.he told me he likes me but we are not compatible.. I understand what he is saying. since I don't like his pet and he doesn't like my religion and dreams of where to live..

I think I'm done talking to him. I confessed my feelings already. He still doesn't want to be with me and change who he is. There is nothing I can do. We are very different with our hearts. 

I think it's just mutual attraction from looks and talk.. I have been rejected before.. but this was scarier for me as I trusted the guy.. he was sketchy as fck but I trusted him..He is always trying to cut corners and scam the system.When he put a hat on me and hugged me goodbye. I didn't expect that. I thought he was gonna leave me. I cried today. As in my entire lifetime no one has done something so special for me. He didn't make me feel loved. But he made me feel like I was human and I am somebody. Our relationship always had deep conversations and he asked me things. This always happens to me that I wish things were different and the person would just be with me. He really thought about it. He really did. 

I really saw him as my partner. I got to know him. He does filfthy and disgusting things. Disgusting and ungenuine thoughts. He told me we see things differently. I really hope the best for him. He is sad. But his sadness causes actions that will harm me. Instead of healing.. he wants to do mean things. Our hearts are different. But our loneliness is the same. 

I think this connection isnt there. But he made me feel pretty special.He judged me 
Asked questions like if he could have sex with me and I said no 
Since he's gone now.. i feel good 
No black cloud around me 
Things he did was not good for me 
Mentally or physically 
He stressed me out and made me feel unwanted 
I feel good he's gone now 

I want someone with a kinder heart.. someone who hugs me and holds me.. someone who honors me.. i wonder how it feels to lose me. As he wasn’t willing to respect and commit to me fully. He also didn’t look at me with love and care. 

He also wanted to break my precious boundaries. Trying to convince me to do something I don’t want to do. He wanted me to break my friendship with my God.He broke up with me because he won't be in my faith and I don't like his pet.

He wants to date other ppl bc he has no feelings for me. He also wants to leave America.

I feel sad. Idk what to do.I know he is not good for me as his personality was shit.

I think I need to chill.the way he dresses and expresses himself.. his dark sad self came out I was like fck you.. You are in pain so you are going to make me in pain too? Cheat on me in front of me? 

When I first met him he was checking me out. It was hot. 

I don't love him. I don't want to think or see him again. I puked.

I think I like parts of him but that's something that will be with me for a bit. As it is pathetic to like someone who rejected you. I like the side face of him. It was like a fat cat. I liked him when he told me to call him sexy and daddy. I felt it was pretty hot. He told me I was horny. I told him I don't want to have sex with him unless it's serious. He accepted this request. 

He brought to me see things I never seen before it was cool. I don't think I want to see him again. He is too unstable. 

&#x200B;. I think I was dating above my league.. he was so lonely and wanted someone so did i.. but he wasnt into me.. when he did hold my hand it felt weird. When we first met I felt he was very sexy but wasn't my type.. i jumped on him and made him do things for me. It was hot.. the first date.. i wanted him badly..

Second date it was bad. I felt unattractive. He said things that made me feel he wont be there for me.

Third date he was gone. We didnt have a third date. Told me he will never get involved with my religion and i said too many unnecessary things. I felt his coldness. I don't want to sleep with him anymore bc he isnt serious about me.I can just pretend nothing happened and that was it. Like a dream. 

He really didn’t help me in the end or capture my heart. His coldness makes me feel indifferent and I have no feelings for him either. 

But I kind of want to go to where he lives and meet somebody else. An interesting place. 

I liked this experience as it helps me prep for my future partner. He picked me up and walked me through the place. Then we out for dinner and was flirting. Drove out to see stars. It was amazing but it wasn’t good since he’s not the one. Lots of touching and glaring at dinner. I like this type of. Date.

I learned that men will do things to make you happy if they think you could be the one.

Second date I looked horrible from the walk. He dumped me. It was really fast. Second date we lost attraction.8 months a go I was sexually assaulted by a guy I liked. It took me 8 months to get over him. Then the last two days it was my first time dating after many years. It was unofficial but still dating. It was my first time holding hands with someone and it didn’t feel good. Felt off.  It was with the wrong person. This new person was cool but he was broken. A broken man that is shamed and dark. He was funny but didn’t care for me. But the first date was really fun. I enjoyed my time. I wish I can do it again and stopped nagging him. My nagging wasn’t cool and kept pressuring him to give me an answer. But deep in my heart I knew we won’t work. He was too inconsiderate and not loving to me. This was a huge deal for me. As I never held hands with someone for many years.I felt the same way the feeling was weird 
He is not someone I would go for in real life 
He is much uglier in person and meaner 
The feelings are not mutual 
When I see his face I don’t see love
Never do online dating again 
I feel so lonely and empty right now. He reminded me of my bisexual ex. Fluid sexuality. The way he dressed. I got disgusted and it's everything I hate. He loves doing fraudulent things. Such a scary creature. The man reminded of my father keeps criticizing me and I kept criticizing him. I don’t think I can ever date someone with such a mindset. 

I did feel he was a good person though.. he didn’t sexually assault me and was very careful with my heart. 

I felt pretty respected with this rejection or ending. I tried to force something that wasn’t love. I don’t think I was attracted to him. He was not my ideal. I don’t want to since my eyes hurt and I already know he doesn’t like me.

I’m pretty relieved but sad. 

I didn’t find my person. I thought he was for a moment but now I see he isn’t.

He is right tho we are not compatiable. About to see my bf for the first time in real life. Scared he wont like me and scared i wont like him. This can get bad. I feel in the beginning I can’t do my work but now I am fine 

I can do work and him not talking to me doesn’t bother me as I know he will eventually respond 

I don’t feel sad about him cheating as I don’t know if he is or not 

But I do want to give him my best with respect and try to love him the best I can. This guy is a pretty bad guy.. he is stupid and has no money..

Idk why he is coming all this way to see me

I haven't heard from him for days and he says he could cheat..

He is a weird guy.. come so far to see me and wants to cheat..

I think I should have spoke to him more before agreeing to meet with him.. he is a pretty fucked up guy and kind of sketchy. i did so many things and i don't feel like talking to him 

he is too much.. always talking about cheating or trying to take advantage of ppl..

i feel like i have to put a barrier on him to protect myself. he makes me so horny by the way he talks

but he also makes me feel so uneasy and not safe

it's stressing me out but also sometimes makes me happy

i kinda hope this cycle ends or he provides me with more knowns

he is a stupid guy with no money. He asked if I would forgive him for cheating I said no. Then he laughed. He said he would forgive me. 

I told him to find someone else.

He then got very very deep with other parts of this marriage. 

He is thinking if I’m worthy to be with him and also if I will believe him. 

He thinks a lot about this and about me. I think a lot about him too but I don’t think he is great guy.He asks me why do I fall in love so fast and I told him he is my type. I want him. He is so sexy and funny.He keeps calling me creepy and asks if my room is disgusting.

Then he asks me sex and i told him you didn't do anything for me why should i give u anything.. he laughs a bit and hides

there is a chance i might be with this guy as i enjoy what he has to say and he likes to hear me out too 

I dont really like him but i dont hate him.. i find him somewhat attractive.. i think we will kiss. His actions are bad. He knows it. I tried explaining why. I think he understands. 

I think he knows I want an actual relationship with him and I think we already have one. I never knew what a relationship is. But it’s communication with someone and trust. Having boundaries. 

I told him many truths about myself.We met online and so far there has been horror moments as I found out he did something illegal online. He asked to sleep in my hotel room to save money. I asked if he can show me his employer as I want to know if he can support himself and not homeless or he will mooch off of me. 

He said he will not tell me who his employer is because he doesn’t want me to stalk him or contact his employer. But he told me vaguely what he does. Regardless I looked him up and I see that he is working somewhere as there are articles of him.

What concerns me is him asking to sleep in my hotel room as I don’t want to get sexually assaulted. I have been sexually assaulted in the past when a man brought me to his place and he carried me into his room and took off all my clothes. It was shocking and I tried to stop him but he did everything except sex. I liked the guy but he crossed all my boundaries. I do not want the same experience so I told the guy I am seeing to get his own room. He eventually did but he was pretty moany about it. 

I can feel the tone in his voice he wants to sleep with me and I asked him many times is he trying to. He said no. I asked for a relationship and he told me let’s talk about that when we meet. I feel like this man is manipulative and told him don’t do that and be honest. He told me he wants lots of children. I told him I can give him that. I feel like this is a crazy sexual relationship but also pieces of it being deeper. I want to go to him. As I want a new life. But I am also concerned since he did something illegal will he pull me down with him. Or will he change? 

I think he wants to change as he wants to be with me. I never met him before maybe that is why there is room to fantasize. What if I meet him and don’t like him at all? 

His personality is kind of shitty. Very stupid and mean. 

He is all over the news as illegal. 

But I still kind of like him. Idk why. Why am I attracted to shitty guys??. 1. Job that doesn’t get me fired 
2. Health care and machinery that helps me 
3. Meeting someone far away. He asked if I think he is bad. I said no but deep down I think he is… 

He is extremely bad and will risk things 

Can’t trust him 

He ghosted me after I found out what happened to him 

This could have been so dangerous and I was pouring my heart out to him for like a month until I found out the truth 

He was gonna hide this from me forever. I am not going to msg him anymore for instant gratification. When I know long term I'll get cheated on. I thought I found a wonderful man. Until he tried to take advantage of me sexually and tried to rob me with his intentions. 

Then I found out on the news he is illegal. 

My whole world is down. 

Online dating is fucked up. 1. My first bf: cheats, cocaine, puts me down. My second biggest regret was to sleep with him
2. Second bf: cheats, cats, drugs, disrespectful. Worse personality. Disgusting
3. Crazy bf: drugs, bisexual, cheats, dangerous
4. Cheater and stinky: stinkiest guy ever, biggest regret in my life was to sleep with him 
5. Not a bf: some guy sexually assaulted me
6. Not a bf: scammer, tried to cheat, rob me, take advantage of me, not safe. I was having a great talk with a guy I met online. However, he kept telling me if I don't like him, I can let him know. I was wondering for awhile why does he keep saying that. Then I searched him up. He did something illegal and got in trouble. I asked him about it and he admit to me it was true.

I don't know if I can trust him because of what he did. And also other things.

I asked him a question yesterday and he has not answered me for two days. This never happened before. I am worried but also wondering maybe this is for the better.**Have you ever thought about this?**
  

  
In a hundred years, in **2123**, there will be none of us, not even our relatives and friends.
  

  
Strangers will live in our homes that we built with a lot of effort and failure. They will have all the stuff we have or throw it in the dumpster. Even the car, for which we spent a fortune, will be lying somewhere in a dump, Our descendants will not remember us and only a few will know who we were. Who among us knows their great-grandfather?

After death, they will remember us for a few more years, then we will be just a portrait on someone's bookshelf (if at all). A few years later our photos and actions will be forgotten. We will not live in the memories of anyone anymore. If you just stopped to think about it one day, you might understand how pointless it is to walk for more and more.
  

  
If we thought and understood that we are just a dot in the history of mankind, let alone the earth or the universe, we would certainly look at our lives and other people differently.
  

  
We always striving for more and more and no time for what really matters.... the moments and the relationships. If we thought about and spent more time HERE AND NOW, we would really enjoy life.
  

  
We would enjoy walks we never had time for. We would love a hug. We would enjoy kisses from our children. In the moments that really count, but we ran out of time. Those would certainly be the most beautiful and best moments to remember and imprinted deep within ourselves. This is how we would fill our lives with joy. And now we fill it with greed, intolerance and hate.
  

  
There is still time. Think about it.1. **Hard-work alone won’t guarantee success — some poor people work harder than all of us.**
  

2. **If you are an adult — your life situation is your responsibility. You made the choices, you face the consequences.**
  

3. **If you want love or approval from someone — you must be okay without it.**

5. **Money is hard to earn — you are desperate and miserable because you won’t have patience.**

7. **Negative people don’t have any ill intent— they are just running on autopilot.**
  

8. **Pain is necessary for growth — there is no way around pain.**. 1. **Read: Spend time every day reading books, articles, and other materials to expand your knowledge and vocabulary.**

3. **Learn something new: Challenge yourself by taking up a new skill or hobby that requires you to learn and think in different ways.**

10. **Surround yourself with positive people: Positive relationships and social support have been linked to better mental health and cognitive function.**. This is a cry for help as it only gets tougher.1. Nobody cares about you, your plans, your goals, or your little dramas. So stop pretending they do, or getting upset when they don't.
  

2. When it comes to reaching your goals, discipline is more important than motivation. If you don't have discipline, you'll never stick to anything.
  

3. You are the only person capable of changing your life; no one can do that for you. The easiest way to change yourself is to change the things you do each day.
  

4. The biggest threat to your progression in life isn't something or someone around you; it's you.
  

5. The key to a successful life lies not in what you know, but in what you do with what you know.

3. Don't force ANYTHING -relationships, conversations, meeting up with someone, etc.
4. Get up every day and find your drive then use it to propel yourself through the day.
5. Money does NOT give you true happiness; just an illusion of it.
6. Most people don't even know what true happiness feels like.
7. Don't outgrow your youth. Live it, at the right time.
8. You can sacrifice a lot for someone you really care about, but they'll still leave you.
9. Pilot your emotions most of the time. Don't let them control you unless need be.
10. Whether you believe in science, religion or nothing at all, death is NOT the end.
11. Invest in good memories whether you have money or not. You'll need them as you grow old.
12. It's all in the mind.
13. Love yourself, but don't forget to reciprocate it to others. Treat everyone with kindness even when they are mean to you. Kindness is strength not weakness.
14. Do good to others and expect nothing in return. It's not a trade.
15. Keep your heart, mind and body clean. Always avoid negative energy.
16. Drink a lot of water OFTEN.
17. Eat healthy - veggies, fruits, yams, etc.
18. Exercise often. Go for a run or hit the gym.
19. In the end, you will realize it's all meaningless. Our endless endeavors to get rich, getting worked up, wanting attention, life and the likes. As we say in our language, " Yote ni vanity."
20. Do not chase anyone who wouldn't do the same for you.
21. Just because she/he looks at you, doesn't mean they LIKE you in that way.
22. That girl/boy that dresses funny, looks funny and talks funny...that "uncool person" in school that nobody wants to hang out or be seen with, ....hate on them now, but you won't believe how good-looking they'll be in a few years.1. ﻿﻿﻿**The less you care about the opinion of others, the more powerful you become.**

2) Choose your friends wisely.
  

  
The fastest way to become better is to surround yourself with better people.
  

  
3) Expect nothing, appreciate everything.

12. **Self love matters a lot. If you love yourself then you don't need anyone else for anything. You can make yourself happy.**. 1. **Always carry a few coins in your pocket….If someone confronts you with a knife you pull the coins subtly from your pocket and drop them on the floor. The attacker will always look down to the floor upon hearing the coins drop and this will buy you a second or two to turn and run. This can also be used if someone is intent on fighting you and you know you need to land the first blow, it’s a distraction technique.**
2. **Never use an ATM while wearing headphones and if wearing a coat/hoodie, never havethe hood up, both will affect your awareness and makes you more likely to be robbed.**
3. **When entering any room, work out where every available exit and hiding place is. In the event of an emergency you will react a hell of a lot quicker if you have planned scenarios in your head, it will make you far less likely to freeze up. This was something explained to me by an ex-special forces guy I was chatting to at a conference (he was head of security). He was sat at the same table as me, one of those big round ones with 10–12 people on each. I noticed his eyes were never still and he was always glancing at each door, window etc, basically any entrance to that room. I got chatting to him after the conference and asked him about what I had observed. He said “imagine you are at a public event and an armed terrorist storms into the room and starts shooting, most people are going to freeze for the first couple of seconds and that can cost you your life, plan for it to happen and although incredibly unlikely it ever will, you’ll react instantly and it could save your life”**

**(EDIT)  Just a few points in relation to some of the comments, point 1 is more about anangry attacker intent on hurting you not just a mugging, the idea of dropping coins is tocause a distraction in order to turn and run, of course there are a lot of variables but thefew seconds it will buy you could be the difference. I’m also in the UK where it’s extremelyunlikely that the attacker would have a gun. Running away from a knife attacker isalways preferable to trying to disarm them however confident you are in your own selfdefence skills.**

**Point 2 is about awareness (as is point 3). In the UK the most common way to be robbed atan ATM is for the thief to wait until you withdraw cash then they will grab the money andrun, not stand there making demands for you to hand over the cash. You will more bemore likely to fall victim to a grab and run if your peripheral vision is blocked and youcan’t hear a would be thief behind you.**

So I struggle with building connections because I take everything very seriously, I overthink what to say and this is backpilling thing I have since birth literally, If I talk to someone better than me (Looks and some other things If it's clearly presented) and they even say the smallest diss at me I take it very seriously as I subconsciously think this person knows hes better than me, and I get insecure about my worth. but with less attractive people if i they try shit like that i either ignore it or if they piss me off i can literally make them cry. i genuinely believe i have a mental disability, i can't control this shit but when i try to it seems unnatural to me. idk where this horrible mental state came from this weird conditioning, maybe from negative self fulfilling observations. im extremely observed.. **What are the lessons people most often learn too late in life?**

Question Im the only one in my family without one and im just shook, only found out people have one 5 months ago. Im the only one in my family without one and im just shook, only found out people have one 5 months ago.In a nutshell you just live in an absolute mental peace!  
for me instagram was my business source for some few years back. I sold all of my instagram businesses having over 100k+ followers. And tbh after i sold everything and started using instagram for personal use i was addicted to it and started comparing myself to the fake instagram "having fun" stories my friends upload. And i often felt leftout and depressed like my life isn't as fun as theirs which was definitely not true but our brains believe it subconsciously. So i cut off from all of my social media also i had a very good reason of doing so, as i had a very bad breakup. TBH this thing changed my life. My friends often criticize me for not being so cool just because i dont have instagram but deep inside ik they envy me and they're struggling with this social media rabit hole too.   
Life has been absolutely peaceful now and reddit is kinda fun as i have many like minded people in communities im interested in just like this one and help each other out. Nothing time wasting atleast for me.   
If anyone is suffering from a poor mental health, i definitely recommend you to take a break from instagram and other social media and think about yourself when you're bored.   
Hope i can add up some value to you all with sharing my experience. I'm still young and learning.. i have a friend come up to me and say that this is a very materialistic hobby. For me  this simply isn't the case and thus many people in my circle say this is pointless. Having a physical copy of an art is just overwhelming for me. Would love to hear your thoughts. Please tell me about it.. My guitar's audio Jack makes a lot of noise when i just move the cable by a bit. It just doesn't make any noise when i keep the cable in a certain position. When displaced again, makes a lot of noise back. Any fixes?. Please help me out with this. Much grateful, I'm a sophomore year engineering student in mechanical engineering but I really want to go into coding and explore.The thread is probably damaged, i took it to many guitar shops and they said it cannot be fixed as the snapped part in the block won't come out. Any fixes or should i play it like that?. Please comment down. Have a blessed october people!.I am someone who - at least on paper- is considered successful even my manager told me he envy my lifestyle but I feel lost and unhappy especially after I had my 30th birthday recently.

I am a 30M working in tech with a remote job, high salary and only 4 work days a week. I was able to build enough savings that would cover my frugal life expenses for like 10 years to come. The plan was to work hard, have enough savings to hopefully support my future family.

Unfortunately, things didn't turn as planned. I tried to go on dating apps and zero matches. I go to social events and all of them are men and the women there are already in a relationship. Until I became 30 and every one of my peers have already multiple relationships meanwhile I am a "30 year old virgin" (I was fat most of twenties and was raised in an extreme religious environment that I left when I grew older)

I started to have thoughts that I am wasting my prime youth years just working extremely hard for a fictional family that may never come but I have zero idea what I want to do instead.

I have some social hobbies like board games, swimming and gym and small group of friends and a loving family.

I was thinking to go on a sabbatical especially while we are in a recession and it's hard anyway to find a new job so maybe I can take the chance now to rest and slow down or maybe this is just another escape.Hey Berliners,

I am considering to become unemployed for the next year and would like to know what are things to take care of in regards to legal status in Berlin to not screw myself in the process with things I don't know (especially pensions and citizenship)

I have permanent residency, I work as a tech employee and also have self-employment on the side.

I know I have to pay my health insurance by myself and I am most probably won't get unemployment benefits as I would quit not get fired. I am also considering to apply for citizenship at one point so I am not sure if this will screw my application or not.

Thanks for your help and hope you have a lovely day :).**Have you ever thought about this?**
  

  
In a hundred years, in **2123**, there will be none of us, not even our relatives and friends.
  

  
Strangers will live in our homes that we built with a lot of effort and failure. They will have all the stuff we have or throw it in the dumpster. Even the car, for which we spent a fortune, will be lying somewhere in a dump, Our descendants will not remember us and only a few will know who we were. Who among us knows their great-grandfather?

After death, they will remember us for a few more years, then we will be just a portrait on someone's bookshelf (if at all). A few years later our photos and actions will be forgotten. We will not live in the memories of anyone anymore. If you just stopped to think about it one day, you might understand how pointless it is to walk for more and more.
  

  
If we thought and understood that we are just a dot in the history of mankind, let alone the earth or the universe, we would certainly look at our lives and other people differently.
  

  
We always striving for more and more and no time for what really matters.... the moments and the relationships. If we thought about and spent more time HERE AND NOW, we would really enjoy life.
  

  
We would enjoy walks we never had time for. We would love a hug. We would enjoy kisses from our children. In the moments that really count, but we ran out of time. Those would certainly be the most beautiful and best moments to remember and imprinted deep within ourselves. This is how we would fill our lives with joy. And now we fill it with greed, intolerance and hate.
  

  
There is still time. Think about it.1. **Hard-work alone won’t guarantee success — some poor people work harder than all of us.**
  

2. **If you are an adult — your life situation is your responsibility. You made the choices, you face the consequences.**
  

3. **If you want love or approval from someone — you must be okay without it.**
  

4. **Your brain is evolved to keep you safe yet miserable — not happy and content.**
  

5. **Money is hard to earn — you are desperate and miserable because you won’t have patience.**
  

6. **People can be toxic even when they love you — you have to live for yourself.**
  

7. **Negative people don’t have any ill intent— they are just running on autopilot.**
  

8. **Pain is necessary for growth — there is no way around pain.**. 1. **Read: Spend time every day reading books, articles, and other materials to expand your knowledge and vocabulary.**
  

2. **Exercise: Regular physical activity helps to increase brain function and improve overall mental health.**
  

3. **Learn something new: Challenge yourself by taking up a new skill or hobby that requires you to learn and think in different ways.**
  

4. **Write: Keeping a journal or writing regularly can help you organize your thoughts and improve your writing skills.**
  

5. **Meditate: Meditation has been shown to improve focus, attention, and cognitive function.**
  

6. **Get enough sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for memory consolidation and brain function.**
  

7. **Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help improve cognitive function and overall brain health.**
  

8. **Eat a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and other nutrients can help boost brain function.**
  

9. **Challenge your brain: Engage in activities that challenge your brain, such as puzzles, riddles, and brain games.**
  

10. **Surround yourself with positive people: Positive relationships and social support have been linked to better mental health and cognitive function.**. This is a cry for help as it only gets tougher.1. Nobody cares about you, your plans, your goals, or your little dramas. So stop pretending they do, or getting upset when they don't.
  

2. When it comes to reaching your goals, discipline is more important than motivation. If you don't have discipline, you'll never stick to anything.
  

3. You are the only person capable of changing your life; no one can do that for you. The easiest way to change yourself is to change the things you do each day.
  

4. The biggest threat to your progression in life isn't something or someone around you; it's you.
  

5. The key to a successful life lies not in what you know, but in what you do with what you know.
  

6. Failure is just a stepping stone on the road to success.
  

7. You can't change the past, but you can still fuck up your future if you repeat it.
  

8. Success is not about what you accomplish, it's about who you become in the process.
  

9. Your comfort zone is a barren place. Nothing ever grows there.
  

10. Anything in life worth achieving will not be easy to get. If it were, everyone would get what they wanted. Most people give up on their goals when things become too difficult. Don’t be like most people.1. Stop posting everything on social media.
2. Most people don't love you, it's just a symbiotic relationship.
3. Don't force ANYTHING -relationships, conversations, meeting up with someone, etc.
4. Get up every day and find your drive then use it to propel yourself through the day.
5. Money does NOT give you true happiness; just an illusion of it.
6. Most people don't even know what true happiness feels like.
7. Don't outgrow your youth. Live it, at the right time.
8. You can sacrifice a lot for someone you really care about, but they'll still leave you.
9. Pilot your emotions most of the time. Don't let them control you unless need be.
10. Whether you believe in science, religion or nothing at all, death is NOT the end.
11. Invest in good memories whether you have money or not. You'll need them as you grow old.
12. It's all in the mind.
13. Love yourself, but don't forget to reciprocate it to others. Treat everyone with kindness even when they are mean to you. Kindness is strength not weakness.
14. Do good to others and expect nothing in return. It's not a trade.
15. Keep your heart, mind and body clean. Always avoid negative energy.
16. Drink a lot of water OFTEN.
17. Eat healthy - veggies, fruits, yams, etc.
18. Exercise often. Go for a run or hit the gym.
19. In the end, you will realize it's all meaningless. Our endless endeavors to get rich, getting worked up, wanting attention, life and the likes. As we say in our language, " Yote ni vanity."
20. Do not chase anyone who wouldn't do the same for you.
21. Just because she/he looks at you, doesn't mean they LIKE you in that way.
22. That girl/boy that dresses funny, looks funny and talks funny...that "uncool person" in school that nobody wants to hang out or be seen with, ....hate on them now, but you won't believe how good-looking they'll be in a few years.1. ﻿﻿﻿**The less you care about the opinion of others, the more powerful you become.**

3. **When you know what you want, have a plan to achieve it, and do the work consistently, nothing will stop you.**
  

4. ﻿﻿﻿**When you get loads of rejections, you stop fearing it. This makes you unstoppable!**
  

5. ﻿﻿﻿**Watch how people treat service workers. It'll show you their true colors.**
  

6. ﻿﻿﻿**Seeking out adversity will help us grow more than being in a comfort zone.**
  

7. ﻿﻿﻿**Knowing what you want in life gets you far more than if you didn't.**
  

8. ﻿﻿﻿**Investing in yourself isn't selfish. It's the most worthwhile thing you can do.**
  

9. ﻿﻿﻿**The power of focusing on one thing at a time will change your life.**

17. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**To be great at anything, you must be consistently good for long enough.**
  
﻿﻿﻿﻿
18. **You are what you say to yourself - change the words you use.**. 1) Stop telling people everything.
  

  
Most people do not care, and some secretly want you to fail.
  

  
2) Choose your friends wisely.
  

  
The fastest way to become better is to surround yourself with better people.
  

  
3) Expect nothing, appreciate everything.
  

  
Be grateful for the little things in your life to find inner peace.
  

  
4) Do your best and trust the process.
  

  
The harder you work, the luckier you will get.
  

  
5) Control yourself, not others.
  

  
Being able to control yourself is true power.
  

  
6) Learn to react less.1. Don't argue, take action.
  

  
2. Don't be smart in front of others.
  

  
3. Don't depend on anyone.
  

  
4. Don't tell your secrets to anyone.
  

  
5. Don't trust everyone.
  

  
6. And value time.

THANK YOU FOR READING. I wanna hear your answers.Mines minecraft prob 6k hours. 1. **Not everyone will like you for being a good person.**
2. **People will hate you just because other people likes you.**

4. **Life will only give you what you deserves.**
5. **If you are talented then also you have to work hard.**

7. **You will repeat your own mistakes many times.**
8. **There will be someone who will love you no matter what.**
9. **Relatives can be your enemies sometimes.**
10. **Age doesn't defines maturity.**
11. **Situation will force you to leave everything but that time defines you.**
12. **Self love matters a lot. If you love yourself then you don't need anyone else for anything. You can make yourself happy.**. 1. **Always carry a few coins in your pocket….If someone confronts you with a knife you pull the coins subtly from your pocket and drop them on the floor. The attacker will always look down to the floor upon hearing the coins drop and this will buy you a second or two to turn and run. This can also be used if someone is intent on fighting you and you know you need to land the first blow, it’s a distraction technique.**
2. **Never use an ATM while wearing headphones and if wearing a coat/hoodie, never havethe hood up, both will affect your awareness and makes you more likely to be robbed.**
3. **When entering any room, work out where every available exit and hiding place is. In the event of an emergency you will react a hell of a lot quicker if you have planned scenarios in your head, it will make you far less likely to freeze up. This was something explained to me by an ex-special forces guy I was chatting to at a conference (he was head of security). He was sat at the same table as me, one of those big round ones with 10–12 people on each. I noticed his eyes were never still and he was always glancing at each door, window etc, basically any entrance to that room. I got chatting to him after the conference and asked him about what I had observed. He said “imagine you are at a public event and an armed terrorist storms into the room and starts shooting, most people are going to freeze for the first couple of seconds and that can cost you your life, plan for it to happen and although incredibly unlikely it ever will, you’ll react instantly and it could save your life”**

**(EDIT)  Just a few points in relation to some of the comments, point 1 is more about anangry attacker intent on hurting you not just a mugging, the idea of dropping coins is tocause a distraction in order to turn and run, of course there are a lot of variables but thefew seconds it will buy you could be the difference. I’m also in the UK where it’s extremelyunlikely that the attacker would have a gun. Running away from a knife attacker isalways preferable to trying to disarm them however confident you are in your own selfdefence skills.**

**Point 2 is about awareness (as is point 3). In the UK the most common way to be robbed atan ATM is for the thief to wait until you withdraw cash then they will grab the money andrun, not stand there making demands for you to hand over the cash. You will more bemore likely to fall victim to a grab and run if your peripheral vision is blocked and youcan’t hear a would be thief behind you.**

Strangers will live in our homes that we built with a lot of effort and failure. They will have all the stuff we have or throw it in the dumpster. Even the car, for which we spent a fortune, will be lying somewhere in a dump, Our descendants will not remember us and only a few will know who we were. Who among us knows their great-grandfather?

After death, they will remember us for a few more years, then we will be just a portrait on someone's bookshelf (if at all). A few years later our photos and actions will be forgotten. We will not live in the memories of anyone anymore. If you just stopped to think about it one day, you might understand how pointless it is to walk for more and more.
  

  
If we thought and understood that we are just a dot in the history of mankind, let alone the earth or the universe, we would certainly look at our lives and other people differently.
  

  
We always striving for more and more and no time for what really matters.... the moments and the relationships. If we thought about and spent more time HERE AND NOW, we would really enjoy life.
  

  
We would enjoy walks we never had time for. We would love a hug. We would enjoy kisses from our children. In the moments that really count, but we ran out of time. Those would certainly be the most beautiful and best moments to remember and imprinted deep within ourselves. This is how we would fill our lives with joy. And now we fill it with greed, intolerance and hate.
  

  
There is still time. Think about it.1. **Hard-work alone won’t guarantee success — some poor people work harder than all of us.**
  

2. **If you are an adult — your life situation is your responsibility. You made the choices, you face the consequences.**
  

3. **If you want love or approval from someone — you must be okay without it.**
  

4. **Your brain is evolved to keep you safe yet miserable — not happy and content.**
  

5. **Money is hard to earn — you are desperate and miserable because you won’t have patience.**
  

6. **People can be toxic even when they love you — you have to live for yourself.**
  

7. **Negative people don’t have any ill intent— they are just running on autopilot.**
  

8. **Pain is necessary for growth — there is no way around pain.**. 1. **Read: Spend time every day reading books, articles, and other materials to expand your knowledge and vocabulary.**
  

2. **Exercise: Regular physical activity helps to increase brain function and improve overall mental health.**
  

3. **Learn something new: Challenge yourself by taking up a new skill or hobby that requires you to learn and think in different ways.**
  

4. **Write: Keeping a journal or writing regularly can help you organize your thoughts and improve your writing skills.**
  

5. **Meditate: Meditation has been shown to improve focus, attention, and cognitive function.**
  

6. **Get enough sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for memory consolidation and brain function.**
  

7. **Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help improve cognitive function and overall brain health.**
  

8. **Eat a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and other nutrients can help boost brain function.**
  

9. **Challenge your brain: Engage in activities that challenge your brain, such as puzzles, riddles, and brain games.**
  

10. **Surround yourself with positive people: Positive relationships and social support have been linked to better mental health and cognitive function.**. This is a cry for help as it only gets tougher.1. Nobody cares about you, your plans, your goals, or your little dramas. So stop pretending they do, or getting upset when they don't.
  

2. When it comes to reaching your goals, discipline is more important than motivation. If you don't have discipline, you'll never stick to anything.
  

3. You are the only person capable of changing your life; no one can do that for you. The easiest way to change yourself is to change the things you do each day.
  

4. The biggest threat to your progression in life isn't something or someone around you; it's you.
  

5. The key to a successful life lies not in what you know, but in what you do with what you know.
  

6. Failure is just a stepping stone on the road to success.
  

7. You can't change the past, but you can still fuck up your future if you repeat it.
  

8. Success is not about what you accomplish, it's about who you become in the process.
  

9. Your comfort zone is a barren place. Nothing ever grows there.

2. Most people don't love you, it's just a symbiotic relationship.
3. Don't force ANYTHING -relationships, conversations, meeting up with someone, etc.
4. Get up every day and find your drive then use it to propel yourself through the day.
5. Money does NOT give you true happiness; just an illusion of it.
6. Most people don't even know what true happiness feels like.
7. Don't outgrow your youth. Live it, at the right time.
8. You can sacrifice a lot for someone you really care about, but they'll still leave you.
9. Pilot your emotions most of the time. Don't let them control you unless need be.
10. Whether you believe in science, religion or nothing at all, death is NOT the end.
11. Invest in good memories whether you have money or not. You'll need them as you grow old.
12. It's all in the mind.
13. Love yourself, but don't forget to reciprocate it to others. Treat everyone with kindness even when they are mean to you. Kindness is strength not weakness.
14. Do good to others and expect nothing in return. It's not a trade.
15. Keep your heart, mind and body clean. Always avoid negative energy.
16. Drink a lot of water OFTEN.
17. Eat healthy - veggies, fruits, yams, etc.
18. Exercise often. Go for a run or hit the gym.
19. In the end, you will realize it's all meaningless. Our endless endeavors to get rich, getting worked up, wanting attention, life and the likes. As we say in our language, " Yote ni vanity."
20. Do not chase anyone who wouldn't do the same for you.
21. Just because she/he looks at you, doesn't mean they LIKE you in that way.
22. That girl/boy that dresses funny, looks funny and talks funny...that "uncool person" in school that nobody wants to hang out or be seen with, ....hate on them now, but you won't believe how good-looking they'll be in a few years.1. ﻿﻿﻿**The less you care about the opinion of others, the more powerful you become.**
  

2. ﻿﻿﻿**Smiling is modern-day magic. Many opportunities will come from the energy you radiate.**
  
﻿﻿﻿
3. **When you know what you want, have a plan to achieve it, and do the work consistently, nothing will stop you.**
  

4. ﻿﻿﻿**When you get loads of rejections, you stop fearing it. This makes you unstoppable!**
  

5. ﻿﻿﻿**Watch how people treat service workers. It'll show you their true colors.**
  

6. ﻿﻿﻿**Seeking out adversity will help us grow more than being in a comfort zone.**
  

7. ﻿﻿﻿**Knowing what you want in life gets you far more than if you didn't.**
  

8. ﻿﻿﻿**Investing in yourself isn't selfish. It's the most worthwhile thing you can do.**
  

9. ﻿﻿﻿**The power of focusing on one thing at a time will change your life.**
  

10. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**The sooner you stop lying to yourself, the quicker you'll be unstoppable.**
  

11. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**Less friends = deeper relationships.**
  

12. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**People who accept suffering achieve greatness. Those who avoid it go nowhere.**
  

13. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**It's not what happens, it's how you react that matters.**
  

14. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**Your life can change tomorrow, if you make the choice to change it.**
  

15. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**The more sacrifices you are willing to make, the more successful you'll become.**
  

16. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**If you believe in yourself as much as you do the people you admire, you'll be unstoppable.**
  

17. ﻿﻿﻿﻿**To be great at anything, you must be consistently good for long enough.**
  
﻿﻿﻿﻿
18. **You are what you say to yourself - change the words you use.**. 1) Stop telling people everything.
  

  
Most people do not care, and some secretly want you to fail.
  

  
2) Choose your friends wisely.
  

  
The fastest way to become better is to surround yourself with better people.
  

  
3) Expect nothing, appreciate everything.
  

  
Be grateful for the little things in your life to find inner peace.
  

  
4) Do your best and trust the process.
  

  
The harder you work, the luckier you will get.
  

  
5) Control yourself, not others.
  

  
Being able to control yourself is true power.
  

  
6) Learn to react less.1. Don't argue, take action.
  

  
2. Don't be smart in front of others.
  

  
3. Don't depend on anyone.

THANK YOU FOR READING. I wanna hear your answers.Mines minecraft prob 6k hours. 1. **Not everyone will like you for being a good person.**
2. **People will hate you just because other people likes you.**
3. **If you don't learn to say no, you will keep doing the things what people says.**
4. **Life will only give you what you deserves.**
5. **If you are talented then also you have to work hard.**
6. **No matter who you are there will always be someone who will hate you.**
7. **You will repeat your own mistakes many times.**
8. **There will be someone who will love you no matter what.**
9. **Relatives can be your enemies sometimes.**
10. **Age doesn't defines maturity.**
11. **Situation will force you to leave everything but that time defines you.**
12. **Self love matters a lot. If you love yourself then you don't need anyone else for anything. You can make yourself happy.**. 1. **Always carry a few coins in your pocket….If someone confronts you with a knife you pull the coins subtly from your pocket and drop them on the floor. The attacker will always look down to the floor upon hearing the coins drop and this will buy you a second or two to turn and run. This can also be used if someone is intent on fighting you and you know you need to land the first blow, it’s a distraction technique.**
2. **Never use an ATM while wearing headphones and if wearing a coat/hoodie, never havethe hood up, both will affect your awareness and makes you more likely to be robbed.**
3. **When entering any room, work out where every available exit and hiding place is. In the event of an emergency you will react a hell of a lot quicker if you have planned scenarios in your head, it will make you far less likely to freeze up. This was something explained to me by an ex-special forces guy I was chatting to at a conference (he was head of security). He was sat at the same table as me, one of those big round ones with 10–12 people on each. I noticed his eyes were never still and he was always glancing at each door, window etc, basically any entrance to that room. I got chatting to him after the conference and asked him about what I had observed. He said “imagine you are at a public event and an armed terrorist storms into the room and starts shooting, most people are going to freeze for the first couple of seconds and that can cost you your life, plan for it to happen and although incredibly unlikely it ever will, you’ll react instantly and it could save your life”**

**(EDIT)  Just a few points in relation to some of the comments, point 1 is more about anangry attacker intent on hurting you not just a mugging, the idea of dropping coins is tocause a distraction in order to turn and run, of course there are a lot of variables but thefew seconds it will buy you could be the difference. I’m also in the UK where it’s extremelyunlikely that the attacker would have a gun. Running away from a knife attacker isalways preferable to trying to disarm them however confident you are in your own selfdefence skills.**

**Point 2 is about awareness (as is point 3). In the UK the most common way to be robbed atan ATM is for the thief to wait until you withdraw cash then they will grab the money andrun, not stand there making demands for you to hand over the cash. You will more bemore likely to fall victim to a grab and run if your peripheral vision is blocked and youcan’t hear a would be thief behind you.**

So I struggle with building connections because I take everything very seriously, I overthink what to say and this is backpilling thing I have since birth literally, If I talk to someone better than me (Looks and some other things If it's clearly presented) and they even say the smallest diss at me I take it very seriously as I subconsciously think this person knows hes better than me, and I get insecure about my worth. but with less attractive people if i they try shit like that i either ignore it or if they piss me off i can literally make them cry. i genuinely believe i have a mental disability, i can't control this shit but when i try to it seems unnatural to me. idk where this horrible mental state came from this weird conditioning, maybe from negative self fulfilling observations. im extremely observed.. **What are the lessons people most often learn too late in life?**

Faceit does record it though because it always have had but is it not a thing in cs2?. when u think of csgo u think of russians but they are the worst teammates you can get out of any country. Question Im the only one in my family without one and im just shook, only found out people have one 5 months ago. Im the only one in my family without one and im just shook, only found out people have one 5 months ago.So, 2 weeks ago I quit my job and my mental health has gone slightly better… I’ve been going to the gym everyday, I enrolled myself in a boxing club, I’m finishing high school and I returned to my passion, learning to draw and writing comics.

I’ve never felt better in my life, honestly… but there’s a big problem tho… now I that I don’t have a job, I have no money to eat and keep nutrients and protein inside my body. I’m running out of food, probably have one week of food left in storage.

So, for you fellow handsome and beautiful people that work at home… is there any way a guy from the Caribbean Islands can work from home and make at least 50USD a week?

It doesn’t have to be like straight 50’s, it can be 10’s and even better 100’s… 

I just want to make enough to support myself and get a better mental status while I’m unemployed so I can go back to having a normal job in a exploitative corporation. 

So, any ideas? Youtube ideas only work in the US and Europe apparently.I’m struggling to find a passion, (well I have one I just can’t get it to work), and I’ve been feeling like I don’t know what to do with my life anymore, like feeling empty and I’m starting to think that maybe nothing can refill this emptiness.

So, will mindfulness and meditation help me find what I’m looking for?. I’ve been trying to quit my porn addiction and can’t get pass a month, my longest streak is 2 months, then I went back to it. 

 and I’m curious, do people notice if you are a person who consumes porn? Do porn consumers stink or something similar?. So, when I’m talking I look people in the eyes… but then what? I start to panic and don’t know what to do.

I look everywhere and my mind starts spinning, I can’t get the words out of my head, suddenly I just start mumbling and can’t get a single word right. How the hell do I fix this? I’m so sick about it.

I haven’t gone to therapy in a couple months, I have no time to go see my therapist now…. I’ve been working at this call center for almost 2 months already, and I want to quit.

It’s really easy, all I do is talk to doctors and pharmacies, but I feel so empty working in there, like there’s nothing special about it. Every time I wake up and gotta go to work my mind keeps telling me to skip that day and go the next day, then the next day my mind tells me the same. 

It’s an easy job, and the pay is kind of decent compared to other jobs, but I feel so empty and trapped working in there… I really don’t know what to do.

Should I quit and find another job? 

There’s another problem, in my country finding a job is really hard unless you’re trying to work in a  Call Center Agency, but I don’t like call centers and right now me being a CCA is not suiting me well. What should I do?. My neck and back never felt better in my life, let’s see what happens when I been there for weeks, then months.

Why would they tell me to not go to the gym?. I’m depressed(going to therapy), I need answers, please and thank you.I have a 9 to 5 job, and I have no time to sit on a computer and do stuffs to double my money myself. So, please send “proven” ways to double it while I’m at work.

If today I invest let’s say 25 or 50 dollars, I want next fortnight to be 85 or 100 dollars. I’m looking for something like that.

If there’s none, I’ll start gambling then.He estado pensando en mudarme a fuera de Santo Domingo, mucho dembow y mucha contaminación, cómo es vivir en Constanza? 

Mi mamá me dijo que hay mucho borrachon para allá, pero que es tranquilo los días de semana. 

Ya con eso último yo estoy bien, los viernes y sábados que se muera el diablo si quiere, pero déjenme dormir mis domingos y días de semana que yo si trabajo.

Pero quisiera saber, cómo es en realidad para allá?. Two weeks ago we were introducing ourselves at work and my time to introduce myself came, and i forgot my own hobbies. Then my time passed and someone else’s turn arrived.

He said he was a rapper and since I write songs I interrupted him and said “Oh, I also can write” and it looked like I wanted to regain the attention of everyone but I didn’t said it with that intend, I just wanted to let them know that I can help with their songs.

Now the problem is, it’s been 2 weeks since then and I know everyone forgot about it, except for me who remembers that event like yesterday and won’t let it go. 

How can I forget about it and keep on with my life? 

These type of things are affecting me at work and is making me feel like I’m not welcome when it’s all inside my head and only there.I apologized with a coworker for something I did and he didn’t even remember me… I knew it wasn’t a big deal but something inside me kept telling me to apologize.

How do I stop listening to that “something” and just go about my day like a normal person? I hate being weird like this. It’s the worst.I get confused and I don't know what's the correct word to use...

How do I know which of those three to use?. I still get uncomfortable when talking to people and I stay silent in social groups, so, how do I fake confidence and push myself to talk?. I still get uncomfortable when talking to people and I stay silent in social groups, so, how do I fake confidence and push myself to talk?. So, I happen to go and greet my sister’s family in law and they started asking questions like that one aunt always does. They asked me if I got a job and if not why not and I said “my mom said I can’t get a job that offers a contract” and I stud there like “WTF!” like why did I said that… I then played it off and started acting cool, but I looked like a man child and started sweating from my forehead.

I don’t care what they think about me, but why did I do that, that what I said was supposed to be part of a secret, but either way, why did i bring that up? They don’t care about my life, they just want something to talk about for the whole week, so why did I said something like that instead of just saying “ohh you know, things have been rough lately”.

How do i stop saying things I don’t have to say even if people starts to get me nervous?. So, yesterday I (24yo, Male) went to the hospital and this cute girl in the information section was trying to conversate with me, she had to change the subject 3 times because I couldn’t make up and answer for none of the things she said on time. I just stood there and answered with “oh, ok and yeah”… I couldn’t think of anything to say at the moment so I left the scene with a big smile on my face, telling her “I gotta get moving” and feeling kind of dumb.

And now, my little sister’s friend is in here and she’s also trying to establish a conversation with me, and I’m using the same responses… “ah, ok, oh, alright” like wth is going on, I can’t think of anything to say to these young ladies. When it comes to a dude I’m ok making up conversation, answering and expressing myself, but when it comes to women I stay there frozen, thinking what to say and Idk why. This is not natural. 

I used to be shy, but now i just can’t speak. Even when talking to a female cashier my tongue twists and I have to reset what i was saying because my brain and my mouth are going at different paces and my heart starts pumping hard. It’s annoying!. Estoy aplicando para teleperformance, pero mi inglés hablado es algo lento y no puedo pensar en palabras al hablar. Por favor recomienden otros call centers donde si tu inglés está algo crudo, con el tiempo pueda ir mejorando y adaptandome. 

I have learned around 3000 words English words, but when it comes to speaking it, I get stuck between words. When writing I only have to delete some words and rephrase what I wrote before but I can't do that when talking, which makes it harder for me to speak and I just stay there stuck. I guess I have the same issue with my writings too. Any idea on how to overcome this problem? Do I need to read, do I need to write? If so, please recommend me some pages to practice my writing and talking skills. Thank you.I got a GamePass ultimate subscription on my Xbox, is this gamepass subscription actually for free? I wouldn't want to pay 2 subscriptions.

En mí opinión es lo mismo que el porno, se siente rico, pero las consecuencias son peores de lo que te imaginas. Entonces, por qué?. Sean sincer@s, cuándo fue la última vez que los hicieron terminar sonriendo luego de tener relaciones?. Is it true that if you stiff yourself and clench your butt during sex you’re gonna cum faster. And if you stay relaxed during the whole section and don’t stiff nor clench you’re gonna last longer?

Also how do i remain relaxed? 
When I’m having sex, i would clench my butt for one moment, like a blink of an eye, but, sometimes it cost to relax it after I’ve started and usually clench even more… 

How do i remain relaxed? I’ve been practicing on my breathing, but i keep losing my breathing rhythm, as i were jogging.

I want to stay calm all the time, I want to have fun with my partner, I want to stop finishing so early, it’s embarrassing. Any help?.i truly miss someone who distanced from me and is not in my life anymore and missing them is painful af, i need to get over this person i fantasised about so bad and obsessed over. having a long distance break up and still obsessively thinking about them even tho they don’t have time for me and have taken the step to move on but i’m still behind on that and long for them. i really need to shut off this feeling and forget about them because it’s ruining my self esteem and mental health. i have no close friends or support network to help me get through this and all the fantasy i built up of loving this person keeps creeping back and keeping me fixed on them but i really need to let go. Me (18m) and my long distance gf (17f) have known eachother for nearly 3 years and distance had been an issue for us since a few months in, we love eachother still but the distance just not being right for us and has been distancing us for so long now and every day of it hurts because of how we don’t have the time and attention for eachother and it’s not want we want anymore even tho we really wish things went right for us, it’s painful to let go of someone when you don’t want to (she initiated the break up having it affect her emotionally first). i truly wish this is just a part in our life where we distance and after school and uni our lives are different and we have the time and love for eachother again. i know i cant sit hoping for this and have to look elsewhere for a partner because there’s so little chance of it happening. i know when we both find someone irl we will be happier and we won’t long for us again but it hurts like hell. my feelings are all over the place i feel bitter, sad, jealous, hopeful, helpless, sometimes peace but that’s only when i believe she’ll come back n then it hits me again. it’s been 3 months already and holding on has held me back. what am i meant to do to process this healthily? what should my end goal be? are you meant to always feel bitter towards an ex that left you?. i had a heartbreak recently and couldn’t deal with it very well. i still get very emotionally sensitive, dependant, and have low self esteem , are these symptoms of low test? and how can i improve my levels quickly. My ex entered my life in a lonely stage and made it amazing and then felt it and felt an unfixable void that is eating me up inside so much
i try and deal with it but i cant get rid of the negative emotions and loneliness and can’t stop missing her. undecided between AQUAEL OPTI SET 240 and AQUA ONE HORIZON 182, both these tanks come with LED lighting but will they be enough for me to set up a reef tank?. my social life ended 3 years ago as i finished highschool and i’ve just become a weak,  insecure, shell of a man that’s caused me to lose everyone ( all me friends, gf and possible people i could have met in the mean time) i really want to change but i just feel stuck and alone. i have the idea in my head of waiting till marriage but i get confused about it and feel like sex life is what i’m missing rn and will solve my unhappiness 
how can i get over this/ what should i do?. i’m so confused about things like my ex relationship, socialising, sex before marriage, getting close to people and generally myself. i don’t know how to act or feel. i want to believe in Gods timing and him making/not things in my life but when i analyse situations it always comes down to my own doings. i had a relationship with my first love that i was so heavily into and it faded out, i got clingy and attached and she distanced, i even was fighting for it while she was saying it’s not right for us until she left and i still prayed we’d end up together somehow.  Now 3 months later i still wake up thinking about her and she doesn’t leave my mind at all really. 

How can i change my attachment and have self worth as a man to stop wanting someone who doesn’t want me? it makes me insecure and like a victim because of the needy way i dealt with the break up but i want to change and be able to let go so i can move on but this attachment stops me living my life and has me hoping and thinking off her while she’s happy somewhere living her life. i still want her and want to stop 
any advice?. watching porn is soo enticing and comforting, makes us feel great in the moment and reaches our lustful desires which is what makes it so hard to stop, but you trade your mental health, you go into relationships for lust and then breakups make you question your sex appeal and not make peace with it, you see every woman for her sex appeal and anything she does hurts you because you see it as a blow to your value, this is what acting with lust does. it feels good but all it brings is pain. instead focus on self love to a point that brings you peace and full security in yourself and then get to know a girl for who she is and what her values are like and respecting her sexual value until you are committed together in love. firstly is RO and RO/DI the same thing or is RO only half of it? secondly i want to add a reverse osmosis filter to my kitchen tap for better drinking water, can i get any ro filter and it be fine to add to my tank too? and lastly since i’ll be using a remineralisation process after the RO for my drinking water will this be fine for my reef water or do i need to use the water without remineralisation?. firstly is RO and RO/DI the same thing or is RO only half of it? secondly i want to add a reverse osmosis filter to my kitchen tap for better drinking water, can i get any ro filter and it be fine to add to my tank too? and lastly since i’ll be using a remineralisation process after the RO for my drinking water will this be fine for my reef water or do i need to use the water without remineralisation?. want to have a 120cm reef tank as a display for my living room, how can i make it look amazing and also really easy to maintain and take care of? looking for any advice or product recommendations. i got broken up with by my first love which tore me down a lot and i see a lot of people that have their relationship break down and their wife leave them and i’m fearful to ever put myself in a position to go through that again or worse. lots of posts complaining about them being worthless to others and that they are lonely and never had a relationship, depressed and can’t see a way out. Don’t you owe it to yourself to develop your personality, develop your social skills and give yourself these experiences you dream of? every single person can work a way to this you’re so desperate for so go and do it.there’s a lot of tips i feel stuck on something about where i am in life or a particular problem that i want to vent and ask online for help, generally this doesn’t get me anywhere and only makes me feel that negativity more. my advice is don’t to go other people for everything this will cause you to have less confidence in your own capability and decisions if it’s just a vent override your mind and put a position view on your situation and stick with it (this requires practice), if you need an answer or advice always go to yourself first have a real big think and it’s very likely you know what you need to do you’re just procrastinating, figure it out on your own and you will get the best rewards of lessons and self reliance and confidence. popular trend online thinking it’s cool to be lone wolf and cut everyone off, it’s not, it’s shit advice. you need social connection as a human and it will catch up to you as depression, yes cut off bad influences and fake friends but don’t go solo and find new people don’t be antisocial.Here's what I'd do in no particular order but the most important ones are up top.   


1. **Saying No** \- Making no a default as opposed to yes, this more so in later 20s. Its controversial because people say 'your 20s is about saying yes to everything' and I did that quite a bit, but its probably better to say "your 20s is about saying yes to some things and no to everything else" because yes opens up life but no defines it. Anything I'd have to actually think about I'd say no to, probably didn't want to do it bad enough anyway.
2. **Quitting** \- Quit fast. Unsatisfactory jobs, Unsatisfactory relationships. This is a muscle. I still struggle with this because my whole identity is pretty much built around "I go at things until I get what I want", but even now, with this frame of mind, I struggle to do it. It's just my brain wiring, but if it isn't your brain wiring, and you are able to quit something that's highly unsatisfactory but don't do it because of societal  / familial expectations, I'd just quit so you can create space to actually do the things you want.
3. **Proactive Communication** \- This is probably the best skill you can learn to navigate society. Understand your emotions, intentions, wants, desires, learn to articulate it and make proactively communicating what you want a habit. The people that are bad at this, live reactionary lives. It's quite sad, I developed this much later in my 20s, about 28 but it literally boosted every aspect of my life since I started it. It allows me to build the relationships I WANT. Build meaning, people treat you the way you allow yourself to be treated, in business, romance, friendships. Get things clear and people can help you grow and be a support line for you rather than objects in space you react to.
4. **Keeping a Schedule** \- Building a schedule is basically the same as drawing a map for your life on a micro scale. 
5. **Journaling** \- As a HABIT, this actually teaches you about yourself and your emotions and clarifies your thinking A LOT. It overall makes you a much better communicator overall, your ideas, likes, dislikes and desires. I picked this one up in maybe my mid 20s , still do it at least once a week, keeps me sane and most importantly HELPS ME MEET MY DEEP NEEDS FOR MYSELF so anxiety doesn't destroy my relationships or make me make stupid decisions.
6. **Maintaining financial awareness** \- I learned about financial rules and principles around 29, which kind of sucks, but I've gone so deep into it, I have peace now. I look at my friends that are still trapped in the mindset of 'things will work itself out', despite hitting their 30s, and even for those that have 'enough' they're not actively trying to learn or get better at financial literacy. Its a sad truth that the phrase 'suffocating with money problems' is commonplace by the time you're 30 - 40. A lot of it is just building a fund for emergencies, paying off debt, and living on less than you make, but I'd try to read and get deeper each year as a habit.
7. **Defaulting to Experts** \- Easily explained, but the converse is actually the issue. Listening to people that AREN'T doing the thing you want to do does more harm that not listening to them in most cases. Its a step back. I'd just ask for proof of concept from anyone giving advice if it isn't blatantly obvious they've already accomplished what I'm looking for, anyone else I'd politely nod and see if anything they said fits into some way I can challenge the confirmed information I already have.
8. **Leaving before the party ends** \- In every way, the bar, the club, the relationship, the job, the date, the conversation. I'd just make a habit to leave not necessarily on a high, but just the moment I'm bored and trying to create something out of nothing. Especially with conversations and dating. If the person isn't making an effort, despite however attractive they are, or however successful they are, boring personality or not, its now unacceptable to me to carry an entire conversation with a WHOLE ADULT that's giving NOTHING back.
9. **Quality Sleep** \- The energy I have in my 30s after quality sleep is phenomenal, now I dream about what it would've been like if i actually tried to optimize my sleep in my 20s lmao.
10. **Skin Care** \- After 30 and kids come into the equation, you start to see the real effects of lifestyle over 10 years on people. I didn't put exercise on the list because I've maintained that habit since teenage years until now, and I always ate pretty healthy, but I didn't intentionally care for my skin, which was fantastic until about 1 year ago. It no longer can handle popping zits without leaving scars, where as before it was easy to just pop and it'd heal smoothly. Now I invest a significant amount into my skincare because looking good is a huge part of feeling good for myself personally.  


Let me know if any of this resonates! 

&#x200B;. Tell me if this sounds familiar.

You got some big plans that you're really excited about and you really want it to work out this time, you've assumed that the reason things didn't work out last time was because of not using your time correctly, so you go online and search "how to be better at time management". Techniques like deep work, Time blocking and the trident method, pop up and you feel a burst of enthusiasm.

You get out your pen and calendar, start writing out your priorities and beautifully color code your google calendar, so you know the activity, the date, time and color of every step of your master plan. You get a slight feeling of accomplishment and hopefulness, thinking to yourself that with this plan in place you can't fail.

Day 1, 2 and 3 go by smoothly, you're hitting every task on your calendar, crushing it out of the park and you have this momentum for about a week, but then it starts crumbling, you struggled to finish a task on time and now your schedule starts looking crazy, or maybe you can get to the desk but can't get yourself to do the work.. You maybe slog through a couple of days like that, taking your small wins before you make it to the dreaded day you knew was coming. You suddenly start ignoring the calendar all together, you wake up and don't feel it for 2 or 3 days in a row, and your goals begin slipping away.

That thing in you that drives you to have big dreams, now turns on you, and its saying things like "you're not good enough, you're not disciplined enough" and now you're back into the cycle, of trying to figure out how to not screw it up the next time.

Does this sound like a time management problem to you? Honestly?  
It doesn't seem like time is the issue to me. 

Having lived in this demotivating loop from hell for essentially all my life from university student to freelancer to building a life abroad to building a youtube channel. There's always 'something' that occurs, and the irony is that phrases like "time management" made me feel quite inadequate when I heard phrases like "everyone has 24 hours in a day" and see elon musk launching satellitles in that same time period I've eaten 2 burritos.  


The gamechanger for me was getting hyper specific. The issue I was facing didn't really have much to do with time, but rather with 2 key players, Attention and Energy levels.  


Here's why it doesn't have to do with time. 2 hours sitting infront of a book NOT reading, does LESS for you than 5 minutes in front of a book and reading, which does LESS for you than 2 minutes reading and 3 minutes PRACTICING what you just read!

&#x200B;

This is obviously a hyperbolized example, but you get what I'm saying regarding attention management vs. time management. Now before I get to the second important aspect that makes up what regular people like us are searching for when we search "Time Management" , I want to expand on Attention Management a bit.  


Attention Management much like "Time Management" isn't viewed as one overarching thing, but rather as small chunks. For example, you plan your YEAR in Daily / Weekly / Hourly Chunks and add them up collectively into a year.   


This is how you should Divide your TIME when you're managing your ATTENTION. Meaning that the time is only as important as the TASK making the TASK the important thing to execute.   


What does this look like? If there's 10 things to do, ideally you spend 10 minutes thinking about what's most important / moves you in the direction you want the fastest" then you do that 1 first, and the second one second etc. This way you're taking huge strides as opposed to minor steps having your attention just on any task.  


This is getting long so I'll shorten the next part.  


ENERGY MANAGEMENT

\- The ability to self monitor, find the things that drain your energy and make it difficult to manage your attention, and the things that do the opposite, give you energy and inspires your attention, and spread them throughout your day in a way that would allow you to consistently maintain high enough energy, to deliberately do the things you want to, rather than drifting away.   


Simple ways to do this :   


Keep a notepad / your smartphone around when you're doing your usual daily tasks, like exercising, walking around, washing dishes etc...

&#x200B;

Based on what builds energy vs. takes away energy, swap out so that you do what drains your energy last or whenever is good for you. I like to do it last so I can take my time, allow myself to be distracted while doing it and see it as the start of the end of my day.  


Alternatively, place the things that GIVE energy, at a time when you're NOT high energy, so you'll be able to move up the energy spectrum and be able to focus on the things you want to do for a bit longer.  


Out of time now but I'd LOVE your feedback! All the best!. “Disappear for a year and see what happens” has to be one of the most misguided and chaotic ideas that have been spread in the self improvement space man. I watch these youtubers, who are sincerely trying to do good, like Iman Ghadzi, say things like this and "your passion doesn't pay, you should do ...." and I wonder to myself why are they selling an incomplete dream to people that often are vulnerable and feel incomplete?   


I'm not saying that its BAD advice, it has merits. Focusing with intent for long periods can produce extraordinary results, thats how these guys earned the right to their platforms to begin with. And pursuing your passion is an overly cooked phrase that has lost all meaning in modern times but I felt compelled to share this after watching an Iman Video where he talked about principles to "get rich" and a part of me felt really sad for the millions of people that are going to attempt, fail, and feel even more incomplete because they didn't understand this...  


"The phrase disappear for a year or 2 and work on yourself is" made to inspire a feeling, to inspire an action or a level of relatability but what this is missing is the very thing that helped them succeed so well, "Cultivating the ABILITY to think".   


Its not about pounding away mindlessly at something from the same perspective for years, its about expanding your brains ability to dissect information on multiple levels.   


Levels that are - Socratic questioning, Critical thinking and Strategic thinking.   


A person incapable of critical thinking  has almost no shot at being a good strategic thinker, because they haven't figured out the type of questions to even begin asking....  


Questions like "If I do A, then what are all the problems that may come up from the result of A? What about B C D E and F. How would I respond to each potential problem in a manner that doesn't affect the outcome / overall mission?" And now its spun off from A to the entire alphabet, as each has its own unique challenges in learning to move the pieces around the board and sorting that information.   


So many people unfortunately read the books, do the hard work at the gym, but don't do the Socratic questioning either. Addressing the external DOES NOT HELP YOUR INTERNAL STATE. Then what happens?   


You've achieved outward 'approval' but because the internal approval wasn't worked on, now you're still repeating the same circumstances, just from a place of "BUT I TRIEDDDDD" and that has knocked down MANY potentially great people, back into the dark realm of despair. 

At the core of everything, we're chasing some FEELING and I just feel sad and a bit angry that this isn't ever addressed. I feel sad to know that someone is going to sacrifice extremely important formative years in their late teens and early twenties, to staying indoors, missing out on social development and not even know that it isn't actually about just "putting in the work", its about the work, working on you, which is a lifelong endeavor, that allows people to speed up that process with a bit of luck and a bit of strategy + critical thinking + socratic questioning.

\*\*This is a thought piece and I want critique please\*\*. This is a continuation to part 1 : Here - [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/160nbdw/advice_the_shortest_distance_between_you_and_good/)  


So I left off on point 6 of the things that cause us to struggle with Habit Formation , here's the next 2 and the resolutions I've found for them.   


7. **Being Around Reminders Of The Habit You're Trying To Break** \- Have you ever moved away from a group of people, become someone different, but when you return to see them again, they're treating you like the 'Old' you? Its my experience that being in certain places causes us to experience 'familiar stimulants' that then reverts us.  

This is something that I think applies to the rooms we're in, the people we talk to, the places we visit and so many other things, these memories trigger and catapult us back into bad habits. This is because of that effort and sacrifice we spoke about earlier I believe. It takes EFFORT to exert yourself as a NEW PERSON in an OLD SPACE and because habit change is something that inherently requires effort, this is just multiple layers onto yourself. Its probably easier to never eat McDonalds again, if you never set foot into McDonalds. Or easier to not play videogames, if you just don't have a console in your house.   


8. - **Not Having a Maintenance Perspective** \- New habits are only habits as long as you continue to do them. For some reason I don't think we really grasp this when going onto the journey. I think we mostly see the 'result' and ignore that "the process is the result".  When I approached meditation, after finally getting it into a really comfortable space in my life, one day it just wasn't any more. I was able to do it everyday for a year, but it fell off, for the main reason that most things in life fall off. I've come to find that almost everything is about process, and result is a symptom of process.   


\*Here's a brain jump I made and hope you'll relate / challenge it - "Decaying into disorder is the natural process of the world of matter. Anything left unmaintained will essentially rot, become dilapidated, die, or grow to create chaos and imbalance in a system it exists in. Because of this Maintaining is the only way to create 'order' or lets call it 'controlled positive sustainability'.   


After enough failures going through the process from lawless party boy to stable human, these are the things that solved these issues for me. For NEW READERS (I'll put problem and solution next to each other so its easy)  


1. **The ability to opt out - Solution I've used (2 fold)** \- Make it incredibly easy to say yes to doing the habit and also making it incredibly difficult to revert to old habits. This can look like many things, environment design comes to mind, but it can also be about the digital environment design and consistently thinking of ways that I can make not doing the habit painful, like telling friends and family that I'm engaging in this and having my 'integrity' on the line. We move away from pain with more energy than we move toward pleasure. 

2. **Losing Momentum** \- **Solution** : Track it everday and place it in a position that I cannot- NOT see it. My personality and a lot of others is not to look in the closet if there's a monster, so if I had it in a notebook and things aren't going so well, I'd misplace that notebook somehow, for myself unfortunately, my mind chose violence everyday, so I'd have to have it clearly stuck on a wall in my room.  


3. **Not Paying Attention to Patterns -** The tracking above helped me with this substantially, and in my case I did a once weekly overall review. Nothing in depth, just asking myself how I felt about it, am I enjoying it and if I did fall off, what happened. What I found by doing this was patterns of behavior I could look into. In my case, once it had 2 weeks where I did the bare minimum, or had continuous skipped days, it was at that point it would either be all over, or an opportunity to do a 'FRESH START' so I could give it another shot with the prebuilt momentum. Everyone's patterns are different of course.  


4. **Bad Foundational Habits** \- Fix these as SOON as you get some positive momentum. They're a cycle that feed into each other unfortunately. In my case it was to fix my sleep as soon as I felt momentum.  


5. **Setting the bar too high - Solution -** Make the thing you're tracking the simplest thing possible, something you could do if you're 1 notch above 'I feel sick'. When I was learning video editing, I literally made the bar ' Open the progam ' . It had days on end when I just did this, and managed to get that identity shift.  


6. **Always needing a 'Fresh Start' - Solution :** Make a fresh start extremely easy by purchasing / creating your own blank calendar. A piece of bristol / card board and a marker.   


7. **Being around reminders - Solution :** Keep distance from old environments and if thats not possible, assume control of the environment by asserting yourself first. For example, going into McDonalds with friends, before I enter I'd let them know I'm not eating anything from here so I'll just wait outside. At home with people that try to revert you to the old you, this one is messy, so its best to avoid if possible, but if not, asserting your new identity (in a non-douchey way) is a good way to do that. I don't have the time to break down how one could verbally do this, but its about being kind, saying things like "talking about the future rather than the past when you're around these people", detaching your overall current, better version of yourself, from the past version of yourself, by speaking about that past version as a separate person, and most well adjusted people will understand that you've grown automatically from the words you use.  


8. **Not Having A Maintenance Perspective - Solution :** I approach it in 2 ways, Path 1 is I pick a time period, so I'm spending the next 6 months developing a journaling habit. Naturally it falls into I really love this or I don't after that time period. Maintenance then came automatic. Path 2 is viewing a habit as a lifestyle, not something I'm doing to achieve a new habit.    
I hope this was coherent people, I rushed this one a bit. But I hope this was of value in some way and I'd love to hear your thoughts and please challenge these or share anything you think could help me or anyone else !!   


Love and prosperity for today yall!. I've been doing my best not to be a scumrat for years, just spent an obnoxious amount of time in my younger days partying, doing drugs, chasing women, NOT doing anything to progress my life..all the way through University and onward into international travel.   


I went through a period of deep isolation living abroad and that painted a picture of the type of life I was living back to myself and I didn't like it so I started working at forming good habits for about 8 years now and things are much better. Became a freelancer, got my body and health in shape, in a MUCH better financial position, so I want to share the habit glow up from scumrat to stable human.  


First thing I had to look into was the things that made me struggle with habit formation to begin with :   


1. **The ability to Opt out** \- For the most part its almost impossible to make anything that you CAN'T opt out from, its built into life, but the **ease** of the ability to opt out is a huge part of making habit change difficult. This is what that looks like, you're building a gym routine, but you don't have enough gym wear to last the amount of days you'd like to go for that week, so what do you do? Most normal people just won't go that day, or the rest of that week. Especially if it isn't near to laundry day. This applied to almost every habit I tried to form, like journalling (woops don't know where the pen is, it'll take too much time), Drinking more water (Oh no, I don't have a filter and I don't want to drink out of the tap) and so on.   

2. **Losing Momentum for more than 2 days** \- Once I was able to get a habit on track, say for a solid 2 weeks or a month in to it, I noticed that the difficulty to get back in once I missed a day grew exponentially. I think we unknowingly assume that starting back at anytime is fine, a day is a day. But I don't think thats true. Starting back after missing 1 day is MUCH easier than starting back after missing 2 and that's much easier than starting back after 3. I think if you miss a week its basically like starting over for most people. This is another silent killer because life does get in the way.   

3. **Not paying attention to patterns** \- When I was building a consistent Morning workout routine, it was hard because it was before work, I'd always get about 2 months in then fall off and try again about a month or so later. Then again hit that 2 month mark. I started monitoring what I was doing and saw that not only with that morning workout, but journalling, meditating, anything that I tried that made it beyond that 3 month mark was basically LOCKED IN. I was going to do it for life. I think this is a really useful thing to do, because it worked on multiple levels. Seeing the problem and also seeing the solution.  

4. **Bad Foundational Habits** \-Things like drinking alcohol every weekend, sleeping poorly, not eating healthy. These were especially true for the gym, but it applied to most habits. Hungover its hard to think clearly enough to journal in any meaningful way, or to focus. These are the ones that should be taken care of as soon as some momentum get building in my opinion.  

5. **Setting the bar to high** \- Perfectionism is the plague of people like us. It has to be done right. I'll start the gym routine and go for 1 hour a day 5 days a week. Its basically motivation suicide. We underestimate just how busy life gets, how challenging things can be, we mistake effort and sacrifice for the same thing and assume its just 1 bit of will power we're going to use. Everything has effort AND sacrifice tied in, and they work TOGETHER. So the willpower is really fighting 2 things at once.   

6. **Waiting for a 'Fresh Start'** \- this one actually upsets me quite a bit. I did this all the time, I'll get back into it at the start of next month. Then as next month rolls around, and life inevitably happens, get busier, get sick or something like that, the date gets pushed back, then distraction sets in and I decide I'm going to do something else completely. Its as if there's any difference between the start of the month being Tuesday March 1st, and Tuesday February 24th other than the date on the calendar and the mental shift. Making your own habit board is how I solved this. I just wipe the board clean, then start and I have the fresh start BOOM.  


\*I ran out of time for my writing today, so I'll finish this during my time tomorrow with the resolutions and last 2 things that I struggled with.   


I'd love any input, as well as your thoughts on things that helped you get to Good habits or at least GET AWAY from the bad ones!   


Peace and love people, have a prosperous day!. I love you man. Thank you for all you've done for us. I hope you read this and feel the love and appreciation vibrate through the device. 

You're a blessing. I hope to see one of your lecture live one day.What I think makes getting into a growth mindset challenging is the muk around modern life. The daily grind of waking up, going to work, either working so hard you're exhausted at the end of the day, or doing something so repetitive that your mind shuts off and its in a state of 'low power' then coming home exhausted or brain dead, taking a dopamine hit to unwind and finishing with just enough time to grab a bath and hit the bed so you can run on the cycle again the next day.   


I live in a high stress country - Japan to be specific, where people work until they die (literally). And work isn't a bad thing, its a beautiful thing, but finding the space to be joyous is a responsibility that I don't think people really assume for themself.  


The 7 things that really changed my life and got me into a state of intentional growth were the following :   


1. Doing something for myself at the start of the day - I do light exercise and yoga for about 30 minutes at the start of the day, it sets the foundation that "I'm living my life in my best interest, everyday" into my mind. Allows me to feel in control of the day and get empowered to do more things to take care of myself, and over years establishes that my life is mine to direct, not to be guided.  

2. Monitoring and Challenging Negative thoughts - Looking out for when I'm criticizing myself for being "lazy, incapable, and overall just not enough. Shedding light on this was the single greatest thing for my happiness as it creates a gap between the negative thought and the negative feeling. It gave me control of the narrative in my own mind, just to ask "who's voice is this? Where is this coming from"  

3. Noticing my Energy Levels Per Activity - Some activities are so draining, that it makes being intentional extremely difficult, but some are very energizing. And just becoming aware of these, then moving things around so that the draining things are followed directly by the energizing things, it helped me to ACT with intention throughout the day.  

4. Keeping a Clean and Minimal Environment - Making sure the spaces I'm in are not distracting and taking up un-necessary resources from my brain is a life hack to taking action. Something about being in an orderly environment clears chaos out of my mind, or at least allows me to feel the need to order inside as well. The external affects the internal, very much the same way the internal is a reflection of the external.  

5. "Forcing Happiness into my life" - I have a daily routine of asking myself "on a scale of 1 - 10, how happy are you, and you can't use 5 or 6". Its the fastest way to readjust myself to a positive state. It isn't a magic bullet, because problems are real things, but its the fastest perspective shift I've found in going from "I'm feeling like crap, life is horrible..." to "I'm a 7/10, I'm alive, I have all my limbs, I didn't get hit by a bus today" and that slowly ramps gratitude into my life.  

6. Saying 'No' to say 'Yes' - Reframing the center of my world from "serving", to "being able to serve".  The idea that you should place your own oxygen mask on first comes to mind. The pull of solving others problems at the expense of my own time really invalued my own time. I remember being "bored and confused" about what to do on a Saturday Night when I didn't have plans, because the Yes' determined if I'd be of use or not. Now that problem doesn't exist, after enough nos, the path to yes' are almost automatic. By definition, moving away from what you think is bad is moving you in a less bad direction, so anything you do during that time is at the least, neutral to your ideal living circumstance.   

7. Choosing words carefully - Respecting that everything has a specific meaning, and treating it in that way, allowed me to get closer to the truth. Trying to find the perfect word to describe the thing we're talking about, requires a connection to your true feeling to emphasize the difference between "Phenomenal time | Good Time | Tired | Fatigued". This is especially valuable with emotions I've found, and that personal connection is a beacon to satisfying self.  


I'd love to hear your thoughts on these! To me it feels just a bit self involved, but useful.. I've spent the last couple of years like a lot of you here, Spending time and money on self help books, learning the thinking frameworks, and basically dumping my old brain out and installing a new one in hoping to change the guy in the mirror.   


Its such a long journey, but coming out of the 'obsessive phase' we all inevitably end up in, I look back and I see that the most influential part to me was the "woo woo est" of them all....the mindsets. Honestly I didn't like that phrase at all and saw it as cheesy marketing until I understood that its just how our values affect our thoughts.   


And that they're important because our thoughts is what leads to our actions, and our actions is where meaningful change came from.   


During this past year, I've gone through one of the roughest of my life, and I came out with 3 I'd love to share with you.

1.  Radical Responsibility - Everything is my fault and therefore my obligation to change. There's traffic, my fault, I should have left earlier. GF left me, my fault, should have picked better / acted differently. (simple enough)  
2. Radical Empathy - If I were them, lived their life, and had their thoughts, I'd do the exact same thing that they did / I'd want the exact same things they want. Or reverse that ... If I were them, and lived the life that they had, what thoughts would I have? What things would I want? (then deliver on that)  
3. Radical Reflection  - Spend dedicated time every weekend to sit and actively reflect on what was done, what could be improved? What was good? like an athlete reviewing game tape. Its INTENTIONAL and DIRECTED toward a key thing you'd like to excel at.   


Let me know anything that worked for you these past months / year!. Hi there, I'm an ALT looking to make a move to Osaka, I only saw posts from before the Yen Value tanked and costs increased (substantially for someone on an ALT salary).  
I also anticipate costs continuing to rise into next year, but I do expect the salary to stagnate, so I'm wondering what does it cost you to live in Osaka in 2023? - Ideally for a single person.  
ESID but I'm just looking to average so I can at least estimate if its a feasible option or not.  
Assuming going out to eat once a week ( I cook at home for health reasons)  
Thank you in advance!. Hi there, I'm an ALT looking to make a move to Osaka, I only saw posts from before the Yen Value tanked and costs increased (substantially for someone on an ALT salary).

Assuming going out to eat once a week ( I cook at home for health reasons)

Thank you in advance!. I keep falling out of momentum when I have a big problem or a really off day 1 that somehow rolls over to day 2 and I struggle with this a LOT!

How long is the most consistent you've been able to maintain what you consider a productive day (if you say what that is also I'd really appreciate it)

And what strategies have you used?. How many people do you know that recently said "I want to just give everything up and go live in a cabin in the woods?" ----- I KNOW A LOT  


I've always felt pressure my entire life, teenage pressure to wear the right things, date the right people, to 20s pressure to travel the world, get into a career quickly and now 30's pressure to have a great career, lots of money, a spouse, a child, a mortgage and this has been a source of so much anxiety for me for basically every bit of my life. 

Prying family members asking "when will you ...." is basically the bane of my existence at this point, but its not their fault, they also no doubt have felt this pressure their entire life. And with them as the ones guiding us, this is just the anxious, guiding the anxious, the paths presented to us all predetermined by society to be "reasonable."   


"Obvious things" like getting a house, or progressing in a career, these are just "obvious" right? What if we could just choose to not have any of it and actually just move into a cabin in the woods in our teenage years?    


I have a family member that was a corporate lawyer that literally just chose homelessness in the 80s. He just said, NOPE to all of it, got rid of everything and began begging. I Think he's a genius and won the game (if there is a game).  


Now I fully understand that choosing to be homeless is like slapping society in the face and peer pressure drives society forward, but isn't it possible to thrive together, grow together as a society, without everyone being confined to the same herded mentality?   


How were you able to begin living intentionally? I'm so interested to hear your stories!. Hey Guys, I'm trying to fuse the drills of great athletes with writing. I'd love to start writing daily and submit to be critiqued, but I'm not sure if I can do that here or if it will be spam. Is anyone open to something like this Idea or can recommend a space to join?. I lurk here all the time but it's my first time posting! 

I'm on an Instructor visa and began doing YouTube here. It's finally picking up some momentum and I'm trying to get monetized and start accepting sponsors but it appears that "Permission to engage in other activities" for part time YouTubers is unprecedented according to the lawyer I spoke with. 

Does anyone have any experience with this or anyone they could direct me to?

Thank you in advance!. Hey Guys,  


I'm considering quitting my job as an ALT to get more access to time. I'm optimizing for personal, usable time specifically (example, I cannot use a headset at school, I cannot edit videos at school, or have online business meetings etc...)   


Because of this I'm considering moving to Peppy Kids club and would realistically like to know what the 'non-working' times value is. For example....  


If you have a 2 hour train ride each way, that's 4 usable hours in my eyes as I can use a headset and my laptop to edit videos or work on personal things. But does the Class prep that you'll have to show up 2 hours in advance for actually take up that much time? That then changes 5.5 hours to 7.5 hours and once you include walking around time to get to the station and get to the school it equals out back to 8 hours of non-free time I have as an ALT. I may have miscalculated something here as well, but I'd love any assistance about what the work week looks like (i'm aware it looks different week by week) as you can have to go far etc, but is it possible to know the amount of actual class room hours you have at PEPPY and should I add 2 hours to that knowing that its all in PREP time?. When I use the f11 key to replace a clip on my timeline with one from the media pool it no longer maintains the length of the clip its replacing and instead adds the full length of the clip from my media pool. I've recently changed from a windows laptop to a Mac and I'm not sure if I'm failing to do something or if its an error with the m1 version of davinci resolve.

Does anyone have any advice?  


Davinci Resolve Free version

I've recently changed from a windows laptop to a Mac and I'm not sure if I'm failing to do something or if its an error with the m1 version of davinci resolve.   


Does anyone have any advice?.I used to be worrying a lot. Worry about whether or not I'll make it. But in front of my partner, I was always "yeah we're going to make it man", it's definitely going to happen but at the back... Shit man, are we going to make it?

It took me a long time before I discovered the power of voice journaling. I know it sounds stupid. Who the hell wants to talk to themselves weirdo. I had the same thoughts as you. When I tried it out myself, I didn't *just* kill my anxiety (most of the time), I also managed to fall asleep faster.

This is honestly probably the fastest way to accept something that happened or may or may not happen. I hear they always talk about you have to learn to accept it. But how? How the hell do you accept something, you know you have to but how the hell!?

If you're anxious about a kidney transplant, whether or not you're going to be successful, whether or not you're going to make it... You probably won't make it. I say that not to be discouraging but because I really don't know. Nor do you.

You don't have to be passive about it either. You know you'll make it but u can't predict whether or not it's 100%, all u can do now is to just grind N know u done your very best. Voice journaling may help you accept that.

**Tip**: If voice journaling doesn't help, u may want to look for a community whom u feel connected with everyone in there. It's hard to find one these days, if u can't, create your own 1 like what I did.

**Edit**: Just to note though, the kidney transplant is not an analogy lol, I got it from a member from my community. She literally told me she was going to give her kidney away to her *ex-husband.* N I'm like woah... N she posted a question in the discord asking help to manage her anxiety.

N that's when I was like huh, maybe this might help her? N her reply was:

"So far so good! I feel a lot less troubled!
 Thank you for the really good advice!"

Definitely warmed my heart to see that. Such a small suggestion but such a big impact...**The Habit Loop**. This small principle dictates why you're not able to stick with meditating. Why you're not able to go to the gym and pump the iron. It also dictates why you're not able to stop playing games, watching porn (To a certain extent of course.)

* **Cue** (The indicator of a reward)
* **Craving** (The wanting of a reward)
* **Response** (The moving to get the reward)
* **Reward** (The reward itself)

Read an article about the habit loop, understand it. It will change your life. It goes something like this, when I wanted to stop using \[insert ur addiction\] as a stress release, I had to slowly reprogram my brain. I had to ask what was the cue, which in our example is stress. N the craving is to release stress. Then the response is to get the reward of releasing stress through \[whatever addiction\]

Then you change it. Instead of doing what u want to do, pre-plan exactly what you would do when you become stressed, in my case, it was put on headphones N listen to my fav music, at first ur brain will ask you wth r u doing, u should be doing \[Addiction\] N when u actually released stress, u have started to have ur brain understand... Oh... So listening to music releases stress...

*In summary to make something a habit, just ask yourself*:

**How do I make it obvious?** 

**How do I make it attractive?** 

**How do I make it easy?** 

**How do I make it satisfying?**

You do NOT need to satisfy all criteria, but the more the better of course, this takes time to learn how to be fast at building habits instantly for example, I found out I keep forgetting about my pillow when I go down to meditate, so I just placed the pillow in front of my door - easy. I will never forget it anymore.

Or maybe apples, just put them outside so you will actually eat it since it's right there and perhaps eat it after brushing your teeth, it makes it more satisfying imo.

**Note**: I wrote this post because a member of my community told me he also red about Atomic Habits and it changed his life. N that's what inspired me to write about this post. N even on Reddit, I hear many people say it changed their lives.It always took me 1 to 3 to 4 hours for me to fall asleep each night. Not anymore.

1. **Externalize your thoughts** (I have to say Journaling didn't help me at all, writing on hand just didn't work for me... Even if I did it for an hour... So I just started talking to a recorder... For maybe an hour and when my head hit the pillow, my head felt like an empty bin... No thoughts whatsover)
2. **Relax after your externalize** (There was another problem, I still couldn't fall asleep because after no thinking for 5 mins, I will still be too tense to fall asleep - thus making me be awake from overthinking again... Either Progressive Muscle Relaxation or Meditate before you sleep ATLEAST 10 mins... There's no other way - no cute answers here sorry.)
3. **Relax your fears** (Idk about you but... I feel unsafe in a black out room... That's y I leave some soft background calming piano music to allow me to feel safe and not tense as if there's something else in the room... Not too loud otherwise it will keep you awake)
4. **Don't allow your body to wake you up** (Don't drink any form of liquid before your sleep for at least 2h... You save yourself from having to wake up because you need to pee.)
5. **Marshmallow Strategy** (Take a **warm** ass shower right before you sleep... You will feel blissful and fall asleep much faster than usual)
6. **Shh....** (Mute everything, no notifications, no distracting devices or any sort of distractions in your room... Only for sleeping... No lights...)
7. **Falling to heaven** (Fall to your bed ONLY and ONLY when you start feeling tired... I noticed sometimes I will stay up till 1am because I am excited about reading something... Then stay up whatever - You trying to fall asleep will be impossible if you fall asleep thinking... Taylor Swift Taylor Swift Taylor Swift.)

And if you want more tips on sleeping better - look at u/Hmm_would_bang comment, recommend it.

**If you still cannot fall asleep fast, no problems.**

Just take a piece of paper, write. Ask yourself "**WHY**" multiple times. That's how I discovered my main problem was not being able to externalize my thoughts fast enough since overthinking is the main problem.

Why can't I fall asleep?

Because I overthink a lot.

Why do I overthink?

I overthink because there's a lot of things in my mind.

Why do I have a lot of things in my mind?

Because I have a lot of responsibilities and things to do.

Okay... Then how do I stop overthinking?

**Then you ask yourself... What's the root cause?**

What's the underlying solution of overthinking?

Oh well... Externalizing your thoughts? Okay then - move on to what are you doing to externalize your thoughts. You may just be using the wrong **form** of the solution. I know I was. (After a long time)

I was using Journaling and what was the main **function** of Journaling...?

Right... Externalizing your thoughts... So what are the different forms of externalizing your thoughts...? Right... Talking to someone... Voice Journaling... Sketching your worries...

**Oh.**. * **Books are kings**

If you seriously SERIOUSLY want to obsessively (like me) improve your life... Please... Understand that Youtube, Courses or whatever the hell on the internet is... Incomparable towards... Books... I've learned 10000x more from a book than Youtube, Articles, Courses **combined**. And I know why you don't want to read... Because it's boring... But that's also why they're king, it's because no one wants to read... (Some people in the comments were saying it depends on the learning style of someone... But honestly... It really doesn't matter what your learning style because... If you truly read a book "*Ofc not just any but good ones*" VS 5 YT videos on the subject... U would see the difference yourself... Ofc u can only do this experiment if u implement everything)

u/ExaltFibs24 mentioned I didn't mention about taking notes while you're reading and that's absolutely correct, you must note-take while you read and actually do something with it otherwise it's pretty much the same as watching Youtube. (Thanks for mentioning it!)

* **When you get rid of all addictions... Life starts going YOUR way**

This - I know is hard. I've struggled with Porn, Gaming, Anime, Netflix and K-Drama etc etc so I know bro. It's **hard** but. But after you cross the stage of getting rid of all distractions.. Ho... Everything starts to shine... Suddenly the hard work becomes easier... Suddenly the book on your shelf looks enticing... (For serious enthusiasts... Atomic Habits Book is your best friend to help you break them.)

* **Taking Action was honestly my biggest problem**

I'll be serious here. The reason you watch Youtube to improve yourself is because you're too lazy to exert the effort to read a book on it. (Ofc I know not everyone) How many Youtube Videos have you watched and how many have you implement? Once you answer that - you will understand what's going on here. Honestly if I'll be real - even though u din read books N just implemented from YT videos, your life will still improve massively.

I've watched thousands of Self-Improvement YT videos myself - Implemented them once N then forgotten about it. I've also red hundreds of articles and never implemented any of them either. It shows it wasn't the knowledge that was the problem here - it was my inaction. I didn't have a system to organize that information (Those serious guys can look into Personal Knowledge Management Books to start with - I recommend How To Take Smart Notes or Building A Second Brain as a starter)

N u need to also understand that Youtube is a money making machine... They profit from you staying on their platform and every Youtuber knows that - so that's exactly what they do - keep you stuck in the platform (Ofc I know that there a couple Youtubers who are genuinely wanting to help people like Thomas Frank is one guy I like - makes really good stuff)

N I know this very well because I am a Youtuber myself - I know that when I make boring introductions... The analytics shows the evidence. But when I change my thumbnails, titles and add stories... Woah... What's going on here...

* **Lone Wolf VS Tribeship Self-Improvement makes a HUGE difference.**

During my first 2 years of self-improvement. I was alone. I was a lone lone wolf. No one supported me and no one cared about me. I was improving myself quietly. Days where I felt like crap - no one was there for me to talk about with. Days where I succeeded - no one was there to celebrate with... What about friends in school...? Haha... Funny you ask.

But year 3 of self-improvement - after coincidentally meeting an old enemy of mine in my old school. We noticed we both changed, we both red the same books and that's... That's when I seriously seriously started improving immensely... Having someone you can trust your back to... Feels... Very different. You have someone to suffer with, someone to celebrate with... Someone to... Just talk your heart out.

It's really made me feel emotional about it because I still remember those very lonely days where I ate alone while everyone was sitting with their friends or girlfriends while I am just at the corner... Eating... And... Ignoring... Day by day... 300 Days later it was still the same. I tried sitting with "friends" once or twice... It feels like I was forcing myself to joke around and... It just wasn't me... Best test to know if his actually a "friend" or not is I call.

*The Friend Connection Test*

Don't talk for 3 seconds and see if it feels awkward (for yourself or for her/him) or not.

If you're trying hard to think what to say next and you spout out something like:

"The clouds are black huh..."

*yeah... Awkward...*

I am not a fan of these 3 tips to self-improvement videos on Youtube nor do I like them in article format like over here - because they were way too generic. So I highly recommend you find a post I did called "Ultimate List on where to start self-improvement" and actually start taking **action** and doing something with your life.

Also, do you think **creating my own subreddit is a good idea?** I always dreamt of creating a community where we all can just obsessively privately improve ourselves while helping each other out... A tribe u could say. Everyone's got your back. You may have no real friends & family irl... But you got a whole tribe that's got your back - every. single. time.

Also I know my english is pretty ass as u/Dahappychap said, I really am sorry if it's hard to read and I am hoping I am not sounding egotistical - it is not what I am trying to do, disagree and agree as you shall, I am totally happy about it.

**Edit 1**: It seems there is a minority of people that disagree a bit with what I wrote, I do apologize if I said anything you don't like as I know everyone has a different view of the world. And it would be very egotistical to think MY way is the best way - I don't believe there is a best way, THESE are just my personal experience that worked best for *me.*

    

**Major Update**: The promise of the tribe has been completed after contemplating for a long time. None of you guys have to be alone in this journey anymore, we are all in this together. I made sure everything is catered towards supporting everyone's journey of self-improvement.  
You shall see it for yourself. But I do want to apologize pre-hand that things are going to go wrong for 100% sure so bear with me brothers.You know the pain of hitting the sack at 1 am and waking up closer to noon than morning? That was me. An unintentional night owl, trapped in a cycle that made 6 am wake-ups seem impossible. But here’s the twist: I cracked the code (In a very unhealthy way) in just 4 days, and I'm about to spill the beans.

I had a personal commitment to start waking up at 6 am. With my messed-up sleep schedule, it felt like climbing Everest. But I didn't back down. Here's my 4-day strategy:

**The Brutal Wake-Up**: Yep, I did the unthinkable. Despite sleeping at 1 am, I forced myself out of bed at 6 am. Sleep deprivation? Oh, it was real. But it was also the jumpstart my body needed.

**Morning Meal Magic**: The moment I was up, I had a hearty meal. This wasn’t just to fuel up, but to reset my internal clock. Eating early signals your body it’s the start of the day, pushing it to adapt faster.

**Push Through the Pain**: The first two days were, not gonna lie, VERY painful! My body begged for naps, but I resisted for the greater good. Keeping active and engaged throughout the day made it easier to fall asleep at night.

**Consistency is Key**: Day 4 was the magic number. By sticking to the routine, my body caught the drift. It understood who the real boss was. Now, 6 am wake-ups feel natural, with no hint of sleep deprivation.

For anyone struggling with sleep schedules, this method is a beast. It’s challenging but effective. Remember that blender that could turn anything (yes, even iPhones) into dust? Think of this method as the 'blender' for your sleep issues. It’s powerful, remarkable, and gets the job done.

**Note**: A community member of mine suggested this to me as well. A pain in the ass that member! I did it coz I had no choice! But... Shit did I not regret it! Thank you bastard!

**Note #2**: Yeah I used ChatGPT to help me write coz I suck at writing. I'm not an adult so I don't have a job, I did not know that people who have a job is dying from sleep... Man the world needs help...Have you ever felt that wave of frustration wash over you? The one that comes from staring at your to-do list and feeling like it's written in another language? One day, amidst the chaotic clutter of my vague tasks, I had an epiphany: Enough is enough.

I looked at my list: "Work on project", "Sort out finances", "Plan trip". Every item was a cloud of ambiguity. No wonder every time I tried to start, I felt paralyzed. Every task felt like a mountain because I didn't even know where the base was!

Then I came across the concept of Next Action from GTD (Getting Things Done). It was a game-changer. Instead of "Work on project", it became "Go to Hostinger and using inspiration from Jamesclear's blog, create a home page.". Suddenly, the fog lifted. My tasks had clarity, a defined purpose, and most importantly, an actionable step.

But here's where the emotions come in: Think about all the time you've lost, staring at that vague list. Feel that anger? That’s hours, days, maybe even weeks of our lives we'll never get back. And the stress? The constant nagging feeling that you have "something" to do but not knowing where to start? It's a weight we've all unknowingly placed on our own shoulders.

Now, imagine the sheer power and liberation of knowing exactly what your next step is. That clarity not only saves time but eradicates the overwhelming stress of indecision.

I urge you all to look back and reflect. Are you being vague with your life? Are you setting yourself up for procrastination and stress?  Embrace the power of the 'Next Action'. Give your tasks a purpose, a direction. Remember. Always ask. What's the next physical concrete next action to move this project to a closure?

**Note**: A community member of mine that I was working on a project of environment change got me to wake up. Got me to stop messing around with the tasks and got me serious about changing my workflow forever. Forever it changed it did!. Spoiler Alert! Don’t read if you don’t want me to spoil Ep 2 of Death Note!

Remember that heart-racing moment in "Death Note" when L, the enigmatic detective, turns the tables on Kira? In Episode 2, L uses a cunning tactic, leaving fans (like me) both awed and slightly anxious. The tool L wielded? Inversion.

When L wanted to know if Kira could kill without being present and pinpoint his location, he didn't just follow the usual detective spiel.

Instead, L aired a televised trap targeting Kira, but only in a specific region. Kira took the bait and acted, inadvertently revealing that he was in the Kanto region of Japan. Clever, right? By thinking about what Kira would do, rather than what he won’t do, L inverted the problem and found his answer.

So, how can we channel our inner L and apply inversion in our lives?

**1. Think Opposite**

Instead of merely focusing on how to succeed, ponder how you might fail. This method helps identify potential pitfalls before they happen.

Let's Dive Into Examples:

Personal Health:

**Goal**: I want to be healthier.

**Opposite Thinking**: What habits would deteriorate my health?

**Insights**: Regularly consuming junk food, avoiding exercise, not getting enough sleep, and ignoringmental well-being could harm my health.

**Action Plan**: Limit junk food intake, establish a workout routine, set a regular sleep schedule, and practice mindfulness or meditation.

Business Success:

**2. Work Backwards**

Envision your end goal, and then reverse engineer the steps to get there. This approach helps you chart a clearer path.

**End Goal**: Publish a bestselling fiction novel.

**Working Backwards**: What defines a bestseller? Engaging plot, relatable characters, crisp narrative. How can I achieve that? Research popular genres, create detailed character profiles, take a writing course, set aside dedicated daily writing time, seek beta readers' feedback, and finally, approach publishers or consider self-publishing.

Inversion, though a simple concept, is a potent tool. Whether you're outwitting fictional villains or plotting your next big move in life, turning your thinking upside down can offer valuable insights. So, the next time you're stuck, think like L. Flip your perspective, and the answers might just surprise you.

**Note**: Thanks to one of my community members for allowing me to share this very interesting connection!. Three years ago, at 14, I faced one of the most crushing moments of my life. My own father cast me aside, banishing me to a boarding school where I was the odd one out. The chilling wind of loneliness wrapped around me, and every corner echoed of isolation.

Each day was an emotional battlefield. Picture this: A sea of laughing faces in the cafeteria, while I sat in a far-off corner, trying to be invisible. No, that's not right. I couldn't even muster the courage to face the cafeteria. I'd often run, run away from lunch, from dinner, trying to escape the burning glances and whispered remarks.

And most importantly, from the pain of seeing the love of my life sitting with a guy...

Night-times weren't a solace either. My escape? Immersing myself in virtual worlds. Hours of gaming, endless anime episodes, and fapping. It was an escape, but also a trap. It wasn't healing; it was a mere numbing mechanism.

But there’s a limit to how much someone can endure. The weight of solitude, the pang of isolation, and the fakeness of friends were my daily companions, but they also became my motivators. A voice within me whispered, "You have to get the fuck out of here."

The journey wasn't easy. Through tears, through struggles, I started to do something. This crucible of pain refined me, teaching me emotional control.

I learned to understand human nature better than any textbook could teach. And oh, did it build resilience in me. Every fall, every setback, only made me tougher. After all, it's the fiercest storms that forge the strongest souls.

Looking back, I realize that while my father might have cast me away, life was molding a warrior out of me. A warrior with a broken heart, with scars, with stories.

To anyone reading this and going through tough times, just a small reminder: Pain is the greatest teacher. Embrace it, learn from it, and let it mold you into a beast. You're not alone; we're all on our unique journeys, battling our demons. But always know, it's these battles that shape our stories.

>You will never hear a successful person without a ridiculously shitty backstory.

You don't have to be alone fighting the demons.I'd come home, filled with so many emotions, so much suffering. Eager for solace, for understanding, I'd recount my day to my mom, every detail, every struggle. And after pouring my heart out, I'll look at her after pausing and I’d hear these words: "*Sorry, can you repeat EVERYTHING you just said?*"

It wasn't just a request to repeat words. It was a confirmation of my worst fear: My pain, my feelings, my existence in that moment was *background noise* to her.

The ache of being unheard is profound. It isn’t just about not being listened to. It’s about feeling invisible, insignificant, as though your feelings and experiences don’t matter.

Then, I stumbled upon Habit No.5 from "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People": *Empathic Listening*.

Empathic listening is about truly hearing someone, not just with ears, but with the heart. It’s about understanding their perspective, feeling their emotion, and giving them the space to be truly seen and heard.

I began practicing it, not just because I craved it from others, but because I realized the transformational power it held. Every conversation became a bridge, a connection, a chance to heal and to bond. Empathic listening transformed my relationships, bringing me closer to the ones I cherished, and healing the wounds of years of being unheard.

In a world filled with distractions, let’s be the sanctuary for someone's voice. Stop saying "uh-huh" and pretending to listen. Stop typing to another friend when your FRIEND is right in front of you. Stop listening with the intent to reply.

Listen. Listen with your whole heart, listen for feeling. Stop jumping to conclusion, question his feelings and what his trying to express. You'll feel different. He will too.

Remember, sometimes, the loudest cry for help is the one that goes unheard.

**Note**: A community member of mine forced me to take a look at my character. It was flawed. I had character problems and he told me he wasn't feeling heard anymore from me. That's when I had to go back to classic character building book. 7 Habits.You know that gut-wrenching feeling when you're on top of your game, crushing habits left and right, only to eventually stumble back into the same old pitfalls? Yeah, been there, done that. But I had a crazy realization recently that shook me to my core. Seriously, this was a game-changer. 🤯
  

  
Imagine your self-improvement journey as if it was a graph. Most people's graphs look like a roller-coaster – a few ups and then a steep plummet down, especially when the motivation wanes. What if I told you, with a tiny tweak in the way you approach self-improvement, your graph could be soaring upward, week after week?
  


  
Now, hold up. Before you roll your eyes, let me break the usual pattern. You've probably read some dope books (shoutout to "Atomic Habits", "Deep Work", etc.), and they feel life-changing in the moment, right? But after a while, the initial hype and motivation fades and you fall back into old habits. It's not about reading the books. It's about **re-reading** them.
  

  
You see, reading a book once is like trying to remember every person you've ever met in passing. Sure, some faces might stick, but most will fade. Re-reading is like spending quality time with a close friend, digging deeper, understanding their quirks, and really, really understanding them. When you re-read, the core concepts become etched in your mind, acting as a constant guide on your journey.

    



To be frank, *there's no difference between reading a book and not reading it if you don’t ever go back to it*. It's like hitting the gym once and expecting a six-pack. Ain't happening bro. And I know I know, you may be thinking but! I take good notes so I don't need to return it.

To be honest with you, I sympathize with the do it all at once and never have to do it again mindset. But as a person who has tried all kinds of note-taking methods and read many good books... You just got to drop that ego for 2 seconds and it's like a new book. Seriously.


  

  
Remember, it's not about the number of books you've read, but the depth to which you understand them. Let's soar together. 🚀
  


  
**P.S.** Shoutout to my community member that got me to find this incredible finding! You rock! 🤘🏻. Ever felt caught in the whirlwind of self-help mantras, swallowed by the vast sea of "you should do this" and "try that"? That was me, floating adrift in an ocean of advice, until I discovered the anchor of First Principles Thinking.
  

  
For those who never heard, First Principles Thinking is about getting down to the basics, the fundamental truths, and building up from there.
  

  
**Example 1**: Making Tea (Simple Application)  

  
Let's say you're trying to make the best cup of tea. Instead of searching for the 'best tea recipes,' start with the basics. What's tea? It's hot water + tea leaves. From there, you can experiment. What happens if the water's too hot? Or if I steep it longer? By understanding the fundamentals, you refine your process.
  

  
**Method**: *The 5 Whys*  

  
This method is about digging deep to understand a problem. Faced an issue? Ask 'Why' five times.

Let's use the tea example:
  

  
Why does my tea taste bitter? - Steeped too long.
  
Why did I steep it too long? - Forgot about it.
  
Why did I forget? - Got distracted by my phone.
  
Why was I on my phone? - Checking social media notifications.
  
Why was I checking notifications? - Habitual distraction.
  
Result: To make better tea, perhaps I need to reduce distractions while making it.
  

  
**Example 2**: Journaling (*Advanced Application*)  

  
I struggled with traditional journaling. Writing felt slow; my hand couldn’t keep up with my brain. Instead of accepting "writing is the way to journal," I questioned it.
  

  
What’s the function of journaling? To externalize thoughts. What’s another way to do that? Speaking. This realization changed mine and members of this subreddit and my community's life, leading me to voice journaling, a method that felt natural and fluid.
  

  
**Method**: *Form vs. Function*  

  
Strip away the form (how it's usually done) and focus on the function (what you're trying to achieve). In my case:  

  
*Form*: Writing to journal.
  
*Function*: Externalizing thoughts.
  
*New Form that meets the Function*: Speaking my thoughts.
  

  
**Note**: Using first principles won't just change your life if you understand how to use it. I won't lie to you... It's not easy. It took me a genuine 1 month of constant obsession of trying to understand how to use it... I did that by writing examples and looking for examples hundreds of times. N it didn't just change my life, it helped me change members of my community too. That's beautiful...
  

  
Stay grounded, be curious, and never forget the power of starting from scratch. 🌱🚀📓🎤. For those who think that they cannot run 5km... I was you man. I totally understand the instant dread you feel in your head when an event for running happens at school. My process of running always started the same no matter what I do.

Whether it's with music or not. Doesn't matter, this always happens:

I am motivated, I get out of bed and start running. I first feel like a king in the morning and then slowly, mr.leg starts playing tricks on you. It starts hurting. The motivation starts to get transferred from your head to the legs.

Your legs start hurting, you start wheezing and you *feel* oh no. You're about to die. I don't want my legs to be broken because \[Insert your excuse\] and I have to do \[Insert your task\] tomorrow. So I have to stop now!

Then I stop. And never ran a 5km ever in my life. I *believed* that I couldn't. That I was born with shitty stamina and I can't do no shit about it. Can't run, well boohoo, blame genetics. 

But I was wrong.

When I read "Willpower Instinct", she talked about how fatigue is an emotion. And I was like huh? Fatigue... Is an emotion? What the hell do you mean? And she says that your mind actually is making you hurt and feel pain so that it can *motivate* you to stop running so that it can save energy as our brains are actually stingy bastards.

So I started pushing myself. I first could only jog for literally 5 mins N I'll die. Just so you know, I'm a 17 year old and skinny. And I can't even jog for 5 mins. SLOW jog btw! But then one day I wanted to try it out. I started pushing that limit... And wtf?! I suddenly am doing 15 mins?? And after the jog, my legs are always fine after that... 

Now today, yesterday actually I went for a jog without our shirts with my best friend under heavy ass rain, we ran from one station to another station 5km away. I bet we looked like crazy people literally running while the rain is heavy as shit.

There was even once, a police car was looking at me, I was like oh shit (I din have my shirt on soo... I'm in a muslim country...) and he just left, I was like hoo, thank gods... And somehow ran the 5km, never believed in my life I could do that... Of course my legs actually did hurt when I woke up.

But nothing so bad. I didn't break my leg like how our thoughts would be like. So... Go out there and test it. Trust me. You will *shock your ass.*

**Note**: I wanted to let you know, 5km is actually nothing... A member of my community, AKA my best friend... That mf ran 17km! 17KM! Without training btw! He read David Goggin's Book and absolutely shocked my ass when I saw that shit...I used to read a lot of manga back in high school. It was so bad it was affecting everything. I was seriously addicted to that shit and I couldn't do anything else. It felt like I was in this safe world that I wished will never end.

For the 576th I was sitting down outside and telling myself, this is the last time I am reading manga. I will be ending it soon. It was 12am actually and I was sitting alone in nature reading manga on my phone.

Someone called me and told me about how he managed to solve this and that problem by just sitting down and writing his thoughts down and asking, why? Why? Why? Why?

Why do I keep doing this one. What's the underlying reason behind it? How do I fix it. And he managed to fix it is what he told me. Of course do note I was still reading manga just before he called me so I was a bit annoyed. Sorry, very annoyed that I now have to listen to that and not just that, he kept *highly recommending* to do it right now...

I was stuttering and stuff but I had to do it. I sighed back to my room and sat down. Just said yeah whatever and started writing and kept asking why... 30 minutes later, I managed to find out why I read manga and how to fix it. I did not fix it completely all in one shot, that's just unlikely.

This was the time when I noticed (obviously duh.) that I did it to run away from life. And to solve it, I needed to do something different this time. So I became very uncomfortable and went out to build a self-improvement club in my class. I went to their houses, talked to them, convinced them.

It helped a lot. I stopped running away a lot more. I faced the issue head on as much as my legs were shaking most of the time. I know it's hard man. We're all human at the end. We all know we need to face \[Name your enemy no.1\] but we keep running away to \[Pick you preferred choice\] and never solve shit.

    

**Note**: Thank you to a member of my community for recommending me this, it really helped me push through a lot of hard times and figure out my head to complicated problems like solving addictions like this one.

Oh... You're still reading? Might as well go deep journal right? You're strong if you are able to sit down and do what everyone else reading this wouldn't do. I respect that.I used to always read a book from cover to cover. I would always see oh... This book has high ratings and is very popular and a lot of people are talking about it. I should read it... And then... What the hell dude.

Trash. Unsuitable. Unrelatable and absolute garbage. For me at least. That's when I noticed something.

The introduction. Almost every book you find, WILL and should have a introduction that *talks* about how the book is organized and what the hell this book is about and why you should or shouldn't read it.

When I found that out... Gods of hell... I was wondering why I spent so much money and time on books I didn't need or are just plain unusable for me. At first I doubted it. I was like dude, no one told me this. Even after watching thousands of "self-improvement" YT videos, no one told me this shit.

And I never heard anyone talk about reading the introduction. I looked into the book "Deep Work" and saw this: 

    

This book has two goals, pursued in two parts. The first, tackled in Part 1, is to **convince** you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second, tackled in Part 2, is to teach you **how** to take advantage of this reality by training your brain and transforming your work habits to place deep work at the core of your professional life. Before diving into these details, however, I'll take a moment to explain how I became such a devotee of depth.

    

Do you see it? If you already want to know HOW to deep work, why the hell are you spending 100 pages reading WHY you should deep work when you are already want to deep work?? Man oh man... I feel refreshed after letting this out...

**Note**: The partner of my community was the first person I told this to and I had to show him multiple times with multiple books before his like no goddamn way... I was reading the women's section for Way of the Superior man N I didn't even need that shit!. Almost every week, there will be a moment in my life where everything ceases to be interesting. Everything in life suddenly felt... Boring. It's not like I was bored actually, but it wasn't like I was sad or depressed or anything like that... To describe it... I felt nothing.

I actually thought I was depressed. And maybe I was. Maybe you are. Since emptiness could be a symptom of bigger issues. Of perhaps mental health issues. But what could I do right now to face it? Rather than run away by watching Netflix or scrolling to infinity and beyond?

It's a very simple solution actually. I got out of my room. I got out of the house. And went out into... 

Nature. Har? Nature? How will that fix emptiness you may ask? I thought it stupid too. I was wondering what the hell is being outside going to do shit... I walked. Walked walked walked... And looked at the sky.

Hmm... Feels... Peaceful? Tranquil? How do I describe it? The clouds slowly moving... The trees practicing dance moves... The birds preparing for an Opera... Hmm... Somehow I feel kinda better? I stayed there and walked through the woods and... Hmm.

I felt refreshed. But it wasn't over yet. I knew in my heart, I would still feel empty and most definitely will be watching anime when I go back upstairs... So instead I took out a book and a pen. And started writing. I know, huh? Journaling... Sigh, seen that done that. Doesn't work shit bro.

But I continued writing anyways. I started by asking. Why. Why was I feeling empty? Then a bunch of thoughts continued. I kept writing. Paused. Write. Paused. Write. I found out why. I seem to have forgotten my why. Why I work. Why I wake up in the morning. Why I do what I do.

I forgotten about that. It was so that I can be free financially. Oh... Okay. Let's get back to work shall we?

    

**Note**: My community, whom my best friend is the founder of, told me that he was feeling empty. He said his been reading for days and days but doesn't feel anything. But always 4h later he calls back and tells me, he went out into nature and journaled and tells me "bro, u have no idea man, I goddamn need to go Japan man..."

*Huh...*. Many times I would read a book and a thought flies by "Oh yeah... I need to text Jessica." and then I text her. Then I sit back down and 20 seconds later "Oh yeah... I have to go get that new book from Marcus Aurelius."

I got sick of it honestly. I would be outside in nature and my thoughts would be looking at the sky and thinking... "What a nice... Oh shit, I forgot to get the book." Honestly Idk how I survived my life without having an Inbox.

You download the app TickTick \[Insert whatever to-do list app\] on your PC or phone whatever you use the most.

Then whenever you are reading, outside or wherever. (If you are like me - reading and hate distractions then just keep a seperate notebook purposefully for inbox reasons) Just write down any tasks or to-do's you FEEL like you need to do or are just wondering.

**For example**:

\- Is there any other books on habits?

\- Is there books on Hypnosis?

\- Oh yeah - I had to text Jessica...

\- Mother's day next week

\- *Oh shit... I got to text a member of my community.*

Anything that has an **action** basically.

THEN you continue life normally and you will **MUST** remember to always ALWAYS clear that INBOX every single night. No matter what.

*Why?*

Because of trust. Once you trust that YOU will clear that Inbox every single night... YOU will start to have clarity and stop worrying about which tasks is for which task - You just KNOW it's going to be taken care of tonight.

*I mean I personally wouldn't trust a president that says:*

"*I do solemnly swear that I will SOMETIMES faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will SOMETIMES to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States"*. 1. **Reading Great/Good Books**

I know you've heard this at least 500 hundred times by now if you've been in self-improvement for at least a few months. Youtubers say it, Redditors say it, heck even my dad says it. I've said it many times but I got to keep saying it. 

You got to have to slap this into your head. Books - sorry. *Good* books will change your life, it's the no.1 productivity thing u can do that actually doesn't just *feel* productive but actually also *is* productive. U can argue with me that podcasts, courses and articles are also productive, heck yeah they are. But a book like Atomic Habits can't compare with a article on James Clear's website.

3. **Shutdown Ritual**

I understand that you want to work all day all long. It' every productivity fanatic's dream. Heck I was one of those crazy dudes. "I HAVE to work 12 hours every day. It's all in or out." That was me every day. Though I was more of all out then all in.

Enforcing to stop working at 5 o clock forced me to work harder and get more done in less time and allowed me to consistently produce at a high rate. It wasn't a audio wave anymore.

3. **Voice Journaling**

I used to overthink a lot. Worry a lot. I was always thinking this scenario, what if this happens what if that happens and what if this doesn't... Sound familiar? The problem with this is that we are imagining things that hasn't even happened yet N heck we can't do anything about it rn.

With my trusty voice recorder, I managed to externalize my thoughts by uh... talking to myself for 20 mins and externalize every. single. little. worry. Thank me later.

4. **Meditation**

I bet you *also* have heard meditation at least 300 times. But this time, you're not going to hear go sit at a chair and do nothing. You don't need to. The purpose of meditation isn't being on a chair and thinking... Inhale... EXHALE... N repeat like a broken recorder.

Rather, the purpose is to just be present and lose focus and come back. That's meditation. Does that mean that \[Insert activity that requires being present with something\], yes it is. (make sure to check though).

5. **Helping People**  
I've built my own **discord community** and started what I dreamt as a loner back in my boarding school. Every day, during enforced tuition time, my classmates (3 guys N 1 girl) will cluster together while I am at the back just... Hoping no one sees me.  
It's tough being on this journey alone. Even worse if you have no one to trust. You only can keep things to yourself and have to put on a robotic smile and act like a different person. After escaping that school, I set my eyes on creating a community that actually helps people and not Mr.troller. Give what you never had. You'll be a better person than them.Everyone believes that it takes BIG changes to get BIG achievements.

And that's true... At least in the front covers. What many people I noticed (myself included oopsies) is that we tend to look at \[Name any billionaire or successful person u know\] and say, OMG, that guy literally had an overnight success blablabla etc etc.

But honestly, what you don't see is the years of small progress day to day to day. That person has been doing a lot of work at the back and all of a sudden, overnight success happens.

However, that overnight success paradoxically is not a overnight success. It was rather a over many years success.

I just want you to remember that as much as you want to start big. You have to start small if you want big changes. Those who read Atomic Habits know the 1% tiny gains rule. 365 Days and you get 37x better in a year!

I know I know. You are in the downs period and you suddenly want to change everything... But where are you next week? You got to just understand that you just got to start small and slowly build your way up there.

You can't build a empire in 1 day. Heard it but hear it again but this time... Actually get it in your head.

Stop making big changes N going back to "normal" and just start to improve slowly. You'll get that "overnight" success u see so often.

I know I did.

    

By the wayyyy I've started my own **small changes to my fear of starting an online community of self-improvement** because oh no... everyone already is in big ones, whats the point of starting a new 1...? But I did it anyways and made it unique, everyone's connected with one another and no general chats at all because I was serious about keeping it high quality and filtered. But hope that inspires someone out there! (Not tryna be egotistical!). **Books**.

You've heard it before. Every CEO reads a book a week. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Elon Musk etc etc reads reads reads. So what's really up with reading a book and changing lives?

I can tell you why because I'm one of those guys who had his life changed from books.

Not just any books though. Don't go ahead and read one of those nonsense crap books from the self-improvement market and then start arguing with other people... Oh books sucks... They're trash.

If you want books that will actually change your life, look at **Atomic Habits, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People & Willpower Instinct.**

These are starter books that changed my life completely. Of course, as usual. They also give you a saying where you keep hearing but don't do.

**Action.**

How many times have you heard this word? You hear it so many times that you are already bored of it. But why not actually do it then? I used to be just like you. Yeah yeah take action, doing that already bois. Am I really?

It took me 3 years to learn about this but you don't need to wait 3 years to learn about this and actually do something about it. I was submerged in articles, courses & Youtube for many years.

Mindvalley, Coursera, Masterclass, Youtube.

Don't get me wrong, they're not trash, they're great... But. It depends on your needs.

I hope this post helped and please don't think I'm being egotistical here.

**Edit**: What the heck, I was writing this post in the middle of a sleep deprived day lol, thank you for liking it! 

    

Btw, do you guys know how to grow a self-improvement community? I've made one recently because of the demand from the post called "4 years of self-improvement in 5 mins" and was wondering how do I find members that are active N really wanting to improve themselves? Any tips would be really helpful!. Passing our genes & survival is the top priority of our brains. Porn is artificial sexual stimulus, which basically means your brain *thinks* that u must continue to pass on your "genes" to every "women" u see on the screen.

&#x200B;

* **You're telling yourself every day that this is going to be the one last time...**

You know yourself it's not the one last time. Rather than thinking that shit man... 90 days NoFap... That's impossible... Say "no" just once now. It's not easy. But it's a mindset shift that will help you much better than looking at streaks. Don't count days. Count "no" now.

&#x200B;

* **You're not changing the cues even 1 bit... All you're saying is "I will change tomorrow..."**

U must not forget that Dopamine is a big thing about Porn for sure which is why u have such huge cravings but if u can't *see* it and u make it *impossible/very difficult* to do it, then u will have a much easier time. It's just the first 2 weeks such like ass, but ur gonna be fine after that.

Delete every bookmark, history. All of it, ur dedicated to getting it out of ur face. Don't hangout with friends who are *cues* for ur Porn use. Go outside way more, don't stick to ur screen N slouch a lot either, it's again cues.

Move your environment around, the "Fapping chair" u have, throw that out. Ur "Fapping Device" also throw that one out or install a blocker. (Cold Turkey Blocker is the most powerful one to use.)

&#x200B;

* **You find ur urges and cravings overpower u so badly that u don't even have time to remember ur "Why".**

This is quite simple solution honestly. Writing papers on ur walls don't goddamn work man. It's literally backed by science that if we keep looking at the same shit, it literally disappears from our sight. Literally.

Rather instead, use these as what I call "Emergency Buttons", Go to NoFap community or something N find ur 3 favorite success stories that will be noted as your "Why" u wana get the hell out of this Porn Addiction. Then print them out.

Print them out N DON'T u dare put it on the wall, rather, put it near u. Somewhere easily accessible where if u feel those URGES, go take a look at those papers. Trust me. U read half of it, ur urges will disappear. U will be like 'Oh shit I forgot'.

**1 final tip**: You can try to build a community (like what I have done) because for some reason, pride is a big factor in the game. When ur a leader, ur forced to not fail. Worked pretty well for me honestly.

I hope I don't sound egotistical or anything, I just am hoping this post will help out someone out there as I know very well how destroying a Porn addiction can be to anyone... Especially younger people... I was stuck there for 4 years before I got out of it... N never looked back.

*You don't need Porn. Porn needs you.*. * **Do you always say ah... Workout is good... Porn is bad...?**

BIG mistake. This is exactly why you're not consistent (Of the many reasons). You see, we when label something as "Bad" or "Good". When we become a lil good... We worked out for an hour...! Now... I deserve watching a bit of porn right?

It's an actual trap. It's called Moral Licensing. I did not know this during my early years until recently and it's such a big trap that I fell into constantly that I'll be repeating it many times in this post.

&#x200B;

* **Do you always say well... I've recently gotten good grades so a lil gaming is fine right...?**

Anything that makes us feel good of ourselves can literally *license* us to give in to temptations and enjoy them guilt-free... A lil gaming is fine... If you understand what you're doing to yourself.

&#x200B;

* **Do you always say look man, I coulda done 0h of work, but I still did an hour! Time to watch anime...?**

Oh no... Sounds ridiculous but a lot of people actually do this unconsciously. I did NOT know about this when it was happening, I categorized all of them in my head as just excuses I didn't want to look into. But anything that you moralize by saying "I coulda done that but I didn't!" is a HUGE trap for procrastinating.

&#x200B;

* **Do you always sit down and look at your laptop and say well... Only today I'll watch Netflix and tomorrow I'll grind all day long... N next day comes... Ur still on Netflix.**

What happened over here? Didn't you promise yourself you were going to work tomorrow for the entire day? Well... For some weird reason, we always moralize doing something NOW by delegating it to our future self N hoping that our future self will be motivated N we can indulge guilt-free now!

&#x200B;

* **Then do you always say things like bruh... What an useless idiot I am, can't even work, what's wrong with you lazy ass hole! N start beating yourself over all those failures?**

WRONG. Did you know beating yourself up with stress and shame actually MAKES you fail more? N if u forgive urself, u ACTUALLY fail lesser?! Ridiculous isn't it? But it's true. When you feel stressed or trash, your fight or flight system actives and u start becoming more impulsive and basically means u will fail more often.

In the 4 years of my self-improvement journey, these are the biggest traps I fell for myself WITHOUT even knowing it existed. But once u know what ur dealing with, u have a much higher chance of beating it. As we all humans at the end only fear one thing:

**The Unknown**.

Also random question but what do you guys look for in an **ideal community**? Coz I'm hoping to improve my own community so that I can genuinely build one that's catered towards *actually* getting people connected... Unlike my first 3 years of self-improvement... Where I sat alone, ate alone while a guy is just sitting with my crush...# 1. Reading Great Books.

**Don't just read a book a week. Use it.**

# 2. Going to the Gym.

**Don't just go the gym alone. Find someone.**

# 3. Practicing Journaling & Self-love.

**Would you beat your friend up if he fails?**

# 4. Start a new hobby so you don't feel like a zombie.

**Stop procrastinating on that piano. Research the best websites and start already.**

# 5. Find a community of like-minded people.

**Go find an online community or build an online community yourself like what I did.**. * **I stopped manipulating**

I was a hardcore manipulator. I always made it my way by manipulating other people's weaknesses. I knew what would make them guilty. I knew what would make them do what I want. I was controlling everything in my life. I was in control.

But I forgot that to be truly in control was to control **myself**.

&#x200B;

* **I started being consistent**

How many times have you heard the sentence: Oh... I failed again... BUT I am trying harder tomorrow.

I've at least heard that 10000's times from my own mouth. Porn. Anime. Netflix. K-Drama. C-Drama. Music. Gaming. Unhealthy food. I failed many many times. But it was all gone. I've started being consistent with ALL my good habits and never failed even *once* again. (Okay *maybe* sometimes.)

&#x200B;

* **I built a community of like-minded people**

Last year in my school, I tried to build a community of self-improvement people. I had 6 guys from my class join N I wanted to change the school... IGCSE came and... I graduated. I became lazy and was like whatever man... I'm the only one that's serious anyways.

This year, I built an **actual** community of like-minded people from discord. And it's much better than last year. I learned from my mistakes, I wasn't a good leader and am still not. But I understand I can improve.Don't think about going to the gym.  
Don't think about meditating.  
Don't think about reading a book.  
Don't think about working on your project.  
Now.. Can you stop thinking about it?. # 1. No One's Going To Help You

I learned this the hard way. Many people in the front will say they support you and say it's very good you go to jog in the early morning! Then... At the back. They leave you when you need help. I had a teacher I thought was in "Self-Improvement" coz he jogs in the morning. But you need to understand

That no one's really going to want to help you. Almost everyone wants dopamine from you. I'm not joking. Look around you. Everyone's on their phones and the most popular kids are either the funniest kids or rich kids.

# 2. You Need To Find Someone

Being alone sucks ass. Being the AKA Lone Wolf isn't as cool as it seems... Especially as something as tough as self-improvement. Can you imagine trying to workout, jog and stay healthy in an environment that eats magee mee, wakes up late as shit and games all day long?

You have to at least find a community where you could trust you back on and at least... At least when you succeed you'll have *someone. Somebody* out there that genuinely supports you. Not *fake* support. It's why I created **that** community. Find your own one, it's going to seriously help you.

# 3. You Don't Need To Be In A Relationship

I don't even know how many times I've seen couples in my school and feel the itch in my heart. But know that you don't have to be in a relationship to continue self-improvement. I used to say bs excuses like Oh... I need a women to be with me in this journey... Not now. 

If you can't even take care of yourself, how can you take care of others?. No text required. Exactly what's mentioned in the title.

&#x200B;. All those who have looked at **What I learned in 4 years of Self-Improvement... I teach you in 5 mins...** post know I promised that I was going to make a community where we all can just obsessively privately improve ourselves while helping each other out... A tribe u could say.

Everyone's got your back. You may have no real friends & family irl... But you got a whole tribe that's got your back - every. single. time.

Well... That was 4 weeks ago.

Now we're done. At last.

This post is going to be pretty long as there's going to quite a lot of information you need to know about this community before thinking of joining - It's not the type of "community" where you can just simply troll around and feel like you're progressing without actually progressing.

When I promised where we all are *serious* about self-improvement, oh we are going to be serious alright.

&#x200B;

**Purpose of the community**: Set people free from suffering of their addictions and build them up into normal happy human beings.

**Benefits of you joining**:

* Strict Accountability Buddies (Based on groups) "Soon"
* Questions will always be answered in detail & personalized (No short BS answers like 'Live life bro')
* Everyone that joins **MUST** create their own 'About Me' page where everyone gets to know their new brother (And share your suffering if you have)
* Only 4 types of post are allowed (Success Story, About Me, Tips & Tricks & Question) and that also means, absolutely **NO general chats**. (I do not want to keep you in our server, you got better things to do outside of it)
* There won't be people writing things like 'I suck ass, I want to die.' If you suck ass, please talk to someone in the community, like *talk*. Not keyboard warrior please.

Oh yeah - all this is free for everyone, so don't worry about it. The only thing we are trying to ensure is quality. So that's why we plan to grow by word of mouth heavily. (Basically we put our trust onto you guys to bring in brothers, not trollers.)

I do want to note, I'm absolutely new to this, so I apologize for anything that goes wrong (Because it definitely is going to.)

I also do want to note, don't join if you're not going to commit. It's going to save each other's time. We're all being serious over here.

**Tribe**: [https://discord.gg/Z7MyHyFxEk](https://discord.gg/Z7MyHyFxEk). I keep hearing J Pop Songs usually are using the royal road progressions so does anyone know how to step by step structure my way of practice to be able to play that?

Whether it's this or that chord.I am confused. I don't understand why I am learning chords or chord progressions to play such songs like L's theme or Sparkle from Kimi No Nawa.

I can't wrap my head around why I need to learn chords as when I see the sheet music for the beginner unravel song. I see (Maybe wrong for sure) no chords but can someone please tell me what's up with chords and J-Pop Music?. I always hear people talk about self-improvement here and there. But is there an actual definition of self-improvement and what can be categorized as "self-improvement" and what does it mean to be in self-improvement?

I've always wondered that. Is me improving my interior design skills or math skills - self-improvement? Or is only going to gym and meditating self-improvement?

I'm very curious what everyone thinks "self-improvement" *really* means.* **Year 1**: The dawn of YT self-improvement

I started self-improvement first through Youtube. I was watching hundreds to thousands of videos, saving *probably* tens of thousands of videos but never watched a single of them. Because I was always fearing the *latest* videos were better. After watching a motivational video on waking up early - Billionaire morning routine. I was excited.

I thought I was following what every billionaire does - Sleep at 10pm and wake at *4am.* How many hours of sleep is that?! That's goddamn 6 hours! I always heard the saying 'You're young, so it's okay to sleep deprive yourself, grind more!' but that's one f upped advice. I always knew I was tired and deprived of sleep but I just went for a jog to wake myself up and coffee.

For an entire year, it was a cycle of Youtube Self-Improvement. Focused more on '6 pack abs workouts' in Youtube and was following very ridiculously hard routines that I thought was needed to become strong. Honestly full of bullcrap, wasted my 4 years on Youtube... Full of absolute crap.

By the end of this year, I was burned out, sleep deprived, Reward Circuit systems was malfunctioned. I was still addicted to porn at this time, still took my tablet from time to time and enter the toilet to fap. I lost to gaming a couple times during this year and I found out about Anime during this year as well which led to a *new* addiction. I was failing no fap once a week as if it was a routine.

* **Year 2**: Life threw hot ass water onto my face

Year 2, after a kick off from the family and sent to a boarding school forced me to open my eyes. I was even more stuck in porn, gaming and anime during this year. I had no friends, no family (basically) and was alone the entire time. I had no one to trust and even though the environment was utter trash, people eating magee mee and everyone gaming and shit, I somehow managed to be in self-improvement (though super badly).

I still woke up at 6am when everyone woke up at 7am to go job and of course, to grab a cup of green tea and walk down a hill with the cool weather. It was nice. I still went did calisthenics (still doing the bs 6 pack abs workout from yt) and started meditating more consistently during the mornings.

Mid-year started and we had online classes. During this time, I dropped off self-improvement fully. Completely dropped out. I lost all control over myself, I was depressed and felt super trash. I gamed all day and slept at ridiculous times. I watched anime at night till 4am and woke up at 10am to watch more. I was a living zombie, living day to day without any memories of yesterday.

By the end of this year, I was devastated. I had to do something about my life. So I got back into self-improvement and started doing some weird life planning on Clickup. I started wasting my time creating a life plan for 10 years doing Courses and shit. I wanted to do better next year.

* **Year 3**:  I am sick and tired of falling off consistently

Before year 2 ended, I was doing some intense planning to escape my school - which happened. But of course legally. I managed to not just escape school, I managed to *drop out* of high school. Call me crazy then, I was truly crazy then, I discovered Coursera & Mindvalley during this time and convinced my mom (super difficult) that I could get the degree u wanted from Coursera without going to University.

She accepted it and I started doing Coursera every day in my room (With some amount of Anime from time to time. Basically for 6 days I would be doing 10h of work and then the 7th day, I would be doing something I called 'Dopamine Intox' which is just taking in as much dopamine as possible to recharge... What a baloney strategy, full of crap honestly, I look back this year with a sneer.

This continued for 2 months before I burned out for real and just couldn't do Coursera anymore and I told my mom... Yeah... Let's go back to high school. I was going to finish my last year of high school during this time. I slowly during this mid year became acquainted with 3 good friends and got into roblox development to make money (I failed miserably) and then after some break up happened, I was left with 1 friend.

I started to be more consistent with meditation, working out, jogging and reading. I still read nonfiction books consistently every day and of course, I was taking absolutely no notes and whenever I started reading a good book (complicated of course) I would throw it out saying it's trash. Used to just read a great book in 10h and said I finished this book. I did not use it. I red over 40 books this year and last year and didn't use them at all. Nothing.

I used to take notes that was 10,000 word long and chugged it into RemNote and forgot about them but I felt as if (like most people) I knew it at the back of my hand (the contents). This year, I was absolutely sick and tired of me failing my addictions week to week. I began creating a self-improvement club after deep journaling about why the hell did I keep falling off.

3 months later, the club flopped because I noticed a big flaw (me). I was a very crappy leader. I didn't know what I was talking about, I had no exact strategy to help them out, I was still stuck in Porn at this time (I quit anime and gaming already during this time) and I was telling them to speed read a book.

*Speed read* a great book. Now I look back. I cry. Why the hell was I trying to marathon great books for?? I was supposed to sit on my ass and analyze them and use them! 

**Year 4**: The rewards of suffering.

This is the time where I finally truly shined and reaped my rewards of all that stupid struggling and inconsistent crap. I broke out of all my addictions at last, found out I loved reading books and wanted to do that for life.

I started finally working out properly by going to my friend's gym, had a best friend now that I trusted fully and life was much much better now. I became no more manipulative and fake anymore and was genuinely a much more better person. Removing all your addictions truly is a liberating feeling.

It felt like I was walking through life with huge metal chains on my back. 8 of them. N one by one I managed to crack them out and now I felt truly free. I could finally be myself. I didn't need to beat myself over everyday because I failed no fap every 2 days just a year ago.

This is where I am now. No distractions, no nothing. Every day I just think of ways to help out anyone, anyone out there is fine. This is also one reason why I try to write a post every day on this subreddit - to see how exactly do you help someone.

    

If you red until the end, thank you. I hope this little story made you feel a bit better about where you are. Whether you're suffering now or is wondering when's life going to get better, it will get better. As they say, when you keep going down till you hit rock bottom, you can only go up after that. 

Adios.Age 13, I was on top of the world. I was the king. I was in the same school for 9 years now and know just about everyone and was in command and respected by many. *Feared* more actually. I had a group of people that listened and feared my every command. I lived life like the king and no one could stop me.

Age 14, my dad kicked me out of the family and sent me to a boarding school. 10 years of my life I was comfortable in my environment - now I was entering the unknown. I entered the boarding school with a stoic expression and entered the classroom like how I would enter my old classroom.

I sat down after a (self-proclaimed) cool 'yo' introduction and... No one came to talk to me. Ever since that day, I became the most popular kid in school to becoming the most invisible kid in school. That year was when life threw a bucket of hot *ass* water on me. I *had* to change and to cut it all short, these books turned my life around completely and I hope it has the same effect to you.

    

1.  **Atomic Habits**

This book is the bible for behavior change. That means you *should* be able to build any habits & break any habits if you really understand the book. This book really changed the game for me, I used to always have a lot of friction to doing the good habits like meditation, working out and all the shit. But after reading this book (4 times) and 2 years later... Wow. I managed to create an environment where I don't use willpower at all to do the hard stuff. Plus it was one of the big reasons how I quit all my addictions.

*To give you a taste of it, get a piece of paper NOW! Write down just 1 or 2 of the good habits, small ones should be fine, now think how do I make it:*

* Obvious?
* Attractive?
* Easy?
* Rewarding?

Let me give you an example that utilizes all of these. Let's say I wanted to stretch every day so how? I first made it obvious by keeping the towel (for stretching) on my dinner table to remind me and the fact that I would be able to read my favorite book made it very attractive. I made it very easy by only needing to stretch 5 \~ 10 minutes and because it feels good to stretch, it's automatically rewarding.

2. **7 Habits of Highly Effective People**

You probably heard of this. The very infamous bible for building our character. Rightfully so it's on the top, this book is complicated, I red this I think like... 7 times already? But I still do not fully understand what the book is talking about. Every time I suddenly became selfish or had problems with my best friend, I always come back to this book. I especially love Habit 5: seek first to understand then to be understood. 

It always reminds me of the quote from a stoic: 

'2 ears, 1 mouth - respect the ratio'

This book is seriously a game changer, I changed from being a very selfish person who didn't even know how to NOT be selfish into someone who is now obsessing over on how to build a community of obsessive self-improvement intellectuals.

To give you a taste of 7 habits, think about this for a moment:

Look around your (Social) surroundings. Who are the people you trust the most? Who are the people that you just don't know why but feel very safe that he/she won't shit on you or share what u said with others. That should be enough for you to understand why 7 habits is so vital.

3. **Getting Things Done**

If you have been in the productivity space for a while, there's no way you haven't heard of the bible of productivity, GTD. I swear I was guilty of skipping this book because I saw the cover a man with a business suit and I was like 'yeah... I'm not a office worker so no thanks'. But oh boy oh boy... How wrong was I. I've always struggled using calenders on Notion and to-do lists every single day. 

I was super freaking frustrated every day. I could not get shit done at all. I was busy having stress trying to figure out which task was for which day and which to-do's need to be done today... F it all. I knew that I needed to change my workflow or I'm never going to be productive.

And that's when I read this book. This book changed my life. I seriously wished someone told me about this long ass time ago, I genuinely am stress-free now when it comes to my productivity, I can get shit done without worrying about 100s of things going to happen tomorrow.

To give you a taste of GTD:

Take a piece of paper right now and write down what is the task you have been procrastinating on for a long time. Then write down from the start what's the next *concrete physical next action* that you need to do to move the task forward. Physical next action means what's the literal next action like, I have to write a blog article; I have to open my laptop then I have to go click scrivener to write the blog article, prepare first draft from notebook etc.

Do you feel more *relaxed* now? The reason why so many people procrastinate is because (me too.) your task list is full of vague tasks like call mom. Call mom about what? Or even worse, Call. Who the hell are we supposed to call??  

    

Please do not think I am boasting over here. I wrote intellectual because I have no idea what other word I could use that signifies what I am right now, I definitely do not think I am an intellectual - far from it. I still know I have a lot to improve and am growing steadily day by day.

Also, imagine this. In this world you only can choose 1 community with you to live till you die, you won't have any other communities in this world. What kind of community would that be like? What kind of people are there? What kind of activites happen there?

For those who read the post *What I learned in 4 years of Self-Improvement... I teach you in 5 mins...* Hi again and you may notice that I sneakily am asking what is an ideal community for self-improvement so I can use it for our community. (Let us know man!). 1. **Train your body so your mind will be able to control it**

Imagine you have a car. This car is a very expensive model of BMW and it's over hundreds of thousands of dollars. You drive it on the highway and put your foot heavily on the pedal - hoping to go over 200km/hour but behind you, you hear noises at the back of your car but you don't mind. You continue pushing the pedal till it goes to 150km/h and then

*Crash*

The police enter the scene where you died. They were trying to figure out what was the cause of the crash and noticed that at the back, the engines were very old and it was definitely a second hand.

Everyone seems to try to train their mind (the car) and seems to less emphasize on the body (the engine). For you to utilize the car's potential fully, you must have a strong engine and that means strengthening your body and making sure that it will listen to it's mind when tough situations happens.

2. **Birds are born somehow knowing how to navigate the skies & knowing how to build a nest. Squirrels who were born before winter gathers nuts during spring even though they never experienced it.** *Do you think we humans were born to scroll on social media & be comfortable - we, who are the highest on the hierarchy?*

You see a baby. You seen it grow up ever since it was a baby and now his a man - 18 years old. He uses his imagination to fantasize about video games and uses his body to satisfy his cravings. 

*Do you think we were born with the gifts of dreaming, imagination, language & creativity just to live like a zombie?*

3. **How would you comfort a friend?**

You walk into the classroom and you see your friend with his neck lolled on the table and you notice that there's something wrong with him. So you go to him and ask him what's wrong? He turns to you slowly and started blabbering about how much of a loser he is and how he doesn't deserve to live anymore.

You immediately tell him no his wrong, he is the most ideal, helpful and considerate friend you ever met in your entire life and that he is absolutely exaggerating his failures and he needs to see reality properly. You encourage him and you sooth him and make sure he doesn't feel that his a failure.

*But then when we fail, what do we do to ourselves?*

Don't beat yourself up - Build yourself up. Think about why you failed and how do you rebound back faster. Beating yourself up just leads to making you feel even worse.

4. **To Be or To Do?**

You are in your room and you see a poster - a poster of this role model that you love. This person is a very successful business man and you really admire and strive to become like him, to build a business that will change the world and lives of millions of people.

Every single day you make sure to dedicate 3 hours of work to build the business you have always dreamt about that will change millions of people's lives. You stayed humble and never told anyone about your idea and while in your job, people were treating you like shit, you looked down and accepted it.

3 years of suffering later, you made it. You managed to build a business that became public and you are now where you wanted to be. You start feeling prideful about yourself and you start to do public speeches and chase the fame. You want everyone to know who you are. You start taking credit for yourself and never delegating any credits. You go back to your old company and enjoy the expressions of their shocked faces and you shout at them, "I made it! What's up?!".

1 year later, your business goes bankrupt and you jump of a building. When we want success, we always get obsessed over becoming *someone*, the amount of fans you have, the title you have, the amount of authority you have and we forget that to be truly great, we should rather be focusing on doing *something* for this world and not becoming *someone.* But no one wants to do something for this world.

Because you would have to suffer not having any recognition, not having any fans and not having much money. It's what it takes to become Great. The question is:

>To Be or To Do? Which one will you choose?. I am so in pain to find out a week ago that school never actually taught us how to stretch *correctly* \- rather they didn't just not do that, they instead taught us *wrongly*.

I always remembered seeing everyone in my school very loose and competing against each other - who can touch the floor and who can do the splits while I am at the back just... Just acting cool. I was always very stiff. I never felt *flexible.* I never felt like flowing like water - I always felt like a walking stick man.

Nor I am flexible now but I am much more flexible than I was a week ago. Because I now just noticed that the reason you are NOT enjoying stretching is because school taught you "No pain no gain" and you think you're supposed to stretch till it *hurts*... But that's wrong. You're actually *tightening* the very muscles you're trying to stretch! (I know - what the hell right?)

>I'm not teaching you step-by-step HOW to stretch, I'm only telling you what's wrong and what's correct. (If you want a simple step-by-step guide - Get the Book "Stretching" by Bob Anderson, his book opened my eyes to create this post and highly recommended.)

    The correct way to stretch (However you stretch):

1. **Stretching is supposed to be easy & fun (It's not a competition of ego. It's less pain, more gain)**

Oh man... School never made it fun. It was always a competition of ego. It's always who can touch the ground. Who can do the splits, Oh you - why are you not stretching? Well... Coz it hurts bro. I need to repeat this: Stretching is **NOT** supposed to be **PAINFUL**. It's rather paradoxical, it's supposed to be less pain, more gain.

You're actually supposed to stretch to the point of feeling an *easy* stretch, just a mild tension and just *feel* it. Then only after 10 \~ 30 Seconds (Depends) that you move a bit further and feel a bit more tense and develop into a *developmental* stretch. (10 \~ 30 seconds again)

2. **Stretching is supposed to feel good... Like a slow massage (You're NOT supposed to BOUNCE!)**

You're not supposed to be bouncing. Yeah, no touching the toe and then moving back and touching the toe again - you're actually straining your muscles and activating the stretch reflex (which tightens the muscles you're trying to loosen)

If you feel pain - it means you're doing something *wrong.* If you are always stretching to the point of pain, no wonder you don't enjoy it - that's like going to a massage parlor and she has concrete made hands, heck you're never going there again.

If you don't trust me btw, try to bounce stretch while trying to touch your toes and then 2 minutes later, come back and stretch again - see if you're actually doing worse or see no improvement at all or not. (No joke, when I tried this, I didn't believe it... I actually *deproved*!)

3. **You're supposed to be breathing bro**

Please. Please do not stop breathing. If you stop breathing, you're doing it wrong. You must be able to breath *normally* when you're stretching. I did NOT know this, I was always holding my breath (This is also a mistake in weightlifting)

4. **You actually improve flexibility when you properly stretch**

If you think that there's something wrong with you when you can't seem to improve your flexibility and for some reason, you feel stiff as usual and you see people around you doing splits and shit? If you want to do those, start with correct stretching, it'll get you there (N you will actually feel & SEE improvement in just a few weeks, for me - in 1 week I could suddenly do the full lotus position which I could never do!)

5. **There's no set time limit for each stretching (It depends on your tightness)**

Remember how school always does the nonsense - Everyone get to a circle! And there's a guy in the middle doing some stretching for the hands and counting 1,2,3,4... Until 8? Or sometimes they yell 1,2,3... 'Oh teacher not looking' 7,8! And then everyone never even gave 2 crap about whether or not they actually *felt* more flexible.

You do not need to count till 30 seconds or whatever. If that particular muscle feels especially tight that day, okay. Just stretch as long as you want. You'll feel good, seriously. I sometimes stay on the same spot for minutes without even noticing because it *feels* good.

Oh also, remember to stretch your tightest part first rather than the more flexible parts - this will help you limber up.

>Don't think you don't have time to stretch, we all do. It literally takes 5 to 10 minutes a day for minimum benefits. You can literally do it anywhere and anytime - even when you're sitting.

Most importantly, I beg you to **implement** this. Seriously you will feel a bit stupid at first but trust me - I fell in love with stretching after trying out the REAL thing for a few days and felt *so* good. N of course that's not even the real benefits, other than feeling good - *who doesn't want to flow like water*? (N for those who workout... You may be interested in seeing how it *could* make you lift more.)

For those who read the post on *What I learned in 4 years of Self-Improvement... I teach you in 5 mins...* Do not worry - I am still very focused on building the community I promised, I will not fail you guys. It's just I fear I will not be competent enough to help all of you - so please be a bit more patient!

And do note that I'm not trying to boast any greatness from me, these are NOT my ideas, all are from Bob Anderson so please do not credit this as my ideas or think I am trying to do so. Absolutely not my intentions and I just wanted to share it because I was absolutely shocked I was doing it all wrong for 17 years of my life!. I basically have been lucid dreaming seriously for 18 days now and after wearing earplugs, I managed to get my first lucid dream 2 days ago.

And now the problem is I can't enter the DreamWorld. Btw, I'm not sure if this is normal or not but is knowing when you're in a dream and easily entering a dreamworld normal? (Like it's so obvious, it's like hyperspace into my head coz it's very similar to sleep paralysis)

Becoz when I was 10 years old to 11 years old, I experienced sleep paralysis for 30mins - 1h, which may explain why I could and ofc it may be very normal but I was very curious.

I keep failing to enter the dream world becoz my heart goes a bit too fast and my breathing makes my chest muscle move and cancels the rem sleep which is frustrating me, what can I do about it? (BTW, I stretch before I go induce a dream to relax the tension from my body)

I tried just not thinking about lucid dreaming when I'm trying but I seem to be always knowing it's a lucid dream when it comes (the transition). Have you ever just sat down on a chair with a great book and you were just absolutely overwhelmed with how much practical information you would get that will change your life! If - only you would use it. But somehow you forget about it or you just read the entire book, smile and feel good for 2 days. But your life still stays the same but you felt you have been productive.

Idk about you but that's me. I used to sit down and read a good book in 5 hours and then smile and feel "enlightened". I'll be like woah... Deep Work book was so good, I am so going to implement it once I go home. Yeah... Not happening. I struggled with this ever since I started reading self-help books from 13 years old until 16 years old, I was searching widely for a note-taking method that focused more on grabbing the practical takeaways from a book and apply them into my life quickly.

Frustrated, I had to create my own one, it took me a long time to experiment every day and really kicked myself in the ass for failing this and that until I managed to create a rudimentary way of doing so, if anyone knows someone who has created a method to implement books, do let me know! I would love to know about it!

After noting at the back of my head that I've at least wasted 1,000 hours+ just consuming and applying absolutely nothing. I have to say to you guys, it's not you guys don't want to apply (Okay well maybe some of you are lazy but I know most of you guys aren't) it's just that you don't know *how* to apply. 

I seen many Youtubers and articles talking about *apply* this information but I don't see anyone *talk* about HOW to implement it. And after regretting wasting thousands of hours, I hope that this will help you even a little bit.  


>I do want to note that this doesn't just apply strictly to books, it could definitely be applied for just about any medium, as long as it's practical information to be used.

**There are about 5 types (from what I experience) of Practical Knowledge you need to know before you apply anything:**

**Habitual** **Practical Knowledge** (Just integrate these Practical ones using the habit loop into your life "Habit Loop is the main principle when it comes to changing any habits btw") U can learn more about this either by the Atomic Habits book or an article. "It's to be deeply understood not memorized btw, it's like a math formula."

*But in summary to make something a habit, just ask yourself:*

1. How do I make it obvious?
2. How do I make it attractive?
3. How do I make it easy? 
4. How do I make it satisfying?

You do NOT need to satisfy all criteria, but the more the better of course, this takes time to learn how to be fast at building habits instantly for example, I found out I keep forgetting about my pillow when I go down to meditate, so I just placed the pillow in front of my door - easy. I will never forget it anymore. 

Or maybe apples, just put them outside so you will actually eat it since it's right there and perhaps eat it after brushing your teeth, it makes it more satisfying imo.

    

**Procedural** **Practical Knowledge** (Put into Procedural Booklet - Procedural Booklet is basically just a A4 or A5 notebook where you have a table of contents right in front of your book and first page will be your morning routine & night routine where you do daily reviews and to add new habits for example - when I wanted to add stretching to my morning routine, I just put it in my morning routine & that's what I mean by Procedural - following a procedure. 

Of course the only problem here is being consistent, but that's why you need to use the habit loop and make it obvious, attractive, easy & satisfying to stick with your flexible morning & night routine.

So it also means that any procedures can be placed inside this book for example: how to implement a book - write it in there and use a table of content at the front page to navigate with sticky notes - Basically if table of content says '2. Book Implementation Procedure', the page for that will have a sticky note that writes 2 and all it should take is one look at the table of content and one flip to get to where you are (For those who already use BuJo, you can just add it in there.)

    

**Experimental Practical Knowledge** (Experimental is basically practical knowledge where you are not sure whether or not you want to use it... So u want to experiment with it. On a piece of paper - U write down the *date every day on the left side* and write down on right side "*Like a table*" Variable Experimented N the other right side *results -* Basically 3 columns, first column is date today, second column is variable experimented and 3rd column is results and maybe 4th column for additional comments if neede. A bit hard to explain but hope u understand, it's like A/B Testing but only 1 or multiple variable to find out the best variable for the best results.

And then every day, you just check what you are experimenting (If there is a need to do so), for example, I was trying to figure out whether or not eating 8 times a day (By eating half a meal and then coming back later 1.5h to eat the other half) going to save me time and make me work better - it did so that's what I needed to experiment with but there wasn't any variables needed so I just wrote it as being experimented on the next page.

    

**Avoidance** **Practical Knowledge** — What you want to avoid (Daily Reflection/Weekly Review) "Daily reflection is basically another thing I do where every night I will reflect on a Notion Page or u can do on a mini book where you have prompts asking you whether or not you did this or not... N of course writing the practical point on your hand could help as a reminder.

*Weekly Review* is something I do every week to review if I need to review N check something for example, if I wanted to check if I was doing spaced repetition for my learning sessions or if I was falling for Dunning-Kruger effect or not. (It's to reset and make sure you don't fall for very serious traps for example, Was I being egotistical this week? Is a question that could help a lot)

Also one good thing about weekly review is - you can put anything in there, whatever you are unsure of doing or you just want a decide-not-to-decide system (For example, should I get that new phone or not? Should I text my grandma or not?), it's a great tool, I love using it.

    

**Theory** \- Put into Flashcards (Basically any theory that u need to memorize. At the moment, I am figuring out how to use a Zettelkasten (Second Brain) to make the theory much better stored as it grows by itself but I am still figuring it out - U can check out *How To Take Smart Notes Book* if ur interested) 

"Btw, U can use RemNote for flashcards if u want to memorize it N if u r more interested in having the recall of knowledge right in ur fingertips, I recommend the book *Unlimited Memory* to use the *memory palace* to keep everything in ur head and recall very easily but this takes hard work I won't lie."

    

Basically you have (probably) covered about all practical points u will ever meet in any book (Of course this is not exhaustive I am sure) and of course most importantly, u can just write down the **Page Number** of the book (on another notebook) of where the *practical point* was at so it's easy to refer back and figure out how to implement it straight away from those categories of practical knowledge.

All of a sudden it felt like 1 book opened a whole new world and I got to keep *everything*... What a wonderful sensation I felt.

So stop reading widely and start reading *deeply* \- that's what an intellectual is. (Hope this helped you out)

**Let me know you implement what you consume!**

I do want to note that I am hoping I don't sound *boastful* that this is a superior technique or whatever, it's just what worked for me but it may not work for you. (So please don't take this in a, "this is the best, you should definitely use this, everything else out there sucks ass" way)

    

For those who read the post on *What I learned in 4 years of Self-Improvement... I teach you in 5 mins*... **Hi again** \- I am still reflecting deeply how we can offer value to our near future community, not sure where to mention it at when it is done but looking forward to meet more mind-like obsessive intellectuals. (WIP - Very soon to launch as requested from you guys). I'll teach you how to be **anti-social**. (Skip to the end if you don't want to hear the story)

Yeah, you heard that right, not social but *anti*\-social. I was a social butterfly my whole school life until I was kicked out of my family and sent to a boarding school. That's when my confidence or (ego) got hit really hard. I lost all my friends, lost all my confidence.

I was forced to mirror my classmates and people in my dorm - I was forced to talk like them, do what they do, game with them - even though I was on self-improvement. Which meant I was NOT supposed to eat magee mee, not supposed to eat chips, not supposed to watch anime and porn but still did anyways.

I was alone there anyways, what did it matter? That's when I started thinking carefully about what I really wanted to do there - first of all I wanted to read more, talk lesser. So what I did was I became anti-social.

It was really hard at first, it's like telling a gamer to stop gaming when his in the middle of a Valorant match. It's in our human nature to literally mirror people because we all want to fit in. But what was there for me to "fit in" when everyone was the complete opposite of who I was?

That's when I started being unresponsive, I started acting depressed. Whenever they came to talk to me, I'll just respond like how girls used to respond to me in text.

"Huh? Oh... Ok."

"Really...? Ok."

And... They slowly backed off. They knew something was up and they did not talk to me anymore - but what I did wasn't just to get rid of all social interaction N become a hatred of mankind or some crap like that. I made sure to give hints to them that I'll talk when I feel like talking, so when during a day I do feel like crap and want to have some fun talking to "friends", I'll talk to them. They're all generally nice about it (Of course, your social environment may very well not be like that and if you ignore them all, they'll all ignore you.)

There are pros and cons to doing this honestly, you can't blame anyone but yourself when you do feel lonely but at least the pros are you get to read more, you don't get disturbed with distractions anymore and I honestly was just happy being myself.

**So in summary - sorry for the short story, just do this:**

* **Act unresponsive no matter what**. (This will be VERY hard at first but you must resist mirroring their expressions and their body language, just act like your mom when you pissed off your mom.)
* **Be monotone, talk like a robot** (Have you heard of Google Assistance voice? Yeah, you want to copy from them but drop the voice to an even more robotic voice. Like a machine)
* **Don't try to correct them if they ask you any questions, just answer yes and don't look at them if possible** (Just act like you're having a depressive mood for a long long time or act tired)

That's literally all, it's just practice that matters. Just so you know, if you still like to talk to a friend or two, act okayish with that person so that you're not totally deprived of social interactions.

I am not recommending this unless you really just despise mirroring people you hate and you want to just be alone and do your own shit - whatever it is. But I do warn you - once you start being like this, you have to stay like it for a long long time... Again, be very careful if you do want to do this. I was only doing this because I was seriously wasting my time pleasing people I hate and that's why I started doing this.I have a hard time falling back to sleep and staying on the bed for far too long trying to induce a CTB and I keep giving myself insomnia.

Is there any suggestions to stay asleep or not get too excited?. I noticed my old classmates have problems with being themselves.

I also noticed quite a lot of people here talking about problems in self-esteem, would anyone like to vent here?

I would like to know more about what's going on in everyone's head and their life situation.

What makes you insecure?

What makes you want others to make you feel secure? Even though you know yourself very well that it's just going to come back and hurt you anyways if your self-worth is based on such fluctuating fragile things.

Let us know what's going on in your head - genuinely very curious.

N no judgement please everyone. As Confucius said:

"Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof when your own doorstep is unclean". Personally, the reason I am asking this question is because 4 years ago me when he wanted to start self-improvement, he went to Youtube to figure out where to start.

And for 2 years he was on Youtube, watching hundreds or videos on Productivity, Self-Improvement, Billionaire Morning Routines and of course only last year I noticed that... It's just full of nonsense. (Of course, I know there are some great guys there like Thomas Frank)

But if now you just search up Self-Improvement on Youtube, it's just full of "5 tips to this" or "3 ways to this". Most of the videos there are just at best a bit valuable and mostly entertaining. Let me know man whether or not people actually go there to improve themselves or just to entertain themselves?

Coz that's actually the reason I created a channel myself - because I despised, absolutely despised videos like those. It absolutely delays progress and destroys motivation to be on Youtube N thinking they are improving.

I actually quit self-improvement 2 years ago mostly because no one told me where to go next or just a bunch of single advice or methods that are generic as hell. I still remember last I talked to one of my classmates, he told me that isn't dopamine detox - that iman gadzhi said - can do 1 hour of instagram a day?

I was like what the hell... Don't goddamn listen to those guys... THESE "guys" are basically who teenagers look up to for advice on self-improvement... N these guys just give out a bunch of crap advice (ofc again not all Ik) and the teenagers listen... I find that absolutely disgusting. 

An actual dopamine detox means absolutely abstain from any dopamine activities... 1 hour of instagram STILL F's up your brain... Like what's the reason you did a dopamine detox for? To detox your brain from dopamine... So why the 1 hour?

Let me know what you guys think about the current status of self-improvement in Youtube. I do apologize if I sounded egotistical or annoyed you or something - just my honest thoughts, do disagree.As this post title suggests - I'll be hoping to change your mind. On what?

On well - whether or not you're wasting your life or not. Whether or not the path you are going on right now is going to lead to mediocrity and depression. If you so humbly want to seriously think about your life direction for a moment... Continue on. Though you want a writing material and a paper.

Now - there's this thought experiment I found very interesting from the Bullet Journal Method. (Spend at least 10 mins on each, Ik sigh... Lazy... But come on bro - you can do this, it's just 20 mins, that's the equivalent of you eating lunch)

**It goes like this...**

Write down on this page a life of most least resistance. Just you writing a biography of a "you" that went on N continued life with the most least resistance, doing only what's comfortable N write down how that life would have went. N then write down you he/she died.

Then the next page you write down a page of most resistance, doing the uncomfortable work N hard work N seeing where do you go and what do you do N what successes happens. N by the end of this life, what happens? Do you die with a loving family and legacy? Do you die with a smile on your face?

Now after you are done.

Where are you going?

What do you REALLY want for this life of yours? Do you want to despair or be happy?

Do you want to die with a smile on your face or die without anyone noticing you died?

If you got your answer - do something then. Anything. Start actually taking action rather than staying complacent - You seriously only live once. If you know someone going down your first path - that should scare you. Scare you into knowing that...

Page 207 - Atomic Habits was almost completed. I was about to finish the YT guide to Habit Building and Breaking. Then - a thought.

*Huh... Wonder if there's any other books on habit...*

I shook my head quickly and slapped myself. I had to focus - after few more pages - Another thought.

*Huh... What if there's a better book on habits...?*

I slapped myself and pushed myself to focus once more... 3 hours later - 50 similar thoughts have already occurred.

*Does this sound familiar to you?*

If yes, perhaps this tip could help you out - it did for me. I am going to take a page from GTD (Every Productivity King has red this bro) and give you a taste for it. If you're like me and clicked that back button when you saw that smiling business executive thinking it was for business executives ONLY... Yeah you may need this.

# Inbox

That's one main concept you'll see in there. It's simple really - so simple that it's ridiculous. You download the app TickTick \[Insert whatever to-do list app\] on your PC or phone whatever you use the most. 

Then whenever you are reading, outside or wherever. (If you are like me - reading and hate distractions then just keep a seperate notebook purposefully for inbox reasons) Just write down any tasks or to-do's you FEEL like you need to do or are just wondering.

For example:

\- Is there any other books on habits?

\- Is there books on Hypnosis?

\- Oh yeah - I had to text jessica...

\- Oh shoot 

\- Mother's day next week

Anything that has an action basically.

THEN you continue life normally and you will MUST remember to always ALWAYS clear that INBOX every single night. No matter what.

*Why?*

Because of trust. Once you trust that YOU will clear that Inbox every single night... YOU will start to have clarity and stop worrying about which tasks is for which task - You just KNOW it's going to be taken care of tonight - simple.

*I mean I personally wouldn't trust a president that says:*

"*I do solemnly swear that I will SOMETIMES faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will SOMETIMES to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States"*

Your brain starts to learn that and is able to relax and delegate those tasks or actions to TickTick or whatever you are using.

# Someday/Maybe List

Perhaps you want more? 

You want to take things to the next level?

Then welcome to Someday/Maybe List - My favorite part of GTD.

All you have to do now if you're in TickTick - just create a folder.Then write down the category of lists you usually have that will be added into this someday/maybe list.

For example - I have different categories called Books to read, Unused Tasks, Unused Ideas, Hobbies, Shop. (These are my most common categories)Now what is this for? It's for another main concept of GTD.

# Weekly Review

I love this. Absolutely LOVE weekly review - so good. As the name sounds like - You just review weekly. 

Review what? Review all the things you have placed into someday/maybe list. Whatever books you wanted to read, whatever research you wanted to do. All placed in here becoz ur unsure of needing it YET.

This is where creativity and clarity of mind happens - I knew mine when I first tried this out. At first it feels tedious - useless. But once u do it a couple times... OH SHI! Why do I feel so much more... Idk...

*Zen...*

N when I meant different categories - I literally just mean a way to commonly categorize most of what you input into the someday/maybe list. It could be - Dogs to buy, What to shop, What to Journal about. Anything that you know you will review every week.

It really gives clarity of mind bro - seriously. I never knew such a simple thing could feel so... So LIBERATING.

N of course, this is just the tip of iceberg of GTD - I highly recommend it. The **Bible for Productivity** suits its name for real.

*Why are you promoting GTD?*

I'm not - It just changed my life that's all. I just wanted to share an Intellectual's Mission.

Do let me know how it goes for you - N if I made any mistake for those GTD fans out there (I would gladly accept any critcism please). As you can see from the title - I am trying to create an ultimate list of exactly how many areas could you start self-improvement in. N honestly the reason I want to do so is because I noticed many people seem to... Misunderstand self-improvement. Which is - when they hear of self-improvement they instantly imagine people in the gym, people jogging outside, people meditating like monks in their room.

I would like to shake that stigma you could say - And also at the same time hopefully inspire some ideas to explore different areas of self-improvement when they feel stuck or feel demotivated.

**PLS** do comment any disagreements or anything to make the post better, I really am hoping this post will help *ONE* person out there - I'll be happy. (Also for the areas I know of - I'll give a little resource tip on how to start)

THIS is not final remember pls - I want us to make this the actual *ultimate* list.

Alright let's get into it:

1. **Working Out**
   1. Muscle Building (Bigger Leaner Stronger Book - Bible for this)
   2. Cardio (Swimming, Jogging, Cycling etc)
   3. Stretching (Stretching by Bod Anderson is most likely the Bible for this - easy and simple. I red it a bit before N can't say I know about it but it's a option)
2. **Meditation** (Perhaps *Wherever You Are, There You Are* Book is an option - Though I've never red it)
   1. Zen Meditation
   2. Mantra Meditation
   3. Tai Chi
   4. Progressive Muscle Relaxation
   5. Body Scanning
3. **Rapid Learning** (*Ultralearning* \- Bible for that) and some examples of what can be rapid learned...
   1. Public Speaking
   2. Social Skills
   3. **Language Learning** (Yes... Fluent Forever is the Bible though I've never red it; but seeing the introduction... Yea... But I can't promise whatnot... He talks about becoming fluent in idk... KOREAN in 3 months or something and I'm like... In self-improvement anything is possible man...)
   4. \[Insert whatever is in your head - 99% it can be rapid learned\]
4. **Effective Learning** (Similar to Rapid Learning but this is just more specifically to how to effectively learn anything rather than intensive rapid learning something) and the Bible for this? *Make it Stick: Science of Successful Learning* is VERY highly recommend - it is 80/20 for Effective Learning.
5. **Habit Changing** (Atomic Habits - Bible for this no questions. Yes this is the bible for any habits you think was impossible to stick with... This will help you... Oh, incase you have an addiction, this could help you a bunch - it sure very much did for me!)
   1. **NoFap** (This... Has it's own area since so many people have problems with Porn... Past me included... Best book I know that helped me was - *Your Brain On Porn* 'very practical N useful'.)
   2. **Gamequitters** (Another one area very famous is gaming addiction... I never used any resources myself to stop gaming so... I have no suggestion except heard good things on Gamequitters ebook but I can't confirm anything!)
6. **Memory Improvement** (Hahaha... I am not joking... Our memory CAN be improved... I am as mindblown as you... I started this last year N I was flabbergasted to be able to remember the first 50 digits of Pi... I was like tf... This is real... N ofc this area of self-improvement can be obsessed over for years or even decades) "For the Bible... Well I am not sure honestly coz I haven't red *Unlimited Memory* yet but that's an option for you guys because to improve my memory I did a MindValley Course called Super Brain and that was a really good introduction towards memory improvement)
7. **Lucid Dreaming** (No... I am not trying to start a cult and no - this is not a mystical spiritual thing where everything is very weird and godly... No this crap is real. It's also one of the most underrated self-improvement areas imo. For those who don't know what this is... It's controlling your dreams and being aware you are dreaming and being able to do whatever you want... WHATEVER you want... Yes... That celebrity you're thinking about... Yes you can... Those old memories of your high school... Yes you can... That dead grandfather... Yes you can revisit that in full senses - Though it takes practice I won't lie, need to be very patient with this process) "For the Bible of this... I say Are You Dreaming?: Exploring Lucid Dreams by Daniel Love or you could try the classic Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LeBarge though for more of a modern look - do Daniel Love and his course on Youtube is only like 4$ and it's very good."
8. **Willpower** (The worst case scenario - this is when you need willpower. When you feel like trash, when your mom slapped you, when your dad kicked your gf, when your room got flooded - You have the willpower to push through anyways. "Not sure if I got the definitions wrong" BUT be very careful when dealing with willpower - most people I know or heard of is all about the stigma of Discipline and all that crap about be more disciplined. But if I'll be honest here - I've very rarely used willpower and I did a take in habit changing, changed my entire environment to support my goals and - BAM - Never needed to use willpower as it was EASY to read, it was SATISFYING to read, it was OBVIOUS to read and it was REWARDING to read.)
9. **Productivity** (Ah yes... Back to basics huh? It means getting more done while doing less; Bible for this? Hard to say... and hard to define productivity... So let's break it down)
   1. **Getting Things Done** (Absolute Bible for Productivity; After reading it multiple times N implementing it and re-reading again... WOW... I avoided this book for years because I saw the cover a business man and it looked... Old... N as a teen... I'm like do I look like an executive bro? Oh man... How wrong I was... After seeing THIS book mentioned like 5 times from my favorite authors like Cal Newport... I was done... I had to see what was this "Bible" and oh my gawd... Bible it is... It teaches you the Art of Stress-Free Productivity and having clarity of mind and basically teaching you how to deal with tasks like a monk. Trust me - this is the first book you should analyze and live to understand what I am saying)
   2. **Bullet Journal Method** (Absolute Bible for Organizing ALL your to-do's, calenders, planners, trackers and diaries ALL in one book... Literally. I've only used this for a while but it's a great addition towards GTD and both are very very good - really good.)
   3. **Deep Work** (This bad boy talks about focus. So you could say this is the "Bible" for Focused Work and it's really good - I never believed I could finish a task that I thought would take 4 hours in 1 HOUR! Like wha.... Most people don't even know they're distracting themselves nor did I. But this book really teaches you to hone in your focus and get crap out of the way)
10. **Mental Visualization** (Now WAIT... Don't skip... It's not boring nor is it as hard as you think it is... I never liked visualizing... NEVER did... Still don't... BUT. If you are interested in changing your entire character/self-image and become a new person... Literally programming yourself... Then Psychocybernetics... is your Bible for that... Am still reading it right now actually lol but just seeing how you can mental play your piano without HAVING the piano to me is just like... HUH?? N you still improve almost just as much if you were playing it... Is what... N the fact that a lot of Olympic Champions uses it.... Uh.... Yeah...)
11. **Social Skills** (Well... Any introverts here? If so... Bible for that at least the one I know of is How to Win Friends & Influence People... Do NOTE that it says INFLUENCE not MANIPULATION... This is your bible to improve your social skills by a lot... Oh yeah... Don't follow it so religiously especially when it comes to high school or Uni friends... It's... Hard to say... It's not really best to follow it religiously when it comes to teenagers I should say but still definitely your Bible!)
12. **Character Building** (NOOO... Don't SKIP... This is very important! This is you as a person... This is how people be friends with you for a week and at the back tell their friends "Yo... This kid can be trusted... His very open and just... Idk I feel safe with this kid..." and for Character Building means becoming a good human being... N it's hard not to mix philosophy and spirituality into this... But. For now, just know that Character is our identity, it's hard to explain honestly coz I am not an expert on this. But the Bible for you will be "*7 Habits of Highly Effective People*". Great book on not just character building but there's a very good chapter on Emphatic Listening which has been SO helpful in making me realize I don't actually listen to my best friend properly and I am just listening to reply, not UNDERSTAND.)
13. **Emotional Intelligence** (Yes - Your emotions can have intelligence. I believe this to be a big area that most people lack and really need to look into. Everyone I know (I only have 1 friend and 1 mom) has a good degree of emotional intelligence. They understand how to control their emotions and not let ego "Another interesting topic" to stray them from their path which is why it's why I believe it should be UNDER character.) I sadly never red any books on it BUT what could be an option is **Emotional Intelligence 2.0**. OR **The School of Life: An Emotional Education** recommended by u/BobbyWeasel "Thank you!" (Another Option could possibly be *Emotional Intelligence* by Daniel Goleman... But. I didn't like how unpractical the book was but it was good theory book on it I could say - But don't take my word for it, I didn't exactly read it properly!)
14. **Sleep** (NO... Pls don't skip this... It's not boring! It's something that you do 4 months every YEAR... How can it be boring??! It's fascinating... VERY fascinating... **Why We Sleep** shall be your bible... Why We Sleep tells you.. Just how amazing the benefits of sleep is... If you workout... If you learn stuff... If you play the piano... YOU need the most sleep... Talks very detailed and NOT confusing theory on sleep and of course on how to improve your sleep...)
15. **Masculinity** (Now.... THIS book according to my best friend... Is YOUR Bible to being a MAN... The book is called The Way of the Superior Man... Great book he says... N this is not the typical testerone booster, you gotta grind book on masculinity... It's very... Philosophical...)
16. **Spirituality** (Very hard to talk about... I don't know much about this field... BUT... If you want to reach for Spiritual Enlightenment - basically finding your one true self and want to rise above your level of thinking... Then "**Power of NOW**" should be your Bible...) "I know there are books like Bhagavad Gita and Wherever You Go, There You Are and many others. BUT I never red any of them so I can't help you... Apologies mate.)
17. **Mental Models** (Ah... One of my favorites... Mental Model determines the quality of your decision making and thinking... It's highly fascinating and there are a lot of mental models out there but for a GREAT Introduction... Pls read The Great Mental Models Volume 1. I red it - Multiple times actually. It's super good... I especially loved First Principles Thinking & Inversion - Highly recommended N his other volumes... haven't red yet so I can't say!)
18. **Philosophy** (This is honestly a way of life... It's very... Hard to explain... It's to do with character and living a good life and many things that I don't know how to explain... *Meditations* is a great introduction towards it... Created by the Roman Philosopher Emperor.)
19. **Breathing** (Yes... This is an area... I know WHAT?! Breathing?? Yes... Believe me... You're not breathing correctly nor am I... I haven't red any books on it but... What looked very promising to me was Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art seemed very promising to teach you - but again I never red it so keep that in mind)
20. **Personal Knowledge Management** (Oh yeah... It's an actual thing! I've tried to enter this field before N try to figure out how to organize my knowledge but until now I am still trying to decipher what's going on! 2 Books I can recommend is "How to take smart notes" and "Building a Second Brain". Those 2 books are great introductions!)
21. **Skincare** (Yeap! This is self-improvement imo for sure! I never red this book but according to my researching skills - This book "*Skincare: the Ultimate No-Nonsense Guide*" seems to be the best according to Goodreads.)

Now I know you may be wondering... Why are they all mostly books?? Why are there no like courses or videos or whatnot?? Well my answer to that is to be really honest with you, books ARE the way to gain knowledge N deeply understand the world or whatever it is honestly...

Youtube genuinely can't teach you to think for yourself... Most videos out there are "5 Tips for Productivity" or \[Insert recent video you watched on Youtube\] and I know this because I own a YT channel myself. I was wondering why the hell was I following all of them?? Why AM I making those 3 signs you're not progressing on self-improvement... Like... IS that really going to help anyone??

No - it will not. This is why I highly highly N only suggest books and sometimes very rarely courses if it's actually that good but books 99% of the time.

*Also - I do know this list can be overwhelming for SOME - But just start with the ones you are either most interested in or are struggling the most in* (Take your pick)

**This list is not completed, I will update it from time to time if anyone has any suggestions!**

Edit 1 - 18/8/23 (Am adding a side towards willpower & emotional intelligence). So I am trying to know if I am doing something wrong here... I have made a unique mnemonic for each of my clefs line and have been drilling them into my head... But I can't seem to get them to play on my hands... Can anyone tell me how to memorize them?

But after using the mnemonics... Or should I be practicing like crazy?

My unique mnemonic meaning is I attached for example line 1 of F clef is Ground N line 2 is Balls - N so on.

Is there a faster way to memorize this with accuracy?. So I was wondering, after being on Pianote Level 4 now. Am wondering just when the hell am I able to play intermediate level songs like L's theme or something.

&#x200B;

Does anyone play anime music and had to learn like for example; Arpeggions, C-Scale etc or something like that.

&#x200B;

I want to know like exactly the path to playing most anime music. What exactly are the components, scales and whatnot do I need to be able to learn?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bOruXptlg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bOruXptlg). I was just curious, are people interested in gaining muscles, like looking lean and strong type of muscles by just going to the gym like literally 4h a week only and genuinely just the laziest way to gain muscles. Like in 3 months, some life-changing stuff going on type of improvement.Just really curious, what do people think and are confused about when it comes to speed reading?. Hi, I am planning to make a mini-course about an entire system that will pull out every practical point from a book easily implement everything in to your life and automatically filters what's needed and what's not.
  

  
Because I noticed after being reading nonfiction books for 3 years, I've been doing nothing about. Until a month ago. And the growth I saw was insane. All a sudden it felt like I was on steroids for self-improvement. Everything started going right and my addictions that I suffered for years fell off like it was nothing...
  

  
Will anyone be interested in buying something like that?.Disclaimer* I am not a professional in sex advise whatsoever. I simply derive an immense pleasure in finding what works for women and the following is my own opinion and technique. This is not relationship advise whatsoever.


Many iterations on this subject exist. This short and concise post will consist of three points of interest to focus our attention on accomplishing the goal at hand: finding and pleasuring the elusive “Clitoris.”

I know what you’re thinking, does it exist? Gentlemen and inclined gentle-ladies, the answer is yes.

First point: Location and how to find it.

Not all vulvas/vaginas are the same, and this is true. While for biologically natural women, the location of the clitoris is universal, the stimulation point may vary.

THE PEEPEE HOLE (urethra) IS NOT THE CLIT. It is our North Star, guiding our way home. Whether by mouth or tongue, find your way just below the urethra and slowly work your way up past the first bump. IF YOU’VE HIT A SECOND BUMP, YOU’VE GONE TOO FAR. This, gentlefolk, is our sweet spot. You may be tempted to ask if you’ve found it. Don’t; you’ll likely kill the mood.

Second Point: Slow and steady wins the race!

When in the process of finding out what works, you have two options. The first option is to use verbal communication. This option isn’t always the best for a few reasons. Firstly, if you’re a man, you might not be able to translate input into output properly. I’m sorry, but we all know it’s true, especially from our esteemed gender counterparts. Secondly, sometimes women don’t have a full grasp of how to communicate their needs exactly, which will translate. Thirdly, it may just kill the mood. MAINTAINING MOOD AND POISE IS KEY TO EVERYTHING, PEOPLE. CONFIDENCE IN BED CAN CARRY YOU THROUGH 90%!!

Our second option and probably the preferred one is to do what I lovingly refer to as the troubleshooting method. Start with one method (now that we have found the clitoris, we have options). CONTINUE THIS METHOD WITHOUT CHANGING SPEED, DIRECTION, OR MAGNITUDE UNLESS SPECIFIC COMMUNICATION OTHERWISE! This important step leads directly to my third and final point:

Third Point: Eye on the prize.

This one is simple. In the process of perfecting your second point, you may come across instances of verbal communication such as “Keep going” or “Right there.” DO NOT GET TOO EXCITED! This is not the time to stop, reassess, and do a U-turn! Those are commands from the higher power to change absolutely nothing, gentlefolk! NEVER CHANGE YOUR SPEED UNLESS INDICATED OTHERWISE. Not too fast, not too slow. The course is straight, the victory is in sight, and endurance is your game!

A summary:

1. Location and Technique: Find the clitoris just above the urethra, avoiding going past the second bump (the cap), which can be the sweet spot for stimulation.
2. Communication and Consistency: Choose between verbal communication or a troubleshooting approach for consistent stimulation, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the mood.
3. Focus on Pleasure: Keep your eye on the prize, following cues for adjustment but maintaining a steady and enduring pace for ultimate satisfaction.

This is not all-encompassing, but you can’t teach a soldier to shoot in a day.

As the title says, I pay a considerable amount of money on cam girls every month, around $100, sometimes less, and it's starting to become a hindrance to live a normal life. I never thought I'd reach the point where I have to order cheaper meals at a restaurant because I already spent $20 on a random cam girl. Also, it's impossible for me to save any money for bigger things like a car or a very nice computer. My savings are ridiculous and, on top of that, I feel self-conscious and socially anxious when I go outside because I feel that if anybody knew thet wouldn't want to be my friends.

It all started when I was 20 and was browsing a camsite, and now I use skype and discord to have shows with cam girls with ads on Instagram and Twitter. Everytime I finish a show I feel awful, and I say to myself "this is the last time", but there's always another time. Yesterday I got home tired from work and the first thing I did was watch porn, which led to me paying for a cam show.

I'm also feeling that, due to the anonimity of these type of shows, I'm letting weird kinks develop that I don't like very much. Every month I think "this month is gonna be a $0-spent-on-porn month", but I never go past the 10th day.

I want to know how to stop this. I know it's an addiction, but I wanna know tricks that worked for you to quit porn cause I could make good use of them. When I manage to spend 5 or 6 days without porn, I start to fantasize about cam shows when I go to bed so I know it's bad. Meditation hasn't worked so far. Whatever was useful for you, please!! It'd help a lot. Thanks for reading!.As the title says, are there any success stories when the guy goes from having moderate/severe peyronies to being 100% recovered from it ? As if he didn't have it at all ??. As the title says, no matter what i do i can't escape the voices in my head, i made a post in r/selfimprovement  with the title "how can i deal with the fact that i will never be able to have sex ? " in which i have talked about how i'm sexually useless because my penis is small and skinny and doesn't work or get hard  because of some fucked up reason, again thanks to everyone who tried to help me.... 

I'm trying now to accept the hard truths about my situation, that i will have to wait at best several more years to get checked by a doctor , tried to confess to my father that i feel not normal when it comes to sexual stuff but he didn't give a fuck, he said that it's not the time to talk about such things and i should ignore everything and only study, he also said that he doesn't have money for doctors, for context we are a muslim family and we are from tunisia which is an arab country so having anything sexual is only after marriage... 

I'm trying to do everyday tasks in a better way and also experimenting with some other stuff, i'm avoiding sugary foods as much as i can, i also try so hard to not think about sex and girls and love, add to this avoiding  porn but i'm failing with this one and it makes me so sad, i'm muslim so doing such thing is haram but i keep going back and i don't want to go to hell because of it 😭 i can't remember how many nights i've spent crying like a kid instead of sleeping to be ready for the next day 

I got back to college and i'm trying to pass the year that i've failed for the last three years, repeating the year for the 4th time crushed my soul and if i drop out my father will kick me out of the house and i will be homeless, i've never seen him that angry when we talked about this subject and he said that he won't let me do it.... 

I also have no one to talk to, the only guy that i used to know left permanently from tunisia to canada and he doesn't reply to my messages anymore, you will tell me talk to your classmates at college but that won't do me any good, 95% of them are girls and they are mostly talking to each other about their crush or bfs, i've heard them many times talking in the class about the same shit, for the guys, they are approaching the girls and doing other haram stuff like drinking and drugs so if i don't do the same thing they won't invite me and they will ignore me....

No matter what i do, there is this voice in the back of my haed that reminds me of how fucked up i am compared to people my age and younger, i get angry when i see the memes about the voices in my head cuz they are real for me 

"fuck you you will die and be forgotten forever" 
"fuck you do whatever the fuck that you fucking situation puts you through, nobody cares" 
"fuck you you are so damn fucked up that even the only one that you know got bored of you, you deserve it" 
"fuck you you think you are good because you went to college ? People your age have a dgree while your are stuck in the same grade for 3 damn years !! Ow, you should never compare yourself to others huh ? Yeah i got it, you were at least getting good grades in school when you were a kid, so fuck you then ! You never grew up to be an adult you piece of shit ! That kid inside you died and he is basically a ghost that cry every time he shows up at night under your bed to see how fucked up you are !!! 
"fuck you that hot pornstar that you have just cum to her at 1 am doesn't even know that you are alive ! She will laugh soo hard if she ever knew that you did cum to her but with a soft penis less than an inch ! Real men have real dicks as hard as a diamond  when they see a gorgeous babe like x or y, you don't even qualify for watching porn, you are not a woman because you don't have a pussy and you are less of a man because of your miserable dick, what a piece of shit !! Who do you think yourself ! You pray to god and act like a good muslim and then you do this, you deserve all of your sadness, you will have even more, your eyes won't stop producing tears till you fucking die !!! 

These are some examples of the thoughts that keep haunting me

These are some examples of the thoughts that keep haunting me 

How can i stop thzm ?? Any suggestions will be appreciated...So basically this guy is a pornstar who is now selling an online course called the growth matrix teaching penis enlargement, he even mentioned on a video in his website that he got in the industry thanks to another pornstar called johnny x who revealed to him that increasing penis size is real, ryan talked also about his personal life, he used to be average in size (5.5 inches) and he had a breakup with his gf because she was a size queen...

I have no experience in penis enlargement, i'm what you call a lurker, i regularly check this subreddit and r/ajelqforyou and i made some posts in both of them because i have severe ED and i'm dealing with every single symptom of a severe peyronies case... 

My point is if every guy could get a big dick the porn industry will be destroyed because there will be nothing special about the guys we see in porn videos, they are literally paid because they have hot bodies and huge cocks, we 100% know that with a proper diet and regular workouts any guy can make his physique better and more attractive but this PE thing is kept in the dark, if it turns out to be 100% true like fitness the competiton will be so damn high and male pornstars will become ordinary people because every guy would be packing a monster in his pants lol, so a pornstar sharing this thing is like someone who says : hey, this is my secret, i want to lose my job "

To the PE experts here and members who are actually performing the techniques, what are your thoughts about this ??.

To the PE experts here and members who are actually performing the techniques, what are your thoughts about this ??. As the title says i'm looking for a supplement that can break down internal fibrous scar tissue, i have fibrosis inside my penis (it's called Peyronie's disease if i'm not mistaken) i'm still living with my parents and they can't afford me a doctor, i also don't have a job (still a student) so i'm trying to save some money to buy a supplement that can help me

Any suggestions will be appreciated !. A stupid question i know, but i'm really curious because every single skinny pornstar has a massive one, also guys in r/twinks and r/skinnydudes have really bigger than average cocks... 

Anyone has en exlpanation for this ??. Like if you believe in this you are telling me that we as humans are stuck in a loop of birth and death ?? I'm a musilm and i believe that we die and then god make us alive again to witness the day of judgement when we will be rewarded for what we did in our life here on earth, if we believed in god and all the prophets and we  prayed and were good we will go to jannah (heaven, paradise, whatever you wanna call it..) the opposite will go to jahannam (hell) so what's the point of living too many lives without remembering each one ?? Or remembering a few moments ?? You could be a believer in one life and an athiest in another so the reward from allah on the day of judgement will be not logic at all...

Any more explanations will be appreciated. 23 years old, never dated, virgin who has a broken kinda small very skinny dick which makes him confused  and more lonely than ever, (you will tell m go to a doctor but i can't, i'm still getting money from my parents and my relationship with them is not that cool so i will not tell them, they can't afford a doctor anyway so why i should tell them such an embarrassing thing ?? 

First of all   sorry for any possible mistakes because english is not my first language. 
 i'm a 23 years old guy from tunisia (a 3rd world country that you probably dont know nothing about except it being in africa), i have almost NO friends, NEVER dated or had a relatioship with a girl, litteraly zero experience, and of course a virgin...

The reason behind all of this is that i'm not sexually normal, you will think that i'm insecure about my size which is a really common thing among guys but its not that much for me, i would definitly choose a bigger  penis  because we all know that SIZE DOES MATTER, think about it, she won't be riding your personality or giving a blowjob to your humour, she needs a big strong one, you will tell me things like use  your fingers or toys, man she has fingers too and she can buy her own toys so why the hell she will need me ???
 
I'm not normal sexually because my penis is BROKEN, i remember being 13 almost 14 having ercetions for the first time (at the time i was so frustrated cuz i didn't know what happening, yes we don't have sexual education in this shitty country and no one told me nothing about puberty...) i forced myself to stop the ercetions by either bending my penis down or to the sides but man they were too strong and i was so horny (still to this day) so one day i tried the same described method but this time i remeber my penis getting in a hourglass shape and since then it has never been the same, it got SO DAMN SKINNY, i also can't remember the last time i got morning wood or even a normal  erection, so basically i'm fucked (didn't realize that back in 2014 or so, i thought unless it goes up a little bit  then it's fine, i was so damn stupid) 

When i got the internet, i started to discover many things related to sex, the first of them was of course, you name it, porn, this fucking addictive content that got me many times disgusted, but through explicit content (especially the homemade or amateur version) i discovered that i have a problem regarding my organ cuz guys' dicks in these homemade videos  last way longer hard  than mine, the guys also in these videos have pleasure when the girl touches their penises, not pain in my case ( as far as te famous or so called professional types of porn i know that they are enhanced by many things such as injections) , so i googled the symptoms and i discovered many things with the same signs as mine:

A curvature ? Yes one on the right 
Narrowing ? Yeah, almost a pencil dick 
Hard tissue that can be felt under the skin of the penis ?? I guess it's called scar tissue or plaque and in my case it's as hard as a fucking bone and i can feel it EVERYWHERE in my penis 

Treatment for this shit called peyronies /fracture /fibrosis/ scarring of the penis or whatever ?? Guess what ? THERE IS NO CURE surgery exists in many types but nothing is guaranteed, i searched a lot and i found many things like implants, plaque grafting, stem cells, p shot and even some scary and weird stuff such as phallo and penis transplant... 



So to conclude, i'm so sad about all of this , seeing people in my age or younger leading normal lives is making me more introverted , i'm not jealous but the fact that i couldn't even be average is driving me crazy, i'm pretty much fucked in every major aspect of my life and no friend or girl will ever want to be with someone like me 

To finish this i would say a big thank you to everyone of you who will upvote, comment, or even read this whole damn post, at least you cared a little bit. 

BYE. What would your reaction be  when you start dating a guy and then you discover he has this kind of problem ??. 23M virgin here and i think i have a severe case of peyronies, i have hourglassing in semi erect state, my penis can't get hard and it's so skinny, i can also feel a hardened tissue EVERYWHERE in my penis... 

As the title says, i found a lot of testimonials about using serrapeptase (a systemic enzyme) in treating several conditions with a fibrous scar tissue such as pulmonary fibrosis, i also found a medication called neprinol that is designed to naturally treat peyronies, i looked at the composition of of the capsule and i found it made of a blend of systemic enzymes with serrapeptase being included

What are your thoughts about this ???. As the title says i'm looking for a way to leave this country once and for all. 

Background : bac lettres 2019, currently struggling in law school (dérogataire 2éme année fi FSJPST, known as "juridiques", i'm repeating the year for the 4th time 😞😞, this happened due to me being extremely sad and depressed about many things to the point of being suicidal sometimes)... 

I'm 23 years old and i have never seen tunisia as a place that can provide a good life, i'm not sure how things were  before الثورة but i think due to the fucked up mentality of people here the past wasn't also that good. Day after day this country is driving me crazy because there is a lot of what we tunisians call عراقيل that are left without an explanation, like if everyone knows that the system is trash why the hell wouldn’t we commit to change it ?? But no ! People just continue with the same fucked up mentality of أخطى راسي و أضرب not performing how they should in their jobs and harming the country instead of helping it, 

The average tunisian doesn't give a fuck about his country, he tries to get what he wants no matter how illegal or disrespectful the way is, a little example :

3bed cheda saf fi koucha, iji wa7ed juste khatrou sa7eb el kawech ihez el 5obz w ya7ra9 saf kemel, ma3neha la yezi elli haz el khobz ma9aderch la3bed elli testana 3andha dra 9adeh, la yezi el kawech b3ath ennes lkol tnayek w 3mal ro7o mayhemmouch maw bech yo5los fel 7altin ! =mentalité 3asba leha 

Another example : la3bed elli traski f metro w zid men fou9 tehlkou (i7ellou fel biben w ikasrou f chbebek) , la yezzi ma y3awench el dawla bel 500 frank elli houma 7keya fer8a bennesba lih la yezzi i3attel la3bed ellli rekba m3ah FOR NO FUCKING. REASON !.... 

tunisia got fucked up to the point when leading an "average healthy lifestyle" is becoming almost a dream for someone from a middle class family like me, i consider this class to be poor nowadays, healthy food is so expensive (kilo escalope b 20dt ya nammi !) even street/junk food is getting more expensive( ma9loub yabda presque fera8 3adi yetkalef 5dt walla 6dt) so being in a family of 5 for example will make it almost  impossible to form and stick to  a healthy diet, let alone joining a gym and buying supplements, my parents can't afford this to me and i understand that, i just have to eat what mom cooks hahaha.. 


Buying things like a house and a car are litteraly dreams 

There is also this one thing that drives me crazy when buying stuff, is that there is a big diffrence in a price of an item when you go to diffrent places in the country :n9oulou 7aja soumha dinar, 3adi rak tal9aha fi blasa o5ra b 2000 walla 2300, 3leh ?? AKHRALHOM FIH !!! wallahi ken tzid 100 frank, ti barra 7atta 500 sme7 ama soum iwalli  double w sa3at akther hedhi 7aja mouch ma39oula jemla ! 

7aja yasm3ou be3a twensa lkol twalli t9oulch 3leha b الذهب, a good example of this is "gaufrettes chocotom" i know it tastes good but there is no fucking reason enni marra l9it 3attar ibi3 feha b 2000 ya zebbi ?!!! 

Another thing, the lack of some necessary foods/items and how strangely the country is dealing with it

I could spend hours trying to explain how fucked up this place is, personally, i don't fit here, i'm an introvert and i don't get along with my family for many reasons  so i want to  leave this place and never come back to it, tbh the only thing good about tunisia is our traditional foods (lablebi, kafteji, etc...) but that won't make up for the other things 

Sorry for the long post, i want to say a big thank you to everyone of you who will read it and try to help me 

BYE. For context :23 male from tunisia, never dated, virgin with no job, no college degree, and 0 friends
I can't physically have sex because my penis is kinda small, so thin (really skinny in girth) and broken (i have severe ED so i can't get hard) i can also feel a hardened tissue EVERYWHERE in my penis and i have hourglassing in semi erect state 
I can't afford a doctor at the moment, i'm still getting money from my parents and my relationship with them is not that cool so i will not tell them.... 

How can i deal with all of this ??. For context :23 male from tunisia, never dated, virgin with no job, no college degree, and 0 friends

How can i deal with all of this ??. As the title says i'm looking for a way to dissolve my peyronies plaque/scar tissue, i believe i got this disease by masturbating too much, with a lot of pressure and in unusual ways, you will tell me "go to a doctor" but i can't, i'm still getting money from my parents(not enough amount) and my relationship with them is not that cool so i will not tell them... 

I'm almost 100% sure i have peyronies, basically i'm experiencing most symptoms :

_ hourglassing in semi erect state

_ a hard bone like tissue that can be felt under the skin of the penis (in my case, it's present EVERYWHERE in my penis) 

_ painful erections : the pain varies a lot but it's still there most of the time. 

_loss of girth :my penis is currently very skinny 

_ ED (severe in my case 😞 i'm still a virgin so this makes me even more depressed 

I read online that scar tissue is called fibrosis /fibrous tissue, and using a systemic enzyme supplment (like serrapeptase) would be effective in dissolving that internal tissue so the body will have an opportunity to replace it with new and healthy tissue, i even have read also some testimonials of serrapeptase "curing" peyronies and treating other fibrotic disorders like pulmonary fibrosis, i found also a medication called "neprinol that is designed to naturally treat peyronies i looked at the composition of the capsule and i found it made of a blend of systemic enzymes, with serrapeptase being included.... 

I HAVEN'T TRIED ANY MEDICATION TILL THIS MOMENT 

any other suggestions will be appreciated 

Sorry for the long post.....As the title says i'm looking for shows with the same concept presented in "forever" (2014)when the main character is dealing with the curse of immortality, i really liked henry morgan's story and it got me disappointed to find out that the show was cancelled after one season.... 

Any suggestions will be appreciated. As the title says, i consider myself severely addicted, from 14 to now (23), i've jerked off and watched the dirty stuff too much, i'm at my lowest right now, 100% in rock bottom..

I used to be smart (i've read a lot of books when i was younger, i also used to get EXCELLENT grades at school, now at college i've failed the same grade of law school 3 damn times, 3 whole years wasted of my life and i have to spend this year studying the same shit again so i can pass...) 

My focus and creativity is nothing compared to my past self, i used to focus on a task for as long as i want to, i used to draw really well compared to my age back then, now i can't bring that focus and it's been a very long time since my last drawing... 

This fucked up state got me to the point of losing the feeling of time, when i was younger, every day of the week had its own vibe, now everything is the same, i would be stuck in my mind for a while and then i briefly realize :"damn that's a whole month gone, what did i do in that month/few months, NOTHING... 

I'm really disgusted of myself, at 23 years old, i'm not a normal guy compared to guys my age, i have nothing, no friends, no college degree, no job, never dated, a virgin, even my penis is damaged from this addiction, i can't remember the last time i got an erection, my penis is so damn skinny and i think i got peyronies disease from all of this which is incurable.... 

DUE TO THIS ADDICTION, I'M NOTHING 

i decided to stop cold turkey, i don't care if it's hard i have nothing to lose, but my question remains :is all this damage permanent ?? Will i be able to recover and be normal like people in my age or younger ?? 

Sorry for the long post...
