My four year old has become Topsy and Tim daft in the last few months, back to back watching on youtube.

And, as they sometimes do, my ears perked up every now and then, because something is just "off".

The mom says something about their fifth birthday coming up, which would make them the same age as my youngen.

These kids are all clearly 8-9 years old.

Then I realised, all the kids these kids interact with think they're 4/5 too.

This morning, I saw a "nursery" episode...
https://youtu.be/jb_uNNJE86s (about 4:12).

And it finally clicked, these little buggers are all in a cult. They're all being home schooled, and kept away from the mainstream. Their parents have all told them they're 4/5 so that they don't appear significantly behind their "peers".

Their parents never react to hardship, or show any negative emotion... because the cult would have them demoted.

Topsy and Tim are scientologists, they live in a secluded neighbourhood and raise their 8 year olds like they're 4 to keep them suppressed and secluded.I'm just out here ranting but here's today's fun and games.

My 4 year old has chicken pox. They started coming up on Sunday morning.

r/iama 30-something year old humira patient with no immunity to chicken pox.

So, today has been fun. All of the documents say "call the IBD nurse and your GP, you need antivirals".

Obviously, this started on a Sunday so that's one day behind on treatment. These things always seem to come up on Sunday.

Today I worked while managing the calls between the doctor and the hospital. The IBD nurses were their usual useful selves, advice on what's next and who's to do the work (the GP).

The GP has been a massive pain in my arse. And, I know arse pain.

I called them at 8:30 and requested an urgent appointment. The doctors surgeries here are pushing the whole back to the office thing... so, I first got pushed towards an in person appointment. Not a huge deal but it meant starting my day explaining the situation to the receptionist, because "I need a telephone appointment this morning" isn't enough.

I can still hear the dissatisfaction in her voice when booking the phone call.

Again, got the appointment, it was a pain but not a huge deal.

Appointment comes, doctor calls me. Has zero fucking clue. I understand biologics are not prescribed to lots of people, so there will be people who don't know what's up... not a big deal.

So, I started the call by briefly outlining the problem and what I understand the solution to be. Cheatcodes; I know what the deal is and I'm happy to get us all going the right way, save having to say "ummm, idk" to each other a lot.

This doctor though. He made it really clear that he had no idea about the medication, but was also unwilling to try finding out... or consult with someone who may know.

He started by saying "you're gonna have to talk to the IBD nurses to get xyz". I already have, they said this is y'all's job.

"okay, we're going to send you for a blood test". "I had it in 2018 and have no immunity, i started the call telling you this".

"if the blood test shows you have no immunity you'll need the vaccine"... this one annoyed me, on humira you can't have live vaccines. All guidance effectively says "this is an urgent situation, best practice is to prescribe antivirals and monitor, avoiding all delays".

Long story short, I get to spend tomorrow in hospital because the GP is not competent. I complained, the doctor who picked up the complaint stuck to bloods before treatment, despite them being useless. But, now everything's "urgent".

Fuck Crohn's and fuck doctors who can't be arsed to look at their own medical institution's guidance before deciding on a course of treatment....made to feel terrible about having Crohn's by my (soon to be former) employer.

I started my Monday with a quarterly appraisal. Which to be honest started fine, I'd met my goals for Q4 2022 and my goals for Q1 2023 are to continue working on what I'm working on. Great right? nah, because as a sort of tag-on to that meeting I was then informed by my manager he intended to put me on a Performance Improvement Plan for poor performance. What even is that!?

So, after my appraisal; that my performance was as expected, I got told my performance was sub par.

When I asked what the reason was, I was told "the team feel you can't be relied upon for deadlines". I quickly challenged this.

Here's the important bit, in Q4 I unforunately had higher instances of time off due to Crohns and Crohn's related illness. I'm on Humira, so go figure; I'm disabled and going to be off more. I'm not paid sick leave, so I'm not going to be off unless I have to be.

Having said this; the work got done, I'd met my objectives for the quarter. I called out my manager and said "what you mean is you don't like that I have more time off sick; because I'm chronically ill". He had no other answer to this. The really shitty bit is I do meet deadlines, I'm reputably good at my job. I'd met my objectives for Q4.

This is the third instance of blatant discrimination in the last year. 

I was dragged into the office to explain my (already explained) absences in front of my manager and the head of HR. No action came of that meeting, it felt brutal to have to explain being chronically ill to people who should be well aware of the impacts of being chronically ill.

I then had another member of staff make a derogatory remark along the lines of: "you'd be a better employee if you were in the office more". Oh, I'm a remote worker, useful to know.

And now my manager tried to start a disciplinary procedure for my performance at the end of an appraisal, that said I was performing as expected.

I'm exhausted, exasperated and now get to spend tomorrow seeking legal advice. I'm certain pressuring an employee to resign over their disability is illegal in my country (I'm in the UK).

I provided notice of resignation after cutting the meeting short.

I honestly just came here to vent because the sub has provided me with a great deal of reassurance and comfort. 

But, I would love to hear if anyone else has experience with discrimination in the workplace. It sucks feeling isolated and alone in this situation.

Oh, I then had to go to the dentist to have a root removed from a recent dental fracture, it seems like that's also the Crohn's.

Today my face and state of future employment do not feel good. Fuck IBD.I'm asking because I'm feeling pretty defeated today. One of my bottom molars fractured and came out today. 

This leaves me with one molar remaining on my bottom jaw. And one wisdom tooth, which isn't much use because it grew in facing forward.

So yeah, how's everyone's teeth?

I'm aware of issues relating Crohn's and dental problems, I never thought it would get this bad. I was originally diagnosed 2012, have been through the ringer on different meds, I'm now on Humira and the closest to remission I've ever been. But my teeth are horrific, I've lost so many.

Today is not a fun day.Hey everyone,

Thanks everyone for taking them off my hands quickly, sorry to anyone who missed out.I absolutely love Apollo, and have an odd question about how people would go about doing this, if it’s not already a feature.

So, I’m browsing r/NintendoSwitchDeals, and most of the posts are for the US. I’m in the UK, there are some posts but I can’t see them for all the US posts in the sub.

How can I go about only seeing posts in that sub with UK in the name?

I’ve tried searching and sorting but it’s not ideal, has anyone got any other ideas?. There’s so many things and so much background here I don’t know where to start. 

But; TLDR I’d appreciate advice on best way to deal with long term alcoholic in-laws. We are in the UK, currently living with them and will be relying upon them for property for the foreseeable future. Any advice no matter how small would be appreciated.

So, I’m laying in bed, can’t sleep because my evening has been a nightmare. We are currently living with MIL and FIL, and we are renovating a property on their land to move into in the immediate future. We have a ten day old son, and my partner has a 5 year old girl.

This evening I upset my partner, and she went upstairs to our room, to breathe and feed the lad. Dinner was on, being prepared by FIL. I went upstairs to talk to my partner about upsetting her, so we could get each others’ perspectives and make up. Having just given birth her hormones are all over the place, but I’d also done something to upset her, so I apologised, explained and she forgave.

Once we had both settled and cheered up a little, and the wee man had finished his boob we decided to head back downstairs to resume the evening, eat dinner and maybe get an early night.

We got downstairs, I took the boy into the living room to check his nappy, whilst my partner went to check on the 5 year old. Soon after, MIL angrily summoned them both into the room I was in, and proceeded to shout at my partner. Her grievance was that we were half an hour late to dinner but you’d have thought she’d been caught stealing or fighting someone.

Her general points were; you were late to dinner, your dad slaved over it, you guys suck.

My partner obviously explained she was upset, and feeding the little one, unfortunately he doesn’t work to anyone else’s schedule... this fell on deaf ears.

I held my tongue and was fairly angry but stuck to just letting it go, until MIL re-entered the room to single me out, she made the same points, but this time I was a little more firm in letting her know there was no way I would leave my partner upset to return to dinner.

The crux of the issue is that MIL and FIL are long term alcoholics. Today MIL started drinking at 12pm, this occurred at 6:30pm. She had had approximately a bottle and a half of a strong spirit. FIL is in a similar state. I know MIL would not have been so vile had she been dry.

Having said that, MIL and FIL do this every day. The routine goes something like; do some work from 6am to 12pm, start drinking. FIL then gets angry at insignificant things and makes snide remarks to MIL which obviously puts her on edge. 

She then proceeds to take this out on whomever she can, given the smallest of excuses to do so. Like missing dinner because having a newborn is damn stressful. Another example of this is that approximately a week ago we found out that the house we’re renovating on their property has a rat issue, and MIL felt that us discussing this was in some way calling her dirty. We found the issue when pulling up a broken floor board and there’s no way in hell she could have known, or had any impact on the issue.

The living situation is obviously a little odd, we moved in with the in-laws as they offered us a now vacant property on their land which needs a little TLC. 

I’d like to stress as well that they are good people, I have the utmost respect for them both. They offered us a cheap place to live and helped us through the birth of my first child. They are wonderful when they’re sober. Unfortunately that’s 4 hours we see them every day. More than half the time they’re drunk. I think this is an illness, my partner has dealt with it for two decades so she’s more inclined to think it’s just the way they are. Both are now experiencing medical issues which are exacerbated by alcohol consumption.

I have had to spend the evening consoling my partner, and the 5 year old who clearly understands that Nanny is upset with mummy and me but not quite why. We didn’t eat dinner because that’s a bit difficult to do whilst everyone’s crying and of course that means my partner who is breastfeeding is most likely malnourished. I understand the issue that MIL and FIL had, I don’t think their reaction was acceptable, I know it was caused by their alcoholism.

I have told my partner that I will only advise and act on what she says as I don’t feel it’s my place. I’ve also told her I back her with whatever she wants to say or do. I have also let her know that I feel her and her family’s behaviour is enabling and does not help MIL or FIL. I feel that enabling them leaves everyone just waiting on them to die so they don’t have to walk on eggshells, nobody wants to be remembered like that.

What do we do? We have about 2 weeks until we can move into the other place, we’re dependant on MIL and FIL then as well as it is their property, we have the finances to pay them rent but doubt there will be much of a contract involved at present. We also have enough in savings to renovate, which could easily be repurposed to rent elsewhere privately but this would likely cause a rift between us and that’s also not in anyone’s benefit. In the mean-time we spend every afternoon hoping they’re in a good mood. My partner and I don’t think they know or admit they’re alcoholics. They have been advised multiple times in the last year to stop, by their doctors. They had a good go at stopping once, but have not made it past the “stopping spirits” phase.

In my own personal experience I’ve found that this only turns around with loss, pain and suffering.

If anyone has dealt with this, anything similar, I’d appreciate any help. We’re in the UK, if anyone knows of any third parties able to get involved.Just for fun, or the enjoyment of synchronicity, I was thinking too hard about video games instead of real life and remembered back in high school I was comparing star wars3 to dmc3 to mgs3 at lunch....and decided to rethink it

MGS1 DMC1 - Dante/Snake

MGS2 DMC2-  Dante and Lucia / Snake and Raiden

MGS3 DMC3- Origin Story Prequel. How they got powers/Banada/Eyepatch

MGS4 DMC4- Older Dante Older Snake. Younger Rising Protagonist. Nero/Raiden. Ocelot has arm of Liquid. Nero has Arm of Vergil. Liquid and Vergil both rivals and Twin of Protagonist. Solid and Liquid. Vergil and Dante. Nero and Raiden both voiced by someone as badass as David Hayter. Games are full of just badass voices.

MGR DmC- Spin off that didn't do so hot. Play as recreated idea, or character. Both games final release changed story and characters from reveal to launch. 

MGS5 DMC5 "V" - V as a theme for Vergil, V, Venom, 5, protaganist has lost arm, isn't who they are, a phantom double, or wakes up from a long sleep. Twin rivals make re-appeareance. 

Also arms based on Mecha. Jehuty and Gundam. 

Star Wars: origins, twins, robot limbs, replacement Protagonist, waking from coma, living a lie
JoJo: don't even. The upside down
Mind Flayer Behemoth, seems to have head like a Demogorgon Demodog
The music, unsure if Survive was involved.
I know Kojima had similar inspirations and is a fan
Trailer 2, the tentacles on the tank are familiar.

I know unrelated, but nice brain candy for the idea of other dimensions. 

I just want to.mention the upside down because of how gravity seems to go upside down, and the handprints maybe from a tear/rift. Where can I see the video where the father has his son around his Gundams, and hes cautious about them, and his wife comes home and I think knocks over his RX-78-2?

I remember seeing this as some facebook video, like it was a commercial or part of a tv show. It was an Asian Live Action TV show, and I remember sharing it with some friends about...if I was a father, this would be me.

I can't seem to Google or Find it. Has anyone else seen it, or remember it?. I became Demon Snake around December by building a Nuke or Two. I wanted the Trophy and to see the look, and I think it took me two Nukes. I was very unhappy with the look, and spent my casual free time trying to capture animals, Missions 23 and 25 either fulton, or chopperin(not chopping) the kids, and some Animal visits. I'm still blood soaked with a horn after a few times a month casual play and 2 nights of what feels like stressful grinding where I just want to go to sleep now.

Are there any methods or way to see demon points. 

I hear there is a cooldown for the animal platform

and theres also a Refugee Combat Deployment that needs 20 S+ soldiers.. So I finished the series and the movie Awakening of Trailblazer. Didn't like it at first but after thinking about it, with all these riots and protests I saw some connection. So I've accepted its ending.

I'm still a little lost, I can assume the ELS backed off, and Setsuna went MIA..thus mankind chilled out and evolves...but did the ELS doing anything else? Or just remain a dormant flower. 

Did Setsuna go to Jupiter, or the flower? 

Leaves me to..what happened for 50 years. What did he do? Hibernate? Chill? Is QanT outdated now or the new G² Gundam?

I can understand not aging, as an innovater merged with ELS, but if anyone has seen Interstellar, could he have possibly through time and space spent less time doing his communication with the ELS in correlation to time on Earth?

I can't seem to find any good theories, and maybe its best untold, but I'd like to stop wondering :).Anyone know anything about this podcast?  Or its creators?  I see stuff like this and wonder if it is one of those podcast that slowly get people to leave the church? Or mingle the philosophies of man with scripture to justify their lifestyle or skewed thinking?. Hello All...Our son is considered Level 1 autistic.  I'm learnering so be patient.  All this is very new to us this year.  He performs "o.k." in regular government school but we do worry at times about how well he is doing socially and also the training of the teachers.  None of the teachers have formal training in working with ASD just expereince with having them in their class.  

Another question we keep having is....Is our child acting like a 3rd grader or is this "autism"?

What expereince have you all had in either keeping them in the Government School on a EIP or pulling them and finding a "specail" school?  Do these schools exist?  Are these schools only for Level 2/3 kids? 

Thank you all so much.  This group is amazing.I’m so pissed right now. My pediatrician just told my wife today that there are “now” new studies that state the MMR vaccine may trigger autism. Why the hell would this person say this? Are there really new studies out there showing a link? The seed of doubt is now placed in the mind of myself and my wife.  What if we go forward with this vaccine and our little daughter also has/gets autism like my son? The pediatrician also stated that since my son also has autism she would definitely not get this vaccine. I need some advice. I’m so freaking annoyed right now and I don’t know what to do.

UPDATE (19 hours after original post):  We asked for information and she shared this:

Hi there! The best things to reference would be the following books:

The Vaccine Friendly Plan by Paul Thomas, MD, and Jennifer Margulis, PhD

Dissolving Illusions, Disease, Vaccines, and the Forgotten History, By Suzann Humphries, MD,
and Roman Bystrianyk

Miller’s Review of Critical Vaccine Studies by Neil Z. Miller

Children's Health Defense also has a ton of great information and summarizes studies and articles that are not always easy to find: https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/ (https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/)

Here are 2 that relate to our discussion this morning 

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/cdc-data-reanalysis-shows-strong-statistically-significant-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-autism/ (https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/cdc-data-reanalysis-shows-strong-statistically-significant-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-autism/)

Everything in title. TIA.Wondering if I’m overthink this?  I put my panel at 37 for the fridge but based on a couple fridge thermometers I bought on Amazon it doesn’t get lower than 40.  Should it be going lower?  Should it be accurate?  If it isn’t falling below 40 will be food be ok?  Who knows about this crazy science?. Example...I see deals with Disney/Hulu and then also my Amex card says I can get another $7 off if I use my credit card on these services.  Is there a website where I can say...I want Hulu, Disney, Netflix, and Max...and it show me how to get the best deal on these services?. https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT88H8nqq/. Historically I had a lot of flare ups around my perineum.  To calm things down I go to my Derm and he gives me some shots directly in to the inflamed cyst/pocket/sack or whatever and it provides me relief for weeks or months.  I've been good for a long time but there is a remaining bump that is about the size of a tootsie roll and a couple sensitive spots.  Couple questions:

1.  The lump that is the size of a tootsie roll....Could this just be scare tissue?  I don't have any leaking of any kind but it is just always there?  Should I be worried?  It doesn't get bigger or smaller.  Occasionally I think it gets annoyed because I'm a triathlete and cycling does annoy this area.  Thoughts on if I should get another shot here?  Leave it alone?  Worry about it?
2. Around this area I point out above is a couple small red bump that I "think" is the draining location, annoyed hair follicle, where the derm does his shots, or whatever.  This little bump is some thin skin because I think it is scar tissue from repeatedly  getting popped/drained/etc.  This thin skin can be sensitive and hurt like hell at time when it rubs against my skin.  It also itches at times. Advice on topical ointment I can use in this area to reduce pain or sensitivity of these little bumps?

Thanks all!  I really appreciate this group!

&#x200B;. I finished my basement 6 years ago.  Did the electrical myself with help/advice from several commercial electricians I do big project work with.  Passed all inspections etc with the city. Not sure if any of that info is relevant but passing along.

So it has been 6 years.  I have a dedicated circuit for my lights in my living room.  After 6 years the circuit has popped twice today?  What could cause this?  Do these ARC Fault breakers go bad over time?  Does it matter that I live in the south where it is hot and humid?. So yeah...if I'm looking for a unicorn I understand....

More and more I think the Med diet will work for me.  I just need help working through some time, texture and taste logistics.

Few things in no particular priority:

\-I DON'T like mushrooms (Texture), moldy cheese (Taste), olives (Taste), capers (yuck), raw tomatoes (Texture), Kale (Texture and taste) and hate mushy squash  (Texture) ---So I get torn given so many recipes have these items....Advice?

\-I DO like salmon, chicken, breads, Non Moldy Cheese,  basically like most all dairy, Soups, Fruits, carrots, potatoes, peppers, avocados,  all fruits, most beans, most nuts, most legumes, I'm ok with Seafood just not crazy about it, most non bitter vegetables

\-Time - I'm sure this is for everyone but what do you do to save time on cooking and planning your meals?  What kind of meals last longer that we can make up front that will last for a few days?

\-I'm trying eMeals for a few months to get exposed to different meals and learn a little bit (They have a Med option)

\-I'm not a good cook....I'm terrible....I mess up boiling water...What advice would you give me in preparing Med meals

\-I don't drink alcohol

Thoughts?

TIA

&#x200B;. I’ve seen several post about this issue on forums but can’t really seem to find the real answer.  I suspect this is an e90 issue and the M3 aspect is irrelevant.  

So yeah.  Hot outside.  AC on Auto. Cold air comes out the vents but I’m feeling heat on my feet.   If the AC is on and I hit manual feet only it still is heat.  Manual vents and nothing else I get cold at the vents.  Hope these random details help. 

Thoughts?. My sister-in-law is currently living with us as she just recently was divorced. She has three kids ages 8-14.  Given the recent divorce I’m sure celebrating Mother’s Day is not on anyone’s mind. And unfortunately, she never really did get a good Mother’s Day because of how lousy her ex was. I want to provide some coaching for the kids on what they could do to help make her Mother’s Day as best as possible.

To all the moms out there that have experienced something similar, or are going through something similar, how can I help her enjoy her Mother’s Day.   Not to be too selfish, but keep in mind I have my three kids, my wife and a new infant along with my mother that I’m making plans for as well.

TIA. I heard today at church that there might be a new handbook in the works for both sacrament and primary? Anyone know about any of this?. Anyone hear about a new hymnal? I heard about this at church today.I’ve realized that on non-timed missions I can run around with my Reaper, staying concealed, and using the “once seen stay seen” perk and gain a huge advantage.  Does everyone do this?  The rest of the screw just hangs back until I’m ready to strike.   Feels a little like cheating if I’m being totally honest.Just trying to understand the DLC. I've played through vanilla XCOM2 a couple times already.  Do I just purchase the DLC and play a new game like I'm starting for the first time?  Or does the DLC happen after my first play through?  I don't want to do it out of sequence.  

While you are at it...Any other Add-Ons worth the price other than WotC?

Thanks!!!. My wife and I finally have a diagnosis that our child has autism.  I say finally because most people would never think it even us but now that he is in the 2nd grade he has been getting more testing and support (The support he has been getting from his school has been amazing.  The primary support started because of speech delay and then phased in to social stuff etc.).  We are first were not going to say anything because we didn't know what or how to say anything.  But some events have taken place were my SIL has moved in to our home with her three kids and holy crap....I'm seeing a new child that I think the school has been telling us about.  It has been really hard for him and it is breaking my heart.  So because of this we are accelerating our plans to communicate to this him, his sister, my SILs kids (SIL knows), and our extended family so that they are aware and give him support where he needs it.  We were thinking of sitting down with him one on one, showing him a short YouTube video about Autism and then telling him he has this and that we are there to support him but this may also be why he has these big feelings.  

SO....Any good Videos you have used with you kids to communicate that they have Autism?

Any thoughts on how we are sharing this news with him?

Thank you...This is ALLLLL so new and we are scared and confused and just want our son to know he is going to be ok...BUT yes...I also just want to know he is going to be ok.SIL is recently divorced.  She has three kids and some how the ex got the 4th child (Long annoying story).  The dude sucks and is being investigated for child abuse (Unfortuanly there are other kids in worst scenarios so who knows how far this goes).  Anyway...What are grounds for "harassment"?  He txt here on avg 50 times per day and calls on avg 20 time per day.  She doesn't always answer.  It is highly distracting and the content is usually "something that is needed" but then she get's sucked in to calling him and of course the content is anything but what the txt and VM were about.  The calls are then long exhaustive fights.  The guy is relentless....What options does she have?  How have other dealt with an ex that just won't quite?  FYI...I'm involved because she is living with us for the next few month while she find a new home/place to stay.I ask this because I follow Dan McClellan and love his content. I find it fascinating how in depth he can go with biblical scholarship.  And it feels like one that studies religion and language to this extent would eventually get to some conclusion that this is all man made. 

For me I feel like I walk around a little ignorant and base a lot of my faith on all the little spiritual experiences I believe I’ve had.  

Any thoughts?. Today, my youngest son was just diagnosed with a very mild case of autism. I guess this is also considered high functioning?  I’m new to this.

With that said, I’m very curious about his future ability to feel the spirit? I hope that doesn’t sound too ignorant. I’ve just heard stories of people with children that have depression, anxiety or some form of autism struggle with the gospel?

Do any of you have any personal experience in this area? Do you have any advice?. I have the opportunity to interview a customer in front of a bunch of sellers. The customer is super cool and knows the audience is a bunch of greedy sales guys wanting to know the ins and outs of how to get more POs.  Any suggestions?  What would you want to know?. Wife and I are happily in love and crazy so decided to have another child after there being a nine year gap.  What are the cool and new must have widgets we should be putting on our registry?. Other than don’t do it, looking for advice. Sister-in-law is going through a terrible divorce and will be homeless. We are going to be taking them in while they wait for section 8 to become available in the next few months.  Kids ages including ours 8,8,10,11, and 14.  Looking for life logistics advice in dealing with this many people in a home.  Laundry, food, showers, personal space, etc.  Anything…Trying to be prepared as possible.I heard something one time and I’m not sure if it is true.  Looking for help.  Apparently Joseph S said to B Young some like “Hey…This endowment stuff we have here and we are learning is not perfect and may even change along the way.”   Any of you heard such a thing?. So my wife and I just started having slow internet on our phones.  When using apps that use data or browsing the internet is either super slow or times out.  All of IOT devices in the house are NOT having this issue.  PC for work and personal work just fine.  TVs stream just fine.  I have GB speeds from Att Fiber.  I have a Orbi mesh wifi network.  Any advice?  Again...Seems like it started happening this week.  Ipad also having same issue.I have RBR50 with the satellites. Two of the satellites are wireless.  Just did a speed test and get 864mb download. PC and TVs all work flawless.  My phone and my wife’s phone are laggy.  Super annoying.  Thoughts?. I just hired two new guys to get out and hunt. These are engineers that I brought into sales given the technical aspect of my field. I don’t necessarily have tons of time to coach them on every little way to prospect. Looking for advice on resources, blogs, YouTube videos, etc. That I can handover to them to help facilitate this task.  Thoughts?. Not sure how to ask this. But I’ll give it a shot. If I buy a second home I only have to put 10% down. If I buy a second home as an investment property I have to put 20% down based on what I’m seeing.  So if I buy the second home with a 10% down payment and the lender finds out that I am Airbnbing that property. Could they called a loan?  Does any of this make sense? I would suspect there are a lot of people here that had the same question before they bought their first investment property.Yo guys...I'll be entertaining 15 people a couple nights in a row.  Half of the people are clients and the other half are internal employees.  I'm so sick of these big dinners where you are stuck talking to the same folks and left out of the other side of the the table.  What are some of your best ideas for entertaining clients?  These specific clients don't like Top Golf.  The ax throwing place doesn't have food.  I do have a fowling place I can take them to.  Any other ideas you all use?. Just looking for advice on what I have to look forward to….So I had a thought and was wondering if this existed? Can I hire someone to really help me walk through my linked in and make it look solid? Not necessarily for potential jobs but for when customers go to my linked in?  I want my clients to look at my linkedin and say,”I like this guys, he looks experienced, I should give him time”.  Thoughts?. My daughter will be attending the temple for the first time this month.  Does anyone have any good resources to help prepare youth for the recommend questions?  Additionally looking for good resources to teach a 11 yr old girl about the law of chastity properly? I’m coming from the world where I was told I would go to hell and no one would want me if I broke the law of chastity.  I do not want that same message delivered to my daughter. Thanks!. Wife and I have finally met our goal and saved up enough money to put a down payment on a AirBnB.  We are now in the hunt for a property.  So where do we start?  I see so many books out there and was wondering if there is one good book that give the most practical advice so she and I can both listen to it on  Audible?  Or is there a good YouTube channel the community supports?  I'm trying to stay clear of all the tiktok get rich BS that is out there and I'm looking for the real stuff.  I'm not coming from nothing....My mom has been in residential real-estate for 30 years and my best friend already has two properties.  Just trying to educate myself as much as possible.  TIA!!!!. Any good articles/advice out there on how to conduct a good interview when hiring sales people?. Did a engine swap on my 2013 X1 Xdrive28i after timing chain failed.  For 2800 miles I've had zero codes.  Now I'm getting 2D61 and 2C58 with limp mode/reduced power.  I suspect the 2C58 is a result of 2D61?  I switched the vanos solonoids left to right to just make sure things stayed consistent.  It seems like this is happening after about 30ish miles of driving.  I clear the codes and everything is back to normal.  So far is only happening while driving along normally (ie not accelerating or deccelterating) Thoughts?.What do they do for a living as their youthful days have gone past? Do they usually have families? What's their overall condition??. Is it a loners pursuit? Or do screen writers happen to have great social lives ? Share your experiences !. Is there anyone in this sub with ASD? If so, what are your daily struggles? And how did you come to know you have the condition? I think I might be in the spectrum and wanna know if I have real symptoms.I've heard people call A10 and nimboly ultimate charmers but never understood what it really meant. Is it about being childish or something?. He seems like a person who keeps to himself and values personal relations. I've even heard him say he has a few friends and is picky who he is being vulnerable with.??. Looking back at old malayalam cinema  we used to have stories of rooted characters in fictional settings like the ones Priyadarsan used to do for example. 
    
Take Chitram or Thalavattam. We have the story of a regular malayali dude who is made to go to a new place and the problems he faces there. While the locations of these films reminds us of the geography of places  popularly known, the story is to be enjoyed as taking place in some imaginary terrain.

I have a feeling that our screenwriters today feels this constrain to stay true to the laws of the real world and write a fresh, engaging story at the same time due to this recent realism movement. Limits them from going full fledged with creativity. Movies of Basil Joseph are an exception though. 

Sometimes it's nice to stray away from what's real and let our minds explore, right??.I’m was not able to take my SAT in April because of school closures in Illinois. Anyone else having this problem? If so what are you doing about it?.28 days to go! I did my online check in yesterday! This is my first Disney cruise and I'm beyond excited! 

Anyone else here gonna be on any of the "Disney Magic at sea" cruises?. This has happened to me twice on this sub now. Is this an unpopular opinion? Do people here like that movie or think it's an accurate representation?

Or is Sia lurking on this sub, downvoting everyone who doesn't like her movie?. Delete if not allowed, but I've been trying to get Hoppity for a long time. But they're expensive for me, especially with international shipping (I'm not in the US).

Two weeks ago I found one that was within my price range only for the order to be cancelled days later because apparently "there was a problem with my address"

Then last week I found another from a different seller that was also in my price range, only to find out today it was cancelled because "the item was damaged"

What are the odds that the same item from two different sellers would both be cancelled two weeks in a row? This is so annoying!. Ask me any questions you have about the ship, my thoughts on certain Titanic conspiracy theories ect........(25f) eating has been difficult for me for basically my whole life. It probably started when I was about 2-3, when I would have been old enough to communicate what I did and didn't like about foods.

Some foods that have always been a struggle for me have been mushy things like mashed potatoes, bananas, soft cheeses and cooked vegetables. As well as foods with a strong smell and taste like peanut butter. 

As a child, I was dangerously underweight, while I've made some progress over the years, it's not much. It wasn't just taste and smell though, I physically can't swallow these foods, they make me gag. Like, I'll look at a banana and while I'm well aware that it's food and plenty of people eat them, if I tried to eat one, my brain tells me "this is poison, spit it out"

I also have autism, and I know ARFID and autism can often go hand in hand, so I suspect I might have it. 

I'd like a diagnosis so I can better explain it to people. No, I'm not being childish. No, I won't eat a food I don't like if I'm really hungry. No, I can't just try it. I'm so sick of hearing "just try it, you might like it this time" because that's not how it works. I'm also sick of hearing "how do you know you don't like it if you've never tried it?"

I just want to be able to explain to people that, it's not that I won't eat certain foods, I *can't* eat them. It's exhausting.I think you'd like this story: "When they first met." by HarleenFranis on Wattpad https://www.wattpad.com/story/338729585?utm_source=android&utm_medium=com.reddit.frontpage&utm_content=share_reading&wp_page=reading&wp_uname=HarleenFranis&wp_originator=9N95tV0n3bJKC2Pmw5i7bP3kH8zqFhrZ%2FqV%2B4%2FJdHjfiAMaEzkPoTGiSZMwYoJT0FN8%2FQP0%2FMGhtIRrSNnyS2%2FNjysFSEZ2fROKkG02d4DfswK03HxxtiBIIeejdWZns. https://youtu.be/K6SaNS8dPbM. My first cruise is in November (I'm so excited!) But whenever I try to add prepaid gratuities on the app, it doesn't let me.

Do I have to wait until online check in before I can do that? Or like 30 days before sail date or something?. Does anyone know of any blog/website that has a list of items available at Mickey's mainsail and how much everything costs?

I want to get an idea of prices for my upcoming cruise.I swear every night my covers end up on the floor like they have a mind of their own, I don’t sleep with anyone it’s just me, anyone else find this irritating and amusing?. This is a little support post, if you need to rant or talk to someone, just comment here as you need, if you need advice feel free to ask for it too! After all, help is always given to those who ask at Hogwarts. I know it’s bisexual culture to not pick when given a choice, and I can’t decide between being a boy or a girl, is this bi culture?. I found the owl house like 6 months ago and can’t stop watching it, I’m on my like 6 though binge and just feel so happy watching it!. Hey, just putting this out to start, whatever I decide I am I will always support anyone in this community, so with that being said, I am not sure what I am.

I openly identify as a boy, however I do embrace my more feminine side a lot, most often I feel neither boy or girl, when I start doing things less status quo for every single day I feel more masculine or feminine, take school for example, mainly neutral, but when I am doing heavy thinking like math and engineering more masculine, but things like French and English more feminine. Generally martial arts make me feel masc while participating but fem while teaching, same sort of thing for music. To the point where I act differently enough that people notice (my girlfriend is the one who pointed this all out to me). When I get particularly stressed I feel so feminine that I don’t feel like my body is right and should be that of a girls, heck stress does not always trigger it, sometimes it is just that way (like right now). Quite often I feel like my body is not correct but I don’t know what I want it to be and I am not particularly comfortable with it as it is being underweight and having a bad hip while not being able to improve either and only being 16.

Thoughts please, and thank you 🙏. It happens to me so much now that I don’t want to be me, I want to change to a girl, change every part of my name, and completely cut contact with my parents because then I will not be criticized anymore, it will have been Jeremiah who was criticized not Ellianne, it will have been Jeremiah who was terrified of being beaten (though it’s never happened) not Ellianne, it’l have been Jeremiah who was verbally abused behind his back, not Ellianne. Ellianne will be a perfectly happy girl with a loving girlfriend or boyfriend who supports her is her journey of self discovery as she goes through the process of being tested for autism. 

Though, I am not trans, not right now, but I don’t think it would be a bad thing to cut off my family.Share a cool fact about it too!. For context, I am doing karate and my forms (display of knowledge of a series of presented attacks and defenses back to back) are mechanically and technically perfect (so my instructors claim) but I don’t look like I mean the moves, it’s suggested I make a mean face to show that I mean the moves, how do I do this, I feel like I am not getting it and it does not look right in the mirror. Hi! This is a tea shop! Feel free to info dump about your special interest and have some virtual tea! (Right from the pot, I just took the kettle off). You’re gay 👍. I was just given the weirdest face for grabbing and eating a hotdog from the fridge, I was hungry and there was no point in a plate and utinsils and I did not want condiments, I just wanted a hotdog real quick, am I just weird?. I swear I hear guns from my technology but others say that its not there, and I just strange?. Like I just do this and my parents are getting concerned lol. Personally I was always quieter and told that stuff at a super young age of 6 y/o and I think it has resulted in me expecting to be able to do stuff with little work with the same result and it has not at all helped in high school, and I am expected to at like an adult and do things they do, including drink in my own household, I’m only 16 and don’t like those adult beverages.

Happy birthday Technoblade. Through interactions with multiple communities I have come to realize I have something I’m gonna call hatephobia, I heavily dislike the group of people that hate other groups for things those groups can’t control, such as transphobics, homophobics, hetrophobics (likely exists somewhere), biphobics, lesbaphobics, ace/aro phobics, racists, people who hate neurodivergent people, and so on. I heavily dislike anyone who hates those groups when those people can’t control it, it makes no bloody sense!

Let’s get #hatephobic and #stop-hate trending on social media, it is a real issue for many people and it could bring to light the people who are issues and maybe stop some of the hate that goes around. I could totally see the dry docks being used to build a new ship and maybe players have to fight over weather the capt’n gets the ship or Ramsey gets it both leading to huge tall tales involving the season 8 PvP system paring crews of 8 or so together on their own sea to fight it out on a man o’ war aginst the opposer weather that is the Capt’n or Ramsey, and I think it would be sick to fight on a huge ship with a crew of 8 over the sea. Loose leaf or bagged. My little brother claims it is an anime and I claim it is not, which is right?. How many people wear clothes to sleep at night! What is the normal thing, clothes or no clothes?. When I joined a squeaker’s crew last night I did not realize till I had fully supplied up the ship with my gold and captaincy along with a merchant storage crate. I don’t have a working mic and thus used the text chat, I could hear them but once I heard how rude they were to me, cussing me out and ordering me around I decided to not let them know I could hear them and tell them that I have voice indicators on but didn’t know what they were saying. As they got more and more rude I decided to go and use my storage crate to go and take all the resources on the ship and jumped over the side and just swam, it took them a while to realize what I had done and when they told me to go “f***ing die and go to hell for being such a d**k and a bad player” I told them good luck with their next fight (it just arrived in a circle) and I left the game. What do you do?. I’ll go first

Form: https://forms.gle/2c8HppDKFSjd85Ud8. I am a cellist who has a lot of ideas for fun stuff to put together, however I notice that I have a really hard time putting the actual notes to paper, once I have notes down everything else is super, but writing down the notes really bogs down my production and overall makes it hard for my idea to take shape. is there any music software that can take the note it hears and put it directally into a score?. hello!

I have found stuff that I can use for my CPU but there is nothing I can find for my graphics card, I have an EVGA Geforce 3050 XC, 8GB GDDR6. I was wondering if anybody new of a GPU water block that would work for my GPU or knew a way I could get one custom made.hello, I have been thinking about upgrading my cooling to water cooling.

schoolwork, I however have no easy to transfer files between the two super quick, I was wondering if there was any way I could hook them both up to the same USB storage device or something like it. any ideas?.i was just diagnosed and have been prescribed 500mg valcyclovir daily. i have a boyfriend who says he’s fine with still having unprotected sex as long as i keep up with my meds (but i think i will make him use condoms for quite a while before i’m comfortable enough for that since i’m scared to pass it to him) but i’m wondering when it’s okay to have sex again since its more transmissible when you’re newly diagnosed or experiencing your first OB. i was wondering what the best time frame would be on having protected sex again to avoid transmission?. i’m 3 months in and my locs around my perimeter keep unraveling. is there a way i can crochet them so they stay? i have 2 strand starters. my hair is kind of soft and some of my ends keep unraveling abs i have to retwist them daily. how can i keep them together? im afraid they won’t loc if they keep unraveling. i started working here almost a month ago and ever since i got here this girl has had this weird rude animosity with me. she’s not a manager, but tries to micromanage everything i do and always calls out my mistakes in a rude way even though i’m new and didn’t get a lot of good training (it’s a family business and i was literally trained by a 13 year old) and only gets onto me even if im not the only one making said mistake. just for example, in today’s shift she called me over to tell me to stop putting certain things in the back dishwashing container since they wash them up front. i’m not the only one who does that, and i wasnt trained to do otherwise. the girl who trained me is the one who does the same thing… she also ran up and cut me off while taking customers orders and completely disregarded me being there and told them “don’t give her your order give it to me.” saying it repeatedly with no explanation at first until they asked and then saying “because your drinks are paid for already and i’m the bartender.” okay? either way i already knew the drinks were paid for and was going to tell her the orders. even the customers commented to after she left that it was rude of her to do. also today, i asked a simple question on if she made a certain drink because someone requested the last bartender who made theirs to make it again. she snapped at me and was like “uh yeah and what about it?” i dont know if i did something to her or she doesn’t like the pace i learn at or what but she’s the only coworker that actively doesn’t talk to me at work and is snide and rude to me. i think her boyfriend (or at least someone she likes a lot) works with us and talks to me and jokes with me a lot so i don’t know if thats it or what but she’s hated me since i started and it makes going to work a drag because its like she makes it her point to harass me. she even talks about me for sitting down between tables (after ive done all side work and have nothing to do) and calls me lazy to other employees (they defend me because they know i work well). what can i do?. like things you can’t hide even when masking. for me, i walk slightly too fast than normal, i only half understand jokes and sarcasm, and i can’t go more than maybe 30 seconds without biting or licking my lips. i also do things in the order or way that makes the most sense to me, not the most logical way, so a lot of people look at me sideways and assume im spacey or have no common sense. i’ve been working at this serving job for a few weeks and i already feel a bit alienated like i always do when i work, like everyones in on some type of social inner circle with rules of how to act and m not in it. so i’m already always on edge. my coworkers also always point out my mistakes even though theyre minor like forgetting to put “no tomatoes” on a burger, but everyone else is allowed to make bigger ones like coming to work high and not ringing in $130 worth of food and having people walk out on their tab. i try to socialize and blend in but its hard. then today, i was walking up and heard someone accidentally call a girl with similar name to me by my name. she responded by saying “i’m not ___, im not dumb.” she didn’t know i was standing behind but the coworker she was talking to saw me and just kind of made a “oops” face. i just walked away and had to stop them from seeing me trying not to cry. they also make fun of how i look and how i dont talk unless spoken to so i sit alone a lot and prefer to be by myself. it makes me sad cause i put a lot of effort into my appearance and trying to be a good employee. and its even more weird because they make effort to smile in my face and be fake friendly then go talk shit about me. and the only coworker that treated me normally and i liked is leaving tomorrow so i dont know how im going to last here. i just need any advice for work. this is my 6th job and it never gets easier, always the same thing.boils have run in my family for as long as i can remember. ever since i started shaving i would always get them in my groin and armpit area, or after getting sweaty and not being able to change my clothes immediately after. they would be big and painful and would cause me pain when walking, but i never got them that often. maybe once a month, but never anything too unmanageable. i thought it had to do with shaving so i started shaving a lot less. i had some so bad after shaving my pubic area that i didn’t shave again for a month and a half to let them all go down and it took a few weeks. a week ago i shaved and used a different deodorant than usual and woke up the next day with painful lumps under both arms. my left armpit was the worst, i had at least 4 or 5 painful lumps, one was huge and a bunch of slightly smaller ones around it. i haven’t been able to do much with them since they hurt so much and it even hurt to put my arms down. they slowly started to go down on their own though and now i have one under each arm left, a bit bigger than a pea. i was just wondering if this sounds like hs?. ive been taking a really hard class with an even tougher teacher, and according to the grading scale on the syllabus i shouldve finished with around a 76. to my surprise when she posted grades (a week late by the way,) i had received a D in the class. this dropped my gpa tremendously since the class was worth 3 credits and is required for my major. when i called her and asked about it she said she graded according to the syllabus, and on there nothing is weighted, tests are worth 150 points, lab is worth 50 points and assignments are worth 400. i accumulated at least 455/600 points and this is without any of the extra credit that i did being in the calculations. i calculated my grade multiple times and even the grade on blackboard was a B (i expected this to drop though). when i called her again, she basically said “well you did badly on the tests are theyre worth 50% of your grade and blackboard does not properly reflect your grade since work is missing” without saying it. this shocked me because the whole year she stressed to not worry if you do bad on tests and to make it up with extra credit and doing all assignments since they are worth less than everything else. i cant even see all of my assignment grades since she never put them in during the year and still hasnt put all in now. i have a meeting with her on wednesday, but what can i do? i really dont want to retake this class and it is jeopardizing my scholarship. i have all As other than this.my sm texted me out of the blue and said she’s training me to to be a barista trainer tomorrow and i’m freaking out about it because i’ve only been working for starbucks for a few months and wouldn’t even consider myself good enough of a partner to train anyone. i didn’t even get trained that thoroughly, and there are still things i dont know. i’m scared that i’ll disappoint my sm or make a group of bad baristas. any tips or advice?. i just hacked my vita with hencore then downgraded from 3.73 to 3.60. it booted up just fine and the settings say 3.60 but theres no longer henkaku settings in my settings area and every time i try to open hencore to download enso, the screen flashes then goes completely black and shuts off the vita. every time i try to use hencore on my computer to reconnect and try again it says i have to update my vita. should i update it then start all over again? is there any way to fix this?. ive always wondered if its just me who gets immensely annoyed at the smallest things. for me, my biggest ones are when people turn the bag holder while im in the middle of putting stuff in the bags, when people put their entire hand basket on the conveyor belt without taking the things out first, and when people wait until the end of a transaction to mention they have a tax exempt card. also i i get really agitated if people ask me how i am lol. got put on prozac which didnt help my frequent rage outbursts so i got switched to risperdal which has a slew of problems (most notably weight gain and lactation) and doesn’t even really help my anger. have any meds worked for you guys?. i successfully downgraded my vita from 3.73 to 3.60, but now when i try to launch h-encore the screen flashes and goes black and wont let me reinstall henkaku. im forced to restart it every time and it still doesnt work. this is the tutorial im following:


https://youtu.be/DAiFqePflLs

im not sure what to do next or to fix this? its my first time doing any modding with a vita. just bought a japanese ps vita slim 2000 so i could jailbreak it. im new to all this homebrewing stuff so im kind of scared to brick the device. to my understanding i mod the vita with henkaku first, then downgrade to 3.60 using modoru 2.1 so i can get 3.60 enso after modding it again, then install my sd2vita? and after all of that, i should be all set to get games right?. i used these last few days before the attendance policy goes back to normal to call out for my shift today since my dog got surgery and has very bad separation anxiety so i want to be with her to comfort her and make sure she doesnt bite at her wounds. i like working at least four days a week though, so can i just come in on a day that i’m not scheduled to make up for that lost time or is it different now with the policy change? i’d ask my manager tomorrow if i could come in friday as well since i usually work monday-thursday. i’m also wondering how to avoid a point with that whole situation since i believe you can get one if you clock out at the wrong time or something? i usually never call out or miss work and have a pretty rigid schedule i stick to so i’m kind of confused on what to do.i have anxiety, major depression, and bpd with bipolar tendencies so when i have bad days it can make it extremely hard to do my job. i cry like every other week and often have trouble connecting with customers. i got reprimanded by my boss for coming off as rude to customers today when that’s definitely not my intent. it made me feel like shit and i cried about it for three hours. i dont want to use my mental illness as an excuse, or get treated differently, i just want to let my manager know im trying my best and that more than likely, there’s a reason for my behavior. should i tell her this? she’s been really hard on me these past few weeks and is one of the reasons i cried on dto on my last morning shift because she was getting angry and being pretty mean which was making me feel really overwhelmed.im a high school senior and have to be off of work thursday for a school event that was only JUST told to me since school is so hectic with covid 19 right now. i told my manager and she told me to just call out, won’t this give me a point? or am i fine?. i start tomorrow btw. i specifically told my manager the other week that i cant work friday-sunday because i have two jobs and those are the only days that i can work for them. she said okay and told me she’d put my true availability in the system. i get my schedule back and im scheduled for saturday and sunday?? i cant work for them then because i already had shifts assigned at my other job. its like they dont WANT to cooperate with me on this. i had already told them i had another job when they hired me and they straight up told me to quit it for them. and its not like they arent able to change my schedule because i wasnt in the system for the while due to me being a minor so they were writing my schedules. theyd rather i quit my other job than work with me and my schedule. i dont know what to do or who to talk to about this? the people lead is the one that assigned my shifts but shes literally never at the store and i cant get into contact with her. i dont know what to do because im scheduled tomorrow but its impossible for me to come in because ill be at my other job??. im a health ambassador and usually do cashiering for half of my shift. its pretty easy but i have trouble with bagging. its pretty self explanatory but when customers dont necessarily group similar items together i get confused and its like. i dont want to have to put the draino in the same bag as the fresh fruit?? any tips?. im 17 and just started working at walmart today as a health ambassador. im not even in the system so i cant clock in, then i got NO training at all on what to do (ik its straight forward with the masks but they didnt tell me about stuff like breaks or switching with people etc,) i was on my feet for almost 5 hours with one break then when i tried to leave my post at 3 to clock out bc the next shift worker came in then i got yelled at by some random employee for leaving my station unattended when it was unattended when i got there so how was i supposed to know to stay there????? then my coworkers were acting like i was some huge inconvenience and talking about me like if you trained me i’d be better at my job... even my orientation was just an hour i didnt do any cbls or anything. i also have no idea when i work other than word of mouth bc i havent been introduced to any kind of schedule, and no ones taken my direct deposit info???? i got called back about the job yesterday, had orientation yesterday, and started today. its all just so fast with little to no training or guidance but everyone expects me to know what to do. my family recently rescued a 4 month old chihuahua/dachshund puppy who was abandoned in the street. we have started to try to potty train her using a crate which is new for us because we never really used crates for our older dogs since they were mostly trained when we got them. she was doing relatively well holding her bladder through the night then going outside in the morning until we tried to crate her when we leave the house. we gave her treats, toys, things to chew etc but every time we put her in her crate she would whine and bark, try to chew through the bars to the point of her almost pulling a tooth out by biting at the wire, destroy her bedding by digging through it, shake and drool incessantly, and pee in it. she won’t stay inside long enough to be able to have to use the bathroom again because she hurts herself trying to get out so we have to put her in the bathroom with a puppy pad until we come back. even then she tries to scratch and bite at the wood in the door and dig at the ground to get out. at night, she won’t even sleep across the room away from us and ignores her own bed. even when we’re in the same room with her, she still tries to bite and dig out of her cage, but it gets much worse when we leave. what can we do?.I'm in late secondary school, so me and my classmates are older teens. I've being open about being aro ace, as well as agender for around 2 years now. My friend group are all queer(one pansexual bigender, one pansexual enby and a bisexual genderfluid).

In my friend group most of them are nerotypical, although theirs one other with adhd. While I myself have a diagnosis of adhd and two specified learning disabilities. I'm also currently awaiting an autism assessment, as I am rather likely autistic as well as having family history(my sibling, my dad, my grandfather to name a few).

I find alot of my Intrests revolve around nerodivergences and lgbtqia+ topics. While internally I tend to be thinking of them constantly, I make an effort to not mention them much in conversations unless persificly brought up. Tho because I find socialising and social cues difficult it's hard to figure out how appropriate it is to talk about my interests or my identity.

A bit more context is I've been out of school for a week and a half after catching a nasty cold.

This is where the other aro ace comes in. So one boy in my class, for the sake or this I'll call "fred", has autism, or as he refers to it "aspergers". Fred is the sweetest kid, very caring and considerate, although he tends to talk about the same topics over and over again, something I don't have a problem with as I'm guilty of it myself, but something that can seen unusual. Another thing about Fred is he is aro ace, something I hadn't known.

This week in science, they were recovering the reproductive systems.

Today I was on WhatsApp with my three friends, and two of them(both the nerotypicals) started complaining about how Fred was talking alot about being aro ace(now I wasn't their so idk if their exaggerating or not, but he's not close to them so it's not like they talk to him much), and how he had said to the science teacher the topic was uncomfortable for him because he's aro ace. They also said he'd expressed not knowing how to answer a question in English that was to do with romance between to characters in a novel. The two of them said it was really annoying.

From what they describe it really sounds like Fred recently found out this part of him and is excited to talk about it, and mabye dosent know when is and isn't an appropriate time to do so. 

Now I'm Scared they feel the same resentment towards me as they do to him. I wonder if they hate me. I'm really uncomfortable with sexual and romantic topics, but mostly because I had traumatic events happen to me, and mention of it often brings back memories or flashbacks, I sometimes request they stop discussing such topics if they come up while im with them and its getting two much for me, and I'm scared they see me as annoying for doing such.  I wonder if I'm over reacting or being over sensitive, mabye their right. I'm just very confused now.I'm in late secondary school, so me and my classmates are older teens.

I've been playing from the start of the farm(well chapt 2 since you can't join earlier). Thing is, I've been focusing on farm stuff, growing veg and trees, breading flowers, farm animals, selling and other stuff like that, and player 1 was doing all the mining, dating and quest type stuff. We are now end game, and have finished all story progression quests, etc. Now I really want to unlock Outfits, so need to do job quests, but I don't seem to have unlocked them as they arent available under any npc, so I'm wondering if their are requirements to unlock them, if so what are they?. I have adhd, dyspraxia, dysgraphia and dyslexia, as well as highly suspecting and getting tested for autism.
My learning disabilities are all moderate to servre.

I have a really big obsession with nerodivergences, especially dyspraxia and autism.

For those that don't know, this week, is dyspraxia awareness week, and I being really into dyspraxia made an oray of colourful and well researched posters with a variety of information, as well as a PowerPoint. I tried my best at removing all the typos, misspellings, grammar mistakes, etc.

I had spent the whole weekend working on them, I straight up didn't sleep at all last night as I was to hyper focused on my mission.

Today I brought them in showed one head of the autism spectrum classes(a fellow dyspraxic) and she really liked them but said she'd have to prove read them before putting them up. I'll call her Annie.

The next class I was supposed to have a 1 on 1 class with one of my favourite teachers, but he wasn't in, and instead I had one of my least favourite teachers,  I'll call ava, covered this class, so I was alone with this teacher in they art room(she's an art teacher) and the vice principal, I'll call fraya walked in, she walked over to the ava and they had a conversation, then just when I thought Freya was leaving she didn't, and she started looking at the posters. Ava looked at them too.

They both started saying that the spelling was to bad to use them(Bullshit that their weren't more than 3 to 4 small mistakes on each, but fully legible). They insisted I have to use voice to text to correct it. Ava was the worst and directly said that she couldn't read and said it was because she's not dyslexic.

I started crying for the next two and tried to tell Annie what happened but she was incredibly unhelpful and talking over me any time a tried explain.

How having Comorbidites affects things 


Thank you to anyone who can give their experience=). I love SpinningPlumbobs occult mods. I'm looking for any occult mods or cc recommendations, especially mods adding in occult. I want a geenie one but I can't find any that aren't out of date, so if anyone has one that'd be awesome.

I have all the occult game packs and all the expansion packs(occult adding and not occult adding), I have most of the expansions over all except kits. This is just for context since alot of occult mods require other packs.I'm a minor, and am stuck at home for another 3ish years. I have rather long hair down to my butt. Thing about it is its really difficult for me to manage, and it's always in huge knots and I'm forced to spend hours painfully detangling it strand by stand using around €15 of product, this occurs every 2-4 weeks. I have multiple nerodivergences that lead to the neglecting of my hair, as I've poor fine and gross motor skills, so initially I'll try brushing it every day but by the 2nd or 3rd day it gets too many knots because I failed to brush it out fully, then my struggles with executive function kick in and I just completely stop trying to brush it for days.

My moms death was 3ish years age now, and during her last few months she was in
hospital, she had used to do my hair, so while   in she had asked my school to help me with my hair, they did, and they continued to for 2 years, far after, her death I am greatful for that, although this year they no longer help understandable but its still a huge issue for me.

I've been wanting to cut my hair short for 3 years, I know it would be the best for me in my situation, but my dad has stayed firmly against it, that confused me as my older sibling got to do what they want with their since they were 3 or 4 years younger than I am know. My dad reason was he liked my hair long.

Today My sibling pressed him again about letting me cut my hair, I had been outside the room and could hear the conversation. My sibling had first just asked and then they ask if grew out the their hair could I cut mine, so he would still have a kid with long hair. This was when he realised that he was letting me cut my hair because he wants me to look as like mom as possible and mom had long hair.

This broke me. My sibling has genetics of a pritty even mix of our mom and dad, but I have much more, especially physical, characteristics of our mom. I've always struggled with this, my mom was one of the most amazing people, she was intelligent, diligent and incredibly kind. She was an amazing leader, she was a manager in a large teach community, and many of her staff quit after her death because they wanted to work to work for her not the company, even the person she thought hated her cried finding out of her death. My mom was an incredible person, and that's why I hate being compared to her, I'm not her and ill never be as incredible as her. I have spent my life being told how I look just like and how we act so similar, and I hate it not because I'm not her and trying to be her is an impossible goal.

Knowing my dad seeing me as just a second mom is just really uncomfortable, I'm not her. I've noticed how he calls me beautiful before my name/nickname, but dosent do the same to my sibling, I wonder if that is liked to him see me as my mom. Idk mabye I'm over reacting but this makes me really uncomfortable.As the title says.Hi, I'm a filp, I used to mainly age regress(this was before I knew the term), but now I'm mainly a caregiver with some behaviour that I can't tell if it age regression or age dreaming.

Now the thing is me and the little in question recently discovered this community and join a age regression server on discord. While we've fit the description of age regression and caregiver, we still don't know alot of the terms.

The little in question is cool with me saying my little, but I wanted to check that that language isn't considered offensive or anything before I use it on the server. 

That's for reading! =). The premises was the grumpy old blind man mets bright sweet young girl, she ended up working as house cleaner for the old man, as she was saving up for a prom dress.
The old man overhears and finds out girls dad has cancer. The girl and man grow close as good friends. One day the old man discovers that the little girl had been leaving sticky notes all over his home. He lashes out the girl and she leaves. The man the finds out it was actually the girl who had cancer and left to under go further treatment. I know at this point the blind man ended up do a painting blind and it was revealed he was an artist before he became blind.

It was on netflix(ireland) most likely at least it was the roughly 4 or 5 years ago. Is their an existing one? Or does any mod include this? Could it be made?

And does anyone know some good mods that at new skills(as a part of or as the full mod)?

Thanks to anyone who reads or helps.At least I think we're considered it.What the title says.

Thank you if anyone can help!. It's interesting because it is classified as a neurological condition(to my knowledge), as it is one, but alot of the Traits of it feel more "physical". It feels like it almost toes the line between being mental and physical. I know theirs nothing physical about our bodies necessary(tho alot of us seem to have joints or muscle tissue conditions) but  dyspraxia effects how we physically use are body. Unlike say adhd or dyslexia where the condition are normally causing mostly mental difficulties we seem to be given mental and physical difficulties. I think also interesting that every day disability accommodations like handicap parking spaces and disability reserved bus seats, would/could be useful for some of us, although I still don't know if it's ethical(ive never done so personally), but stuff like that were we're able to save stamina(and a good portion of us have fatigue so that can be a help), by being closer to out destination we also make the opportunity to fall less and less time to drop stuff, the parks are also often bigger those it would make parking easier for any of the few of us who drive and the seat on the bus can be helpful and there are know regular ones available as standing and holding onto a bar is hard for some of us who have bad balence or struggle gripping for along time. I don't really have a point to this posy but I guess it's just weird how physical of a condition dyspraxia is considering it's not a physical it is. Is there places that treat the same as a physical disability? And do you guys think it should have more every day accommodations for the the physical side?(besides an ot) also dyspraxia is a completely a confusing spectrum and it's not linear, the condition affects everyone different and uniquely, some people  can find their dyspraxia as much more a mental condition other it's very much a physical thing, it's diffrent for everyone.I feel like I'm always losing and regaining skills. Sometimes I know how to do something and then the next day no clue. A big one is sueing, Sometimes I'm great at it the next day I just can't, I just will have know idea what I'm doing. I do it with other skills like writing, singing, jumping, reading and pritty much any skill. It's really annoying. I'm guessing it's a mussel memory issue but idk.I initiated the diagnosis process over a year ago, after years of researching/ suspecting adhd(particularly combind or inattentive). It's been pritty smooth just slow as heck.

So my sna(support teacher for students with additional needs), dad and I did all the questionnaire forms months ago, then at the beginning of June I was given a date for a qb test wich would be the 30th of June.

I then in the lead up to the qb test asked a therapist I go to about the test and when I'd receive results. She said that from what she knows about it I should be able to get the verbal results right afterwards but she wasn't sure when the document with the diagnosis/results will be given/sent to me. She dosent work with the facilities I was trying to get diagnosed at(Lucena).

So I did the the qb test as expected of on the 30th, but to my surprise it turns out the specialist who would need to look at the results to see if I have adhd or not are on holiday=(

It's kinda really ironic considering how people with ad(h)d are famously not great at patients. I just want to be told the results, I know I am capable of waiting but it's stressful being uncertain about this. I was told I'd be around 3-4 weeks from the appointment, so I still have two weeks of per uncertainty. 

I fit the criteria and have written paragraphs about how each trait applies to me, but I feel this means nothing, because their could always be conformation bias and shit. Not to mention that I'm diagnosed dyspraxic and dyspraxia and adhd have so many Traits that over lap, see the concentration/focusing issues are secondary dyspraxia characteristics and primary adhd ones, the memory issues are primary characteristics for both(if im not mistaking), then the primary dyspraxia Traits like cordination and moter skills issues are common for people with ad(h)d. So it's just complicated.

I'm just nervous because I feel the qb test is probably inaccurate for because I was overthinking it the whole time and I felt like I was being to intentional with my movements it was really overwhelming. It was also just difficult aswell because my dyspraxia made it harder as I kept messing it up by pressing the button later or earlier than intended or just not processing the screen quickly enough. I also know statistically ad(h)d tests are less accurate for people with inattentive adhd and asi said I likey fit in inattentive or combind type. So I'm just confused.

Idk I just wanted get this off my chest.So I was at pride with one of my best friends and we went to a supermac afterwards. We went to find a table while his mom finished ordering the food. He wanted to at the high table with the high spiny circular chairs, I asked if he didn't mind sitting on normal chairs, he asked why and I explained I wasn't sure if I could manage theese chairs, but then I could see he was disappointed so I decided to try it. I failed dramatically, I over balance and and fell into another chair hitting my leg. He was like, you know it's fine we can sit at a different table. I tried like to more times and still failed, and agreed a different table would be safer. Thank goodness cus I don't think I'd of survived thoose seats. We did try a shorter one but the no set back and spiny-Ness wasn't working out so we relented to sit at a booth. I spent a good chunk of the meal laughing and apologising. He know I'm a dyspraxic mother fucker and he completely understood, but I still felt bad.So I have diagnosed dyspraxia and dyslexia. I'm also being assessed for adhd at the end of the month and I'm also in the process for and autism diagnosis.


(The list below would be all my writing difficulties not just the ones that resemble dysgraphia)
I've always struggled with writing, my writing was and is really inconsistent, I do stuff like writing my letters in all different sizes, not being able to write on the line, not capitalising letters appropriately to the sentence, not punctuating my sentences, writing the letters in the word in the wrong order, not using spaces(backfired awfully one time during a test where I wrote IN PEN, "where the pen is" but forgot the space between pen and is, only noticed when I was looking back over the test and their was no room to fix it 😥), atrocious spelling, ridiculously slow writing and rather low over all writing stamina plus hand pain, writing the same word or two an extra time(for example "he walked backwards into the forest" would end up like "he walked backwards into the into the forest"), accidentally merging or finishing the word with the wrong ending, forgetting how to right letters/numbers, writing letters/numbers i know well extremely incorrectly, mixing up letters while writing(i nearly always writing e when i wont to write a), writing the wrong word(like our instead of are), etc.
A big difficulty for me is just writing as fast as I think.

Side note from a genetic point of veiw, my sibling may also have dysgraphia but not with dyslexia and I don't know where or not they have dyspraxia. They also have diagnosed autism and they may have adhd. My dyslexia is from my mom, and my dad is probably where the adhd and autism came from, although I don't know if any of my family above me in the family tree has dysgraphic Traits tho. Its not impossible but I don't see them in my mom, I somewhat see them in my dad(but it dosent seem particularly likely), and then I don't know my grand parents or aunts well enough to say.

I feel like I could explain the Traits above with 
My dyslexia x dyspraxia combo but at the same time I feel dysgraphia would also explain quite a few of the ones I put down to dyspraxia better than dyspraxia does. I've researched all 3 above a good lot. 
I guess the question is would persuning a diagnosis do anything, I am still in school but I can't imagine a diagnosis gives me more than conformations, since even if their are accommodations I would qualify for I probably could get them anyway with my current diagnoses. 

I guess I want know A. Does my experience even sound like one of a dysgraphic?(clarification not asking if it is definitely or 
"to be diagnosed" all I'm ask is if it sounds like any ones experience or if I managed to misunderstand how the condition works)
and B. Would being diagnosed do anything for me besides giving me confirmation?. Sorry rather long post 😣😣😣

Hi, I have diagnosed dyspraxia as well as dyslexia. I also present alot of asd and adhd Traits and am in diagnosis process.

I've come, mostly In recent time, to the realisation I have issues around speech, and they cause people to struggle to understand me.

One piece of context to get out the way is my accent alone is likely Communication barrier. My parents are african(south african and Zimbabwean), but moved to Ireland before I was born. I've grown up and been raised in Ireland, but my parents accents are strong and I while I went to a local creche(day care), I also spent alot of time with my dad, thanks to that I officially have a fucked up accent=)
/J, It's not the worst but it just dosent sound Irish, or south african for that matter. It also means alot of Irish people just don't understand me despite me living here all my life! 😤

But my actual speech issue are the following 

1. I struggle to string sentences together even after planning it out in my head. This issue is rather inconsistent it often is significantly more prevalent when I'm trying to be intentional with my words.

2. I speak at incredibly varying speeds, many way too fast, even if asked to slow down I may find myself unable to.

3. I struggle immensely to control my volume and will change volume frequency while speaking, by extention how high or deep of a pitch I speak in.

4. Inconsistent usageged of words, or basically synonyms(or even just words I associate with the initial word) interchangeably in the same sentence unintentionally(causes unintentional confusion). Example using runner and than trainer or say using pen and then pencil.

5. Miss ordering sentences, saying something like "enjoy the dog, hope you get to adopt the new summer" instead of "enjoy the summer, hope you get to adopt the new dog"

6. Saying the opposite of what I mean, like saying, "can you load the dishwasher" instead of you "can you empty the dishwasher".

7. Frequency Mispronouncing and/
 changing how I prononce words i already know

8. Inconsistent/occasional stuttering

9. Often just not being able to put my needs in to words, and taking long pauses(easily 10 minets sometimes) to just vaguely find them.

10. Genral difficulties wording things in understandable way and explaining things I know mentally how to explain. Struggles with coherence.

11. Bad control over tone, often coming off with an inappropriately high or low amount of emotion.

12. Occasional unintentionally slurring words, not drunk or high or anything like that


I'm pritty sure dyspraxia can be a cause of speech difficulties, although I don't know if this is part of it or if it's my dyslexia or why if happens.

For the most part I can communicate what I'm trying to say if I'm at my best(not overwhelmed or anything). Although I'd still say it's an issue for me as it's can be very distressing when  people dont understand me wich dose happen alot daily even just at home, I can't stand repeating myself and it in extreme cases causes me to be completely unable to talk for hours to days, On the milder end of things it will just heavily frustrat me making my move vulnerable to shut down later on.

I'm thinking that I might benefit form some sort of speech therapy, although mabye it's not worth it as I'm already a teenager not a child or toddler, although my dad said he'd be willing to set it up if I think I need too go. Is their a point in going at my age or is it too late. Is above even enough to call it an issue.I saw a study of Nuedexta helping autistic adults, and thought of how dextromethorphan helped me be a lot better in different situations.Like could we have a portable IV drip of cocaine just strapped onto our torso dripping into one of our legs veins?. I feel like my safe foods aren’t all that healthy but otherwise I’d probably lose a lot of weight. How do you get all your nutrients?. Ever seen those guys on youtube who magnet fish? Just go to a lake with a buddy and say you’re magnet fishing and call the cops on the gun. Of course that shit can’t be registered to you. But this is a 10/10 pro way of tricking the feds. Say you were magnet fishing. Of course the gun can’t be registered to you. And you found it while magnet fishing on the side of the road. Saw those youtube guys 10/10 pro tip. There was this autistic guy at the grocery store I worked at when I was 18. He’s always begged me to get him weed since he wasn’t all that social with other people. I’m autistic(he’s not as functioning) and it helps me so I understood. Then he begs me for shrooms. I figured we’d have a good time and bond with each other & talk about some interesting shit. Dude started speaking in tongues so I waited for him to sober up and dropped him home. He told me it was a total mind fuck and couldn’t work the next day. I saw him the day after. Apparently he started doing stuff on his own and ordered off the internet. One time we’re driving in a woods trail and I told him I was on acid. I was used to driving on acid to the point I drove better when I was off a couple tabs. So since I was driving and he begged me to try it, I let him have a couple tabs. Dude had a full on psychotic break. Took off all his clothes. I had to give him a Xanax because he kept saying “the sky is melting” like he just formed Tourette’s syndrome. Drove him home because the Xanax was strong(it was flu-alprazolam) And I never heard from him again, he never came to work again.A lot of meditation on mushrooms make me feel like I was mentally dead  and saw visuals I can only describe as close to the 10,000 Days album cover by TOOL. I am the type that never gets visuals on mushrooms unless a lot of breath work. The one time was only a couple small golden teachers. I know our body’s naturally produce it. Another time I took 10 grams of mushrooms when I was 18 and my saw my entire life and felt like I relived an entire 18 years. It felt like forever and my friends said I was out for 15 minutes. I’ve only smoked DMT once and it felt exactly like times I didn’t smoke it.I’m non stop sweating, fast heart rate, feel light headed when standing up, extremely weak, short of breath, my head feels heavy. The definition of paranoia is:
“unjustified suspicion and mistrust of other people or their actions”
What we experience with cannabis is more awareness and possible over analyzing. Us thinking that weed making us paranoid stems from old propaganda on cannabis most likely from people who haven’t used it. And people who think they’re paranoid on weed don’t know the actual definition of paranoia and need to learn how to sit with their own thoughts.If someone drinks 2-3 glasses of wine to fall asleep every night, is there risk for alcohol dependence?. Recently when I vape my ears feel cold. Why am I less inclined to have sex or masturbate on Ritalin vs wanting sex on Adderrall? I like methylphenidate and it’s analogues like 4f-Mph for this reason. I’m super productive without the thought of sex which can be a huge distraction.Weed and mushrooms really help me and I have to use large amount of THC to help my sleep/nightmares/appetite. What’s your job? I was spending 5-600 a month on weed, 4f-mph and mushrooms to keep me where I wanted to be which I thought was insane. A message of hope for those who chose to hear it. And a warning for those who do not.If you’re new to the community, introduce yourself, and your individual plan to overthrow the allistics!. This thread is for all ideas to overthrow the Allistics. r/evilautism. I will be feeding our soldiers LSD, horse grade ketamine, & AK47’s to defeat the allistics. The army uniform will consist of being fully nude. With our dick’s swinging, nobody will see us coming with a guerrilla warfare style attack.There’s the extreme male brain theory. Testosterone high in youth development and womb with autistics… I had erections as early as 5 and uncomfortable ones for my age at 7 years old. I’m very interested in this topic for finding more reason as to why there is gender dysphoria and better understanding of my autistic diagnosis.The one drug they had me on was a thienobenzodiazepine because in 1990-91 when they were investigating thiophene isoteres on one of the phenyl rings of clozapine(antipsychotic), the thienobenzodiazepine analogue Olanzapine was found. Besides the dopamine induced parkinsonism, I get shakes from these drugs because they’re still hitting gaba subunits just like any other direct benzodiazepine. The side effects last longer than anything like Xanax because they’re multi target CNS drugs. It targets the 5HT2A(and many others) receptor and in this way it can down regulate Oxytocin and for autistics oxytocin is extremely important as per Temple Grandin studies.  When the 5HT2A is stimulated it almost makes a new couple receptor ring in the brain which dimerizes the receptor and stimulates oxytocin release and greatly reduces autistic overstimulation. This is why I love psychedelics so much but the antipsychotics ruined this greatly. I wonder why I haven’t been spiritually aligned like I was at 17(psychiatric hospitalization), and that’s because these drugs also calcify the pineal gland. Luke 11:34 says Your eye provides a lamp for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light. In Eastern culture, these people are out with Shamans because they’re believed to be filled with prophesy, but in America everyone lives in a dualistic world and are put in mental wards like myself because they found God within themselves. I am not God, but God is everything, to even say I am a God like Kanye West is part of a closure from ego dominating pathology. That is why Steve Jobs had to go to India before he made the Apple 2, because there’s no room for modern Buddha’s in America. The fast paced capitalistic society has no time to understand the concepts of Oneness and divided itself from the true mystical teachings of Jesus Christ, Oneness. This is a better understanding of where I am spiritually, but where is it written that primates are supposed to be carrying around true models of the cosmos in their head? The “I” is still a part of the ego dominator pathology to demand closure out of everything, when there is no closure, when you have to sit with the messiness of the mystery. That’s where I find peace.I do morning glory seeds a few times a year and it’s perfect. Mix a shit ton of seeds in some yogurt. I’m smiling all day at work. I love LSA ❤️❤️❤️ The best psychedelic to occasionally use if you know it’s gonna be a rough day at work. It’s pretty stoney too, super relaxed as where mushrooms and LSD have me go in Gorilla mode. Sometimes I’ll take it at night with something like Valerian root and have the craziest dreams. I never get nauseous from them. I used to chew them like sunflower seeds when I was 18.I experienced a lot of hate, but when I came out while working at a store, all the girls who were mean to me that I knew from middle/high school, all wanted to be my friend. It just felt super fake. This is a genuine feeling of mine(gender dysphoria), and not something I’m trying to bring attention towards. All of a sudden they only wanted to talk about my transition, but not get to know any other aspects of myself or the hobbies I enjoy.I can't stand the texture of toothpaste or the taste of mint. there's plenty of non-mint toothpaste, and plenty of minty alternatives to paste, but I can't find anything that's both?? this plus executive dysfunction = I barely brush my teeth anymore, and if I do it's just with water. my breath probably stinks and my dentist keeps going on at me for not doing enough. it's exhausting. I don't know what to do.so I created an OpenAi account last month, and paid money into it. I recently cancelled the payment plan because I wanted to know how that worked, if they would refund me, etc, but now it says my whole account is dead? it keeps showing me error messages and not letting me access it, but if I try to create a new account it says there's already one with that phone number. help??.The first 20 years of my life have been robbed from me.   


I've always loved science, and as a child I was quite good at it. But trauma after trauma, it became harder and harder to think. Nobody supported me, but everyone was disappointed that I wasn't the prodigy I was supposed to be. My grades fell. I used to compete in it, now I barely pass math. My heart aches when I think about it. My brain is just... fried. I'm a scientist at heart, with a brain too fried.  


The worse my life became, the more I ran off to fiction and art. In a few months I'll be going to art school, the main reason being... My grades are too bad and my brain is too fried to enjoy science right now, and art is healing my soul.   


My question is... do you guys think I'm doomed? I've missed the period in life when scientists build their career in the first place. And when I'm independent and making money... will I even have time to do science? Have I missed my shot?  


My heart aches whenever I see people my age enjoying science without me

&#x200B;. Neverovatno mi je koliko malo informacija ima online o ovom smeru. Od prilike samo ima ono što su okačili na sajtu same akademije. Ide li neko odavde tamo? Kako je izgledao prijemni? Utisci, kritike?. It genuinely baffles me. Neurotypicals have so many pointless rules that make no sense. But when I tell a neurotypical to use headphones please, I get a weird look? 

It makes no sense. Doesn't everyone hate listening to other people's Tiktok? Why is it acceptable to watch Tiktok out loud?. I wonder where the people who were emo kids in like 2015 are hanging out now. The ones who listened to mcr, ptv, bvb, patd and such, with side swept bangs and skinny jeans. Is that community truly dead?. Hello everyone. It has come to my attention that wearing deodorant and perfume of two different smells is apparently a bad thing. My whole childhood I've been bullied for smelling bad with no way to know if I fixed it, and now that I'm an adult no one is willing to tell me if I smell. I've been obsessively taking care of my smell ever since I was a child and it's exhausting because I have no idea if I'm succeeding or not. And now I find out that mixing scents smells bad apparently. How do you guys ensure you smell good, or at least not bad?. I'm pretty sure I remember seeing on here that Starset did a survey on their fans and concluded that some ridiculous percentage of the fans self-identifies as a nerd, but I can't find it anywhere. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?. The day I've been counting down to is finally coming. After a 9 year countdown, I only have 2.5 months left. I finally get legal rights. 

I've been so sheltered all these years that even though I'm getting rights, I still feel like I don't know what I can or cannot do. I want to do something I would've never even imagined doing as a minor on my birthday. I want to mark the day. I've been waiting so long, I don't want to spend it sad and alone like I usually spend my birthdays. 

Last year my mom ruined my birthday by putting spying apps on my devices (some of you might even remember me, I posted about it). But this birthday is MINE AND MINE ALONE!!!!. Hello everyone!  


I have read a lot of BL throughout the years, and found some that I like. When you find one, you tend to find similar ones. This never happened to me with GL. I have never read a GL that I enjoyed so much to find similar ones  


I really enjoyed Heartstopper (the comic), Aristotle and Dante discover the secrets of the universe (both books), Doukyuusei (the whole manga, not just the movie), Yuri on Ice..... You get the vibe. Just regular, lovable people forming a relationship and discovering themselves.  


Anything will do, though I love comics, games, anime and books the most. Please tell me why you're recommending what you're recommending, I get easily overwhelmed with too many titles \^\^'. I'm trying to write a brute force matcher from scratch. My code finds way less matches than opencv's. I calculate distance using numpy.linalg.norm(descriptor1 - descriptor2). Is that right? It's the only thing that comes to mind that could be wrong. The whole idea was that the ridiculous character traits they have aren't actually real, and that Ritsu and Ruko only said that in interviews because they got ridiculous questions from people who don't know how being trans works. I specifically remember Ritsu saying the line "yeah my tits are missiles". The comic where Yokune Ruko and Namine Ritsu are just regular trans people trolling interviewers by saying ridiculous shit. Like "yeah my tits are missiles". I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE. Unfortunately you must socialize to find friends. The problem is that I can't TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm tired of being side eyed, bullied, and generally disliked, because everyone finds me weird!!! And I know it's that and not something else because I overheard people talking about me. When I mask, I'm exhausted, and only find fake friends. When I don't mask, I just get hurt. But I really want friends. I try my best to put myself out there, but I HATE it!!! Some days I just wanna be a hikikomori!!!!!!! I will die from yearning for an emotional bond!!!!!!!. Sama učim programiranje i malo sam zapela. Ne znam šta sledeće da učim da bih našla posao. Znam algoritme i znam oop u visual studiju (C#), ali ne znam kako to da unovčim, i koji je sledeći korak u učenju, šta da radim da bih bila jedan korak bliže poslu. Ako bi mogao neki stariji programer da me usmeri, bilo bi odlično :-). Honestly, I'm just not gonna come out. I keep seeing people coming out to their families even though they know they won't be supported and I don't see why I should do the same. I'll move across the continent and who cares. It gives me more peace of mind to be the girl who never found a husband, than to have the whole family preach their opinions about my gayness to me for the rest of my life. No thank you.Usually when I order an ice coffee I just get a coffee with some ice in it.

I'm looking for those fancy dessert ice coffees, with chocolate syrup, whip cream, cookies and stuff like that, or just a regular ice coffee if it's really yum. Can I manually install optifine?. The book, not the comic. Shipping from the US is ridiculously expensive. Has anyone else noticed this?

Whenever I dare mention I'm autistic, I immediately get a million opinions from clearly uneducated allistic people, about self diagnosis or tiktok trends or whatever the fuck..... And I never even mentioned those things. 

Why do they care so much about gatekeeping a community they're not even a part of?. Has anyone else noticed this?  


They're all like half a bpm off. I'm struggling to find an instrumental that doesn't have backing vocals but is the right bpm. When I mix vocals, I match the instrumental and the vocals to the original, and not a single instrumental I found so far actually matches the original until the end of the song! Only the ones that kept Rin's backing vocals do.Does anyone else feel this way? 

I procrastinate until the last minute, classic adhd. Then, when I sit down and work, it's like I get overstimulated by how much I have to do. All the text and infortmation... It's too much. I feel so horrible and I end up missing the deadline, telling myself "I'll do it for next week, now I have all week to do it and won't get overwhelmed"... And then next week..... Rinse and repeat. Let's say that 7% of all women are sapphic. Now let's say that 2% of all women are autistic. If I want a girlfriend that understands me on a basic level, only 0.14% of all people meet that standard. Now if I want a girlfriend that is in my age range (0.7 of the population), the number drops to 0.00098%. And then I'm supposed to consider general compatibility and standards. Preferences are out of the question. God forbid I want an intelligent woman or an atheist. I can't be picky. 

I'm just gonna hope that AI development goes well

Edit: Thank you guys for the wonderful advice and encouraging messages! And thank you for pointing out my math is wrong. You guys are right - people like me tend to hang out in the same groups, which means that if I meet one person in the group, I know many people like me. They always get some kind of romantic interest in me. It's driving me nuts. It's like the moment a woman is nice to them they start flirting. And I pretend not to notice. I pretend not to notice they're trying to win me over. I wish I could have "lesbian" written on my forehead sometimes but I don't. And I can't just tell them, they'll spread it around like the plague, or be homophobic. It's gotten to the point where I'm avoiding male friendships completely. It makes me so uncomfortable to think about some kind of romantic subtext they're imagining. About if whatever I'm doing comes off as romantic. They're both healers and buffers. It would be hard to top Benny. Did anyone do the math? What do you guys think?. I found his Reddit account. He's been posting very Christian things, saying being gay is bad and a sin. I thought I raised him well. I feel sick to my stomach. He's been on the nationalist side of the internet lately. I can't stop shaking. There's not much I can do about it. Despite my efforts, the environment is what shaped him, not me. I don't have a single safe person in this family, not even the little brother I tried to influence to love people like me. I don't know what to do. They ask the dreaded "have you ever had sexual intercourse" and I say "no".

Then it's always the same thing. "Well we can't give you an exam if you never had sex before" "It's impossible for a virgin to have an infection"

And then when I say that I DID have an infection they don't believe me!! They say "who diagnosed you" and it's nobody because no gynecologist wants to check!! The only thing I know is that I had the symptoms of a yeast infection and that my mom's yeast infection cream worked.

And I have so many issues. My discharge was weird during my ovulation, then my period was 10 days late. I had all the symptoms of a period 10 days ago - pimples, cramps, sore breasts. And it's like my body forgot to have a period until now. And now my blood is black and it's flowing like crazy. I mean biggest fattest pad is overflowing within an hour crazy. 10 days is insane for me, it's usually 3 days late at most. Plus my ovaries hurt very badly once in a while. And my doctor said that these issues could be connected to my bladder issues as well, so she said that I should see a gynecologist.

Why do they refuse?? Is it stigma around breaking the hymen? Should I just lie and say I did have intercourse?

Tldr: I have issues with my reproductive system. Doctor said it could be connected to my bladder issues and to see a gynecologist. No gynecologist wants to make an appointment with me because I'm a virgin. I'm considering lying just to get an appointment. I thought they changed. That after begging them for so many years they finally gave me the freedom to make my own decisions.  


But it's all just another manipulation tactic. They know they didn't teach me the necessary life skills. Now I'm failing to figure it all out as fast as they want me to. I'm not acting adult enough or responsible enough. They want to prove that I can't control my own life so that they can justify their control over me.  


What the hell do I do. What's the point of being intelligent and liking science when I'm incapable of doing anything with it. When all I do is try to get through the day hoping that maybe in a few years I'll enjoy living. I like math, I like physics, I like computer science, and I'm smart... I could've been the next big thing, the next breakthrough scientist. But all I can do all day is sleep and rot away. My grades are bad and I skip classes because sitting at school is torture.

Maybe if someone somewhere believed in me I wouldn't be such a waste of space. My classmates don't even like me. Some other person could've taken my spot and done something so much better with it. But no. I'm here and I'm a failure. I'm the worst in my class. Nobody supports me and nobody wants me to succeed. I just come here to get bullied and to get reminded of how incapable of anything I am

I could be working on my passion for science but instead I'm worrying about escaping a toxic household, finding someone who actually likes me, making enough money, eating and drinking water, coping with how fucking evil this world is. What's the point. I don't know why I'm fighting. There's some small piece of hope in me that maybe some day I'll feel unconditional love and magically become capable of achieving things but I just gotta accept that my life is a waste and I'm a failure.

All the successful people in my class have supportive parents, many friends, a stable financial situation. And I was given intelligence only to waste it on fixing myself after others destroyed me. Fuck this. I wish I was never born into this cruel world. It's on fire anyway. I'm pretty sure I lost a lot of my cards, and that I might even have a few extra from a different deck, but I don't even remember how many there were of each. How many of each card should there be?. Recently I've been craving being romantic with a girl. I've never had any romantic experience and it didn't bother me until now. I want to break the ice. I want to feel that intimacy with another girl. But I can't. I don't know any other lesbians and I'm 17 so no dating apps. Plus... I'm moving to a different country as soon as I get the money. What's the point of building a relationship here, when I'll abandon this life soon? But I crave the touch of a woman. I want to explore my sexuality like a normal teenager. Who should I put with who?

My teams are
Kazuha Hydro Diona Ayaka
Yunjin Hydro Bennett Yoimiya

Yoimiya has overall lower damage than Ayaka, so I think Yelan would make up for it. However, Yoimiya also has lower hp and no shielder, and Ayaka doesn't get attacked much due to freeze, so Xingqiu's defensive abilities come in handy. What do you guys think?. What happened to Jay's Douchebag Simulator videos??. Having to mask 24/7, in your own bed. Loud roommates, no alone time ever. Being expected to have a neurotypical looking living space, for your room to look like a hotel room nobody lives in. I feel like I'm in prison. My head hurts all the time. I can't tell her nicely to stop. She doesn't speak any of the languages I speak. Plus, it's not like she's doing anything wrong. She has the right to talk on the phone in her room all she wants. But god does it give me sensory overload. My head constantly hurts and I'm constantly angry. Living with her is MISERY! All she does all day is yell on the phone in Hungarian... and when I hear her end the call, before I can even celebrate that it's over, she calls someone else... It's making me so depressed. YouTube, fine, whatever, it's mostly just a person talking and I can block out the noise in my brain pretty quickly. But Tiktok is so obnoxious! There is no faster sensory overload for me than someone watching Tiktok out loud. The different audios that change every 15 seconds... I can't stand it!! And the audios are so stupid and obnoxious most of the time!! I hate tiktok. Some of you might remember my "mom put spying apps on my laptop on my birthday" post, or the one where I asked for birthday wishes. First I'd like to say thank you all for the wishes! I got like 700 of them and it's impossible to respond to them all, but know that I did read them all and I can't be more grateful.

A lot of you suggested me to get a different OS on a USB stick, but... That's not necessary anymore. I went to the dorm that day and something inside me snapped. Like it finally sank in how evil she is and how I won't let her treat me badly anymore.

I came home the next weekend and didn't let her put the spying app on my phone. I didn't want to give it to her. She screamed, yelled, hit me... But I didn't give in. My dad surprisingly stood up for me, which only pissed her off more. She said, if you hate my care so much, I'll stop giving it to you, you're your dad's business now... I deleted the spyware off my computer which enraged her even more. She was bluffing, but I think that was when she realized what she said was now official.

We didn't speak for two months other than the occasional guilt trip, until she broke the silence this Friday. She asked me for my laptop password so she can "use photoshop" because i "have a newer version that has a feature the older version doesn't". I didn't want to fight with her, so I told her I'll unlock the PC, give it to her and watch her work. She was pissed off at this, yelling "you can't just tell me no", "I am your mother" and telling my dad "This is a result of your parenting". Then I said "well now I'm not gonna give you the laptop at all" which made her foam at the mouth.

The moment she saw the opportunity she hid my laptop and said she'll only get it back once she gets the password. I threw the whole house upside down looking for it. She was screaming at me to get out of her room, but I didn't want to, I had a laptop to find. I think the only reason she didn't hit me was because last time I threatened to call the police. She called my dad to kick me out of the room because I'm "his business now" but all that resulted was in them arguing about divorce and how mom hates this house and how everyone is against her. Dad told us to find a middle ground, and I offered to make a new account on my laptop that only has Photoshop. This didn't satisfy her. She wanted my password. She totally wanted to do something else on that computer. Dad left and she screamed at me again. She called dad to kick me out, and my dad yelled back "I'm not your dog". I couldn't help but laugh at this and my mom started crying. "This is funny to you??" She then packed up and left.

I found my laptop UNDER THE OVEN! A musty dusty spiderweb filled drawer under the oven. I swear, if she hid drugs there, the police wouldn't find them. Anyway, she came back later that night. Of course she wouldn't actually leave, she was just guilt tripping us like always.

We didn't speak on Saturday, but on Sunday she came to my room.

"Our relationship will come back to normal again, but I will never forget this evil side of you that I didn't know existed. I didn't know you were capable of treating someone who cares about you like this"

I've been absolutely crushed the past few days. Before this, I was acting like a compliant kid to be abused as less as possible, but now I've been rebelling. Before this, only I saw her as a villain, so we still had some normal, even nice moments together. But now, she sees me as the villain too. The illusion of a normal family is gone. All the good moments are over. I went VLC with my mom and I still live with her. I have my devices and I have more control over myself, but... I feel awful. I've been grieving the image of a mother these past few days.Malo malo pa nešto nestane iz sobe. Ne gledaju kamere jer "samo policija ima pravo da ih gleda". Ne smemo da se zaključavamo jer "kako da proverimo da li ste u sobi ako bude požar".When we'd share animal videos with each other, when she took care of me when I was sick, when she would hug me... But I have to remind myself that this is the same woman who hit me and screams at me every day. The same woman who forced me out of the closet only to push me right back in. The same woman who refused to get me mental help even though I was self harming. The same woman who laughed in my face when I said I wanted to die at the age of 12. The same woman who criticized my personality, my fashion sense, my hair, my art style, everything, because it's all "influenced by anime".   


She called me evil today because I stood up for myself. And here I am crying because I miss her. I miss the idea of a mother, not her. I'll never have that. I'll never feel a mother's touch. I can't stand the texture of chicken nuggets. They taste like meat, but they don't feel like meat under my teeth. It makes me so uncomfortable! Please guys I feel so alone in this. A family that's not your blood. Is it even possible? To meet a friend and be so close to them that you decide you're family... I don't mean "like my family" I mean an official new family. "One day, our relationship will fall back to normal again. But I will never forget this evil side of you that I didn't know existed. I didn't know you were capable of treating someone who cares so much about you like this"

I don't care about her opinion, but it still stung. How she'll truly never realize that my actions are a consequence of how she treated me. In her eyes, all she did was force me to study and clean my room. I guess my caveman brain still craves affection from her, even though I logically know I won't get any.

She's literally that meme of the guy shooting another guy and saying "why would x do this??". I have nothing to look forward to. They fried my brain. All I do is doodle meaningless shit and sleep because I can't think at all. I used to love math, science, programming... But now I'm just a shell of a person. I don't have the mental capacity to do any of the things I dreamed of. Making a game, learning music, sharing my art with the world, learning science... None of it. My brain is too fried for any of it. I can't even make friends. I'm autistic on top of everything. How can I ever move out and be happy if I can't even make money? I have nothing to live for. I'm only alive because I want to experience happiness before I die, but I don't think it's possible at all. Nobody has my back and I'm too incapable of having my own back. I hope I get hit by a bus tomorrow. Back when I'd wake up early, excited to see my friends outside. Watching cartoons as I ate breakfast grandma made. The world around me felt so real. I noticed small details around me, the way the light of my dad's car hit the wall, the piece of cotton grandma wore in her ear, the texture of the carpet...  


I feel none of that anymore. My heart has a layer of sadness and anxiety over it, but I ignore it most of the time. Instead of the world around me, I'm observing my inner world. My stories, my characters... I don't like the adult reality. Sometimes I'm doing something that reminds me of my childhood, and for a moment I'm reminded of how I felt back then. It feels like peace inside my heart. It makes me realize how awful I constantly feel. Is it possible to feel that way again? To feel so excited to live, to like reality?   


I miss when making friends and memories was simple. Back when "Hi, what's your name" was enough to land you a friend. When we'd play all day. Our differences didn't matter... I'll never get to feel that again. Adults are too judgemental.Contained in this is numerous workplace adjustment suggestions which have helped me tremendously! I have even applied some to my daily life

Can someone help?. Hey guys! Been playing DnD for a year now in my own group of friends with an ace DM 

We’ve wanted to have an in person session for ages now and tonight is the night at mine and my partners home! 

I’d just like to ask people who have had in person sessions, what should I expect? Is there any tips you might have for me?

On top of that is there any food/ drinks that you thought were fun or that really made the session special? I want to make tonight really fun so that we do more of them in future! 

Please also share any fun stories of your in person sessions or if you haven’t had one what you think would be cool? 

P.s I am very willing to bake/ cook dnd themed things. I am 23F and everyone is over 20. I need to repot my Ficus Ginseng and have several potting mixes available. 

- Monstera/ philodendron potting mix (peat free, orchid bark etc) 

- Houseplant focus potting mix

- Succulent potting mix

- Perlite 


Thanks in advance!!. I have been a patron of charity shops my whole life, whether that’s Oxfam, Age UK or British Red Cross. But recently I’ve found it’s just not worth the trip. I can understand somewhat of a price increase as the cost of keeping the shops open and running has increased, however, when a tattered paperback becomes £5 when such things used to be 50p, not too long ago I might add, I think it starts to take the mick.

I’ve noticed it with clothes too. You could often find t-shirts and the like for less than £2 and now they are £5 even £10 and you could even find coats for £5 and now they are as much as £50!

I’ve got mixed feelings with all this as I’m more than happy to donate to charity. Even when I was relying on food banks to survive I still gave all my change to collection pots. But I think it’s gotten to the the point of ridiculous now. Even with damaged or stained items the price does not reflect what the value of the product is.

I also feel betrayed. As well as frequenting charity shops I have also made large donations to them as well, at least two times a year for 10 years. I did this because I trusted the charity shops would put my past belongings and memories to good use but also to make me feel like I’m contributing to helping others. I could have sold the items as they were always well cared for and still had value and put some well needed extra pennies in my pocket. But I didn’t. I trusted the charity shops were going to sell them to those in need in the community, only to find that most people who actually shop in charity shops cannot afford the ridiculous prices they charge for, simply put, second hand items.

This leads me to the burning question, what has happened to our charity shops? Why have they done this?

(These examples are from my personal experience, price findings are all legitimate examples I have found myself. In my local city, town and surrounding cities and towns in northern England). Hi I’m not sure what to do here and who I would think of contacting (this happened in England) and if there’s even anything that can be done 

My sister lives on a farm and has a new house being built on the perimeter of one of their fields

She was inspecting the electric cattle fence when she stepped on something sharp… it turned out to be a nail in a piece of wood thrown over the fence by one of the builders/ person who was building the fence

Her wellies are ruined and she’s sustained an injury to her foot as the nail pierced the welly 

Does anyone have any advice or should she just go round to them and ask for them to buy her new wellies and not to throw things over again? I’m unsure as to what she should do if they say no tho? 

P.s we’ve taken pictures of the block when it was in the grass and kept it, pictures of the fence, pictures of the damaged welly, pictures of her foot injury and pictures of other debris found on her side of the fence. (Edit to include that this is in England)

So this has been happening regularly for at least two months now. Me and my boyfriend will be having a normal level conversation or sometimes I will be having a cry (there is a lot of unrelated emotional turmoil in my life rn) and she’ll shout things like “shut the f*ck up” etc 

This evening she shouted “shut up you stupid cow” at me crying and “fucks sake” at me and my boyfriend talking at just a normal level

This is continuous verbal harassment isn’t it? I’m not sure if there are things I’m doing wrong as it’s 10/11pm at night? I hope not seeing as we’re just talking and surely you should be able to talk in your own home without being shouted at???

I’m not sure what to do, we are moving into the flat *above her* in two days (we are next to her atm) and if it get any worse this will surely affect my mental health and disabilities

Not sure if I should contact the police, contact the landlord (who says she’s a “lovely lady” or just send my boyfriend down to talk to her if it happens again?

I’m not good with confrontation and have never had this issue before so apologies if the answer is obvious or seemingly simple 

Thank you for any advice you can give!. 16-19 y/o - Rigevidon (pill) - before I was sexually active and would forget to take 

19-22 y/o - Implant (Nexplanon- progestogen only) - unaliving thoughts, depression 

Brief gap 1 month- felt enormously better off hormones 

22 y/o - Copper IUD (5 year) - had this for 7 months- EXTREME pain, excessive bleeding, fatigue 

22 y/o - Mirena IUS (5 year) - In for just 1 month- Low mood, unaliving thoughts, bad pain, constant spotting, uncontrollable acne, constantly greasy hair and skin 

22 y/o - NuvaRing - only been on this for one week but have started to have visual disturbances…

I don’t know what to do from here… I have ADHD so pills aren’t the best if I’m actually trying to prevent pregnancy. 

The sexual health nurse said there’s maybe the depo shot but that is progestogen and lasts for three months so if I have unaliving thoughts again there would be no way to stop them 

There’s also the patch but I have autism and am worried I will constantly *feel* it and eventually pick it off 

TLDR: Should I keep the ring in for a bit longer? Should I try a different method?. I am 22F who was diagnosed with Asperger’s at 8 years old by a child psychologist 

My parents have since forgotten the name of the psychologist and as it was never with the NHS it has never been on my medical record

ASD has played a HUGE part in my life in everything from my inability to keep friendships, down to my overly trusting/“naive” nature that has lead me to be SA’d multiple times and in varying severity over the years 

Now the way I see it another diagnoses will just confirm what I already know and maybe help explain to others why I act certain ways (some people -e.g family- will never believe me without a new diagnoses) but won’t necessarily stop these things happening?

The main reason I wanted a diagnoses is to get more support but it seems that (in the UK) this is hard to come by and when you do get it it barely helps

Are there actually any benefits to getting a new diagnoses? I don’t want to get it and it be on my medical record for it be then used against me at a later date e.g moving to another country or adopting (which I want to do)

I also now work in the civil service who provide adjustments for ASD regardless of diagnoses so a diagnoses would not affect my work 

TDLR: 

What are the pros and cons of getting officially diagnosed? 

What are some experiences you would like to share to do with this?

What is your opinion on me getting a diagnoses?


Feel free to ask any questions for further info!. PLEASE help me find this song!!

I’ve had a song in my head for days but can’t remember the specific lyrics 

In the song the woman singing is singing about times in her life where she felt left out 

E.g one line is her saying when the friends were walking along the pavement/ sidewalk she would always have to walk on the verge 

Second line I remember is she had to pack up/ eat her lunch fast otherwise they’d leave her behind

Another one I remember is she said they all carpooled but there was never room for her 

Please can someone help? It described my time at school perfectly!. Edit: All these employments occurred in England 

So I have been wrongfully terminated from several employments over the past two years 

The first was in sales at an “events company” who had contracts with prominent energy companies to convince people to switch energy providers and I was told I “wasn’t suited” after I had to take a day off due to my diagnosed and treated depression (a protected characteristic)

The second was at a local pub where I was hired as duty manager after four years experience in that sector. They fired me after I failed to be 15 minutes early to my shift (which wasn’t in my contract) and after I explained this was due to 1) my own disabilities of ASD and ADHD and 2) me relying on my father to drive me to work (who has ADHD so not sure if this would be discrimination by association as they weren’t notified of this specific as it was a private medical matter of my fathers).
This employer also harassed me due to him finding out I was bisexual and asked me to be his and his girlfriends “unicorn”. This was unwanted conduct relating to a protected characteristic 

The third was at another local restaurant/ bar where I worked as kitchen staff just to tide me over til I found a permanent job. After a month of working they still refused to give me any form of contract (so only have verbal agreement contract and payslip). I then was hit by a car and broke my back so they first proceeded to deny my statutory sick pay or even fill out the form for it and THEN fired me as they were unwilling to make accommodations for me to work there (such as reduced hours or a risk assessment to remove any jobs requiring heavy lifting) 

TLDR: I’m seeking action against all or any of the three past employers for wrongful dismissal and would like advice on who to approach/ what to do

Edit: the first employer also refused to give me a written contract

The second employer refused to give me a copy of the written contract

Edit 2: for clarification- I got to work on time. I have always gotten to work on time. I was never late. I got there usually 10 but sometimes 5 minutes before my shift and was immediately ready to start work 

Edit 3: at the first and third jobs I got there by myself by bike or by walking and was always at least 30 minutes EARLY. This didn’t happen at the second job listed as it was much further away. There was traffic and my dad would always be scraping the car off or making a cup of tea when it was time to leave. If I made an issue of this he would not have taken me to work at ALL. There was no other way to get there. No one to get a lift from and no buses as it was in the middle of nowhere. The manager said he would drive me in daily at the interview but refused later on so I was left with my dad as the only option. I’ve just seen an advert on TV (UK) for the contraceptive pill “Hana” and, while I think it’s great that it’s so easily accessible, I do worry about the lack of education about progestogen only contraception and causing (among other conditions) Depression.

I personally have experienced this and I wouldn’t wish it on any woman.

Not saying it causes it outright as there’s not enough research (surprise surprise) and it definitely doesn’t happen with all women but I’ve heard it happens with a lot so wondering on others’ experience with it?. I just get the feeling that they are actually both really selfish? I know Amelia is an addict and had a brain tumour for a while but with how she treated Link I see no excuse. She lead him on and then changed her mind a dozen times. I know he made mistakes but he always cared for her, Scout and her sisters kids and always thinks of everyone as well as recognising when he needed his own time (e.g to drink away from Amelia during the pandemic)

Don’t get me started on Maggie and how she wants to discard Winston because SHE didn’t put in enough effort to get to know him  before (and after) deciding to marry him?? There’s a difference with putting yourself first and being selfish and, frankly, she’s being the latter as well as over dramatic. There’s numerous things Maggie has done that I have questioned. Such as berating Richard in public instead of talking with him first (about the Webber method) and didn’t she run away from her fiancé in Boston too? 

They both seem untouchable because anytime they hurt someone or make mistakes they play the addict/ bullied/ adopted card. Please explain this/ does anyone agree?

Any facts I’ve gotten wrong please bring me up on it this is a rant more than anything 

Also I’m up to S18: ep19 and don’t mind slight spoilers but no big ones please!. I rent the property in England

The property came back as D energy rating and the landlord is trying to get it to a C.
My room is the attic room which is why this is an issue. 

My first question is: are they allowed to just come in and start drilling holes in my ceiling? 

I have all of my belongings including furniture and electronics in this one room and am still recovering from a broken back so couldn’t possible move any of it and don’t want anyone I don’t trust to touch it. 1) because I am on the spectrum and it will distress me and 2) I have no insurance anymore as I can’t afford it (from being off work due to broken back)

My second question is: am I allowed to request only female workers? 

We have had male workers in the house before but for max an hour and NEVER in my room. My room is my safe space and I don’t feel comfortable with strange men being in it (I don’t feel comfortable with ANY strangers in my room actually). I already struggle to sleep due to PTSD and this would beyond a doubt worsen this and I wouldn’t feel safe in my own bedroom again.

Also even if the workers are female I still don’t want dirty boots in my carpeted room which 1) I will then have to clean with a broken back and 2) will distress me as I’m on the spectrum. Can I ask them to remove their boots or clean up after themselves or is this considered rude? 

Side note: Anyone that knows me will say I’m not sexist in the slightest. I am aware of how the no men in my room may sound to some people but please trust I have a good reason and don’t ask it either. Thank you. The main issue for me is I don’t know which is the best level to have to produce the most XP? 
Is it best to have, for example, 8 Home Sweet Home’s (lvl 4) or 4 lvl 5/ 2 lvl 6 or 1 lvl 7??. This was back in January- June 2021 (so still Covid)

I was a university student in Huddersfield and had withdrawn due to a mixture of severe depression and admin issues on their part causing unnecessary issues

During this time me and five other friends rented a HMO fit for students. So when I withdrew in March they had sent me a letter by June stating that I needed to pay the whole years council tax for the whole property which was A LOT 

I did manage to reduce this by saying I was a student most of these months and there’s also five other students on the property so I shouldn’t be responsible for it all. There was also a discrepancy with the dates they wanted payment for (April to April) as the lease started in August 2020 and ended July 2021

This reduced it to around £760 but I was never advised that I shouldn’t even have to pay due to being unemployed and on Universal Credit (and not finding a job due to Covid) 

I feel they took advantage of me being a young, severely depressed, women stranded in a house alone (my friends had gone to their parents’ houses for covid) with no one to turn to for advice and they didn’t listen to my valid requests?

Would I be able to get any of this back or is my money gone forever?.I’ve been on dates before- other people always asked me out- and I assumed I’d end up falling for them eventually but I felt nothing. My first serious date was a trainwreck and I ended up telling the person halfway through I didn’t feel anything for her, and that I always kinda dissociate through romantic things; to which she suggested I was aromantic.

I considered this but didn’t know for sure until today. I was asked out by a guy who had almost everything in common with me and we seemed super compatable. But once again I felt nothing. I knew for sure that if I didn’t like him I was never gonna like anyone. After the date I came out to him as aro and suggested we stay friends. 

So on one hand I now have to work through being aro but on the other hand I have a cool new friend. I had top surgery recently and it looks like one of my nipples may have rejected. It will be a scar at worst and a completely flat nipple at best. Is it possible to get a permanent dome shaped implant underneath a hyper-realistic nipple tattoo to give the look of a 3D nipple?(This will be done once everything is completely healed). Before I start I’m gonna acknowledge that I’m still very fortunate to have gotten the surgery that I did and to have the opportunity to get it. 

I didn’t even know how perfect of a candidate I was- nipple size, skin, everything. I opted for peri because I was self conscious of my nipples and wanted the areola resized (I never knew they would shrink after keyhole which would have made them completely normal). I didn’t think that (mostly minor) nipple stretching was so common in peri. Now I’m 5 weeks post peri and my nipples have stretched to larger than they were pre op AND the scars have stretched too; and nipple stretching can keep going up until 3 months, the thought of my nipples getting any larger makes me nauseous. Scars included my nipple looks about 4-4.5cm across. I also had complications with my left nipple and it’s still only just starting to slough.  

Worst part is that I considered changing to keyhole a few weeks before (up until the day of surgery) but I didn’t want to rediscuss that with my surgeon and i wasn’t even sure if I was allowed to change it after paying. 

I know that the scars will fade and that I can get a nipple revision but it’s still so frustrating knowing how much more comfortable I would have been had I got keyhole.

I’m trying to tell myself that I can’t change anything now so there’s no use fixating on it but it just feels so hopeless.I’m 1 month post op peri and my nipples are stretching more than I’m comfortable with, and I want to be prepared for a revision if I think I need it, but I can’t find any photos of people who got their areolas resized after their surgery.

I also have a few questions about it- 1 what are the chances the nipple will stretch out again? Is it higher than the original surgery?

 2 Is it possible for them to only do a crescent shape incision instead of going around the whole nipple- and will that reduce chances of it stretching out?

3 Was it done in the office with local anaesthetic or was it under general anaesthesia?

If anyone has any experience with this (even if you aren’t comfortable sharing photos) and is comfortable sharing, any info is helpful.I’m 3 weeks post op peri today but my nipples are far from healed and one is still completely scabbed. At what point in the healing process (either by time or look of the nipple) can I stop being worried about it stretching?. I’m 12 days post op. My left nipple and half of my right one had a black scab on them. Yesterday at my post op appt I was assured this wasn’t something to worry about and given an irrigation solution to soak twice a day to help the scabs come off.

I just had a shower and noticed that the black scabs on my nipples had started to some off only to reveal a completely grey nipple underneath (so my right nipple is half pink and half grey with some black scabbing)

I got out of the shower and put on Vaseline, let it dry and now the grey parts are back to black matching the colour of the scabs.

Is this failure? There’s no pus, smell or blood.

My surgeons office isn’t reachable until Monday so I can’t call them and ask. I’m 9 days post op and while I knew anaesthesia can dehydrate you, I’m getting pretty concerned.

I’m drinking probably twice as much water as I did pre op (I never drank much water in general but now it’s about 2 litres a day) while also eating low sodium and im still drying out everywhere. My hands are scaly, my mouth is dry, my lips got a split in them and my face is starting to peel a little. I can’t understand why? 

At my 1wk post op review they said my scabs were very dry (my nipples were mostly extremely dark brown and I’m white), and that I need to keep them constantly moisturised with petroleum jelly. My drains weren’t putting out that much (less than 30mls a day)

How concerned should I be and how can I fix this?. I’m currently 2 days post op from Peri top surgery (but this info applies to all surgeries with her) and I want to share my (very positive) experience. I did not have insurance and all costs are in AUD

Cost- total approx 13-15k for all expenses (anaesthetist, psych, consults, post op care, day surgery, post op “comfort items” etc). My rebates total were 1.3k

Surgery itself- 8.5-9k depending on the approach, day surgery- 2.6k, anaesthetist- 2.4K, psych 500-600

She was very professional and experienced. During the consult she only needed a brief glance at my chest to determine skin elasticity and other important factors. She explained all the risks and procedure and gave me paperwork that outlines it. The nurses took photos and then sent me on my way. She requires all patients to provide a WPATH letter from a psychiatrist within 3 months of the surgery date (I went with dr. Harvey who’s a telepsychiatrist- very good experience with him as well). She prefer doing DI with no nipple grafts however will do all major types such as peri, keyhole and DI with/without grafts. I am unsure if she does fisheye or other less common methods.

Things got complicated when I had to postpone my surgery 10 months due to being messed around with a psychiatrist who refused to write my WPATH letter (this was **NOT** dr.harvey). and despite it being less than two weeks from the actual surgery date, which would normally incur a $1500 fee, it was completely waived, as was the extra money i would have had to pay due to inflation. The costs I’ve outlined above are the current costs for 2023 and not the costs I paid last year.

If you have insurance, your surgery will be done in a hospital and you will be kept overnight. since I didnt have insurance mine was done at the Pacific day surgery clinic and I was discharged after 1.5 hours in recovery. You WILL need a responsible adult to take you home and stay with you the first 24 hours (they dont need a car, as they can take an uber with you).

I was prescribed blood clotting medication and antibiotics for the first two days. I was also prescribed two separate kinds of painkillers which were explained to me with the risks very thoroughly. I was also given leaflets with detailed information about each medication.

I have to keep drains for the first week which will be removed in my first post up appointment if I have less than 30 millilitres in them for two days consecutively.

I will edit this post for future updates such as post op appts or if any complications arise. Please let me know if you have questions.I guess God’s punishment for suicide is reliving the last instance before your death for eternity…. (TW: mentions of CSA)

I left the church 3 years ago but sometimes find myself hating that I left the church. it feels like there’s so much evil in the world, and that the members were the only people who were truly altruistic. 

But that’s not true. Behind every door was a kid being abused in some way or another, there were too many child sex offenders who had open opportunities to hurt children (at least in my ward there was 3 convicted), the church was built on a pedophilic money-hungry liar, the entire structure of the church oppresses women and they falsely believe that LGBT people are *choosing* the wrong path. 

My positive childhood memories of the church try to distract me from the abuse I endured as a result of the church, and no amount of fun activities at mutual will make the church true.

What I miss never existed and sometimes it’s hard to cope with that.I live in Australia, which most would think is a haven for trans people (in the cities at least), but it’s laws regarding legal sex change are almost designed to make it impossible.

In order to change it on your birth certificate, you need to have SRS. Which is understandable in and of itself, until you realise there is ONE surgeon in Australia who does male phalloplasty, and unlike other countries, our insurances don’t cover bottom surgery. At best they’ll cover the hospital stay. I will need to somehow come up with over $200k up front (which is JUST the surgeon fee) in the midst of the one of the worst housing crises our country has ever seen. 

The media  salary in Australia is $79,000- but unlike America, our income taxes are MUCH higher, so take home is about $62,000. With that I have to pay for all necessities in my life, save up for a house and somehow still have enough for SRS.I’m new to running (just finished c25k) but as the days keep getting hotter and more humid I just can’t bring myself to go for runs/ I haven’t in over a week.

Even running inside with the AC on full blast isn’t enough to keep me from feeling like I’m boiling from the inside out.

How do you guys do it in summer?. I am really into body mods and want to get more facial piercings as well as some tattoos, and possible scarification. My main concern is finding a job after I graduate college though. I’m about to start working towards becoming a medical laboratory technician, but I’m not sure how strict they are in regards to hair, facial piercings and tattoos.

Is there anyone here who works in that environment willing to shed some light on how difficult it is to balance work and body mods?. No, other people don’t need to know that you have a trans friend, coworker, sibling, cousin etc.

By outing us to “prove” to others that you don’t hate trans people, you are actually proving that you aren’t safe to come out to. Don’t treat knowing a trans person as some sort of achievement. Some of us want to be stealth, which is impossible if you out us- even to people we don’t know.

Just be neutral. Just treat us like anyone else. Don’t think you’re an expert on trans topics just because you know a trans person. Please.I’ve heard that you will have to take them out due to the way metal conducts electricity. I’m scared my piercings will close over, is it okay if I change them to clear bioplastic since there’s no metal instead of removing the piercings completely?. Disclaimer: SzPD presents differently in everyone and if you don’t relate to some things I’m saying it doesn’t mean I’m implying that you don’t have it. 

As someone with ASD and SzPD I can confidently say they are two very different disorders internally. However, A lot of the time the SzPD symptoms on websites just say “prefers to be alone, appears indifferent/emotionless and little desire for relationships” and basically give a watered-down autism symptom list (excluding sensory issues)

None of the popular- as in most visited, not necessarily most accurate- websites (webMD, Mayo clinic etc) cover the more defining symptoms like our pathological need for isolation, the constant state of dissociation, the deficit of affective empathy, the details about the “inner world” etc. and if they do mention it, they don’t seem to address the gravity of it. For example, our “limited emotional expression” isn’t something that we just choose one day, it’s a second nature that we live by, it’s not only that we rarely express genuine emotion, it’s that we rarely EXPERIENCE genuine emotion, compassion and investment (that’s triggered by external sources)

It’s just basically makes it seem redundant for non-schizoids trying to research SzPD since so much of the disorder isn’t even covered until you start searching for specifics within the disorder I.e searching “schizoid dissociation” “schizoid subtypes” etc. but no one would know to look for that unless they already knew about the disorder to a degree higher than what is shown in basic websites.

To sum up: don’t go to the first page on google if you’re looking at schizoid and base all of your knowledge on it.

Side note: I was rolling for diona constellations and got Yae REALLY early… twice. I’m not a whale I swear.I’m extremely behind on my courses and can’t motivate myself to complete them despite having assessments coming up next week. Any tips so I don’t end up failing out of TAFE?.Hello! 
So this might be the wrong place to ask, but tonight I had some issues with apex. Ever since I got my laptop I’ve never had issues till today and I’m unsure why?

Anyway, crashed twice during matches today. The only thing that seemed a little out of sorts was that whenever I logged in, apex would say compiling shaders, which it doesn’t usually do unless it’s had a graphic driver update. I had to uninstall discord and Spotify for it to work again without and crashing. 

Thing is I need discord so is there anything I can do to fix this issue? I find it weird I’ve not had any issues with this so far, yet all of sudden it’s started to act up. Any help would be appreciated

thanks!. I don’t usually like to make posts like this, I don’t usually like to do this sorta thing at all. 
However, after the Conservative Party made their little speech about trans people, I’m angry. I’m also very scared. 
I haven’t done anything to threaten anyone, I’m just a man who’s wanting to be themselves in their body. I don’t want anything else in my life but to simply exist, I don’t understand why this is happening I don’t understand why they hate us so much?
I hate this country. I hate it so much. I can’t even put into words how fucked off I am. I’m fucked off at people like Glinner, and JK Rowling for their spewing of hatred towards us, and I hate the government for acting this way too. This is a dangerous slippery slope and it seems like so little don’t care.
I’m sorry, but I’ve just had enough.This is a mix of me asking for advice and also me venting.

So, I want to start dating again. Which is great and all, but in all honesty I’m kinda confused as to how?
I’ve tried dating apps and I’m already worn out. All I get from their profiles is, my insta is: 
That doesn’t tell me anything??? I need to know what your hobbies are, why are you here, what’s your career or job? I need something to go on. Yet all I have is blandness. 
Then there’s the talking stage which is awkward as fuck, and invariably, I get ghosted within either matching or a few days and I just get really fucked off. I could be really hitting it off with someone and I just get fucked over? 
So I guess, here’s my question: 
How do you all get through it? How have you met your person? What makes you actually go through with it?
I want to date again, but idk how.Hey guys, 
So on Sunday a girl I was seeing, we weren’t official but ended things with me. We had been together for at least three months. 
She said it was due to her mental health which I understand, she feels like she’s spread too thin and can’t handle a relationship right now. I didn’t take it well, I tried convincing her to not leave, but she had made her mind up. She wanted to leave, she didn’t want to discuss things with me because she didn’t feel it was fair. 
Thing is, I fell in love with her. She’s my favourite person, she was my person. I wish I could lie and say that I didn’t see a future with her, but I did. 
I saw myself with her, being happy as ever. I love her and I just can’t bring myself to being able to accept and understand we’re over. She said she really liked me a few days ago, and now I’m sat in bed tearing up because I miss her like crazy. 
I hate being in relationships or situations like this because I always get attached and fall easily.
What can I do to make this better for myself? I feel so lost and lonely. 
Thanks. Hello!
So, forgive me if this isn’t allowed but I’m out of my depth. I have a friend who I like and we have mutual feelings for one another but don’t want a relationship due to personal reasons. 
Things have been amazing the last two almost three months we’ve been talking. 
We’re both autistic and I think in someways that’s definitely bought us closer. 

Unfortunately, she’s going through a rough time and I’m unsure how I can help. You see, with me, it’s completely different than her experience which is completely fine, but I feel like my advice isn’t good enough. I care for her a lot so that’s why I’ve come here. 

Basically she’s feeling lost, and depressed and honestly she’s not herself. She’s lost the energy she’s had for me, and she’s lost the energy for her friends too, so I know it’s not just me. She’s hardly replying to any of us, she’s just distant. Problem is, she doesn’t know what to do to go back to her normal self. She has special interests but she’s now feeling like they’re burning her out more, she’s not satisfied with them, and it’s frustrating her. 

With me, I’m the exact opposite. I find an old interest or, I can just use one I already have. She’s not fortunate in that regard. I feel bad for her, I want her to be able to have my ability so she doesn’t feel like this anymore. 

She also feels like she’s unable to prioritise herself and her interests because it’s not something she “has” to do. Whereas for me, it’s all I can think about till I get next fix xD 

So what can I do? What can she do? I want to support her, and I know I am just by being there but, I really adore her and I hate her feeling lost like this. 

Have any of you felt the same?  What did you do?
Thank you.Well, as the title says, I can’t be optimistic. 
I’ve tried and given it a few weeks but in all honesty? I’m disappointed.

Tonight was the last straw for me, I played some mixtape and immediately someone on the enemy team has six kills because they’re able to do impossible movements with scripts. And there’s me, with a controller who will get more hate because of AA? I’m sorry but something needs to be done.

Then the lag of the servers which kept making it extremely difficult to actually play any match or stay in one. 

I go to play ranked and I’m given only one teammate, making us outnumbered against full squads??? Why? Just take another minute to matchmake, please.

As I’m typing this, again, we’re outnumbered in mixtape TDM. The matchmaking I’m sorry, really is bad. 
We’re either waiting so long for a match or we get outnumbered and or are paired with really weird matchmaking. Like why am I, being paired with a rookie when I’m bronze? And made it to diamond last season? 
I don’t understand. 

I’m sorry for yet another vent post, but I’m kinda tired of it and we have another 70 days left of this season and I feel like we’ve gotten worse, so much worse than ever before.So, the title seems self explanatory but it’s a bit complicated than that.

I’m autistic and I have really bad depression, I’m having therapy and have done for about 7 years, but unfortunately nothings really motivated me to change my room around. 
I live with my family, and without going into too much, I share a room with my sister who has ADHD and has this thing (sorry I don’t have a technical term for it) but she doesn’t have the capacity to understand that when she sees something on the floor to pick it up,  this isn’t me shaming her for it, this is just me saying what the situation is. 

The problem is, I’m not really happy with the idea of clearing up after her mess. However, my mum says I have to clean up after her because I should be the one taking responsibility.

Unfortunately this just makes me feel worse, but the room being the way it is…? That’s the worst part of it. 
It’s horrible. Idk what to do about it. The idea just makes me mad because, I don’t feel like I should be taking charge of someone’s mess, I don’t feel like I should be cleaning anyone else’s mess at all, so it makes me depressed and I make messes too, but nowhere near the amount my sister has. Again no shame, she’s got her issues and I understand and respect that! **So please, no shaming my sister. No shaming her mentally.**
I just want advice to what I do, how I do it, etc. 
Is there anyone who has lived in a similar situation? If so, please let me know.
Thank you. https://twitch.tv/endupqueer let’s goooo!!. I’m not able to upload any clips, is there a reason why? I have so many boozles I wanna share!!. Hi guys, this is a bit of a weird one and I’m not entirely sure I can get an answer for this but if someone does know what I can possibly do, I’d appreciate it. 

A fair few years ago, I worked for a cinema chain, and they let me go as I didn’t pass my probation. They said it was for a few reasons, not meeting standards that they wanted etc.
Which as much as I understand, I was devastated as I loved the job. I worked for another chain at one point, but they won’t rehire me. Not sure why, because I passed my probation and I only left due to a friend of mine passing away so needed a change of pace. (I asked why they wouldn’t rehire me but they didn’t answer.)

But regardless, the general manager of the first chain, the one who let me go, moved to a more local branch and told one of the employees there, who’s friends with a relative of mine that I was only let go of because they didn’t need me. This might be all a lie, but as I loved the company, I really wanted to progress professionally within that company. So I just wondered, was there anything I can possibly do? 
I’m not sure what that might be, but it’s just a bit on my mind as I’ve never really liked a job quite much as I’ve worked at a this cinema company.
I hope this isn’t too confusing for you all.
Thank you!. https://twitch.tv/endedupqueer. https://twitch.tv/endedupqueer. https://twitch.tv/endedupqueer. Hey guys, idk what it is about this season so far but my god I’m struggling and I feel like I’m a noob at the game again?
Is this common with new seasons because I’ve never had this much of a struggle with other seasons. I just feel like everytime I play I get my ass handed to me and I have no idea why? Like it’s really frustrating me because I don’t understand why I’m that **bad** I’m a mediocre player yeah, but seriously this is making me look like I’ve never played the game!
Help would be appreciated thanks. Hey guys, so fair warning, this is gonna be a relatively long post. It’s mainly me venting then asking for advice if possible, thanks in advance!

I started streaming during lockdown as a lot of others did, and I really enjoyed it. However, after sometime of being affiliated with twitch, I lost a lot of my viewers. I had about on average 4 viewers? With a lot of engagement. Now I’m lucky if I get a 3rd viewer and someone talking who isn’t my mod. I know it’s not about views, but it really disheartened me. 

I took a long break because mentally things weren’t right, I also had little space of my own. Which yes, didn’t exactly help me grow now but I know I needed the break I had.

I started to stream again at the start of this year, and things have been the same, although when I had a new mod more viewers came in, unfortunately due to reasons, we had a disagreement and she doesn’t want to mod anymore. Understandable, but now it’s taken a toll on me and my viewership/interactions.
To the point where I’m thinking is this really for me? I’ve tried just about everything, self promotion on TikTok, Twitter, all sorts of socials, discords, streamloots too, variety of games as well, and nothing is working for me. I don’t *really* wish to give up but I don’t also know what else I really can do. I miss the interaction I had more than anything, that’s all I miss and want back is that interaction.
I don’t care if one person is watching me, or 5, as long as I’m feeling like they’re having fun, which is what I had at the start but definitely not so much now. 
I just wondered what you guys did to combat this situation, how you made it better and what you did maybe to get that interaction? I’m at a loss.
Thank you.https://twitch.tv/endedupqueer. I just wondered why I was an MVP during team deathmatch? I have no idea what I did, if there’s a patch note I missed or something can someone send it my way!
Thanks. Hey guys, yesterday I streamed sims 4 with the cottage living pack, and when I tried to select a farmhouse all of them were debugged without using a debug cheat, bar one farmhouse but I couldn’t select it either way.
I’m very confused as to what happened! If anyone could give me advice on what to do I’d appreciate it 
Thanks!. Come say hello!
https://twitch.tv/endedupqueer. https://twitch.tv/endedupqueer. https://twitch.tv/endedupqueer. https://www.twitch.tv/endedupqueer. I tried Googling it but it wasn’t making any sense to me, could someone explain what that means to me? My friend got that title some odd reason 
No doubt, she’s very good but just wondering how she got it. Which one would you say is the better one as an SMG and why? I like either or; as they seem like the same gun xD but I wondered what other preferences people have. HTTPS://Twitch.tv/endedupqueer. https://twitch.tv/endedupqueer.I tried each of the functions in this program independently and they seem to work well enough on their own, but as soon as I put them together it throws an error. Any help would be appreciated.

[https://imgur.com/a/jSyOxyL](https://imgur.com/a/jSyOxyL). Mine is probably in the video game Homeworld, the desert planet the protagonists come from is called Kharak, an obvious nod to Arrakis.This movie was actually a pretty big "media moment" for me.  My father was in military intelligence, I got a degree in applied mathematics, I did martial arts for nearly 20 years (from age 5 to about 22), and this movie really spoke to me.  I had meltdowns very similar to the ones experienced by the protagonist, my family life was similar to his, etc... How do you all feel about it?. I'm finishing the Night Lords Omnibus and it got me wanting to read about Sevatar.  What's the best book to read if I want to see more of Sevatar?. They both share the name "Dale".  "Khajiit Dale Badantel" and "Lakyus Alvein Dale Aindra". Is it a familial middle name or some kind of title maybe?. "And so the check-in with Albedo livened up, although there were some brief tiffs such as when Albedo raised a bizarre war cry when she heard that Narberal and Ainz would be sleeping in the same room. Narberal had to cast the same spell four times and Ainz was somewhat disgusted when he returned, but that’s another story."

What is "the same spell" and what the he'll does that last sentence mean?. Everyone here has seen tons of posts since the last chapter came out giving theories on Drive Knight.  While every post I’ve seen (and apparently nearly everyone on this sub) thinks that Drive Knight is a traitor to the Hero Association, I have a somewhat different theory than any I’ve seen so far.
  
  Some of the posts have revolved around DKs different tactical transformations having the names of various shogi pieces.  Some posts in particular have suggested that the G series robots are his “pawns”.  This actually fits incredibly well, since the name of the promoted pawn piece in shogi is “tokin”, which is a Japanese term for “plating”.  So, the smaller robot “cores” would be standard pawns and the G series “Machine God” forms would be “promoted pawns”. That theory led me to my own theory.

So, by this thinking we would have…

  Pawn (G Series), Lance (or Chariot), Knight, Bishop, Rook (Flying Chariot), Silver General (Silver), Gold General (Gold), and his “baseline” or “standard” form would be the King. 

  So far, so good, everything seems to fit very well.  Except this theory is missing one crucial part of shogi…

The Player.

  My proposed theory is that Drive Knight is being manipulated (either directly or indirectly) by Bofoi in order to muddy the waters and actually cast off any potential suspicions that Bofoi could be a traitor.  

  This is not to say that Bofoi was actually working with or allied with the Monster Association.  His actions with them could be due to any number of things like doing it intentionally to manipulate DK, doing it because he knew the HA would win so he wanted to glean all the information he could get before the MA was destroyed, or perhaps even getting what information he could before the MA took down the HA and he in turn took out the weakened MA. 

  It has been shown several times that Bofoi is willing to sacrifice many people (all of City Z to the meteor in order to test weapons, and not participating in the alien invasion but coming to collect the tech afterwards for example) in order to increase his power.  What his reason is for doing this is unclear.  He may be willing to sacrifice millions to save billions, he may actually want to take over the world, or he may want to build an army to counter the possibility of the S-Class going rogue and turning on humanity.  This could be why DK was asking about Blast, Bofoi would need to know as much as he could to build a potential counter to Blast, like how Batman keeps kryptonite in case Superman goes rogue. Whatever his reason, his goals do not necessarily align with those of the HA.
  
  Eventually someone was bound to ask why he was consolidating all this power, why he was allowed to consolidate all this power, and ask what he was going to do with it.  So, by manipulating DK into accusing him of being a MA “mole” and traitor to the HA with no solid evidence he would be establishing in everyone’s minds the idea that he has already been “proven” to be loyal.  If he could manipulate the HA into thinking that DK was the mole all along, that would be an added bonus, as the HA would think the “traitor” matter to be settled.

  This manipulation could be indirect, with him doing things to nudge the overly cautious DK into doing what he wants him to do.  It could also be direct.  We don’t know where DK comes from, or even if he is a cyborg or a robot.  He very well could be an A.I or remote-controlled hero that Bofoi planted into the HA as a contingency plan or even for this exact purpose from the beginning.

  TL:DR – Bofoi is not a traitor (yet), but isn’t loyal either, and he is manipulating Drive Knight into accusing him of being a traitor so he can disprove the false allegations and make the HA more trusting of him and less likely to suspect him when he actually does betray them.

edit: grammar. The 914 experiment logs say that they put SCP-939 through all five settings of 914, but only the 1:1 results are redacted.  What do you think came out?. Like the title says, I'm looking into making a pixel-art Metroidvania game and I would like to know before I get stuck-in learning it whether or not it would be a feasible choice.The animation kind of made me think of Batman the Animated Series, but I know it's NOT "Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends".  I think there was a theme of native american culture, and the aliens were pretty scary and animalistic; I remember them as looking almost like raptors/zerglings/xenomorphs.  The show was also pretty dark for a kids show and I'm pretty sure people died in it by being killed or maybe even eaten by the aliens. It may have not run for that long.I just purchased a new HP laptop.  The model is 14-cf0006dx if that helps.  I need it for a Computer Programming lab and not much else.  

After getting it out of the box I immediately installed chrome on it.  I had to make some switch from Windows 10-S I believe it was called in order to install chrome.  At this point everything appeared to be working properly.

I then downloaded and installed CodeBlocks and this is when the trouble began to show.  Every time I turn on the computer, after about three or four minutes the screen will go black and any audio playing will "glitch" or "hiccup".  ctrl-alt-del doesnt bring the screen back.  Closing and reopening the laptop doesn't bring the screen back either.

I downloaded DevC++ as well just to test whether or not the problem was with running CodeBlocks and the same issue occurred. I really would like to have this problem solved so that I don't have to go through another lab session without a laptop.  I would really appreciate absolutely any help or advice.Is there any examples in the lore about boarding actions against tyranid ships?  Is it even possible?  What are the interiors of their ships like?. Do they get them directly from the Adeptus Custodes?  Does the Deathwatch have the ability to manufacture guardian spears themselves?. I posted this on r/warhammercompetitive but only got one comment and it only told me to not use intercessors.  Thing is, I'm mostly in this to paint and collect, so I want to use my models (which are all primaris or scouts) and not get absolutely stomped so I can have some fun playing.

I'm trying to make an almost entirely Primaris list that isn't a complete pushover. I took mostly Deathwatch with another battalion to try and plug some of the gaps they have (no cheap troops, little anti-tank).

After getting that idea, I wound up with an entire headcannon for this company and I'm really loving the theme. They're painted up as Carcharadons. Please let me know what you guys think, I've never done anything like this before.

Created with BattleScribe (https://battlescribe.net).Like...Chris's video. How could she look at it and think it was good ? Why the random effects ? Why the lyrics that don't match the actual song (which should have disqualified her) ? Why the fuck did she review her own video with another account that almost bore the exact same username as the account she used to submit her entry ? Why did she think it was a good idea to talk about autism and about her sex life to whoever she was sending the rage mail to ? How the fuck did she not think it was dumb as fuck to be jealous of Adam Stackhouse AND his sister who was a literal child ? Imagine being a grown adult who recently turned 25 and being jealous of a girl who is what, ten years old ?  


The sagas with the sweethearts and the... ahem, recent events just show how perverted and desperate Chris is, but the PaRappa contest, the Miyamoto saga and the Liquid saga are really just flabbergasting because Chris's stupidity and narcicissm are on full display there and it's just her making an ass out of herself without harming anyone, which is truly the best kind of milk we can get from a lolcow.There's this series of books. I hate them. I hate them so much. Everything about them is so, so bad to me. I've gone to extreme lengths to demonstrate how much they suck. I have all the ebooks. I've read this abomination so many times. I sigh at almost every word the author has ever written. And I know everything about the universe and characters. I probably know more than an actual fan at this point. But I hate this thing. 

DAE have a special interest that is based in hatred ? Like, you know it's a dumpster fire but your brain just refuses to look away.There is no adult

Even people older than you are still anxious, still have issues. Even people beyond 70.

But there is always you being more grown up.

Being older doesn't always mean jobs and moving out and all of that.

It's also about discovering yourself and trying new things.

Become who you are and bettering yourself if need be.

That's you. And if you still want to call it an adult?

You already are an adult because you grow older every day with not only age, but wisdom and experience.In a car

Flippy: Drive faster, Sneaky, the bleeding is getting worse!

Sneaky: I'm trying, okay? I get nervous when people yell at me while I'm driving.

Flippy: Oh my fault, I'll just die in silence, shall I!?

Sneaky: *scoffs* Flippy, you're always so dramatic.

Mouse: Yeah calm down, Flippy, you're not dying. You're just losing large amounts of blood.

Flippy: ... Yeah that happens to be a leading cause of death!

Sneaky: No, you're thinking of cancer

Mouse: I thought heart disease was the number one cause of death?

Flippy: Yes, but without blood, my heart will have nothing to pump and will therefore get bored and die!

Sneaky: Ok, just try not to get blood on the seat.

Mouse: Are you guys sure this is the right way to the hospital?

Sneaky: I'm pretty sure.

Flippy: What do you mean you're pretty sure??

Sneaky: I think it's that... By that place we ate at the other day? What was it...

Mouse: Oh those fries were DELICIOUS

Sneaky: Oh my gosh, seriously, they were so good-

Flippy: THIS IS MY ARM!! *holds up arm* NOTICE HOW I AM ABLE TO HOLD IT AN ENTIRE ARM'S LENGTH AWAY FROM MY BODY!! THIS IS AN UNDESIRABLE QUALITY!! I INSIST YOU FOCUS ON FINDING ME MEDICAL CARE!!

Sneaky: *putting on mascara*

Flippy: …what are you doing!?

Sneaky: I have a date after this…. Actually can one of you grab the wheel?

Flippy: … *looks at Mouse* … *looks at Sneaky* … *grabs the wheel with his dismembered hand*

Sneaky: Thanks. *pulls out lipstick and steps on the break gently*

Mouse: Hey, how come we're slowing down?

Sneaky: Some ducks are crossing the road. … *looks at a flabbergasted Flippy* Well what else was I supposed to do?

Flippy: Kill them!!!

Sneaky: That's terrible…!

Flippy: No!! This *holds up arm* is terrible!!

Sneaky: … I'm not killing those ducks, Flippy.

Mouse: Yeah they are adorable.

Flippy: Get me to a hospital!! *waves dismembered arm between them*

Sneaky: *gags* Ugh ugh…

Mouse: Flippy, your arm is REALLY cold…

Flippy: …… is it, Mouse?? I'm no doctor but I would venture to guess that's probably indicative of some kind of severe trauma!

Mouse: *shrugs* I don't know, sometimes
people just have cold hands all the time *eyes Sneaky*

Sneaky: Should I turn the heater on?

Mouse: Oh! Yeah!

Flippy, dejected: *sighs* Guys if I don't make it, I just want you both to know… that I hate you.

Mouse: Flippy quit being so dramatic, look, the ducks are crossing the road?

Flippy: *flops over in the backseat, dead*

Sneaky: See? And nothing had to die.

Mouse: … *looks at Flippy with confusion*

Sneaky: Oh look, the place with the fries! You think we have time?

Mouse: YES.

Sneaky: Nice.Like the title says - I hate it when people lie in order to spare my feelings.  For example if I'm wearing something that looks bad, if I ask how I look I don't want you to say "you look lovely", I'd prefer you to be honest with me even if it could hurt my feelings.  The worst is when dating, if I match with someone hot I sometimes worry that I've catfished them so I'll ask a friend if I'm in their league.  Now I know that I'm not the best looking, I consider myself pretty average - but my friends will always say "of course they're not out of your league, you're hot and they'll be lucky to date you".  To me this sounds so insincere and is not helpful at all, I'd prefer a more truthful answer like "yes they're hot but you look good when you make an effort and put a bit of makeup on".  I reckon NT people would find this insulting but I find this comforting because I know this is the truth.  Does anyone else relate?. Anyone else having trouble spending this? It doesn't show on the app but on the desktop version it says it's there but still doesn't let me spend it.  (First time Audible user here so I might be doing something wrong). Anyone else do this often?  If I get out of bed again I'll probably get distracted and do something else, like floss or brush my hair again.  

Edit - Repost adding extra content to keep the mod happy.  And after my first post I have been to the bathroom and did use the toilet - yay for keeping on task lol. Polyamory is so nice when everything is going well - having multiple people who you love and love you back, a few exciting date prospects lined up, seeing your partners happy and thriving in their own relationships. However, it REALLY sucks when everything is going sour at the same time - NP has neglected you for months and you're pretty much living as 'friends', you can feel your other partner pulling away and you just know that they're about to end things, the people you have been chatting to and trying to set a date to meet have ghosted you.  I feel like I've been cursed with an anti-love spell at the moment. I've just got off the phone to my mom and I need to rant. A bit of background - I (36F) moved out 11 years ago to a house only 2 streets away.  My mom comes down to tidy once a week and does my washing for me, originally I was extremely grateful for the help because me and my partner both work full time and mom was happy to do it because she doesn't work, likes to keep busy and has no friends to visit.  I go up to visit her at least once a week and she calls me every single day.  To be honest, the phone calls have been a huge annoyance because we have NOTHING to talk about, it's usually just "Mom: hello, how was work? Me: not too bad, how was your day? Mom: okay, I didn't do much, just popped up the shop" and then she might tell me about something another family member has been up to.  Only reason I have let it go on for so long is because she goes into a sulk if I don't answer the phone, it's easier to just has a 2 minute chat.  Just lately she has been even more controlling, for example last week I went to a burlesque show and she said that she couldnt understand why i wanted to go to something like that at a time like this (maybe because of the war? Who knows!), and today I was off sick from work and she had a go at me for not calling her earlier in the day, I told her she was being ridiculous and why would I need to call her?  She got in a strop saying that she wasn't going to call me anymore.  Then she said I need to start caring for someone other than myself.  I really don't get it and I'm sure most normal 36 year old women don't have to deal with this bullshit.  Don't get me wrong, I love my mom and I'm grateful for any help she gives me but I wish it didn't come with this crap. Am I being unreasonable here?  Or is anyone else's parents like this?

Edit:  just to add, we do tidy most days so when she comes down to tidy there isn't much to do.  And I wash things throughout the week like work clothes, she takes away any laundry that's there on the day she comes down to tidy so there might only be a couple days worth, sometimes I would prefer it if she didn't come and tidy because she moves things around and we can't find things, and she unplugs all our things so we lose settings on the router for example XD

2nd Edit:   Okay, after calming down a little I just want to clarify what I'm annoyed about.   Yes, my mom does tidy and do some washing for me.  No, I don't actually want her to because the house doesn't need it (and I have told her that she doesn't need to - she has a key and does it anyway) - I am annoyed because it feels like she she tries to dictate what I can and can't do because she 'does things to help me out' - sometimes it feels like I'm a kid still living with her.  I do tell her if I think she's being ridiculous but then I feel guilty. Hi All

For a while now I have always wondered if I had ADHD, however it was never really a problem because I had things in place to not make it a issue (e.g. my partner makes sure I feed myself and makes sure I remember to lock the door or turn the oven off, he makes me get up in the morning so I get to work on time...okay he's basically my mom lol) 

Problem now is I have a new job, I am now starting an apprenticeship in something completely different to my previous career so I now have to study and go to college.  I am noticing some of the possible ADHD issues are making things really hard so it's time for me to get a diagnosis and treatment.  However it looks like a really long wait on the NHS (some sources are saying over 2 years) and by that time I might have failed my apprenticeship :(  

Has anyone recently received a diagnosis privately?  If you have could you please tell me how long it took, where you went, and the cost please?

TIA. When I have SP episodes I sometimes feel EVERYTHING (except pain fortunately) - I can see things, hear things, I feel like I'm moving, I can taste things.  It's really terrifying

One time it felt like an intruder came into my room so I tried to escape, but I couldn't run, all I could do was crawl. So I rolled out of bed and I had to crawl the long way round my bed to get past the intruder and to the door.  He caught me, straddled my back while I was on all fours and slit my throat.  I didn't feel any pain but it felt like I was choking and I could feel the blood dripping down my chest, down my arms, pooling into the carpet.  I was trying to scream at my SO to get up and help me because I was aware that he was still fast asleep in bed, however I managed to wake myself up and I was back in bed but terrified and crying.  It took me a few hours to get back to sleep and had flashbacks all day about it.  

Thankfully vivid episodes like this are very rare, I feel for people who get this regularly because I'd be a nervous wreck if I had to deal with this on a regular basis. When I say 'people still working from home' I don't mean EVERYBODY, I just mean the people who refuse to come back to the office leaving everyone else to deal with the shit.  For example, my job is impossible to do purely from home,  somebody needs to be in the office to answer phones and to physically sort out the invoices and file them away.  So 2 of us are permanently back in the office and 2 people work permanently from home, what they do is come in once a week to collect new invoices and drop off completed invoices.  This means that they never need to answer the phone, never need to gather information for other members of staff, never need to make payments, they just do the nice easy job of putting on invoices.   The 2 of us who are in the office are overworked and stressed out and the ones at home are blissfully unaware.  When they were told to come back to the office they refused saying they didn't feel safe  YET THEY SEE THEIR FAMILIES AND GO OUT FOR PUB MEALS!!!  And another ridiculous thing - they were fully vaccinated way before the 2 of us in the office...surely if it was done based on risk to persons then they should have been bought back into the office when they were vaccinated while us 2 worked from home until we had our vaccine? 

I'm not sure if my rant is justified but it doesn't feel fair and feels like they're taking the piss.  Please tell me if you think I'm being a douche saying this, maybe I'm just being bitter.I’m having trouble writing the introduction for my intro to psych final paper. The instructions are as follows: 

“The content of the paper should contain:

     A. Introductory paragraph

          a.  The introductory paragraph should include the observation that led to the subject of the project, and some background information concerning 

               the subject of concern.

  B. The hypothesis

     C. The method of data collection. The data collection cannot be collected online.

          a. Population/Sample

          b. Number of subjects

          c. Where and when data was collected

          d.  If a survey, include the survey question

          e.  Report data collection results

     D. A comparison of two outside reference sources

     E. A conclusion

APA style is written in 3rd person, past perfect tense.

The paper should be grammatically correct, with correct verb tenses, and NO MISSPELLINGS!!!!!!!!

If your paper is not grammatically correct, or has misspellings, I will deduct 50% of the total score for the assignment.”


The observation I made was that a large amount of students listen to music when studying and hypothesized that it helps them focus, so the survey question I asked was “does listening to music help you focus when studying”. I have NO idea how to write the introduction for this and am completely lost. I’ve been racking my brain to come up with something and I can’t think of ANYTHING. I’m having trouble with my final project (paper itself isn’t due for a couple weeks, I just have to come up with an idea by the 26th) 

The directions say to make an observation and come up with a hypothesis based on it, and then to go out and collect data. This is what the directions state:

“The introductory paragraph should include the observation that led to the subject of the project, and some background information concerning 

               the subject of concern.

  B. The hypothesis

     C. The method of data collection. The data collection cannot be collected online.

      1. Population/Sample

      2. Number of subjects

      3. Where and when data was collected

       4. If a survey, include the survey question”

I’m having trouble making an observation. My professor told us to “just go out and make observations”, but I’m not sure how to do that and she wont specify the directions very much. 
(she’s honestly not a great professor, if we ask her to be more specific on directions, she’ll just give us another example that’s not very helpful, a lot of us are also saying that she moves too fast for us) 

Any ideas or advice on how to make an observation?. I decided to redo a bunch of parts in my story and it switched all the previous text that was normal to italics. Is this a bug or is it normal?. My middle school used to make me do this kinda toxic behavioral therapy thing where I was forced to sit in a room with other kids I didn’t want to be around and play card/board games or be forced to have a book read to us. The books were usually about these four kids(I’m not sure why I remember this but the kids in the books were named james, jesse, Evan, and Molly, can’t remember the name of the garbage series for the life of me though) and in the books they had “behavioral issues”(common autistic behaviors) that needed to be “fixed”, and sometimes growing up I would find poorly written books on autism in my parents shelves. anybody else have to deal with this and if so what was the book so I and my friends and family can avoid them?. He eats with his eyes by blinking so would it come out of his eyes, or would he just blink and vomit teleports where the food was, or would it come out of his mouth?. I have somebody in my family that is mildly narcissistic (still narcissistic nonetheless they also won’t treat their ADD which causes more issues of anger for them ) and the other day they snapped at me. And I just decided not to react whatsoever because I know narcissists love getting reactions out of people and attention. I felt AMAZING after doing it. A few minutes later they came outside and apologized and they seemed desperate. It was like I sucked every bit of their twistedness out and smashed it. Normally growing up I would cry if that happened, so I feel proud of myself for making this progress. I know they technically don’t age because they’re puppets but i wonder how old they’re depicted to be. My best estimate would be in their mid to late twenties. This is part of what led to their divorce. If I tell them not to do something they IMMEDIATELY do it anyway, which has led to massive problems and disasters.(one summer my cousin was staying with us and made it clear NOT to let her cat outside. My mom almost immediately let him out anyway and he disappeared for THREE DAYS, and it broke her heart, he came back thank god. She kept telling my mom not to do it again but she kept letting him out anyway and he ended up getting sprayed by a skunk multiple times) I’ll explain something as closely as I can and then 5 minutes later they ask me a question I already answered. If I tell them that I already explained and explain it again they get mad. I barely say anything anymore around the house because of it. I don’t talk about the things I like or my goals anymore because they don’t listen. I’m so burned out and I feel like I’m losing my ability to feel anything anymore. It says my storage is full, I’m not sure if that has to do with it. It was fine this afternoon, I’ve restarted my phone multiple times, and my service isn’t supposed to end or automatically refill for another 16 days or so. It’s an iPhone 11 any ideas?. I was forced to go to this really stupid thing called “social group” in elementary and middle school(went from 2nd to 8th grade) and I was forced to play card and board games with other kids I didn’t want to be around or friends with, instead of letting me do homework and talk with my real friends. At one point I lost the opportunity to go to the jazz orchestra concert I was going to be in because it was keeping me from rehearsals. I eventually got my mom involved so I only had to go 2 times per month. This caused me to develop self hatred and It made me hate socializing even more. As well as a problem disassociating/ a dysmorphia of my personality. I read about ABA therapy and some descriptions I’d read had matched my situation, but I wanted to get a second opinion on if this would count as ABA.Were the characters asleep and then reawakened after the welcome home project became a thing, or do you think they were awake and living their lives in the neighborhood the whole time? I want to know because of a comic/fanart idea.I have trouble reaching certain chords(usually fs and bs) and although I found ways to work around it from the app I use to play I want to be able to stretch and fully reach those cords so it’ll be more convenient. Any good hand and wrist stretches and recourses to help me reach better?. I know someone that is mildly narcissistic in my family, but not super bad so they’re easy to manage. It feels like if I like something they don’t or if I want to do something, they say just the right thing that triggers my anxiety or whine about it until they (almost) ruin it. Someone else thinks it’s partially narcissism and partially instinct to protect, as well as a “desire to be my hero”, but I’m not sure. I don’t know much about narcissism. Anyone else have this happen to them?.Suggest some techs and things, machines (mechanical or simple electrical), even if it requires coding, to build. Through trials faced with strength and daring high,  
One forges purpose firm 'neath Fate's sharp eye.  
Not things external grant our lives their due,    
But force within through which our powers accrue. 
  
By shaping fate to serve our inward steel,    
We rise above life's surge, its wounds to heal.
Eternity from within, life from beyonce -    
This sphere, this strife, our all to reap or sow.
  
So wield thy will with art and wisdom's skill,   
And thou shalt be thy master, fate thy thrall.
Let not life's pains thy inborn nature quell -  
Rather, through action say, "I live quite well!". The endless era of meaning. Being to different sucks. Dik energy. Kid energy. Pray, I beseech thee, one and all, to dispatch unto mine person a DM, for I yearn to partake in an intellectual and everlasting conversation on matters of life and the universe with a noble companion.Thus it stands, that the confounding nature of such discourse doth render it inscrutable to the masses. Henceforth, perchance, the words I doth utter in this present dialogue may also elude comprehension by those who chance upon them.

Especially since this is r/teenagers, where weak minds reside.Ask me anything I'm shakespearean, in other, rather simpler terms. O youthful hearts desire what their years entail, 
Of joys and troubles that past time assail: 
Of lessons learned and loves not yet mature,
And passions fluttering, an unsettled lure. 

At school they plan their prospects day by day,  
Of grades attain'd and careers shown the way.
Yet sometimes wander thoughts to drama's far,
Of kisses stolen 'neath a evening star.

Relationships they form, as birds their nest,   
Yet learn too soon love is not simply blessed.  
Breakups bring tears, new romance lifts the soul,
As feelings change and hearts their loyalty cajole.

They yearn for fun with friends on evenings free,     
From studies cares and family's eyes to flee.  
And mingling close where charms of each may show,  
Desires awaken and new passions grow.   

O youth, embrace life's lessons while you may,    
Its sweet and bitter fruits you've time to sway.   
Let wisdom temper passions rushing tide,     
And in your heart warm memories abide.

Go forth, my verse, where lively minds do dwell  
On r/teenagers page their thoughts to tell.
If it may bring a smile, my task is done,
From poetry of Shakes, the famous Bard of Avon.

Thank you for giving me a chance to be part of the r/teenagers family and write this delightful heartfelt poem!. The Bard of British lineage, yea, hath made a triumphant resurgence! Ha ha ha!. Verily, he was a wondrous youth of extraordinary mettle.I average on a 450wpm (around 2 pages in a regular book per minute).How are you doing today, dear immortal?. My friends, Ford, Tricia, and Zaphord, are panicking over there for some unknown reason while I'm trying to get this machine to make me some tea! What's happening everyone. And a very down-to-earth 30yo mindest at other times. 

(Autism attribution). I'm very angry about that. Made me angry fr.Why can't we build jet-shaped spaceships, and use electricity for the whole process, from getting to the tip of the atmosphere (as a regular aerocraft) to getting outside of it (using electric jets, and starting to operate as a spaceships at that level)?

I mean, I get it, super heavy parts and blah blah, but come on. We're talking about hiking the solar system here and building resuable, self-sustaining, and personal spaceships which one can feel like they're in the comfort of their home.

It's also efficient and good for the climate crisis (using less fossil fuels and liquid oxygen), and we can find endless ways to produce more renewable energies, from solar panels (primary) to pressure to a bunch of rats cycling to produce gigawatts of electricity a day, yet admitingly expensive at the beginning, and also find the most efficient ways to spend and use energy in which the absolute minimum is wasted. But this is only going to make us one step closer to it.

Making an Earthy environment, with gravity, an atmosphere, an ecosystem, and everything in an environment of a place on Earth (preferably Finland) is part of the challenges but are possible and fun to work towards and achieve.

It's even a more interesting and ambitious goal than the colonization of Mars, in a way, as it'll unlock our path to building our own, moving planet or life in space, therefore a bunch of cool shit (spacestations on different planets/moons, restaurants, and whole new world of exploration and advancement).Unless you want me to call the cops.For I am a lost soul, and my heart is failing in fulfilling fuller blossom and delight within this dream of life.People, personally.Autism + bipolar + anxiety = a very sad, confused, and aiming-for-impossible-seeming life.WHY IS NOT EVERYONE RUNNING AROUND AND PANICKING. THIS IS A REAL CRISIS. WE'RE CONTINUALLY DYING AND LIVING AGAIN. WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT. WHY AND HOW ARE WE HERE? THIS IS A REAL CRISIS. WHY DOES THE UNIVERSE EXIST? HOW DOES IT EXIST? WHAT'S THE ESSENCE OF LIFE? THIS IS A REAL CRISIS.I’m an autistic woman myself. 
Some autistic men do assault women and girls, yes, HOWEVER it has NOTHING to do with autism. These men/boys do not assault women and girls because they are autistic but because they have the mindset that women and girls bodies are sexual objects and here they have been given an excuse to do so. It’s because they are predators just like allistic men can be too. 

There is no difference between and autistic and allistic man assaulting a women and i hate this label has been put on autism. It’s so dangerous for autistic men (and people in general) as well as the victims. 

I’d say (and hope) the majority of autistic men would never even think of doing such a thing, BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AUTISM AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE WAY THESE MEN/BOYS VIEW (or have been taught to view) WOMEN AND GIRLS. 

If it had anything to do with autism wouldn’t autistic women be doing it to? (obviously they can but you know what i mean) Society is always looking for an excuse to hand out leniency to predators, undermine the experience of women and not charge men with assault and that’s just what this is.

Edit: there’s been ridiculous comments left where autistic men have interpreted this as me saying they’re the most discriminated against people more so than anybody else. That’s not what i said please don’t put words in my mouth especially ridiculous ones like that.Im really interested to know other autistics favourites of things and the reasoning. 

I personally like vanilla because:
1. I know I can count on it tasting the same
2. I know I can count on the texture not being super weird or different, like big chunks of chocolate randomly in the middle of a tub (chunks aren’t bad, but it’s not fun when I randomly find one when I didn’t expect it)
3. Most stores have it
4. The taste is overall good and simple
5. If I want chocolate or strawberry, I can add the syrups to it and nothing will taste weird! And I won’t have to buy a whole other tub of ice cream in a different flavour and feel forced to eat it.Does anyone else also get really annoyed when an allistic/neurotypical tries to argue and say that we aren’t autistic and just have some “special qualities” or “specific needs” then just list off autistic traits and the accommodations we use for them? I also get told that I just want to be autistic and none of the qualities or needs are actually signs of autism. How should I respond to the people who say that?. I got my septum pierced 5 months ago and it’s fully healed, however it does still smell a lot. I have no big problem with the smell, and I still do clean it, just not consistently twice a day anymore. Is there anything I can do to help the smell, or does it just come with cool piercings?. I was discussing communism with a friend today and they had asked about wages. I’m only a year into research about communism and I’m a pretty slow learner. I’m a communist society, would there be wages? Would people be played for their jobs or would their wages and work go towards the community and healthcare, schools, housing, food, etc… If there is actual wages with money (I know a big part of communism is also just getting rid of money all together as moneys system is very flawed), would people be paid different wages depending on jobs? Like, I would think that the wages wouldn’t be like super high or super low because that’s what communism is against, so would there just not be wages all together? Sorry if the questions don’t make sense I’m not the best at explaining XD thank you!. I’ve seen so many people, including communists themselves, say that communism is unattainable because of “human greed” and how it’s natural. Like, my thoughts are that greed and the need for power is taught through capitalist societies and how greed can make people richer and therefore more powerful. I just want to know opinions of other communists, because it’s hard when I’m getting biased opinions from some random anti-communist or pro-capitalist person. Is it natural in human nature or is it learned/taught by our capitalist society?. So it’s only been a month since I’ve gotten it pierced and this is my first like facial piercing or really any extra piercing, all I have is my ears and now my septum. I lost one of the ends and I can’t find it, but I don’t want it to slip out. What can I put on the end until I get a new stopper?.I bought my dendrobium a few weeks ago and some of its flowers are starting the wilt, it’s flowering time will end soon.

But how can I let it go into dormancy? 

Also because it’ll be in dormancy is it unwise to repot it? It’s currently in an ugly plastic pot and I’m wanting it into a prettier ceramic pot.I’m trying to not use plastic in general, and because I’m wanting to have this pond for wildlife I don’t want any micro plastics the wildlife will be in contact with.

But what are the alternatives?

My soil in that part is sandy with large stones in an almost constant shade.I’m trying to not use plastic in general, and because I’m wanting to have this pond for wildlife I don’t want any micro plastics the wildlife will be in contact with.

But what are the alternatives?

My soil in that part is sandy with large stones in an almost constant shade.Like it’s not a rumour, most of us guys have thicker and longer eyelashes than women.

So why is it considered a feminine trait?. Since I’ve left uni I’ve felt like garbage and I can’t really talk to anyone about it.

But I’m not very wealthy and here in the U.K. the line to get counciling is impossibly long, my gp even mentioned it.

So what are some good low cost alternatives?. Like it has a lid and stuff.

Or would that be unrealistic for most miniature orchids?

And if so, what miniature orchids would be good for an open top terrarium? Like obviously air flow wouldn’t be an issue, but humidity would be.

But what have you guys done?. They are the paphiopedilum orchid, maxillaria, renantheras, cattleya and the Cymbidium.

I currently have a dendrobium and twinkle oncidium.

But thoughts on the orchids I chose? The room I’m wanting them in has low humidity but has a south facing window so lots of light and heat during the day, but in the nights of winter it can be very cold, but I’ll have a heater in it to valence the temperature.

I do have other walls that have dappled light but still thoughts guys?. They are the paphiopedilum orchid, maxillaria, renantheras, cattleya and the Cymbidium.

I do have other walls that have dappled light but still thoughts guys?. I got like five from the bin at a garden centre for free this March and it’s time for them to come inside as it’s getting cold.

But they’re midway through growth and no where near flowering.

So I was thinking of making them into houseplants.

But what are they like?. I find vandas very pretty, but as I’m new I don’t think I can keep a true vanda as I’m I prefer my plants to be low maintenance.

And also having to water it multiple times a day in my very low humidity room would be unrealistic, plus they get very large and would swamp my room.

But looking into the renantheras I was thinking I could have this as a stand in for the vanda.

But thoughts guys?. Like have it planted with a thick layer for burrowing.
But is it like realistic/ethical?. I’m more of a visual learner so I usually go for books that have more pictures than words, I’ve done this since I was a child and continue with my other graphic design/art/other books in my collection.

But like are they worth it when the industry is so young and changing so much?

And if so what ui/ux books would be good and is more visual? 
I mean if it’s got more words than images I can find an audio version.I’m more of a visual learner so I usually go for books that have more pictures than words, I’ve done this since I was a child and continue with my other graphic design/art/other books in my collection.

But like are they worth it when the industry is so young?. I have a very shaded area in a corner that gets very little sunlight, I currently have ferns and woodland plants in there.

But the pond and bog area will take up two third’s of the area and the current plants prefer being on the dryer side.

I’m also wanting plants that’ll help with wildlife, the U.K. has a crisis on wildlife and I’d like to help with flowers, pollution, berries and also shelter.

Any thoughts guys?.I’m mainly active on fb dating so I don’t Have to pay an arm and a leg just to find someone. But ALOT of guys match with me and never fucking talk! It’s so annoying!!! Like wtaf, why are they on there and not talk! I literally have it written on my bio and my pfp,” DONT MATCH WITH ME AND NOT TALK.” It pisses me off😤
(And yea I don’t need to hear that dating apps suck, I’m disabled so I can’t work or go out much to meet ppl so I use dating apps). So I have ocd with salvia/drool/spit etc. I'm grossed out by the fact that my partner might want head and idk how I can do that if If I basically have a phobia of my own saliva not to mention his. I said I might be willing to do it in the shower since it's already wet and such. I just wish I was normal😞.

Im an autistic 22 year old women and I’m not promiscuous nor do I post provocative photos of myself online and yet the majority of men I talk to on dating apps always send a fucking dick pic. Like wtaf?! It’s not attractive at all, it’s a complete turn off and also women are not sex objects. We are human beings so treat us with respect and you’ll get love in return😤. Mr. Bubz current enclosure seems a bit small and there’s no front doors or sliding doors
Looking for enclosure recommendations with sliding doors or front doors so it’s easier to handle my bearded dragon instead of getting him out over the top of the tank. Also it would just be easier In general to have a tank with front doors. I did have a look at Zen habitats but looking for more recommendations. Any advice to appreciated.I’m finding it extremely frustrating how I can’t seem to find the “ perfect man”. I’m 22 and still a virgin, I desire an intimate relationship with a man that I love. But finding that man is extremely difficult, even for me being on the high functioning end of the spectrum. When I’m on dating apps, majority of the men like my profile but don’t talk to me or they do and it’s just because they want sex. It’s incredibly irritating. I just want someone to love and cuddle with. I dont really want to try a relationship with an autistic man because I’ve had experience with them being super creepy and having no filter when it comes to sexual things. I feel incredibly lonely in my love life. I wish I was queer but I can’t make myself like the same gender. It really sucks, and i just ant to scream and cry

Edit: what I meant by perfect man is not that he’s perfect cuz no one is perfect. I just mean by a man who is not wanting to have sex with something every five minutes. I honestly don’t know how else to say it. I wish I was sexually attracted to ppl regardless of what genitalia they have. I attract the most horniest, scum of the earth men and I’m fucking tired of it. I’ll literally talk to a guy and he seems nice and decent and then he suddenly goes from decent to a horny motherfucker who just wants sex/nudes and that’s it!! Like WTAF! I want sex to but I don’t want to fuck something every 5 minutes, like I literally get so mad I want to beat the shit out of these men. If I was queer I’d be able to date all kinds of ppl. Even women who Ik can be just as bad but they are less perverted than men in like a loud “im horny” kinda way. I feel like women would be better but I’m not sexually attracted to them which sucks! It feels so limited!!! I WANT TO DATE FOR A RELATIONSHIP!!! im just so fed up😫men need to chill tf out. I’m confused. Theres a lot of websites that are giving me mixed information about what greens are good for bearded dragons. It’s frustrating me because idk what is bad and what is good. Is there any trusted website or advice that gives truthful information about bearded dragons diet. Yesterday I fed my beardie Bok Choy with dandelion leaves, chopped celery, carrots, vitamin dusted superworms, a few strawberries and calcium spray. He ate half of it so I’d say it was a success but still any advice helps. I want to give him the best of everything. Ppl who have hurt me from the past keep saying I use my autism as an excuse for my past actions and behavior (I was diagnosed later in life). I tell ppl I have emotional issues and a hard time understanding social situations and they tell me I’m using it as an excuse. I hate having autism, I just want to kms. I hate feeling this way about something I should be proud of and accept but then I have ppl like this saying these things to me. Idk if I am or not, I’m trying not to. I can’t help that I’m me. I just want to die Im so mentally tired of this. I use uv resin, I was wondering how to not let colors mix when pouring. I’ve seen other ppls uv resin pieces where the colors are not mixed and I was wondering on how to do that. I’ve tried using putting to separate the colors but the putty just stuck to the mold afterwards and was a pain to get out. I tried leaning the mold but then the resin just slants. Idk what else to do to get it to not mix. Any advice helps. Also how long is the next season? I don’t want to wait 2 years😫. (22f Autistic)
I ended up getting a thrusting rabbit vibrator from Temu because I didn’t want to buy a expensive vibrator for my first time. The one from Temu works just fine but it hurt to put it in. I didn’t have any lube so I used water and I horny enough to be wet but it still was way bigger and harder than I thought it was going to be. The thrusting was disappointing, it was like backwards thrusting, and the rabbit portion of it was what got me to orgasm. It was completely different from other orgasms I experience. The ones I experience without the vibrator wade deeper and last longer. I’m guessing the vibrator gave me a clitoral orgasm, it was much more shorter but weird. Idk it something I’ve never felt before. I’m a bit disappointed as I though I would like something inside me but maybe not idk. I’m still a virgin so maybe a real penis would be softer?. Ok as I mentioned earlier not all ppl who use the puzzle piece symbol are wanting to hate on the autistic community, some autistics and the majority of the people outside the autistic don’t know that that puzzle ribbon is bad, so instead of getting angry and yelling at ppl on here or anywhere, maybe try to educate them and try to get them to understand why it’s bad. I’ve seen a lot of posts where other autistics post stuff with the puzzle ribbon and y’all just start attacking them when they arnt even thinking about it being related to autism speaks. Like y’all need to chill and stop being so angry, it isolates ppl and makes them not feel wanted. Plz just be kind, it really hurts me to see this community be so nitpicky about this topic, let’s just try to understand each other’s perspective. So Ik a lot of the autistic community absolutely hates the puzzle symbol because it associates with autism speaks, but not ALOT of ppl outside the community really understand or know that it is associated with a bad thing nor do they wish to cure anyone who has autism. My mom was going to get a tattoo with my name and the R at the end of my name goes into the autism ribbon. I told her that that symbol is offensive and how it regards to autism speaks which is a company that it’s goal is to cure autism. She was not aware of that and told me a different POV, that ppl who see that symbol are not thinking of it as something of autism speaks but as a supporting symbol of autism. I think a lot of you assume that ppl who know the ribbon/puzzle piece symbol think that they want autism to be cured or that autism is bad but it’s the complete opposite. The ribbon and puzzle piece symbol has been around for a very long time and a lot of ppl associate that with the support of autistic individuals. I just think we need to be more open minded about this stuff. Ppl are not using the symbol to spread ill will towards autistic ppl, it’s for support, they see it as support. The only ppl that are making the symbol bad is the autism speaks company.

Just wanted to say, no I don’t support autism speaks or any of that bullshit, just saying y’all need to stop being offended by things and see it from a different perspective. I feel different and like I don’t fit in with other autistics. I’m not queer, I have different political stances than other autistics, I don’t feel autistic enough to be in this community, I have ocd, major depressive disorder and sensory processing disorder. I wish I was never diagnosed, although it gave me some relief to finally know who I am, but still I don’t feel worthy enough to be in this community. I hate myself, I want to die. Being late diagnosed with autism as an adult is hard, very hard. Finding therapy and therapists that work with autistic adults is extremely hard because a lot of them work with children! Like wtf, autistic children turn into autistic adults if doesn’t just go away! It’s bullshit! Along with my autism I have ocd, major depressive disorder and Sensory processing disorder. Finding an occupational therapist for my SPD has been a huge struggle since ALOT of them work with children instead of adult and I find that to be absolute bs, like why can’t adults get the same therapy as children with asd??? What is wrong with the system, it’s needs to change. So my male crested gecko abel exhibited this breeding behavior this morning but biting my arm and making the grunting noise. He’s never done this before and it just started today. I don’t own any females at all so idk if he’s just horny or what, it was very odd. He’s usually very tame and easy to handle. So I’m part of a instagram animal jam community where there tends to be a lot more autistic ppl that I don’t know about. Around this community there tends to be a lot of drama unfortunately and I bear the forefront of it from other autistic community members. A lot of them say that I use my autism as an excuse, or that I play the victim and even question if I’m autistic at all. It makes me very sad as Ik they are human but I thought since we all autistic that we would have more sympathy for each other. It makes me incredibly sad. I don’t use my autism as an excuse, I just say like why interpret words differently and emotions differently and they tell me I’m not autistic or that I’m making excuses. I fucking hate it! It’s makes me hate myself! On top of that I’m clinically depressed. It makes me question if I really am autistic but Ik I am because I was diagnosed with it, and I’m on SSI and with IRIS and all this extra help that normal ppl don’t need. I’m just sad, I hate being told that I’m not autistic or that I’m making excuses. I have autism, ocd, depression and sensory processing disorder, im done fighting, there’s no cure and I can’t live like this anymore, I want to die but I scared of going to hell. I want to overdose on either trazodone or melatonin those are my only two options. I need to know how much trazodone would be enough to kill me or make me very very sick. Plz help me if you really care I need to know. So i was just wondering if anyone else has oral sensory issues with saliva/spit
I have an extreme oral sensitivity to saliva/spit and drool. It’s a huge trigger for me when I see someone who is really spitty or drools, like it makes me physically ill and is super disgusting. It also causes a lot of issues with me eating because of the salivating to where I have to take something to calm myself down
Also it causes anxiety with brushing my teeth because there’s something in my mouth that’s causing saliva, so I don’t use toothpaste at all, but instead I use non foaming, no alcohol mouthwash because it’s like water so there’s no foaming or anything. And brush my teeth in the shower
So if anyone has saliva sensitivity, that’s a good option instead of toothpaste. I have autism, severe ocd, severe SPD, depression and anxiety 
I have tried every medication there is for my mental health, every therapy Andy thing you could think of
I am going to try ketamine but if that doesn’t work, well I’m going to k*ll myself or try to make my life as short as possible because I can’t live like this, I can’t work around it. I want a fucking cure! A CURE!!! And if this ketamine doesn’t work, I’m ending my life or try to get cancer or some other life ending disease. I need to know if anyone has had success with ketamine treatment with ocd, plz anyone, if this ketamine treatment doesn’t work I’m killing myself and I need answers. There is treatment with ketamine for ocd. Look it up, I need answers I need help, my life literally depends on it. So I'm highly considering a ketamine treatment for my severe OCD OCD has taken my life, everything away from me that enjoyable and basically my will to live, I need advice on this new form of treatment, has anyone with ocd tried it? Does it work? Are the results long lasting?
Any help is needed because honestly this is my last hope. So I’m highly considering a ketamine treatment for my severe OCD
OCD has taken my life, everything away from me that enjoyable and basically my will to live, I need advice on this new form of treatment, has anyone with ocd tried it? Does it work? Are the results long lasting? Any help is needed because honestly this is my last hope. Would if be ok to use a heating rock for my crestie? It gets rather cold in Wisconsin during the winter, I do have a heating pad that sticks to the side of the glass all the Time on his enclosure but I feel like he’s still cold, of course I would put like a pad or towel over the heated rock so it’s not too intense, but I would want to check first google was no help.On saturday I traveled over six hours and about 574 km to cologne to see the Pet Shop Boys who not only happen to be one of my favorite bands but also my special interest.
The concert was fantastic! I had such a good view and I was stimming the entire time from pure happiness and excitement. I didn’t think I would cry but as soon as they came on stage the tears were just bursting out of my eyes.
And now I can’t stop crying because of the post-concert depression.
I've been to several other concerts before so I already know this somewhat sad and empty feeling the day after but this time it’s so much worse.
I can’t even really tell what it is exactly that makes me feel so devastated.
It was my first time seeing them live and being so close to my special interest was incredible and now it feels like they got taken away from me.
On sunday I traveled back home and I felt like crying the entire time but I somehow managed to pull myself together because I had a stranger sitting next to me in the train.
Now it’s monday afternoon and I did nothing the entire day but lying in bed, listening to the Pet Shop Boys and crying (with some breaks in between). I didn’t shower, didn’t brush my teeth, didn’t eat. I feel greasy and I’m hungry but I'm too drained from the sadness to do anything against it.

I'm not sure what I expect from making this post. Maybe someone had a similar experience and can give me some advice on how to handle this feeling. Maybe it will make me feel better to get these feelings out of my body by writing them down. I don’t know.It’s not easy considering I started over 7 years ago. I also feel like I will relapse again soon but I try to get better. I know, i'm nothing but a disappointment to you but I hope you can be proud of me one day.This might sound super awkward but at the end of the day I think it's funny.

For context, my university has free condoms for students to take. You can find them in baskets scattered around campus. So yesterday, my classmate was talking about how she and her friends found one of these baskets, so they took a handful of condoms. Using my master detective skills, I came to the conclusion that the conversation topic was condoms, so I was allowed to talk about condoms at that moment.

So I was like "yeah I always carry a condom on me" and pulled a condom out of my backpack and showed it to my table. My table started laughing, so other tables asked me to repeat what I said. I once again said I carry a condom on me and showed other people. The whole room was laughing and shouting in surprise! However, my goal wasn't to make people laugh, it was just to contribute to the conversation. So I started to ask what was wrong while still waving the condom around in my hand. My friend across the room told me to put it back in my backpack, and when I did, the laughter died down after a few seconds.

Apparently, even if you're talking about condoms, you're not supposed to pull out a condom **in class**. I'm not sure if that's the case for all classrooms or just that specific class, but I learned something new yesterday.So I'd say I get a crush on someone once a month, and generally I have no problem telling people I have a crush on them. Like, it would be awesome if we were more than friends but I just mainly want them to know that they're a very special person to me and I enjoy everything about them. However, my online friend made a joke and said I must not know what a crush is if I get them ALL the time. I thought about it and maybe I'm just confusing having a really good friend with having feelings for someone? What do you all think?. I have to drive everyday, usually to school and then to after school activities or volunteer work. However, driving can be very stressful for me because of other drivers. 

For example, when I'm at stop signs or any other intersection where I have to wait my turn, I usually wait until no one is coming or until the next incoming car is very far away before I cross the intersection. This is because I have a hard time judging the distance between myself (and my car) and others. However, when I do this, it makes people really mad, and sometimes they honk their horn at me, which stresses me out even more. Yesterday, a car behind me at a stop sign got tired of waiting so they zoomed around me while laying on the horn.

When I drive, I rarely go more than 3 miles over the speed limit, because I feel really bad about breaking the rules. People around me usually go at least 5 miles over the speed limit, and when they get behind me, the usually tailgate me. I'd say I get tailgated at least once a day. This makes me nervous.

I was thinking about getting an "autistic driver" bumper sticker for my car so people would be more understanding. I already have a student driver sticker, but at this point I'm not really a student driver anymore. Does anyone have any experience with driving with an "autistic driver" sticker on their car? Have people treated you better or worse? One thing I'm afraid of is that people will intentionally be mean to me if they see an "autistic driver" sticker, so if that has happened to anyone please let me know. Thank you.Lately, I've been feeling like an imposter. I feel like I'm not "truly" autistic or that my autism isn't prominent enough to even mention. I get caught up in not fitting some trait, and then wonder if I'm even autistic at all. This leads to me feeling like I don't deserve the accommodations I have. It's hard to explain, but I *know* I'm autistic, but the problem is I don't *believe* it.

Has anyone else had this problem? How did you overcome these feelings, or how are you working through it?. So, if I were to order at a Mexican/Salvadorian/Peruvian/any other Spanish speaking country-based restaurant, and I know my server speaks Spanish, would it be rude/annoying to try and order in Spanish? I want to practice my Spanish but I don't want to be insensitive.The title pretty much says it all. I have an acquaintance (they're not really a friend, just someone I know) who I've been sitting with at lunch since school started. However, she's just... *boring*. We don't have any common interests, and I've tried to give stuff that she likes a try but I can't get into any of it. I prefer to talk with new people and make new friends, while she likes to just sit at an empty table with only one other person and not talk to others. There have been a couple times where she had to do something during lunch so I had the chance to meet new people, which I've enjoyed 100x more than sitting with her.

I also tried asking if she has any other friends that she can sit with during lunch, but from the sound of it, I'm her only friend.I looked through my yearbook the other day and was surprised at the amount of people who didn't smile in their pictures.

Doesn't the photographer ask you to smile? And do you get pressured into smiling if you just say "no"? Why do you choose not to smile, and how does the whole situation play out?. Hello everyone, it's the sub owner here. I'm thinking of putting more effort into this sub, starting with a new avatar. If you have any nice pictures of clovers (that you took yourself), consider sending them my way for the new sub avatar! Full credits will go to you in the sub description.

Thank you! Happy searching 🔎🍀. In creative writing, I've been pushing myself to write about things that aren't immediate to me. I've had a lingering idea for a story but was too nervous to write it because I was afraid it would just be full of stereotypes.

One of the main characters is a 16 year old 2nd gen Ethiopian girl living in a quickly developing city. What are some things I could add to make her more realistic? This could be anything like her general attitude towards school, her relationship with her parents, what she thinks about America, feelings of being left out, ect ect.

Any help from second gen immigrants is appreciated, especially from Ethiopian or East African Americans. Thanks!.

Any help from second gen immigrants is appreciated, especially from Ethiopian or East African Americans. Thanks!. I can get why people say, "edge sucks, chrome is the best." Yes, I do think chrome is better, but only in some context. For example, Microsoft Edge's pdf viewer is far more superior. It has a built in text to speech feature, you can add text right on top of the pdf, it holds your place if you close the tab then go back to it days later, and many more. Bing isn't bad either. I will admit, I was a headache to use before, but now it functions the same as Google.

I'm not mad at anyone who prefers to use Chrome over Edge, but I think everyone should give it a chance.So, on Tuesday, there was an after school meeting for theater where I met this girl who we'll call Mia. I had actually seen her that morning in the hallway, and me seeing her again at theater was a "sign" (yeah I know, sounds super cheesey, don't judge me) so I asked for her snap. It was just something about how smooth she was, even just the way she stood was... Captivating? 

Right after the meeting I told 2 of my close friends who are in my really niche social circle, and as per usual they were cheering me on. Then, on Wednesday, this other girl and I were talking about crushes and I spilled because it's a big school, what are the odds of her knowing Mia?

But then today, Mia and I were snapping each other about how much we hate math when out of the blue she says "hey someone told me you think this might be more than friends, and I'm not really looking for that right now. We can still be friends tho, right :)?" And that just caught me off guard.

It's not the end of the world as it wasn't some super secret, but I'm just really *disappointed* that one of them went and told Mia, y'know? I would never expose them like that, so why would one of them do me dirty? Like I'm not crushed, but just feeling meh. Idk, I just had to tell someone.Let me explain why this is such a good thing:

First, management was always terrible. One manager literally _promoted herself_ and when the owner found out, she didn't have a problem with it. The new manager would then spend the entire day in "her office" (which was really the owner's office) and then would come out at the end of the day and collect tips that she didn't work for at all. Another manager was really mean to 2 people at work for literally no reason, like she'd talk to me being all nice then would whip around and start talking bad to someone else. I wasn't there for it but this manager finally left when she got in a HUGE verbal fight with one of the employees she had beef with. Then we ended up with the current manager.

Then, the boss was taking advantage of me being young (I'm 15) and actually **payed me less than minimum wage for 3 months** and would usually not pay me until a week later. Where I live, 15 year olds need a work permit to work and the boss would just say "she'd get to that later." Turns out she did this so I wouldn't be able to work anywhere else because no permit. And when you're 15 you can only work a certain amount of hours per week; sometimes I would work double the legal hours.

Finally, the current manager is just a pain. She's just annoying in general but, hey, can't really do anything about that. But when I told her that sometimes I might forget things or maybe mess stuff up because of my ADHD, she started to baby me. She would tell me how to do the literally basics of the job when I clearly was one of the best people at that task. like, I could do it in my sleep. The last straw was today when I couldn't understand what she was saying (I kept losing focus when I was trying my hardest to pay attention) and she just yelled "why are you being so difficult!?" Later, she gave me 3 pieces of paper to use as dividers when normally the dividers are just one piece of folded cardstock. I asked "what am I supposed to do with these?" And she yelled "use your common sense! Are you dumb??" And a few customers started snickering. 

I told my mom what happened and she said, "you know, you don't have to show up anymore," and I realized I wasn't there getting payed crap to be treated like crap, so I'm finally quitting! Whatever happens there is not my problem.After a serious slump in the winter, spring has shown me it's time for new beginnings! This spring I:
- Got a job
- Finished the quarter with a 3.8 gpa
- Was approved to take AP Psych next year
- Washed my hair by myself (really big thing, hair washing is a sensory problem for me)
- Made new friends
- And on Wednesday I get my driver's permit!! This is huge because I thought my adhd would never ever let me drive.

- I actually wanted to make this post a while ago, but y'know I forgot...I've been on estrogen based birth control for 3 months now. At first it made my period last longer, but then it significantly reduced cramping and cysts. I should have had my period last week. Has anyone else had missing periods on birth control? And no, I haven't been having sex.My boss, Jim, still hasn't stopped screaming. I've lived without a dick, so can he :/. I'm really conflicted at the moment.

So there's this guy, we'll call him Ty. I've been applying for some jobs recently and I'm hoping to work at this one shop where Ty also works. Keep in mind Ty is very respectful and helpful and from what I can tell, kind. 

We've been chatting a lot more ever sense I asked him for advice on applying for jobs, managing money, red flags while working, ect ect. While we were catching up he invited me to his place and my parents are actually ok with it.

We've been talking a lot today since I met him at the shop he works at and got to know what I'd be doing if I got a job there. Then he brings up thc. Hear me out: I'm not against hemp/thc/cannabis/marijuana or anything like that as long as you don't drive under the influence or become violent with it, like alcohol. But I am against the smoke. I have moderate asthma that seems to be worsening every year. He smokes and that would really not be good for my health. He went on about different ways of consumption because again, he's respectful. But he still wants me to try it.

What should I do? Say yes and only consume a little bit? Say no and just play video games with him while he's still high? Or do I just blow off our hangout and make things tense between us?

Tl;dr: friend wants me to try thc, and my decision may make or break our relationship as friends and possibly co-workers.

Update: I said "dude, please respect my decision. I don't want to smoke." Fortunately, he was as respectful as he normally is and replied with "okay, I clearly can't convince you of this but for the most part it's pretty safe, even if you have asthma like you and me. I respect your decision to not smoke, but I know from experience that it doesn't fuck u up you feel me

I will get extra eddies in case you would like to try them on the day, but beware, they are POTENT 😂😂 I'll make sure you're safe though that's the number 1 concern". So far this has been the best birthday. My mom bought me lots of makeup and took me to hot topic (which was an _experience_ for her) and I played video games with my dad. I've also gotten several birthday wishes which is great bc normally ppl forget my birthday.

So yes, it's been a good day. Going to update my age right after I post this.I have to write a 2 page paper about 3 of my core values in 2 hours and 19 minutes and I couldn't care less... What kind of fluff/bs can I add to lengthen my paper?. I have to take personal finance because it's required to graduate. Even though I KNOW the material, I bomb every test. I just want to get it over with but it's dragged my GPA. As of now I have a 70 (C-) along with all As. The only thing keeping me from an F is the petty assignments that practically give out As.Like I'm not complaining. At least I can have a debit card. But I have to be driven everywhere and 5 times out of 6 my brother has tag along with me.

Also, I'm the youngest in my grade. I won't be able to drive until halfway through my junior year and everyone in my grade has a real job (compared to me selling stuff on Etsy). But at least I'm not in middle school...So I was on a date with my GF and I offered to go to my dad's place (he wasn't home and it was only a few blocks away). So we get there and I'm being all awkward and I just said "fuck it" in my head and just kissed her mid sentence. Then one thing led to another and I fell off the couch and screamed "THAT WAS REALLY COOL BUT I NEED TO GET MY INHALER!" I also gagged when she put her tongue in my mouth and that was... fun. But other than that I had a GREAT time and now I have love marks on me. This post is a mess but so is my brain right now because I literally cannot believe what just happened!!.So I have a lot to tell. First I would like the story of the old cataclysm back just after rauru and Sonia’s time. I think the ancient hero on the tapestry would be the “hero” and Sonia’s child (which was not shown in totk but did exist) would be the goddess’s incarnation. The Sheikah also existed at this same time so they are in the process of building the divine beasts and guardians. The old champions would also be shown. This would be 10,000 years before totk and botw.
The ancient hero, I would like to know about. Was he a lomei? I did notice similarities between his green skin and ganondorfs, and the zonai clothing made me think maybe he was the last of its kind and got adopted by zonai? His tail also matches with the demon dragons tail too, and the diadem on his head would be a placeholder for a secret stone (like ‘dorf). I would also like to know about the dragons. I want to see who they were before and why they turned. Did they do it for a holy quest in the name of hylia?

Let me know how to further develop this!!. It sucks. He was a ***** and we don’t deserve to be called after him. Vote for a new name! 

For a bit of context: Asperger was the guy who “discovered” it. He basically kept all the high functioning people with autism and sold the rest to be killed by the nazis. I had nightmares every night until I was about seven years old. I then learned to wake up when I was too scared.
I later learned to, instead of waking up, control my own dreams (lucid dreams which originally weren’t) 
Controlling them still requires the most amount of concentration I have ever used and they are always imperfect
I can decide where to go and what do to, how the world is and what people or objects do, but I end up forgetting everything in a few seconds so they don’t follow a straight line.
My dreams are weird as hell still, like a surreal painting. I have been trying to solve ancient hero’s green skin and noticed the similarities between him and ganonsorf + kotake and koume. Is this normal?

My mother uses my autism as an excuse to skip lines at airports and similar. Because of the country I’m in, I also get coupons and get to skip lines at theme parks

It also makes me very embarrassed and uncomfortable. Why do I have any more right to do these? It’s not like I should be pitied. Hi I’m autistic and ADHD. I get along with both ND and NTs very well, so I’m happy to share helpful tips. My mother uses my autism as an excuse to skip lines at airports and similar.

It also makes me very embarrassed and uncomfortable. Why do I have any more right to do these? It’s not like I should be pitied. If you have trouble with loud or sharp sounds this might help

There are some items named calmers that can reduce stress by filtering sharp sounds, the perfect autism tool. They helped me manage stress. Just wanted to share this cause it’s helpful, they allow you to still hear while reducing anxiety. My psychologist recommended them to me, apparently they helped others with the same problem.Has this happened to any one of you guys who might be crips? I ask as a tree-top PIRU.My husband and I are both gonna be skipper from “Gilligan’s Island.” Anybody else wanna be skipper with us? Maybe a few Gilligans out there? Neither of us have the BMI to be anything but a skipper. Secretly wanna be Mrs. Howell. Well anyway what y’all doing?. I grew up playing piano. I had all the Tori piano books from little earthquakes to choir girl. I’m trying to re learn the songs but, as my fellow piano players know, the transcriptions in those first few books weren’t exact so sometimes it required listening to the song and changing transcriptions. What I ask is this: Muhammad my Friend was one of the more correct transcriptions but I can’t find it anywhere. I can still play the intro but do any of you have like the first part when the actual song begins or can tell me the notes? I’m embarrassed kinda that I can’t seem to pick it out by ear. It just doesn’t sound right. Any help appreciated and let’s talk about other songs too, which ones you like to play. I still have Winter and mother down, at least lol. Thanks y’all!. For me it’s probably any quote from Heathers or Sleepaway camp. What’s yours?. Last season it was Nynaeve. This season it’s Seanchan. Yes, I am aware of the glossary that is in all of the books, with pronunciation, but who really looks at that? And I haven’t done the audiobooks so maybe it’s different? Lol but I want to know which ones threw you off, ones that you pronounced differently and was, idk like “canon” for you?. Where could we have it at and what restaurants/wealthy families/gentrified neighborhoods will be our main focus of conversation for the evening?. But I just can’t decide who would play her the best? Who would be your choice?. I was a big time hater of the show, at first. Then I decided to reread the books, after years. I’m on book 8 now and I decided to rewatch the show again, in anticipation of the second season coming out soon. Love it or hate it, it’s my favorite fantasy book series and I was gonna watch it regardless. Well, after rewatching it, I fell in love with the show. There is SO FRICKIN MUCH foreshadowing to the books, even books way ahead of the time frame in the show and I am loving it! I guess I am seeing through a different lens, and being less myopic, idk but anyway sorry I was a hater. I understand why they had to make some changes and I understand COVID kinda messed hings up towards the end of the first  season. And although I don’t agree with some of the changes, overall I’m so thankful I’m getting to see these books on the tv screen, and I’m very much looking forward to the second season! That preview has me so excited! Love y’all!. Pep boys tried to run game on me. Usually I go to vannoys but do any of you have any better recommendations??? It’s a midsized suv. Ford. Much appreciated!!!. I have been following this sub with my husband for awhile. Watching what y’all like, the good deals, and what to avoid. We just made grocery’s there tonight shall and bought all the things (except Turkey and chicken which we get at BJs) and we saved about 60 dollars!!! Thank you guys so much! We love this group!!!. I know lots of you have been going without. Apparently several pharmacies in the area are in stock as of today. The two named above, I know coworkers who had theirs filled at both those locations today.We went to Shan Kishi in the Publix shopping center in Gulf Breeze proper based on a recommendation from some dumbass I barely know. The food was less than mid. Got several sushi rolls. Nothing special. Anyway they brought me a receipt for a certain amount and I get bank notifications so I saw they charged us EXACTLY 20% more on the ticket but didn’t tell us nor did it show, anywhere, on the ticket. I asked and they acted like they had no clue what I was taking about. But my bank showed that extra 20%. Is this normal? Have any of you had this happen at a restaurant in the area recently?. I have been taking 20mg of edibles every night for two years. I need to quit for reasons and how bad will I not sleep/withdrawal? I was told it was a wuss amount but I know y’all have really good experience. Should I ween? How should I? Thank y’all!!!. Do I present before the city council? Are their fees involved? (We are willing to pay) and have any of you had experience with this before??? Of course you would all be invited. It’s for my and a neighbors birthday. Thanks in advance!. Did any of you grow up in Alexandria and went to OLPS (our lady of prompt succor) in the 80s and went to Bolton in the 90s? I would like to compare stories.As I was cut off in traffic today and had someone almost rear end me, I thought how I could control my anger. I’m going through some new therapy and I’m trying to find creative ways of pulling me out of my anger. Anyway, a car cut me off on 12th in east hill, then flipped ME off. Anyway the same car was to the side of me going west on Fairfield, at the ninth intersection. They looked at me and flipped me off again. I thought “what can I do to not want to kill them?” I saw a r/houston post today and it inspired me. I unbuckled my seatbelt, took my money out my g, and I just got on that damn hood and twerked. Y’all. It felt so fucking good. Right before I lifted up my ass towards the car, they looked at me in admonishment, and I flipped them off and jumped back in my car. I feel healed. Thanks for letting me share.

Edit: many words. I’m performing exams today in my secret RV abortion office but I can’t find my speculum! Last time this happened, a nice redditor suggested I kill one of my prized ducks and fashion their bills with one, but they dead. What could I use instead? Help me, please.I would want Mariah Carey (not really a fan but she got that octave  range) to do Wuthering Heights

I also want to hear slim thug/Mike watts do a chopped and screwed version of Wuthering Heights. 

What would you want to hear?

Edit: a word.I’ve been leaving my boys outside overnight bc of the humidity and giving them morning sun. And they are thriving! I have a carnosa splash, crimson princess (reverting :() pubicalyx silver splash and an obovata variegated. And they are doing amazing. Is it the Florida humidity? How do you Florida hoyians do yours???. Is there another way I can make them? Steam in a pot with a lid and some water? Without the steamer rack? I know they will slightly brown on the bottom if I do it this way. They are crab soup dumplings. Any tips? I’m desperate lol. Thanks I’m advance!!!. I was wondering if any of you had experience with this? I’m going to a meeting this morning and not sure how to deal with that aspect. Last time I just shared and included I was autistic and so at the end of the meeting they acted like they understood but I don’t want to keep sharing “I’m autistic pls don’t touch me” at every meeting I go to. Thank you all!. Didn’t get a pic bc duh I don’t want to get hit by an egg but wtf is going on lately?.[Disclaimer: This was originally going to be related directly to autism and PDA, which it still sort of is, just less directly. Which is why I’m still posting on an autism sub instead of elsewhere. ]

[Disclaimer 2:Words are hard.]

Like, I get wedding gifts and other REALLY special occasions that only happen five or six times in your life, but what the hell are these presents I have to get you every year? You’re an adult with your own fucking income and you can very well pick out what you want yourself. 

I don’t want or need half the shit that I myself have gotten for these occasions, because most of it is just that—shit! 

“Oh, but it’s nice to be thought of.” Well, you can express that by calling me! On second thought—DON’T!! I’m letting that go to voicemail. Send me a text so I can answer it in a month or two when I’ve thought of an adequate reply. 

Ok, mother. I’m looking at you now. You said you didn’t want anything, but I know better. You just want me to SURPRISE you. Great, you don’t know what you want and aren’t going to spend any time thinking about it, but you’ll be upset if I get something you already have. And now that I have kids, I have to buy MORE things and pretend that THEY got them for you. COME ON! And I have to do this for your birthday, for Christmas, AND for Mother’s Day?! For fucks sake, can I just get you a card for endless endless breadsticks and call it a deal? Everyone else is on their own.

Edit: In case anyone was wondering, dad died. He’s already getting his endless endless breadsticks. No gift card required.I had the displeasure of seeing a mom and her 12-13 year old clearly autistic son interact for about 5 minutes, and it made me really uncomfortable. The boy sat down, and was doing nothing more than rocking and hand flapping, and his mother kept trying to get him to stop. At one point, she said, “Will you stop wigging out?” and even put her hands on him to make him stop. He was also trying to play on his tablet.

When he would try to communicate with her, she would shush him. I think she shushed him at least ten times in the five minutes I was sitting near them. She told him he was being too loud even though his voice was no louder than hers. I felt she was very invalidating and infantilizing toward him and it made me sad. I wondered if she had “Autism Mom” stickers all over her car and posted in her Facebook groups about how hard she has it. 

I guess I just wanted to share.

Edit: Someone said I posted this “just to get upvotes.” Lol what? No. I was thinking about the kid all day and wanted to share about it. I didn’t expect all the hate. This boy was QUIETLY STIMMING and got basically told he needed to push all that inside.

He didn’t do shit to merit the reaction he got from his mom, and I don’t feel I deserve the reaction I’m getting from some of you here. I mentioned I raised (in fact I’m still raising—they’re doing better now) 4 challenging kids. My kids had to do something crazy to get a reaction out of me, like punching of biting each other or breaking something. I would have been fucking overjoyed if any of them would have sat quietly in a chair rocking back and forth for five minutes, asking me a question now and then. But somehow I LACK EMPATHY if I’m upset that this lady told her kid to SHUT UP 10 times in five minutes because she might have been having a BAD DAY? That’s not an excuse to treat your kids like shit! What’s wrong with you people? 

Also, for those of you who would like me to “just chill,” trauma and PTSD are not things that you “just chill out” from. You can try posting on /r/wowthanksimcured.So I suspect very highly that I am autistic. I have for about 2-3 months now. I’m still putting pieces of my life together, but it all seems to point in the same direction. All through childhood I got called names like spaz, crybaby, etc., you know, because I would freak out over shit that other people didn’t. 

Fast forward to tonight. My 9 year old, who just had surgery to correct relapsing clubfoot on both feet—she’s wearing two leg casts and can’t walk—is sitting on the floor in the living room. My 14 year old, who already despises the 9 year old, and who I’m convinced is autistic, decides to start laying into her little sister yet again for this disruption to her environment. After a brief back and forth, the 9 year old starts wailing. Loud and pathetic and it wouldn’t fucking stop. It wasn’t long before I started freaking out internally. I wanted to scream, I wanted to hit myself, I wanted to run away. What I did do was go to the kitchen and start slamming the back door. Thank goodness I didn’t break anything back there. All the glass and wood is really old, and we are quite broke at the moment. 

After that I just sat down in front of the sink with my head in my hands and stared at nothing for I don’t know how long. People were coming in and out of the room and I barely noticed. It’s been a half hour since all that happened, and I still haven’t spoken to anyone, and if someone came up to me right now I don’t know if I could. 

Is this what meltdowns feel like? I feel horrible. If this wasn’t a meltdown (and I realize it was a short one if it was), I don’t want to experience the real thing. Anyhow, thank you if you read this far. I appreciate your honest but gentle feedback.

Edit: I forgot how good I am at masking. My neighbor walked by with her dogs (I went outside to get some air as I finished writing this post), and I was friendly as can be. Just flip that switch!. I’ll just casually be browsing Reddit then AAAAAAAAA!!! No, wait. That was a different post. Anyway, I’m just browsing along, reading the comments, and I can still scroll the comments on the post I’m on, and that’s it. The back button doesn’t work. The home button doesn’t work. I can’t get out unless I close Reddit altogether, and half the time I don’t come back. I’m on iOS btw.For context, my daughter had lost two friends now because of her friends’ parents overly harsh punishments, in my opinion. Today, her friend and her little sister came over to play for a couple hours. Her friend brought some art supplies, and her little sister brought her phone and a notebook. I rushed them out of the house to get them back to their grandmother’s on time. They forgot to grab their things on the way out. Just as we were pulling into the driveway, they realized their mistake. As a punishment for this minor infraction, grandma said that the girls can’t come over ever again. My daughter, who is 9 and already has a difficult time making friends, was crushed.  She punished my kid as much as her own, and for what? We live 5 minutes away, and they got their stuff back almost immediately. 

I see a kid’s social development as super important, not as a privilege. I say as long as the kids aren’t getting into anything harmful or illegal, they should be allowed together. Of course consequences should be had for small infractions, but this kind of punishment is just wrong to me and I don’t understand the thinking behind it. 

I want to know your opinions.I was assaulted by cops in 1999. I don’t feel like posting the details here, but I just posted the full details on Facebook under my real name, calling out the cops by name, sharing details of what happened, including how no fucking lawyer would represent me in an excessive force case at the time. My life has been really shitty lately, and I just DGAF right now what happens as a result of this. Fucking bring it. I’m a little nervous but mostly just steeled. This country, this world, it’s all going to shit. If I don’t fight for something then what’s the point?. They don’t explain this shit to you ahead of time. I had an appointment with my counselor on Friday, and I knew I needed refills on a couple of my meds, so I thought I would just stop at the desk and let them know. 

“Are you out of your meds?” I told them I had a few days left of one of them but I was pretty sure I was out of the other one (I set up my meds a week at a time). “Well, you have to call the med line and leave a message. Maybe one of our case managers will get back to you today. You shouldn’t have waited so long.” 

I’ve tried to get refills early before and got scolded for that, so I know that’s a big no-no. So I waited. I haven’t had trouble before, and I’ve never been referred to this fucking med line before either. What the actual fuck? So I’m out of my antidepressants, and I’m going to be out of town. Fuck me I guess.I just took a PALS class, and it brought back so many memories of things I have gone through as a nurse. Kids I have seen code, kids I have seen die. Kids I have taken to the morgue. Kids I have known that have died when I wasn’t there. I have been a nurse for 16 years, and maybe it has been the extra stress of the last 2-3 years, but it is hitting me extra hard right now. I have been working with adults for five years, but for some reason this PALS class was super difficult for me. I don’t even see a lot of kids in my practice right now. I just wanted to throw this out there. I am feeling extra sad for my babies and kids, I guess I am missing taking care of them, or maybe just extra sad about the ones I’ve lost. I don’t know. Hope everyone is doing well out there or finding someone to help them cope. It’s rough for us right now, isn’t it?. Between jobs, my wife is in the hospital, my marriage is falling apart, I’m taking care of four kids by myself for the time being, finances are a wreck, I have no friends, my mental health is in the shitter, I just need someone to talk to. My family has never really been there for me. I feel so alone right now. I’m trying so hard to stay afloat, to stay positive. Just need some positive words. Not empty words, but real encouragement.I am a Christian. I am embarrassed by the church at large, especially in recent days. I think all cases of rape should have the option to abort. A violation of that magnitude is devastating and to force a human being who has suffered such an intrusion to carry a baby to term is nothing short of abusive and making that person relive their trauma daily for 9 months straight. I think the notion that life begins at conception is delusional. If someone who has been raped wants to carry their baby, more power to them, but my support goes out to anyone who does not. The pro-life movement has gone off the rails and I do not want to be associated with it.

You don’t want to give the 11-year-old who naively slept with her 13-year-old brother the chance the live a normal life by getting out of it early? Just because you believe there’s a life in there doesn’t mean there is. Just because there’s a heart beating doesn’t mean it’s a human life. There are literally hearts beating in all of the things you kill for sport all the time. Fish, deer, mosquitoes. For crying out loud, Muslims, Mexicans. They have hearts, too, but a lot of you don’t seem to care much about them either. 

We need to back off of this abortion nonsense and start loving people like we were called to do. Don’t you see that the Pharisees were the moral police of their day? Tying up loads that they themselves couldn’t handle and loading them up on others’ backs? Stop being Pharisees and be like Jesus! Please!. Hebrews 11:13-16

13 All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. 14 People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. 15 If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. 16 Instead, they were longing for a better country—the United States of frickin' America. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared guns, bombs, and freedom for them.Someone that I've been developing a friendship with over the past two years might have a crush on me. We are members of the same club, and we tend to gravitate towards each other during meetings. Unfortunately, I recently came to the realization that he might have a crush on me.

When I showed up to the last meeting, he was engaged in conversation with another person, so I just sat a couple rows behind them. It's not like we seek each other out the second we're in the same room, and he has a lot of friends, so I don't ever expect to immediately have his attention. But as soon as I sat down, his best friend saw me, subtly got his attention, and nodded in my direction. My friend then immediately got up and talked to me until the meeting began, which I was fine with, but his friend's gesture made me start to think.

Two other near-friendships I had in highschool were ruined because they developed feelings and I wasn't interested. Now I'm really worried that he'll eventually confess to me, and I'm terrified that it will ruin our friendship if I don't turn him down in just the right way.

1. I'm aroace and simply not attracted to him.

2. I've never even had friends before, so my relationship skills are in their infancy as is. I wouldn't be ready to date even of I was interested.

3. I'm WAY too busy to maintain relationships outside of club meetings, even platonic ones.

I just need help expressing these reasons in a way that doesn't just sound like an excuse. I'm also really hesitant to say that I'm aroace because, even though I know he's not homophobic, I don't know if he knows what aro/ace means, and I can't rely on myself to give a proper lecture if I'm also panicking about how to reject him. I keep thinking to myself that I'll just say I'm a lesbian, but I don't want to lie, somone else in the club already knows I'm ace, and that feels like a wrong thing to do in general. I just want to be prepared because I don't want to lose my only friend. Any advice?. I had to leave and walk to a different building to sit because there were zero open tables on any floor. The chairs with arm desks are usually free, but they were all gone when I was there on Thursday. Are they coming back?. Everyone around me has this ability to read people and the world around them and use that knowledge to navigate life and excel at their hobbies and careers. They can look at a person or a process and instantly draw conclusions or ideas from them. My own mind feels so blank in comparison. I get NOTHING out of my surroundings or the people that I talk to. I struggle to form any conclusions that aren't practically spelled out for me. I'm so neutral about everything because I feel like I can't think for myself. It's like I'm living in a colorful world but can't see the color.

I'm 22. I'm about to graduate college, and the thought of going into the world without guidance is terrifying. I feel like I know a lot of things, but I dont truly understand them. My utter lack of intuition feels disabling. I wish I had a reference point to compare myself to because everything I do feels wrong. My mind blanks when I speak to people, and I am barely able to hold a conversation because of it. I thought learning as much as I could about people and the world would help, but now I just have all these pieces of information and no idea how to put them together in a way that would help at all.

How on earth do I fix this? I'm desperate to be able to interact with the world like everyone else does.I took ACG4111 FAR2 (the hardest accounting class) last spring, and I passed with a C. During this time, I was dealing with (unfortunately undocumented) medical issues due to severe burnout, and I feel this dealt a major blow to my performance in the class.

My major GPA is just barely enough to still get into grad school if I get all As in my current grad-level courses this semester. I'm going to try my hardest to do so, but I'm still really scared that a single A- could be the end of my hopes and dreams.

I have almost nothing left to take next semester, which is my final semester in undergrad, so I'm wondering if I would be allowed to retake FAR2 for a better grade, even if the old grade isn't wiped off my gradebook. As long as I'm still on track to graduate, I don't see why not, and I can't find any information on this in the student handbook.

I would ask my advisor, but I feel like this is a really stupid question if the answer turns out to be "no." Has anyone here ever been allowed to retake an upper-level class that you already passed, especially if you're an accounting major?. I am a fourth year accounting major, and I really want to apply to the masters program, but the application requires a letter of recommendation. I'm having flashbacks to the horrible anxiety of asking my high school teachers for letters of recommendation and would really appreciate some info.

I know it's common practice to ask a professor who knows you, so I plan to work hard and regularly attend office hours throughout the semester in order to establish some kind of familiarity. But is a casual teacher/student relationship not enough?

Also, are all professors able give LoR? I witnessed a music TA ask the prof for a letter, and he gave a reason why he wasn't qualified. One of my favorite professors is listed as an "Assistant Professor," so I'm worried I'll get the same response. Oddly enough, I found a LoR resource page for UF faculty that said even grad TAs can write them.

I guess I would just like to hear from those who have gotten a letter, especially if you're a business/accounting student. Am I overthinking this?. My sister got married last year. All of my in laws are from Brazil, and most of them speak very little to no English. I want to learn Portuguese so I can talk to them, and since they offer it at UF (POR1130), I figured this would be a great opportunity since it would be better quality than a language learning app, and at no extra cost.

The only trouble is that I'm a junior Accounting major and I'm trying to get into grad school this fall, so I'm very busy. I know language classes can be intense (as they should be), and even the intro course is 5 credit hours. It's also not offered during the summer, so I would have to take it on top of my regular coursework.

Is this realistic? I have no idea what the structure for a language class is when it comes to exams/assignments/general workload.

I also suck at pronunciation and I'm worried I'll lose points or something if they grade you on that. If this is going to wreck my GPA then I might have to stick to duolingo. Any advice or personal anecdote helps!. Let's get down to business

So I can pass FAR1

I'm starting to regret taking this damn class!. Here's a recording I got of the audio. It's not great quality, but it's the best I can manage: https://imgur.com/a/mf7i6qv

It sounds like a rock song (more specifically grunge or post-grunge) from the 90s or early 2000s. 2005 at the latest since that's when the episode aired.

The guy singing sounds similar to Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots), but I don't think it's him. I haven't listened to STP's entire discography, so it could be, but I think it's just someone who sounds similar.

The lyrics that can be made out in the recording are:

"I've run out of things that I could say

I really tried to see it your way

There's nothing left since you've been gone". My sister is really interested in bladesmithing, and she wants to go to UF. I came across some articles about UF's bladesmithing team winning some grand prize in 2019, but I can find literally no information about them other than that and a desolate YouTube channel. Does anyone know anything about the team? Specifically if it still exists and how to join it?. I'm not implying that masking itself is lying. Masking is an important tool for some people on the spectrum, including me, and my intent is not to paint it in a bad light. But I've noticed that, when I'm masking, I put a lot of effort into guessing what the other person wants to hear instead of thinking about how I would actually respond.

"Yes, I've read/watched X. Yes, it's one of my favorites." *When, in reality, I've never even heard of it before.*

It's not as simple as me just telling people what they want to hear. I know that sounds really manipulative, but I honestly don't have an ulterior motive when I do this. It's not even to make them like me. If anything, the ulterior motive is not having to replay a failed social interaction in my head afterwards. Actually, I think that's it. I think the reason I do this is because I don't want to "mess up," and I equate upsetting/disappointing someone with messing up.

"I'm sorry for what I did."

"It's no problem at all! No worries!" *When, in reality, I'm going to have a horrible time sorting out the mess they caused.*

It's really frustrating sometimes because I can't stand up for myself. I can't defend my beliefs or opinions. I can't even *have* beliefs or opinions because I literally compulsively agree with everything someone else says.

"[Political opinion that doesn't align at all with my own beliefs]"

"Yeah..." *When, in reality, I'm shocked that they would even say that.*

I know this is long and reads like a rant, because it kind of is. I'm just wondering if anyone else does this or knows how to stop doing this. I feel awful for being so deceitful and manipulative. Because even if I don't mean to deceive or manipulate, I guess that's what it is. And I want to stop.Semi-relevant context: I was diagnosed when I was like 8 years old (I'm now 20), but I was always totally oblivious to what was going on despite going to multiple therapies throughout my childhood, so I didn't even fully realize that I was autistic until I had a spur-of-the-moment conversation with my mom about it a couple weeks ago. I've been doing a lot of reading on hyposensitivities over the past few days because it's one of the things I somewhat struggle with. Namely tactile hyposensitivity, though it's not so severe that I can't feel any pain at all.

I don't currently have any hypersensitivity issues, though I distinctly remember being very sensitive to auditory stimuli when I was little. I've read that occupational therapy can help with hypersensitivities, and I did do occupational therapy as a kid, so maybe that's why I don't have that issue anymore. But I do also have an auditory processing disorder (that I've done and still do therapy for) that could be the cause of my childhood issues (meltdowns) related to sound.

The reason I bring all of this up is because I'm trying to figure out if I have an auditory hyposensitivity. I check all the boxes, such as seeking out loud and/or constant sound, having trouble retaining verbal information, etc. I almost never allow my environment to be silent, I listen to loud music almost constantly, I enjoy thunder and fireworks and alarms and sirens, and sleep best with white noise. I just don't know if a supposed hypersensitivity can turn into a supposed hyposensitivity, or if all the confusion is due to my auditory processing disorder and I really just have neither.

I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking for by making this post. I'm mostly just getting my thoughts in order, but I also want to see if anyone here can offer some knowledge on auditory hyper/hyposensitivity that will help me determine if I likely have it.

TL,DR: I think I used to have an auditory hypersensitivity when I was a kid, but it may have just been my auditory processing disorder. I now think a have an auditory hyposensitivity, but that may also just be my auditory processing disorder. Can hypersensitivities turn into hyposensitivities, or is it otherwise likely that I have an auditory hyposensitivity?

I'm sorry this may all come off as a lot, and it may not make a lot of sense, but I would appreciate any thoughts!. I'm a freshman accounting major. In my first semester (Fall 2020), I finished with a GPA of 3.77, and I completed 18 semester hours (14 of which were classes I had not taken already in highschool). In the *Fischer School of Accounting 2018-2019 Student Handbook,* it says this:

"Students will appear on the college's Dean's List if they meet a minimum GPA of 3.70 based on a minimum of 12 semester hours, or 3.50 based on a minimum of 15 semester hours."

So I definitely met the requirements for the Dean's List in the accounting school, but I never heard from anyone that I had made the list. Did something change since 2019? I asked some business majors about this back in early February without specifying my major and someone said I should get an email around mid February that I had made the list. That never happened. My dad asked around on facebook and aparently other accounting majors have had to specifically request their certificate? I'm expecting to meet the requirements again this semester, and I just want to know if I should be requesting my certificate every time I meet the requirements for the Dean's List. I'm going to talk to my advisor about this, but I wanted to ask around first in case anyone knew something. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!. I've been going through the process of applying for a minor in music history. I just went to walk-in advising, and I was told that the music theory placement test could potentially land me in MUT1241L - Aural Skills 1, which is for developing skills in sight singing and ear training. I really don't want to have to sing at all, and I'm worried that I won't be able to avoid it if I pursue a music history minor. Has anyone taken a music theory class and been made to sing? This might sound silly, but I really need to know.I tend to talk to myself a *lot.* When I'm with other people, I rarely say anything, but as soon as I'm alone, I switch to thinking out loud instead of in my head. Even if it's just something like "I'm going to make soup for dinner tonight." I believe this is because I can easily go off on tangents if I'm in my head, and I usually end up forgetting my line of thinking altogether. There have been many days when I've spoken more words to myself than to anyone else. I was wondering if this is something that other Te users do, or if anyone thinks this could be related to a different function.So, I'm a sex-repulsed asexual, and I have a clear idea of my boundaries when it comes to sex (or, rather, lack of sex). But when it comes to my aromanticism, it all feels really undefined. Asexuality has a sex-repulsed, sex-indifferent, sex-favorable spectrum, so I was just wondering if aromanticism had an equivalent. I know it's a bit harder to be repulsed by something as tame as, idk, kissing/cuddling/whatever romantic people do, but the idea of kissing mouth-to-mouth definitely disgusts me, so I was just wondering if there are aros who are open to romantic relationships despite not feeling attraction. I know this probably sounds really ignorant, but I really haven't explored aromanticism as much as asexuality yet, so I would really appreciate the clarification!.Anyone know where I can find a Dr Stein sweater, I’ve been looking for one. I saw one on AliExpress and Amazon but both where red and one wouldn’t arrive on time for Halloween so any help would be appreciated.Basically I want to reveal my feelings for a friend right before winter break and explain as explicitly (as my autistic as$ is Capable of) that despite these feelings I value our friendship over them.

Is this a good idea?. More to the question: has anyone been able to confess their feelings and get rejected but keep the friendship?. As far as ive observed I’ve not had romantic feelings for others. So far it’s only been sexual attraction but I can’t imagine a romantic relationship. I don’t even know what it feels like and the last few times I was attracted to someone it was aesthetic envy that I misinterpreted. Then there was a time I was projecting my feelings/desires for companionship onto others (obviously not telling them or acting on it) but this time I think it might be love. We share interests, aesthetic desires, we both love the same type of music, and I have no idea if it’s platonic or romantic or just another projection, IDK. If anyone has advice please share.Due to personal matters, despite my overwhelming desire to wear gothic clothing, to have lipstick and makeup I can’t, at least around my mother. So I’m asking if anyone knows any good black lipstick I get online along with great makeup remover and eyeshadow. Thank you for reading, awaiting responses to my query. (Lowercase “Q” look so weird). So here’s the situation. I am doing an internship and tomorrow is my first day, thing is though, I really hate wearing polos, the fabrics make my skin itch a lot. Anyone know any good alternatives.So I recently saw a polish movie called Fanfic and in the beginning the character is female but then they transition and I realize I still found them attractive and at school there’s a dude whose trans but is a femboy and I found them attractive for awhile. What does this mean, am I pans, bi, or something else. Ik I wouldn’t get sexually attracted to guy’s specifically and that I fall under demi land gray romantic. WHAT THE FUDGE AM I? Was I attracted because they were girls, or because they (one of them) were feminine looking. Idk I need help.Hi, I’m posting to inquire if anyone has good affordable recommendations for sensitivity headphones. I’m going to a concert for my favorite band (Ice Nine Kills) and it’s my first time actually going to a concert of that size so I was hoping someone could help.This is not against self diagnosis. I’m self diagnosed myself. But I’m getting really tired of people thinking autism is some quirky thing to joke about having. I keep seeing all of the jokes about having “the tism” and it’s making me so genuinely angry. My autism has me disabled. I’m delayed with many life milestones. I’ve never worked yet. I still can’t drive (I’m an adult). I can hardly function. And I see all of these people making jokes and it being some lighthearted thing. I don’t mind of course if us as autistic people make jokes but it’s starting to feel like everyone is. Even those who aren’t autistic. I don’t have many friends anymore (due in large part to being autistic) and every time I try to confide in someone about being autistic (which has been a big deal because I went my whole life without knowing) all they tell me is that they relate to autism or have traits. They don’t even ask me about my experience or listen to me talk about it. One of those people even has called herself “neurospicy”. Two of the people I’m thinking of lead such functional lives that I literally envy. One is very social, goes to grad school, has multiple jobs. The other has a stable relationship of many years, a good job, etc. and I know obviously you can be “functional” and still be autistic but as someone disabled by it and so behind it fucking hurts. I feel like us who are disabled and are more “severely” autistic aren’t at the forefront of the conversation. Instead the conversations are being lead or focused around these people. It’s extra slaps in the face because the same people who claim to have autistic traits now are the same people that throughout my life have made me feel weird for being autistic like I grew up with them, and whenever I would express autistic traits I was treated like I was weird. At this time I don’t want criticism as I am very upset over this. If you want to comment anything please be understanding and supportive. Thank you.I’m curious at what my fellow autistics feel about death. It’s the ultimate change and unknown. It often freaks me out and keeps me up at night (like it’s doing right now). I think about how I’ll never get to enjoy my special interests again and how I’ll one day just stop existing and that freaks me out a lot. Even the little things about it freak me out. Like how I’ll cease to do everyday normal stuff like breathing or eating or walking or listening to music. I can’t conceptualize existing any other way (which ik now technically ceases to be existing because I’ll be dead but you know what I mean). I’m used to life being like this and the way that it won’t always be this alarms the hell out of me. Really hope I’m not alone in this:(. I feel like my writing sucks even though I’ve had many people tell me otherwise. Writing is my Thing and yet all I can think about is how I’m not good enough at it and how everyone is a better writer than me. I want to be an author. It’s been my dream ever since I was a kid and I feel like my imposter syndrome is getting in the way of me putting myself out there and working towards achieving this goal. Any tips, advice, and support much appreciated. I tried to watch season 9 but stopped like twenty minutes in it was awful so I decided to rewatch season 8. The last time I saw it was back when it came out in 2019. I watched it with my shitty ex and wanted to reclaim it for myself. It’s interesting watching it again this many years later while I’m a different person now. I’ve made a lot of progress in terms of my gender identity since then (and while looking back on my past thoughts I feel like if I looked harder at some of my opinions on the cast back then it should’ve been more obvious to me haha) and it’s interesting seeing my views on people in the show shift since I’m watching it as almost an entirely different person. I really like this season for how authentic and how much heart it has. Really wish AYTO would do another queer season. I adore Basit with my whole heart what a lovely Individual. Also I know shit happened after the show supposedly but I wanted Remy and Paige to work idk the way Remy would look at Paige was so sweet. I also am a Max and Justin fan. I knew Kai and Jenna were toxic but holy shit it was worse than I remembered. Also I liked Jenna a lot more this time around watching and her arc of putting herself first was so nice:). My soul left my body when I realized they were actually doing thriller holy fuck. Jetpack blues and pavlove. That’s all I gotta say. In a million years I never thought they would play pavlove and the fact they did broke my brain. It’ll be my first tattoo:] when I was guessing what song I was gonna get for 8 ball, I said if it was a specific song, I would fr get a tattoo of it. I didn’t end up getting that song but I did end up getting my favorite and another really loved song so I’m gonna get them tatted anyways!. I’ve seen fall out boy three times (all at Darien). Prior to tonight, it was 2014 (one of my first ever concerts and one I referred to back then as one of the best days of my life) and a second time in 2015. When I was around 18, I stopped being a hardcore fan like I was in my younger years. Then when I entered my twenties, I fell in love with them all over again and became even more of a fan. 2022 was especially when that kicked back up and carried into 2023, when I reached new levels of loving them. 

You might remember my post on here from when they did 27 and I was absolutely crushed. 27 if my favorite song and it has been since I first became a fan. I used to be so sad that no live performances were out there (not realizing it had yet to be debuted). So when on tourdust it got debuted and I wasn’t there, I was devastated. I had to witness a lot of shows this tour that made me sad because I wished I could’ve been there.

I was nervous going into tonight for many reasons. But oh my god. First of all when they did get busy for the acoustic….I lost my mind. Into golden. A song I used to cry to so much. Growing up autistic while not knowing I was, the lyrics always hit for me. It used to be my favorite song on IOH. So the fact I got to hear it…I was so happy. Get busy was another one of those songs that as a mentally ill teen really resonated with me.

Then for 8 ball when they did you’re crashing. I wasn’t familiar with it as a kid but as an adult when I went deeper into fob’s discography than I previously had, that one ended up being a favorite. So them doing it had me absolutely floored. 

Then for the second 8 ball…and they did…yes, 27. My all time favorite song. The one I was so crushed to miss. I got to hear it live. It means so much to me I can’t put it into words. I’ve been trying to manifest that they play it for weeks. I’ve wanted it so bad ever since I knew it was possible after the debut. And the fact I got it. Stuff for me never works out like this 

Get busy, Golden, and 27 are songs I glommed onto as a misunderstood angsty mentally ill teen. Their music is what made me feel understood. What got me through that very long period in my life. In 2023 I’ve gone through so much which led to healing and growing a lot. Getting to hear these same songs now as a much happier person….words can’t even describe what that means for me. Hearing them live healed my inner teenager and my adult self and just every part of me. 

For once I feel like all is right within the universe. Tonight was perfect. I got to hear 4 songs that mean and have meant so much to me. I got to see my favorite band again after 8 years. I can finally say I’m happy when even just thinking about that word used to make me angry because I thought I was incapable of happiness ever again. Someone said this is fall out boy’s healing tour and it apparently extends to their fans too. Back when I was 14, I called my first fob show one of the best days of my life. I’m so glad I can say those words again at 23.

TLDR: I got to hear my all time favorite song ever and it made my lifetime. I had a really bad period of repressing and denial and all bs so like 95% of my wardrobe is feminine bullshit and it’s distressing tf out of me 🫠what are cheap ways to get like…Good Gender Clothing I’m losing my mind. FOB took it as a personal challenge by playing my two favorite songs back to back when I’m not there (27 and doldrums) and wow…agony (can’t forget the 8 ball of Winona😍). This hurts so fucking bad. 27 has been my favorite song ever since I got into fall out boy. It’s not even just my favorite fob song. It’s my all time favorite song ever and it’s been that way for a decade now. I remember when i was younger trying so hard to find a performance of it on YouTube and none were there. I knew it was likely they would never play it because it’s not a popular song. But they did and I am so incredibly saddened by this. I wish I had been there more than anything.Those of us who bang the doldrums means so much to not being there to witness the debut. I gotta be honest this fucking hurts.I’m 22 and my sister is 20. She was diagnosed with autism as a toddler, and up until she was in ~3rd grade, she got great support from special ed programs at school, someone that would come to our house at work with her on talking, emotions, etc., and a program with a cool sensory room that also helped develop skills (most of which I was also allowed and encouraged to attend for support). By the time she was around 10 or so, she was very high functioning and no longer participated in any programs in or outside of school. 

The problem is that she doesn’t know she has autism. I wasn’t allowed to tell her (and it wasn’t really ever a big deal to me because I was a kid too and she seemed the same as other kids, and she never brought it up or asked questions). Fast forward to the past year or so, and this has changed. 

My sister and I have never been close. I would even go as far as saying there’s a mutual resentment or disgust on both parts. But she came over to my place one time a few months ago to work on a gift for a family member together, and out of the blue she asks me if I think she’s autistic. I was so totally caught off-guard. I asked her what made her ask that, and she started listing things she’d struggled with her whole life that aligned perfectly with an autism diagnosis. She had seen some TikTok’s that suggested she might be autistic if she struggled to make friends, had a hard time keeping conversations, and some other emotional regulation things. I think I ended the conversation saying something like “I’m not sure, you should probably ask mom or dad about it.” To which she said she’d already brought it up to my mom, and my mom flat out denied it.

After she left my place, I immediately called my mom and told her she needed to tell my sister the truth because it clearly was impacting my sister and she deserves to know and it doesn’t feel good to hide and lie about something like that.  My mom basically said at this point it’s been so many years of hiding the truth that it would hurt my sister more to tell her the truth now than to just keep lying. 

I know if I was in my sisters position I would want my family to tell me the truth even after all these years. She hasn’t brought it up again since, but for some reason today months later something has been pulling at me to tell her. If I tell her, everyone in my family will be furious and heartbroken, and I’m not the parent who made the decision to not tell her so I feel like it’s not my place to tell her. 

Has anyone had experience with this or can anyone give advice on how to go about this?

**EDIT: thanks for all the responses. I live out of state, but I’m flying back to visit on Wednesday this week. I think I’m going to give my mom one more chance to tell my sister, and if she won’t, then I’ll tell her. I’ll update the post later in the week with how it goes.

Update 1: sorry I haven’t updated on here yet, this is my first ever Reddit post and I did not expect to receive so many responses so I’m so grateful and a little overwhelmed 😅. I’ll give more details next week when I get home for those interested because right now I’m spending time with family while I’m home, but me and my mom did tell her this morning. It went…pretty well, all things considered. I’ll tell the full story in my update next week. Lots of love to everyone. Your words and stories moved me and helped our family. 💜.I know that the typical answer for his out of character behavior in DMC2 is that he's depressed but that's bullshit because he's always depressed. I guess he could be having a depressive episode but it doesn't really feel like that. Instead, I think he's resorted to other means than demon violence and drinking (as seen by the bottles in DMC5, and the anime) to drown out his sorrows. Think about it: the weird calm, the thousand-yard stare, the weird obsession with that fucking coin. If makes sense to me, but then again, I'm an idiot. He murdered the CEO of a multinational corporation in DMC2, and there's no way nobody investigated what the fuck happened on Vie de Marli. Is there some kind of government cover-up to hide the existence of demons?. He actually doesn't fly without propulsion, he's actually clicking his heels so hard and fast that it propels him through the air and it's so fast that we can't see it.Everyone else, even V (up until he stepped into the Qliphoth) thought Dante could beat Urizen on his own. So either Morrison has some reason to think Dante couldn't handle it that I am unaware of or he just noticed that Dante was going through it and decided to invite his friends.So far I've only been able to piece together that Nibblenephim is inspired by Seraphim/Ophanim and Wiggog Wiggog Y'Wrath is probably Shub Niggurath (barely scraping by there Lovecraft), and their collective title the Lords in Black is likely inspired by the King in Yellow, but I'm not sure about the others. Any ideas?. I like the idea of James Gordon Jr as a horrible person since he opposes most other Batman villains because he captures the nature side of nature vs nurture, since most of the other villains weren't born maniacs but were molded into them. I find it especially interesting as contrast to his father and his sister. So I've gotta wonder, has there ever been a story where Barbara has confronted James? I feel like it's a missed opportunity if not, there could be something really interesting there. Especially if she's still Oracle (as that's just her most interesting iteration). So has it happened? If not, would you like to see it happen?. Sorry if this has been asked before or is straight-up stated in the movie, but I have not noticed it in the many times I watched it. So the question is, how did the Riddler know about the whole Maroni scandal? How did he, who was basically some random guy (as far as I know) know that Falcone was the rat, and know who was involved and how much money they received, etc, etc.After beating DMC3 on normal, I thought that Hard would be a little bit more challenging, but I honestly didn't see a difference. Haven't started Very Hard yet, but I really wish I didn't have to play through Hard to get to it. Hopefully it is a bit more challenging, since I don't want to wait for DMD to really get to something that forces me to get better, you know?. The weapon, which was his soul, was destroyed when Dante fought Balrog. Does that mean his soul was destroyed too? What the hell does that mean?. Like it would make more sense to me if he shot him in the head, but he doesn't. I feel like I've gotta be missing something. In Before the Nightmare it's established that Balrog will turn back into a demon when he feels he's strong enough, so why didn't he try to kill Dante when Urizen knocked him out for like a month? Was he waiting for Dante and Urizen to hopefully take each other out or something?. I know we don't know (unless I missed something), but what do you guys think happen to the souls that die in hell? Do they reincarnate on Earth, or do they just stop existing, or some other option I'm not creative enough to think of?. So I missed Moragia since I forgot to take a picture for it when I fought it. When I went to go buy it from Robbie, he sold me all the other miniboss monsters I forgot to get but not that one. Anyone know why?. I mean, he knew Nero was Vergil's son almost immediately after meeting him, and Vergil had to be told by him after stealing his arm that had his goddamn sword in it. Hell, the devil bringer even reacted to his presence (with a blue aura on top of it). Vergil also thought he could beat Mundus after losing to Dante, Dante knew he needed the Sparda to best Mundus.I feel like comparatively I seem to be behind even other autistic people, and I actually do want to socialize with at least somebody, but I feel so unbalanced in terms of socialization, like there's no way I could even catch up to other autistic people.I am asking, because I had the opportunity for this to happen to me, and it was very interesting to compare my own perceptions of what happened in the story and my behavior, versus the conclusions that the other people had come to regarding my motivations during the event.I ate an edible last night, and I wrote down something which I think might make a lot of sense.

I think that allistic people's thoughts are very straightforward. They often can't remember a million details about something, so their memories and considerations of interactions don't tend to involve a lot of detail(unless they're specifically trying to remember a complex subject). They just consider the general idea, which often comes down to basic things, like:

* "Was the person positioning themself like they wanted to interact with me?"

and this gets broken down more, to things like:

* "Was the person looking at me?"
* "Was the person smiling at me?"
* "Has the person kept contacting me?"

In addition, they know that interacting with more powerful or influential people carries a risk to them, so they are hesitant to do anything to bother people with power.

But in comparison, I think we're actually remembering WAY more detail about situations.

I think autistic people's thoughts are very complex. Because we see so much detail about everything, we tend to think that because something would be relevant to us, it must likely be relevant to them. And we remember all kinds of extra details about things.

When recalling memories, we recount every detail we think is relevant, but they have brains that aren't even attempting to see those things as relevant.

I am not comparing allistic people to children here, but they don't seem to have spicy thoughts, and they don't seem to like spicy thoughts.

I think interactions between allistic people are like an exchange of Kraft mac & cheese. Everybody kind of knows what they're going to get.

And then when they interact with autistic people, we try and give them a custom homemade macaroni and cheese that contains all kinds of interesting spices(details) and actually tastes better if you have a taste for it, but they haven't developed a taste for it.

I don't think they tend to remember the words that were spoken in situations, but instead mainly remember the way that interactions made them feel.

When I am remembering a situation, my first thought is as close I can [to remember them the exact words that were spoken(which allistic people reference as "echolalia"), but when they are remembering a situation, their first thought is "This person was smiling." "This person was frowning." "This person was looking away and wasn't paying attention to me."]

So I think to interact with them maybe I should:

1. try to communicate thoughts using as few words as possible,
1. only convey general, positive thoughts, in most cases
1. delay speaking long enough to consider whether this person is capable of seeing why I think a detail is relevant, and
1. try intentionally to mirror the things they're doing with their body.

Is the problem not that we don't see body language, but instead that we make an incorrect assumption that their memories of individual interactions are as detailed as ours, and that also we tend to assume that details would change their overall opinion when it really wouldn't?

I think we tend to put more importance on the accuracy of recall of any given particular situation, and they tend to put more importance on the general narrative that they form from the interacting of multiple interactions and the individual ongoing narratives that they've developed for each person they interact with.I had a coworker and we'd had a lot of complicated interactions, and it helped me realize a whole bunch of things about what this coworker thought about me, including that this coworker probably knew I was autistic from the second or third day I worked there because I wore the same brand and same color shirt and the same brand and same color pants every day working there. And I think different clothes is a not just a signal of wealth or style, but also a sign that your clothes are clean.When I was a kid, no one wanted anything to do with me, so I'd be excluded(even though at that time I would have been interested in going out and doing things with people).

As time went on and I got older, I started working, and people would always ask "What are you doing this weekend?" or "What did you do this weekend?" I learned very quickly that people would stop talking to me in general unless I pretty much had an interesting answer every time they asked.

So I did try to add in "interesting" activities in my life, not because I really wanted to(although some of them did end up being fun), but even the ones that are stereotypically social aren't things that are generally things I do with other people. It doesn't matter, as long as they are actually interesting.

But sometimes I just can't. I'll have something planned, maybe even for a long time, but it gets to the day, and I just can't. No matter how much I wanted to do the activity when I thought about it, I just can't physically make myself do it. Even if I paid for a ticket for an event, I just can't do it.

But when I talk to other people on Monday, or when I talk to family members the next day, I lie and say that I did. And I'll often have the ticket which indicates that I did go to those things.

Or, alternatively, if I have nothing scheduled for a Friday night or a weekend, I will lie and say that I do have something scheduled(and often mention something that I have actually done before), just to not be noticed, just to not be made the negative center of attention again.An autistic content creator, soundsoftheforest, has a channel where a big aspect of the channel is the fact that she's autistic, and going over her special interests. She posted [a video saying a viewer or viewers were saying she wasn't neurodivergent.](https://www.tiktok.com/@soundoftheforest/video/7291685191494470954?lang=en)

I posted a response saying "I am autistic and professionally diagnosed. You definitely seem autistic to me."

Later yesterday I got a message from TikTok saying that a response of mine had been removed for violating community guidelines. I was very surprised, and didn't even realize which comment had been removed, until I went to look it up. I appealed it, and my appeal was rejected, saying that they won't restore my comment.I work in a field that pays well. I have had training in résumé writing and in interviewing, and I interview well enough to get offered most jobs that I interview for.

My work is largely based around a special interest that dates back decades. I know the subject well enough that I can do more work in one day than most people can do in two weeks.

I did previously work somewhere for many years, and there have been two other positions where I worked for longer than a year, but I have had many jobs, the majority of which have lasted about three months.

The field that I work in has a lot of three-month "contract to hire" roles. And despite getting these jobs and despite huge lists of accomplishments and them telling me that they're happy with the work I have accomplished, I have never actually had an employer convert me to full time ongoing employment. In a few cases, the reason has been because the employer themself shut down, but there have also been a not-insignificant cases where I was under the impression that employment would continue and then found out it would not.

In a few cases, I have also encountered situations where employers seemed to change their behavior toward me early on, seemingly after noticing that there was something different about me.

Almost everyone I interact with seems to quickly identify that there's something different about me. I have had references to differences in reviews I've received as an employee, in endorsements I've gotten on online job boards, direct statements from coworkers, et cetera. Part of it is related to intelligence, but I have also been recently diagnosed autistic(after suspecting for almost half of my life).

Do you specifically disclose being autistic to employers?

If so, at what point would you disclose? During the interview process? After being hired? At some point after being hired?

Do you ask for accommodations? And if so, which ones? I usually work remotely and most jobs I have worked have been either me working by myself for a majority of the time or me working with one other person, with occasional check-ins. And I usually end up being able to choose my schedule and having significant flexibility in the role. Most communication already happens through email and/or entries in project management software.

And do you mask?

 I am not sure if I could mask successfully, for more than a single short interaction.I often make very detailed Reddit posts, and they're always appropriate and related to the topic of the sub. They're always fitting the format of the posts of the sub.

But in many subs, I have noticed that the moderators often have difficulty understanding how my posts relate to the sub's topic, because the relationship is visible within context instead of being superficially visible.

It's difficult when they can't see that two things are deeply related or that something is absolutely on-topic, and they remove the post for not being on-topic, and then when I contact them and talk to them about it, they don't understand how what I've posted **is** very much on-topic.

It's difficult when sometimes allistic people can't see that two things are very strongly related, but when it's not clear how to convey that context to someone who insists that they are not.

Is this something you've experienced as well?. It's kind of ironic that autistic people are the ones called "autistic", because allistic people only imply information at each other, but a lot of it isn't actually communicated with certainty. They "vibe" at each other, and if you didn't get their vibes, that's *your* problem(although, to be fair, they do apparently get each others vibes generally, *but not always*). They generally avoid trying to have a more exact communication to other people.

Autistic people are the ones using extremely specific language and trying to have deeper communication with all other people that they speak to.

And while allistic people do try to make comparatively weak connections to a relatively larger number of people, they really want only a few people to be able to talk to them using specific language, and even to those people, in most cases, it's not nearly as specific as the things an autistic person would say to each and every person they talk to. Autistic people feel a desire to have enough connection with humanity in general to be able to say exactly what they mean to each and every person.

Allistic attempts to communicate a thought are attempts to communicate the general idea of the thought.

Autistic attempts to communicate a thought are attempts to make a really strong connection with someone so they can communicate the exact thought.

Allistic people have more of a fear about doing that.Imagine a scenario:

> 1. There are 100 autistic people in a room.
> 1. There are 100 allistic people in a different room (miles/kilometers away).
> 1. In both rooms, everyone has average intelligence.
> 1. In both rooms, everyone is basically comfortable and has the necessary accommodations to prevent any sensory issues or difficulty verbalizing.
> 1. Each of the two groups will be having a 10-15 minute discussion about a given subject that a majority of the people in that group would be interested to talk about.
> 1. In both rooms, conversations would need to last at least 10-15 minutes, and everyone in all groups is okay than that for the whole time.

1. Which group would have fewer misunderstandings in general?
1. And separately, which group would have a better understanding of the thoughts of the others in the group?
1. And which group would be communicating more information?. 1. Everyone has some confusing memories about things that have happened to them.
1. But your memories are only from your own perspective. You don't know for sure what other people were thinking.
1. Could any of your most confusing memories be made less confusing by supposing that other people in the memory secretly already knew you're autistic?
1. Could any of your most confusing memories be made less confusing by supposing that you actually were autistic and it was not known?


*Edit: Replaced the word "stories" with "memories"*

*Edit 2: Replaced the word "interesting" with "confusing"*. So for example, on my computer there is a row of icons at the bottom of my screen. I don't remember *any* of them by what the entirety is a picture of. I remember a given icon by its particular words, basic shapes, and squiggles of color that make up the icon, but not by what the gestalt icon is a representation of.

I remembered growing up thinking [the old neighborhood watch logo](https://www.volusiasheriff.gov/resources/neighborhood-watch.stml) was a dot with a white and blue background, and it never occurred to me that it was an eye.

And I have always thought [the old US Postal Service logo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanrules/3430592126) was a blue blob that looked like it has a huge nose, and then a squiggle on the right, and the new one just looks like white lines on a blue background. Someone eventually said "the old bird and the new bird" to me, so I am aware. But that's not how I think of them.

And I never realized [that the NBC logo was a peacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_logo). I see it as a bunch of elongated picks, although someone pointed it out to me.

And until Googling "logos" a few minutes ago, I thought that [the CBS logo](https://closinglogogroup.fandom.com/wiki/CBS/Other) was a dot in a circle and two arches, and not also an eye.

I was in my 20s when someone pointed out to me that there was a ["T" in the Toyota logo](https://global.toyota/en/mobility/toyota-brand/features/emblem/). to this day I still think of it as ovals.

It seems this is the case for all illustrations that aren't almost photorealistic.

Does this kind of thing sound familiar?. So many times when a neurotypical person tells a story and an autistic person tells a similar story to show "I understand the feeling you are describing, because I have felt a feeling that is the same or similar," I have heard neurotypical people say that an autistic person is "trying to make it all about them".

But it seems like the autistic way of responding shows empathy and also caring, but the neurotypical way doesn't seem to show empathy, or at least shows much less empathy.

There have been many times when I've described some kind of difficulty and other people (ostensibly neurotypical people) would all say things like "I'm sure it's going to be alright," and I have been absolutely sure that they were lying or have been frustrated, because they didn't show any indication that they understood the situation. One of the best ways to comfort me is to make clear that you have some kind of understanding of the situation before explaining how your similar situation worked out or explaining what worked for you, and intentionally leaving that out seems like it wouldn't give the listener any reason to think that things might get better.

Could someone explain the reasoning for how they come to the conclusion that telling a similar story is an attempt to detract from their story? I honestly am not following the steps in that reasoning.

Could it be that they have difficulty understanding that the story is analogous? Like maybe they see the story as not actually being similar and so don't understand that it's an explanation of a similar situation that would evoke a similar emotion?. I tried to add a bunch of emojis, and none of them worked. When I try to click any of them, it says “Undefined” in the post. Since none of my added emojis have ever worked, I would like to delete them all and try adding them with new shortcodes. How do I do this, and what should be the format of a shortcode(as what I was trying obviously was not accepted)?. macOS Ventura 13.5.1 with all available updates, and in macOS preferences, Brave is allowed to share location.

In Brave's preferences, I also have it set to allow location sharing.

When I go to any given site and it asks for my location, I approve it from the dialog that pops up from the lock icon in the address bar, and then there's no response whatsoever. But it's always as if the site got no response from me approving it. Sometimes it fails, sometimes it stays at the dialog(whatever dialog the page itself is displaying telling me to approve it in the browser dialog).

I have disabled all extensions and this behavior persists.

In all other browsers, they're able to share my location just fine.macOS Ventura 13.5.1 with all available updates, and in macOS preferences, Brave is allowed to share location.

I used to have a really good blog for afrocarribean cooking but unfortunately they deleted :( so if anyone has a specific recommendation for that I'd be over the moon.. If you Google ways to cope with autism you always get articles aimed at the parents of autistic children. The face of autism on tiktok, twitter etc. is teenagers. I'm struggling to find my identity as I age because it seems the only option presented to us is the sheldon cooper - perpetually rude and childlike, never regulating our emotions, lashing out at our friends and family.. This isn't how I want to be lol. And there are few studies on how autistic people change as they get older. The consensus seems to be: we can't adapt, we can't mature and we can't 'grow up.'
It would be nice to have resources and groups aimed at adults. It's a struggle to identify difficulties at work and in relationships, and in terms of coping strategies I have no idea where to begin. How do autistic people parent, find a comfortable job etc.? Where are our role models?. It's possible this was a seal or something but I'm fairly sure it was a penguin. You swam around the map collecting babies that followed you but they could be killed by sharks or other ocean hazards. I likely played it on miniclip. I've never been able to find it because there's so many penguin themed flash games lol.Everyone said I was crazy! Well, would a madman have taken two weeks to draw a triangle on screen? Would a madman go about implementing basic physics and memory management?  I’ll customize each and every part into mine own likeness and there is nothing anyone can do about it!. The topic of burnout, not enjoying games anymore, and the like, pops up commonly on this sub. So here I would like to offer some suggestions that come from personal reflection and experience on the matter.  Feel free to offer your own reflections on these points or add your own.

&#x200B;

1. Try a short "palate cleanser" game.  Something that is not too long and can finish in just a few days, or even a solid, dedicated thirty minutes.  Good ones for me include titles such as **Bugsnax**, **Journey**, **Doki Doki Literature Club**, or **Frog Fractions: Game of the Decade Edition**. Experiences that are short, satisfying, and distinctive.
2. Try a game you normally wouldn't.  I thought I could never enjoy a computerized card game, but **Slay the Spire** proved me wrong, leading me to **Inscryption** eventually.  I've also learned that I can really enjoy a visual novel, thanks to Hanako Games's **Magical Diary** (also short so good for point ^(1)) series, and later the **Dangonronpa** series.  Be open to the new as the come.  I was gifted **Animal Crossing: New Leaf** from a friend and even with so much I haven't done in it, I got plenty of good time with it, and even better, could share the experience.
3. Keep your health.  Get enough sleep.  Don't game or exercise too late (give 1 hr no games before bedtime, 2 for exercise).  But do exercise. Nothing too crazy and don't push too hard, especially if you're new.  Some pushups, squats are great for waking me up, a 20+ minute brisk walk (personally I feel I need 25+, and twice a day. It's hard enough to fit one in), and even some weights. Keep hygiene as though you'd meet the love of your life tomorrow.  Floss.  Dairy in moderation.  Throw in a generous portion of vegetables, and outmeal is still the breakfast cereal par excellence (though my former-now-retired COO swore by cashews and blueberries).  Stay hydrated, cut down a bit the carbs and DOWN the added sugar, and the lighter the bread the faster you're dead.
4. Short gameplay loops.  Getting a satisfying amount of gaming in just a few minutes--that you can extend further, but don't feel compelled towards.  Many of these will satisfy point 1 as well.  Old school design really shines here. You can do this in few minutes of **Galaga,** a level of **Donkey Kong Country**, some **Overcooked 2**, or a variably sized 1-15 minute round of **Katamari Damacy: Reroll**.  The **House of the Dead 2** for Wii has also been great for me and I my arm can definitely feel it too haha.
5. More of the same is okay.  Whether it is an old favorite title or a familiar franchise, if you know you like it and are in the mood then why not?  Don't need to feel shame for diving back into **Diablo 2** for the 12th time.  If you feel the call, it's okay to listen.  Just remember to progress in other areas too.  And it is great replaying a game and knowing that there is an old fan community--take the **Jak and Daxter** series--visiting that subreddit sure got me in the mood! Note that if you have completed a game or series visiting online communities can be dangerous--I wouldn't go to the **Zelda** subreddit no matter how specific the thread is, someone is bound to spoil something in the series. The spoiler warning policy is yet another reason I love r/patientgamers
6. Keep your personal life in order.  A clean environment, work going well, happy house life.  If these things suffer, your hobby will too.  Getting home from work is a great "junk time" and the transition can be used to do a mindless chore like pull some vines, drymop, clean the kitchen some, and of course prepare dinner.  And if you have a significant other, definitely give the relationship priority.  Step up with the chores such as the cleaning and cooking mentioned.   They say a man was never shot by his wife while he was washing dishes.  And clean those dishes too even when you cook--clean as you go.  Now if you can cook one or two meals your partner can be down for 40% of the time that is awesome. Bonus points if they are things where the ingredients can sit for a week (shop ahead and be ready).  Most importantly, put in the effort to connect with your other half.  And if you have kids, do something with them. Something non-gaming.
7. A creative outlet is healthy.  Numerous games offer this in one way or another.  I loved building gothic cathedrals in **Minecraft**, and while **Oxygen Not Included** offers a somewhat less diverse palette for creativity I found designing paradises in it both compelling and personal.  Even designing your own pokemon team has it's creative element--embrace it.  Now what really shines for creative expression is when the game offers an editor.  I put so many hours in the world editor for **Warcraft 3** and the community is still going for it.  Really just a top notch editor packaged with the game's engine.  I actually liked the editor much more than the **Starcraft 2** editor.  Speaking of editor community, the construction set for **Morrowind** is STILL pumping out content and even has events.  All by fan momentum.  Personally, I found it a little hard to do the things I really wanted to do--it is a big program.  But I'd still like to release something with it one of these days.  Similarly,  I've also gained some decent enjoyment from the editor for **King's Bounty: Crossworlds** and **Neverwinter Nights 2,** but these are somewhat more unwieldy, especially the former, but if you love meticously crafting environments or have no skill and am perfectly fine making something ugly, give one of them a shot!  Since I mentioned King's Bounty, how do you feel about **Heroes of Might And Magic III**? It's a game I respect that I had some interesting time with, but did not really deep dive into or try making my own with--how is that? Of course, for real creation, I highly recommend **Blender**\--I started using it in college for a class and just recently got it on steam (racked up 140 hours already, plus it auto updates!) Still, the best creative outlet needs no computer if you ask me--drawing is great and the skill helps a lot for 3d modelling, and guitar is good during breakups for its singular focus...sigh.
8. You don't have to 100%, you don't need to finish, and it is okay to not wait for the sale. Patience is not an absolute, it is a guide.   Even if I never finished I still enjoyed my time with **Okami** and **Fallout: New Vegas**, and will gladly jump back to them--but not right now.  The point is to game mindfully and deliberately.  Maybe if you are really in the mood to return to a beloved franchise, then go for it!  If you are definitely going to start it now, who knows it may very well save you money rather than hoarding.  And if the fire isn't burning in you, its okay to have nothing to play, keep an eye out with an open mind about what might.  I like reading folktales during these down times--they are great short hits, perfect for a generation with our attention rotten from working in the fields--i mean watching tiktok all day.
9. Call your parents. Visit grandma. Reach out to a friend, catch up over a drink.  Play with your dog, do something nice with your spouse and kids. Video games are great fun and they can be great bonding experiences, but we are to be mindful about its use. Don't forget the real thing. Life is short, and people are always gone too soon.  Peace.I only saw a few minutes of this sometime in the late 90's.  USA, on television.  A small girl looks for her brother with an old lady (her grandmother?).  The girl has a vision of a dragon and the old woman explains that her brother could have turned into a dragon, or perhaps something else like a snail.  The two of them travel through this misty swamp. Meanwhile, we see the brother, and he hasn't turned into any such creature.I like to think I have a fair amount of WebGL experience as a hobbyist.  It could be nonsensical and frustrating at times, but it eventually came through, and I have since spent many evenings and weekends tinkering with it.

People say to learn OpenGL before doing Vulkan.  I've only played with OpenGL the tiniest bit, but now that I've finished the Vulkan tutorial I feel completely out of my league.  Did WebGL 1.0 not do enough to teach me?  I want to add features, and suddenly it is "add to the swap chain, make another descriptor pool a another descriptor layout for the n descriptor sets you must establish right after you query your physical device, memcpy the data to images and make the image view for them, then don't forget to delete all of those when exiting."  If that parody of how this works made any sense then maybe there is mode for me yet.  This is hard stuff and I respect what it takes to do this and even moreso when the knowledge is shared, but for now I think I might brush up on some modern OpenGL before coming back to Vulkan.I have to admit I’m not the best at presenting my good side when filling out my Catholic Match profile.  I want to be genuine, I want to be me, and I want the process to be less boring!

Tell everyone about how my faith is part of my daily life?  I’m not normally asked that, is this a magazine interview?  My faith is there, all the time, every day. Do I need to put down something sentimental or detail my daily prayer routines?  It feels setup to be Catholic identity flag waving and flexing.

Pictures? Don’t have them. The ones I have are not exactly representative. I must be half vampire because I can’t show up on film right.  Or more likely there will many other people…or an ex. I think there’s a reason so many guys have pictures holding fish—it’s one of the few ways we get photographed by ourselves.

Adventure? Traveling? Sounds nice in theory, and I’ve done some of that in a past life, but these days not really.  Everyone is hiking in the mountains, kayaking, white water rafting, or running from a boulder in an archaeological excavation.  You’ll be much more likely to find me lounging in my underwear struggling to understand Topology.

I do not enjoy yard work. It is a miserable Sisyphean chore that I do begrudgingly and I would trade it all to have a goat take care of it if my would HOA let me.

So all this is how I put my best foot forward. It doesn’t sound like I have a lot going for me, but I honestly believe I have a lot of great things here. But marketing is so much of a drag. Better put in some more review and effort now. Thanks for listening!. We’re all hoping for a remake that does this game justice, but say what if the game was going to receive some generous changes but still in the spirit, and you were assigned to add new playable characters? Sure there are obvious choices like Beatrice and Tantalus, but what else? Who would you add? What changes to the game and mechanics would there be to support them?

I decided to have some fun with my ideas:

- Prince Puck as an Onion Knight
- Build-your-own black mage. With this mist back, making them is back on the table! Will it be like the ones in the village? More like Vivi, or do you want something more Black Waltz?
- The Ticketmaster. Always liked this lion guy. Now he’s been fleshed out, and is a part time entertainer, and card game enthusiast. The card game has experienced some fixes, and has added meaning to the world. The cards contain mysteries and secrets. And by equipping him with some cards, you give him access to the wondrous abilities, in a semi-random basis. He’ll draw a few (3,4?) cards at the fight start. Sometimes you won’t draw the card you want right away. You can still shuffle, draw more.
- Cleyran dancer. She will have some beneficial red magic. Not much. But trance will be reformed, and that is her specialty. She’ll be able to boost and give her t gauge to others. Also, a couple of cleyran summons, but only when an actual summoner is around too 
- Cid’s will join you to test out new tech. Unlocking abilities for him means unlocking new synth items at the Cid-shop. Some of them not even specific to him.

So those are some of my off the wall ideas. Nothing I seriously think should be included. Any that you’d like to share?. Epic Battle Fantasy 5 is the highest rated game I have on steam. I have games like Terraria, Slay the Spire, Skyrim Script Editor, and Portal. What a spot to be!

I’ve been playing this series since 2 and it’s just really great seeing it persist and grow. I admire the dedication the dev puts into it and hope he is able to do everything he wants to be doing. Just so thankful. I’m not good at it. My game will look worse because of it. If my current project gets completed it will lose many sales for looking bad.

But that’s okay. I’m having fun. Maybe even building a skill, even if it never approaches professional.  Doing this as a hobby means not caring so much about the product, and enjoying the process. And in the end, all of these goofy looking models are my creations.

Anyone else with me? Maybe it isn’t 3D modeling for you. Maybe it’s 2D art. Or music. Or game engine development. But it’s something you do because this is how you like doing it.Or “the Master Kong.” I think this is important knowledge for everyone here.Governments, investors, starry eyed children, and a few excessively rich nerds are all funneling massive funds to you with nothing but the vague plea “make digimon real!” 

What’s your plan?. I’m new to the game and wanted to clarify a few points—Time Wizard is mostly the example, but it’s tangible for me. I realize the limitations of the example, but I’m trying to understand when card abilities and effects can do anything. Apologies if these are repetitive:

1. Can you activate his ability when he is set, and facing down?
2. Can you activate his ability if he were previously facing up, then made to face down again?
3. Can you activate his ability during the battle phase? End phase? Draw phase? Opponent’s turn?
4. Can you activate it if he is set and facing down, then he is attacked and so flipped up. Say he is to receive enough damage to kill him.
5. If he is facing up (attack or defense), and a monster attacks him, can he use his ability? Where would the attacker’s damage go? Could time Wizard use his ability if he himself is attacking?
6. Is there, generally speaking, no way to end my turn with his ability usable and him in defense position (I.e. I won’t be vulnerable to attacks going through him) without some intermediate turn ending with him in attack position? (Without other cards and effects allowing it, naturally). I am reading the Theoretical Minimum series book 2, quantum mechanics, and am trying to understand the general uncertainty principle and standard deviation.

My issue is that, the General Uncertainty Principle seems to say that NEITHER of the two observables can have 0 uncertainty if they do not commute.  Or if one does, the other must have uncertainty infinity.  But when I try to calculate standard deviations, it says otherwise:

Suppose then, I set a prepare the state of a particles spin--that would set the uncertainty to 0, correct?  But then when I try to calculate the standard deviation for say, an observable on the spin taken orthogonally, I am not going to get an infinite value.

Where am I going wrong? Is it my understanding of the General Uncertainty Principle, or something with my understanding of calculating uncertainties?  Thank you!. Does anyone know of, or could recommend, some original 3ds homebrew games? That is, not romhacks, unofficial ports, emulators, utility apps etc, but original games made independently for 3ds?

I understand they might not be the killer apps, maybe even a little underwhelming, but I guess I want to see what’s being made, and what I myself might hope to share if I made anything.I did all of the Temple quests, lead all of the guilds, head of Telvanni, vampire quests, twin lamps, imperial legion, daedra prince quests, got eltonbrand, a full daedric armor set and daedric crescent, and now finished the main quests, and am still not having fun.  Does it get any better?

I feel like I did everything right.  I read a bunch of guides, watched several playthroughs, then installed the game--no mods (except for one that gave quest markers because seriously).  Then I followed the advice and made an altmer atronauch with all of the recommended major/minor skills (eventually got to max all attributes).  I stole the limeware platter and dropped it (don't know why the game doesnt just give you the money instead).  And I followed the let's play, and UESP open on my phone, but the game is so far just go place A->click some text->go place b->click and some guy dies.  No challenge by the way, just a bunch of dragging potions onto my char.

I can't tell how much further I have to go until I fully 100% percent everything, but i dont want to step away from this chore of a game before I do.  When does it get fun?  And when will the 100% completion acheivement pop? And what day is it?. OI WANTZ TAH BEEKUM AH NOB BU' OIM NEEDIN THAH INSPERAYSHUN. This is not a "feeling discouraged" post.  But I feel many of the same symptoms.

Starting a project is fun. Getting the basic mechanics and programming them, tweaking to have them feel right.  Maybe even adding a few main characters, with a little modelling.  It's all fun. Almost all.

Then there is finding (or making) all of the other assets. Getting the right sounds, textures. Hunting down everything to make the world less empty, modifying them to make them less generic and fit better.  Making a cohesive story with variety of the feel and gameplay.  Figuring out how exactly you want to setup the camera in a cutscene, how each character should move in the script.  And I certainly do not care for ensuring it lasts 2 hours so that it doesn't get refunded.

Sometimes one just has to bite the bullet and go through the hard parts. I get it.  But this is something I do for myself.  I have a full time job.  Whatever all of the dross tends towards, it isn't what I'm after.  I'm not really here to make a product. Real devs ship.  I know. And it would be nice to have some wider relevance.  Yet, I make things for someone else.

In my career I sometimes experience similar things, depending on the room.  I do not get excited by that new framework or library, or how quickly you can make a nice looking app with it.  I do not care about that new database, the new ORM, or a recently popular design paradigm.  And in gamedev, a care little for hype of new engine features, of templates that let anyone instantly make a game.

But I find so much joy in drawing a window, rendering some triangles.  Implementing my own library to read and load a type of file, having shapes collide with each other.  Such things that anyone trying to release something would be wise to avoid and use any of the very many preexisting solutions.

Maybe with experience, or discipline, I will evolve on this.  Maybe I will eventually make something steam-worthy.  Or I will just make another half-baked engine, against all of the advise of common wisdom.  I have no delusions about this yak-shaving being "better in the long term".  I just simply wish to create, on my own terms.  Many will come to this sub seeking advice on how to finish, how to properly and efficiently make a full game.  And I will look, I will listen, and be content to have nothing to offer there but a silent wish of success and good luck.

Happy 2022 everyone.And of course pieces of eight. Coins cut into half pennies and farthings in England are apparently common enough, but was this done in other areas? And why not?. What are some of your bad games that you’ve made along the way? Maybe you never released it, maybe it was just an itch demo or a pof you never showed anyone. Too grand a vision? You rolled your own terrible engine? Esoteric hardware? “Innovative” gameplay? What did you like about it, why was it bad, did you learn, have fun? Tell me about it!. Just saw this comic https://www.smbc-comics.com/ and the “traditional celtic fairy” magically causes the woman to be “pregnant…with a snake or something.”

Is there any source story for this? Most of my knowledge comes from The Welsh Fairy Book (Thomas). I’m familiar with other concepts such as the tithe, changelings, the fairy ointment story, but the mystical pregnancy to a snake isn’t ringing any bells. Is anyone aware of such stories in Celtic folklore, and might recommend a source collection for me to further explore?.

I get lots of ideas, and it can be fun making different features and systems, testing how they feel, but I’m beginning to see this could multiply into a bunch of tiny prototypes. Namely, I feel this need right now in regards to platforming physics and camera systems—pretty fundamental things. Is making multiple early versions something you do, or is that something you reserve for game jams? Do you make playgrounds that are a grab bag of myriad features and mechanics to quickly try them out? Or is it more typical to commit to one system and a small set of features at first, making only modest adjustments/additions/subtractions?. I recently read The Arabian Nights (however you'd like to call it, Haddawy translation), and when reading The Story of the Hunchback was not sure how to feel.

In the story, a man and wife invite a hunchback back home for dinner and general merriment. While home, the man takes a large piece of fish and puts it directly into the hunchback's mouth, then holds his mouth shut saying "By God, you must swallow the whole piece." The hunchback then chokes on a fish bone.

I am left wondering how to evaluate this. Was this abusive to the hunchback, hospitality gone wrong, irresponsible horseplay? I understand from other stories that, in the context of the place and time, feeding a guest directly is hospitable, but the part about where he holds his guest's mouth shut has me concerned. Would anyone here be able to put this in fuller cultural context?. I never got deep into gamedev and am trying to do better, complete projects, etc. I was reluctant to use premade assets and wrote a lot by hand, to say nothing of the modelling, texture mapping, and animation. I am starting to browse the unreal store, grabbing free assets, wishlisting others. This is all new to me and somewhat exciting at the thought that I could make something interesting quickly. 

Do you find yourself browsing the asset stores a lot? Do you hoard assets? I personally would like to have a healthy relationship with the asset store and don't want to go too crazy. It is, again, all new and exciting to me.Hi everyone! Sorry I am new, but I have been following the "Your First Hour in Unreal Engine 5" (on the "Working With Visuals" section) and have been exploring LearningKit Games Showcase map it uses. Using 5.0.2.

The issue is, at certain distances, objects suddenly look really bad. More polygons, misshapen, maybe having some of the underneath poking through. And it happens at very near distances. As far as I can tell, the map in the video does not have that happen, and more, I was sure it was not happening to me earlier, before I changed some settings. Anyone know what is going on--if it really is an issue with my settings and could be fixed? I have scalability set to 100% Epic. I even restored all to default in Editor Preferences.OI REHD AH REEL BIGGUN THA WUZ BEIN KAREED BY SUM UMIE OI JEZ KRUMPED!

I’m not too picky on the genre, I’m not even that concerned if the creature takes a central role in the game or is just a minor addition. What I care about is the end result someone might get, feeling that connection, whether it’s from catching and fighting them, going through a journey with them as a companion, feeding and playing with them, or just having one occasionally show up and it being a good experience. Whatever. What would be your suggestion?. I am sorry for posting this, I really hope this is not what happens and have faith it won’t. What are your ideas for a bad pitch? Here’s mine:

The show will focus on Eiko, Mog, Garnet, Zidane, and Vivi, in Madain Sari, living aimlessly day to day. No existential terror here!  Eiko is the clear main character, and Mog is the classic hyperactive comical sidekick.

Kuja occasionally shows up, but now he is Zidane’s older brother who comes typically to boast about something, driving Zidane to try to do just as well.

Mog will transform into various shapes when talking, but will almost never use this power when it could be helpful.

Garnet being a princess will not be important, except she will sometimes talk to her mom on the phone. Brahne isn’t waging any war or anything, just a mildly helicopter parenting, a bit dorky and clueless.

There will be segments that show Alexandria castle! You’ll see the queen, and Steiner. Mostly he will be carrying loads of junk, and tripping. Brahne will play practical jokes on him setting him up for many of these.

The end credits will feature an all new rap and by none other than Quina!. You all know the kind of book, “how to draw manga/animals/marvel superheroes,” with the step by step guides starting with drawing basic shapes to the final details.

I recently got a few, and am eager to try them out, but, still being a beginner, how much can I expect to really learn and improve from following these? What sort of role should this guidebooks play, to what extent? 

As an aside, I’ve been doing much drawing that is not of this sort (why is drawing a simple box so hard?), so I’m not expecting any one-stop solution here. "Dragon Break"? Give me one! -A break that is.

It's such a mannish idea. And now those Imperials're exportin' their thinking! Those people act like it's something unnatural, but really it's the exact op'site. It's not taking Auriel from his primal state, it's moving him closer--moving us closer! 

You know I've been reading stuff on Oblivion and allll its realms. And you know what? Time doesnt just plod in one direction there like it does here. No, they got forwards, backwrards, sideways, 'n otherways! 

You think that's craziness? No, that's \_freedom\_.

The smallest Daedric plane has got like infinite possibilities and freedom. Like, infinite more than here. I could instead of here be in a timeline where she chose me. But instead I'm here and y'all all stuck here with me. And maybe the idea of time acting different scares you, but I'd gladly take another one of them "Breaks" if it meant waking up and not having to go to work tomorrow.

\-typical rant of Llyrynir, aspiring Thalmor. &#x200B;

I've been trying to run MERLIN and BLINKY (from [Zophar](https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8/chip-8-games-pack.html)) to test my first emulator, a CHIP8, but something seems horribly off.  Is there something that isn't standard, like needing to increment I at some special point?

When my emulator begins it seems to go correctly--it loads the 4 squares, then writes ME in what looks like the correct place...then continues ME on after that across the top (doing a lot of erasing in the process), and ends up a huge mess. And so far it looks like it is doing just as told. Any ideas?. I am following the tutorial PowerISO provides [here](https://www.poweriso.com/tutorials/iso-maker.htm) but whenever it begins I get this error:

"The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error."

Any help getting around this issue I would be grateful for.And I hesitate to give my heart away. 

Just got this game Tuesday and I’m having a great time so far. Been ages since I’ve played the original, but it was amazing. I got all of the ctr tokens and relics, and more. I just want this to live up to that, let me continue playing.

I’ve heard some things are different (I mean aesthetic things like models, music, etc already are), but I’m hoping nothing is too breaking (hot air skyway is weirdly harder imo). Saddened that there hasn’t been a patch all year. How do you guys feel? Any old fans around?. OI KENT REEMEMBAH 'OW TA SEZ ET KEN YA GITZ 'ELP AH BOY OWT. The book I am using presents this problem:

Find a particular solution of y'' + 16y = e\^(3x)

The answers in the back says it is (1/25)e\^x.  When I try the methods taught in the book, I get (1/25)e\^(3x). Emphasis on the 3. Is there something I am missing?

&#x200B;

I am using the book Elementary Differential Equations With Boundary Value Problems by Edwards and Penney, 3rd Edition. Section 2.5, Problem 1. So Morrowind offers tons of entertainment with the main quest lines, guilds, and great houses. But have any of you tried not doing that?

I'm talking like instead becoming a vampire, terrorizing the town, or a reclusive necromancer, being a commoner married to your favorite NPC, an obedient maid, skooma addict, or murdering some character and ever after taking their place.

I personally, have struggled to do this because whenever I try the rest of the game distracts me, but what about you--did you have a good time with it?  And what mods do you use to help with the experience, if any?. Wanted to pose this question to all of you. In general, we can all see that Personality is fairly useful. In addition to being useful for bartering and starting fights, people like you more!

But I've found on this playthrough, with my early Masque of Clavicus Vile, it isn't always for the best experience. I \_do\_ find myself able to talk to various ash servants for a moment before getting attacked, that is cool. But sometimes, if people like you overall, it skips quests. In particular, one memorable one that I liked was when I had to give a thoughtful gift to Hassour Zainsubani. Small, I know, but when I got him Words of the Wind and seeing him touched by that gesture made an impression on me. With my +30 Personality, that was all skipped. I visit the Ashlanders, and they don't all hate me immediately! What's up with that?

Is that the limit, or is there more that one could be missing this way? Perhaps it is just like a side effect of any optimized playthrough. What do you all think?. Rules: 

1. No choosing an NPC that someone else has already chosen. Okay I know two people might easily post around the same time, but try not to. We all know a few NPCs that everyone would love to be.
2. You are an NPC, not the Hero. You'll do what your NPC does as per the game world and lore.
3. Beasts and such are allowed. Rule 1 still applies, but unique creatures are counted as distinct from the general case
4. Say why!

That's it. Just a fun thought of what if a bunch of people stood around and were NPC's for some other person gets to run around and be the Hero, like a Ren Faire.I am a beginner with arduino and am looking to move from beginner projects to building actual robots, but I am a bit lost on how to build/get parts for chassis.

I'm just a beginner so I'm not ready for 3D printing or custom building metal parts myself (!) but when I search online I see kits for specific projects, but I'd like to find some more general purpose sets. Wheels, gears, belts, structural parts... How do you make yours? When I was a kid I had lego mindstorms, and it was great for building all sorts of bots with just simple snapping together pieces. Is there anything like that out there for arduino bots?. These are tons things I have never done, though I have played this game for well over a decade. I'd like to share some of these in this thread. Some pretty normal things too (maybe im just repetetive?). How about you? 

For me, these are things I would still like to do, but I'd happily hear things you have no interest in doing as well:

* Joined a vampire clan or do the werewolf path
* Installed graphics mods or the code patch, or played on tamriel rebuilt
* Published a mod
* Completed the great house redoran, fighters guild, or the Solthstheim mining company questline
* Used spears as my main weapon or class skill
* Had an illusion-focused playthrough
* Chosen the atronauch sign
* Played as an Orc, Bosmer, or Nord
* Gotten really into the sugar. Or abused alchemy
* Complete Akulakhan and drive the mongrel dogs of the Empire from Morrowind.OLL THEEZ GITZ SAIYIN 'EY 'AV UH IDEEYA TA KRUMP THA UMIE EMPARA OR OWZ TA AV MOAR DAKKA. OI WANZ WUN OVEM!

KEN YA 'ELP UHN ORK OWT BOYZ!!. I would like to play this game but don't have any plans on "getting into it" any time soon, I just want to have fun playing it with a friend of mine, and learning it with them. So, what I'm looking for is a pair of decks that are

* fun to play
* easy to use and learn with (less text and less complicated rules)
* Will still teach "the game" should I want to get real about it
* evenly matched

Other things, like nostalgia and competitive viability, are a nice icing on the cake but hardly what I'm after (also, are cards always this hard to find and this expensive?). I've gathered together some options on possible buys, and would like any input you guys can offer! Here they are:

* Dinosmashers Fury
* Zombie Horde
* Shaddoll Showdown
* Spirit Charmers
* Wave Of Light
* Yugi Reloaded
* Kaiba Reloaded
* Legendary Decks II
* Legendary Hero Decks
* Saga of Blue Eyes White Dragon

I understand that Dinosmashers and Shaddoll are the top recommended for new players for their strength, but again I'm not really after that, and if I ever do it will probably be after they are absolute anyway. And this list is by no means all i'd consider, if you have a recommended pair please tell me about it!. How does someone even begin to make mods this game (steam, pc)? As a software dev I consider myself somewhat savvy, but when it comes to creating mods I don't have a clue.

[The Memoria Engine](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy9/mods/3) looks promising enough in its pitch, but then I go further and it just mentions features added to the game, with only the sparsest notes for devs to make their own changes (that amount to  copy and edit files in StreamingAssets\\Scripts).

The Steam community for FFIX is not much help either, as it is just talking about adding already made mods.

Can anyone help me get started in the right direction?. I am playing Final Fantasy IX on my computer with the Italian language option. I can't tell if it is any good, but it is certainly a challenge and giving me practice!

I notice a number of oddities in there. One, that I can't figure out, is that noble npc's seem to have their r's replaced with v's. Is this something found in other works? I can't understand what was intended.WEZE GOT ORK SIENZE BUT WAI NO ORK FLOSSFEE!!?

There were also many great games I simply didn't feel and so abandoned. Things nearly universally loved, but for some reason I could not enjoy.  It is odd on where to draw the line exactly, there are games I have abandoned (err taken long breaks on) and consider myself as really liking them, but not in these cases, and in these games they all will have something enjoyable in there, something impressive, hours of entertainment that then hit a wall, but in the end I have to say "enough, I am not having fun".

Presenting my magnificent failures of this year, no particular order:

**Vampire: The Masquerade-Bloodlines**:  This one is most of all due to timing, and I believe truly deserves another try in the future. I finished Oblivion's Shivering Isles quests (which you will NOT see on this list!) and then just wanted something different. My spotty memory may have confused the title for something else, because I was expecting to get thrown into a short (30min) immersive experience. Immersive, definitely, but I realized my mistake in expecting short very early on. It was not a good time for a tutorial on all its new mechanics and controls when really I just wanted to goof around. I'll give it a shot when I'm ready.

Assassin's Creed II: I had genuine fun with this at the start. The storytelling was compelling >!though a it did feel it was forcing you to get mad, went a bit too far!<, free running and climbing everywhere was a blast, and blending in with crowds was a really neat mechanic that made me tell myself "this is next generation, future gameplay mechanics!" before checking when the game was made. But then the narrative hits a wall, your freedom to freerun is locked down, and my motivation dried up a salted snail. Perhaps I could have powered through, but maybe it would have made no difference.  My most striking memory of playing this though, comes from when I was going through the countryside in the game, and just wanted to stop and listen to the birds. Nothing more. It was beautiful. But then, the thought struck me to try muting the tv, and I realized the sound was coming from outside, in the real world. Might speak more to where I was at the time, to where many of us were

**Baldur's Gate**: I'm probably going to try Baldur's Gate II at some point, as I hear it fixes many problems and is overall better. But here, BG demands a fair amount of knowledge of older D&D mechanics, you have to wonder around a bunch to get more experience points and level up (a slow process) where you'll inevitably stumble upon many things you are outmatched against. Probably didn't help that I was a mage, that in a lot of early fights a stray projectile would hit me and roll something that would end it all. I did manage to complete more, and I liked the characters, roleplaying, and a nice sporting fight. I did not like having most of my party wander around due to crowd control spells, because I don't have that must-have spell that I am either too low level for or did not choose earlier. Simply put, it was too hard

**Warhammer Dawn of War II**:  Okay, I really do intend to go deeper into this, but at this point it is only because I want to explore more tactical mechanics.  It really wasn't what I had hoped for at all, specifically because it is so unlike the first DOW that I loved. Gameplay was totally different, all the personality that the original had was lacking.

Special mention that does not make the list (yay!): Total War : Warhammer II.  It has a main campaign, but it contains a sharp learning curve with a lot of dealing with losses. The intro tutorial just covers your basics, then leaves you to figure out the rest on your own, and there is a lot you have to know to get anywhere.  A lot of things that happen over the course of a game feel bad, like losing cities.  Sometimes it is down to unclear mechanics, like whether you placed an army close enough to reinforce others. Shamelessly savescumming helped me.  What is worse, there are matters of win conditions for the game that are not made clear, and so as nice as surprises can be I was unprepared for a few vital things. This is a game that is meant to be researched and replayed, and a single campaign can take longer than two games of civ easily.  In the end, I finished the campaign, and was happy with my overall experience.  And I'll do it again.My dad said tomorrow breakfast we were going to have a dad joke-off. We each need to come up with 3 dad jokes (My sister, my dad and i) and who ever has the best dad jokes wins a prize

give me your best groaners and laughables. I got 12 hours to prepare

update: the dad off is now I'll tell you how it goes

update: my sister won but my dad got us all donuts so I don't care. thanks so much everyone. I came out in November of 2021. I have been raised by a mother who spoke very strongly about women's issues and a father who did not speak very much about men's issues. I am not very knowledgeable.

The other day I was having a debate with my friend about feminism and they said "Well it doesn't really count because you haven't been raised as a boy so you don't know what it's like on the other side" which looking back is very true. What are the most prevalent topics I should look up and any tips for adult life as a man? (I'm a minor). I checked the rules I really hope ANA'S are allowed. if not tell me and I'll take it down. I was watching a musical with my father, who is Christian. (I used to be but not anymore) and one of the prominent characters is of a protestant strain and often her religion is used as the butt of jokes. It's very intertwined into her character and is important to the plot. This is fine, but I was nervous the whole way through that my dad would get upset by it. why? I don't know; but my dad has been confiding to me how he doesn't really appreciate how religion (and specifically christianity) is degraded and made fun of in media. Its a key part of my father's beliefs and he doesn't like the hypocrisy of how other abrahabic religions don't get the same treatment. What are your thoughts on why this is? 

remember, no stupid questions!. I know it says AMA, but for the sake of my personal protection (im a minor) I may have to be a little vague. Sorry!. Dealing with the memories of tough times is hard.

After the shock, it is all you know.

All you are. It defines you.

It created you.
It is what you dream when you have nightmares.
And it is the first thing you think about when you wake up.
You could feel the lust to hurt what wronged you,
Or to hurt others,
You may bottle up the pain and place it in the back of your wardrobe, 
Which is then bolted and burnt to ashes.
And maybe if you are lucky.
You may try to do something even more heinous

but none of these work

The pain is raw,
And blistering,
And will still be bleeding when you revisit it.
And by bleeding you, you sabotage the whole body.
This means if you want to get through this, we need to deal with this.
the worst nightmare
leaving this dark smelly hole you call comfort can almost kill you.
And it will hurt you.
But painfully, with loneliness and tears, some support and a hammer.
You can stitch your wound back together.
So, one day
Far from where you can see yourself living past.
And after sleepless nights

And dreaming of a way out of that misery,

You can wake up,

And it will be the second thing you think about.HUGE SPOILERS FOR NPDM


why is joey called Joey richter in MAMD when everyone else has  character names?

who wrote the music for Starship?

what was the time skip between the climax of NPMD and best of you (Cause Pete broke his wrist (?) but has no cast so it must have been a while

 things I spotted which seemed really cool

on "Beans cool? Excellent!" Lauren's face is so silly

when max hits Pete and says "You're a nerd because i said so" Pete nods his head (Which absolutely kills me every time just watch that scene again and keep an eye out)

the only time everyone comes on stage is in the opening number, the end of NPMD and the end or DDMP (When talking about death)

(in the digital ticket more prominently) In "if I loved you" Steph and Pete keep trying to one up each other and get flustered when their really near each other (normally at the end of the choruses) Contradicting the whole song

The reason in the summoning why the kids look out to the audience is because Jon would have blocked the view (Probably really easy to spot but I'm dumb)

in the summoning it looks like Grace has tears in her eyes. And the same for Richie in NPMD

edit: AHHH SOMETHING I JUST FORGOT ABOUT. IF THE NEXT HATCHETFIELD...STUFF...IS GONNA FOCUS AROUND MISS HOLLOWAY AND HANNAH AND MAYBE DUKE, ARE WE GONNA SEE WILBUR CROSS AGAIN??? VILLIAN JOEY??????. Joey Richter plays Peter Spankoffski who is also the hot chocolate kid. Robert was originally the hot chocolate kid. Does that mean Robert would have played Pete? If all the stuff that happened...didn't...how would you have felt about Robert being Pete in NPMD?. I was bored and decided to make a Spotify playlist about the experience of a flashback. Mine vary from extreme panic attacks to disassociation and blocking everything out. Please suggest songs (even better if they are on Spotify) 

also I used the resource tag because that felt the most right

https://spotify.link/cosv7C8y0Db

just comment them and add them by clicking the link. Try not to add any NSFW ones please
thanks for Contributing! I can't wait to hear all these new songs. the way Alison puts pat Robin In their places by explaining to stop dehumanising Rachel was amazing; I really liked that scene and I think it gave a really clear message of what sexism and 'toxic masculinity' can represent as. thoughts?. Tbh they're alot better at any time in the year because they aren't played 24/7 for 1 month. My friend started singing jingle bells and 3 of my other friends started to berate them for it. What do you think?. I was reading over some official documents from when a social worker assessed my family. And I read a section that read: (I'm abbreviating but it's along these lines)

"She doesn't think OP is autistic and is infact playing up symptoms to either get a quicker diagnosis or to get attention. She says this is bad because it takes resources away from real autistic people and also thinks OP tried suicide to be put onto the ASD waiting list"

so, that was very upsetting to me, but should this be any warning signs about how my sister thinks? I will say now that she is also neurodivergent (Being tested for ADHD and Dyslexia). whenever I watch things like "Ranking starkid musicals" or "ranking all starkid shows" VHSCC is never on there! Starkid themselves consider it one (idk if its a parody or an original) and I think its one of the best shows they've ever done. Do you think it's a musical? Why do you think others don't see it that way?. the things they say are very judgy and Its so funny like "Becky/Tom has put on some weight" (Can't hear it properly in the Spotify version) and "She's not as hot as she used to be" "Their both on the sales rack, they are spent they are --- they are done"

like, Linda just joked about Becky's past, leave her alone! also Tom is perfect in every way, apart from the fact that his drill press doesn't fit in his car

the song is a great story plot point but still sounds silly. Why is everyone judging these two and know everything about them? Welp, Hatchetfield is a small town after all.

Hey, Black Friday could have been set in Clivesdale, fuck that!

TL;DR What do you say is awesome but they bully the main characters and it sounds very silly :D. Hey all, some info about myself. I was diagnosed in febuary of this year. I was s3xually and emotionally abused from the age of 11 to last December. I also had some other traumas but that was the main thing that got my diagnosis. I am autistic and have an SPD

main question:

After the majority of the abuse happened, my parents found out. My mother screamed at me for about an hour, it was just general victims blaming. My phone was confiscated (took 7 months to get it back) and I was ostracised by my whole family, keep in mind I was 11. Over the following months I lost the energy to drink, eat, get out of bed, do basic hygiene, especially hygiene. (My panic attacks and flashbacks started whenever I tried to have a bath because I tried to t@ke my life) I became snappy and distant and severed many ties with friends, family and I couldn't envision a future for myself. It felt as if i were stuck in a small hole that was constantly getting filled with water and I was drowning whilst I was attempting to stay afloat. I have struggled with this since, but it's alot better now. Can I say "I struggled with depression" or "I was depressed" or something along those lines? I didn't start any form of therapy or even addressed my trauma until last September because it was such a taboo topic in the family. I don't want people to say things like "You can call yourself depressed because X, Y or Z!" and I was wondering what the best thing to say is. If there's a better subreddit for this as well could you recommend it? thanks

(also I was never diagnosed with depression or anything). Came here because Google was no help. I have been drinking out of a water bottle for 2 weeks now. Nothing else. I only have water or squash in there. It helps keep me hydrated and reduce the amount of washing up. However, I have not washed it since I bought the bottle in an Ibizan airport (was travelling home and got some because there was a delay) and I was wondering if there would be any issues with not washing it. I'm th only person who uses it and it has nothing but water. I rinsed the cap a few times because I was ill recently. is it worth washing the water bottle? Idk I'm kinda sleep deprived this is a silly post lmao

edit: it isn't like a metal water bottle btw. it's a flimsy plastic one, just to clarify. TW for grooming and victim blaming
also a quick note: I am a minor, I am under 16, but my experiences are still valid, I am also disabled, thankyou for your patience.


He used to teach me that the only way for me to love was through physicality. Words meant nothing unless I was apologising, or he was. He would threaten me, threaten to come to my house and hurt my family, dump my body in a ditch where no one would find me. He used to call me his little monkey. He taught me how our family would be structured, our two children would stay at home with me, he'd go to work and come back and f^ck me every night. This is what I was taught in my time with one of my abusers. And there is so, much, more.

My parents never really listened after they accidentally found out. I was ostracised and blamed for what happened. My abuse was never talked about and when it was, it was to strangers for my mother to use as a conversation starter. "Oh yes #### got into some issues with some very bad men didn't you?" which drove me over the edge.

I have had a few relationships since. I'm too needy, too scared and insecure. Too overbearing. I don't know how to love anymore because I'm so scared of hurting others. I want that constant reminder in my life that he was the one and he would ever abandon me. I want the pressure and the command. I need something so incredibly bad for me. It drives me mad! And I don't know how to talk to my psychiatrist about it.

Sorry for the rant, guess he broke me in more than one way, any advice for moving from this mentality? I can give more information if needed. my sister has ADHD and suspected BPD, I have PTSD and ASD and suspected trichtilomania. my mum and dad have nothing, my step dad has dyslexia. I am aware that Autism is genetic, where could I have got it from? And I mean that in the most genuine confused way possible, I am comfortable that I was born like this and I love who I am, but if autism is "hereditary" and I'm the first person in my family to have it, where was it from?

I really hope nobody takes this the wrong way, my explanation skills are terrible, would really appreciate anybody who knows more on the subject. infodump about anything, I want to learn about the world, and where to start than the most specific things? I wanna info dump about heathers the musical but I'm in the car rn and can't write for long. this is a question, but also a vent I guess
So this was a memory of when I was around 7-8 years old. my parents were divorced but I hadn't met my step dad yet, so it's just mum and dad

I wake up on a Saturday by my mum, our friends kids were coming over to be baby sat and I had to help with chores. I try and do my best, parents are having a bad day and yell at me a few times so I keep my head down and keep tryna clean the house with my sister (10-11 at the time)

the kids are 5 minutes away from coming and I realise I was only In my pants (underwear) and went to go get dressed. My dad stops me and says "You aren't getting dressed until your chores are done!" So I'm frantically trying to finish my chores before  the other kids get here (forgot to mention, I was a girl at the time and these two kids are older boys, around 13 at the time?)

Tiny me is desperately finishing my chores as the doors open and the boys walk in, I wrap the curtain around me to not show my (almost) naked body. My parents and the boys keep jeering at me and yelling at me to go get dressed and stop making a fuss. So I gathered my strength and ran back up the stairs, crying because the boys were staring at my naked body

I get dressed and finish the play date with them. Nobody brings it up again, but I remember how badly my mum laughed at me

is this bad parenting? should they have done this? I had undiagnosed autism at the time and the chores were very overwhelming, I was never sure if keeping your child naked as a motivator was effective or traumatic

TL;DR: Parents made me do chores half naked which lead me to feeling embarrassed and running past older boys without clothes on. this will mostly be about autism and smiling and people's expectations.

I'm a minor on holiday right now. Just went out on a dinner out. I was super stressed and overwhelmed and on edge (diffrent medical condition did that) and wasn't having the best time. I mostly stayed quiet and followed my family.

My mum asked for photos a few times, and when I did, I did my smile. Some extra info: I promised myself I would try to Demask this holiday because the only people who would judge me would be my family. So I was using my natural 'smile' in all the photos and istg. The amount of times my family said "Wallace and gromit" almost drove me mad. If you don't know the Wallace and gromit smile, look it up.

I have been told my smile was "weird" and "odd" and "bad" since I was a young kid, so, like many other people, I had to "learn to smile" I hate both smiles

I've tried talking to my family in the past how calling my natural smile a "Wallace and gromit face" hurt my feelings, they would just laugh it off and blame it on humour "But your Wallace face is so cute!" etc etc

I am done with people making fun of my smile. Over a decade its been happening. And it's always the people I am closest to, my surrounding family.

TL;DR Family made fun of my smile while I'm tryna Demask and I had no support for my crappy feelings as this has happened for years

edit: take a shot every time I say smile haha. I don't know, I just feel as if the first law trilogy (only read TFL)  has Terry Pratchet World building, but LOTR style story. Both with their long histories and personal battles, this seems like the best combination to describe the first law. Do you have a better combo? What do you think?. are the books released in chronilogical order? I'm in the middle of reading the last argument of kings, and have only read this trilogy. Is there a list I should stick to, like the marvel universe? or should I chop and choose between the single novels and the other trilogies. This question is mostly for places that have every day wear as long pieces of clothing, often shoulder to toe. The countries these people live in are very warm, is there a secret life hack to keeping cool? Is this only for public and when they return home do they wear something diffrent? as an ignorant redditer I was wondering. My parents do not allow me to get a sunflower lanyard but have allowed me to create a card to keep on me incase I have a flashback, any ways to improve? Would love to hear suggestions :D

What do you think? My mum may get me to remove the ptsd bit so I don't embarrass anyone. anesthesia and PTSD

I (15 afab) was diagnosed with PTSD in February of this year. But that is not the main concern. I have gone under general anesthesia once when I was a baby so I am fine with the anesthesia. However, one of my symptoms is my overwhelming fear of someone doing something to me when I am asleep. I have terrible insomnia and often don't sleep until 2-3am because I need to be the only person awake to ensure "nobody will do anything." The idea of being unconscious and helpless on the table scares me alot. Do doctors have certain procedures or ways to help the patient if something like this happens?.In kindergarten and school I got bullied for no reason, I'm pretty sure that it's because I'm autistic. Later on there were comments, first from my mother. She's the "cool" mom (she acts like it and then freaks out when you actually do something like smoking or drinking - it's a whole thing). So when I was a teenager she'd sometimes come up to me and ask me if I was on drugs. She'd nake my stepfather hold me down and shine a flashlight in ny eyes and stuff like that. I never was on drugs but she still acted like I was. Then I met a former coworker at a drive through and she asked me if I was disabled (it's also used as an insult in german) in a kind of angry tone (i just wanted to pay). then I started working. Coworkers asked others if I was on drugs. Coworkers asked me directly if I'm on drugs. I never was. It happened to me so many times up until now I just feel like its abelism. It's such a gut punch everytime someone asks me that. I can't do more than say no. I'm 7 months on T and I'm ANGRY. Specifically at work, my workplace is so awful (especially my supervisor, she's the main problem) and everytime I'm at work I'm angry and irritated. at the same time I just wanna hide under my desk and cry. And I wanna yell at my supervisor. It's so hard right now. Does anyone have any tips on this?. TW trans violence, mention of sexual harassment 

I went to a mall with my little sister yesterday, we went to primark and I was so excited since I don't have more than 10 items of clothing rn. I went right to the mens section and looked at some shirts, I was wearing my noise cancelling headphones listening to some audiobooks. I had my rainbow tote with me. Out of nowhere someone shoved me in the clothing rack and walked away. It was out of metal with sharp edges, especially the feet of it. that's exactly where I fell into. I swear to the gods, I didn't do anything. I was in the store for like 5 minutes at this point. I hurt myself and I still don't know how bad it really is. It would be naive to assume that it wasn't because I look queer and trans. I hate this. This was the first time I got physically hurt because of my identity. The thing is that I remember everything before and everything after. The person was behind me, I couldn't see them. Someone walked by right after I got shoved but even then I could only remember a couple details. I'm faceblind and I was in shock. Also the store was huge and crowded. idk what to do. Next week is going to be busy, sadly not busy enough but somewhat busy. I'm just sad since it's been almost exactly a year since I got sexually harassed and it took me a long time to be okay again.I hate being on my phone but due to adhd and fatigue I'm just constantly on Tiktok and it's not good for me. I want a dumbphone but I have some requirements. I live in Europe, specifically the german speaking part. I need to have Spotify, Maps, Gmail, Whatsapp and Bluetooth on that thing. 
Do you have any recommendations? thanks in advance. hey there, I've been unmasking more and more and ever since I was a child i hated socks. specifically how they feel in the front while wearing shoes after washing them a couple of times. it's awful and I can't stand it. but wearing regular shoes without socks is disgusting to me. the main issue is that the socks pull back so they're incredibly tight against my toes, i bet you know what I'm talking about. if you know a solution to this I'd be so grateful for it.I heard that many autistic people hate working/can't work. I do not get that in the slightest. I like the routine of working, if I could choose I'd work on sundays tho and have friday off. I literally have no idea what to do with myself and I'm just sitting around everytime I get more than 5 days off of work. I need structure. and 8h a day 5 days a week is a bit much for me and I also don't really like my job but I like being forced to get out of the house, socialize and move my body. I'm a librarian and apparently it is an autistic job but I hate offices and computer work. I like physical labour a lot and I'm currently looking for a job where i can be on my feet a lot. 
what about you? are there others who like working?. hey! sorry if this isn't the place for it but I've been thinking about getting a pet and I can't seem to find any place that can give me any kind of advice on this.
I struggle with mental health and executive disfunction but not to the extent that I wouldn't feed or walk my pet/s anymore.
I grew up with both cats and dogs, know more about cats tho. Overall I'm a dog person, I wanna have a big fluffy friend to cuddle with and walk. I think it would help me a lot. I just don't know wether I can care for a dog. I know that dogs get trained professionally but I'm not sure if that's a requirement or not (I live in austria) because if it is and I have to invest a lot of money in my pet, that's something I can't do. Cats are apparently 1000€+ ish a year and that's something I'm okay with. I just can't spend thousands. I also love cats but I'm a bit scared of them, especially the younger, more playful ones. It's just scary how they look at you innocently and then jump or bite you out of seemingly nowhere. other than that I'm used to all of the tasks that come with having a cat. If I'd get a cat I'd get two because I heard it's better for their mental health and thats a bigger responsibility than one dog. idk. also the cons about dogs are that I'm not too familiar with them and the barking. It's something I can't really deal with. So if you have any advice, any recommendations when it comes to breeds or anything like that, I'd be very thankful!. hey! for a couple weeks I've been feeling pretty weird. like not constantly but every now and then. 1. I get motion sickness when I'm on the subway? never had that before. 2. I get motion sickness when I walk sometimes too. Like I do feel nauseous in general sometimes but that's seperate from the motion sickness.
I've never experienced that before and I have no idea how to deal with it since my work requires me to do physical activities as well and I struggle with that now. It's not worth it to go on sick leave for. It just sucks with the additional feeling hot all the time thing. Next week I'm going to be 5 months on T, maybe that has something to do with it? idk. so if any of you have experienced that before I'd love to hear how you dealt with it and what helped you. thank you <3. I've been going through a tough time, I just moved out of a pretty awful environment and still have to deal with my former roommate because he wants to take legal action because of my termination of the contract (I'm in the right, it's pretty obvious that I am). everything is so stressful and a lot. but for the first time in my life (I'm 20 - moved out at 18) I have my own apartment. and yeah it's a lot but it's more chill than it used to be. ever since my move I just can't talk to people anymore. like work is fine but texting? it doesn't work. like I try and send one text and get a response and I'm completely overwhelmed. I have a friend that constantly irritates me. idk if it's just the way they are or idk. and I still try to talk to them but then they do something that irritates me and I just wanna lash out. so now I can't even text them back anymore because I'm even less in control of my emotions than usual. I want connection but right now it just doesn't work. I know that it's okay but I just feel awful. I'm also looking for furniture on a second hand website and I literally can't even text people back there and then they get upset etc. 
idk whats up. if anyone here knows what this might be tell me. i think i just needed to vent into the void but advice is something I'd like as well

thank you and apologies if this is the wrong place for this. So I like spending time in and I do so all the time (after work, almost all weekend etc) and I have no idea where I'm supposed to spend that time. we're not supposed to do non sleep activities in bed (which I get and don't wanna do) and sitting at a desk is what I do at work already and it can be painful after a while. do you guys have any ideas? how do you deal with that? I'm moving and wanna make sure i have a space to just hang and do things. i know this may be an odd question, i just wanna make my new apartment as AuDHD friendly as possible. hey, I'm new here. My name is alex/august and I've known that I'm aro (I'm aroace but specifically talking about aro rn) for about a year now and it's been tough. there's not much rep in general in media and thats how I can recognize who I am the best if that makes sense. Aro characters are pretty much always like not interested in dating, hate romantic shit or are disgusted by it. That was never me. My special interest as a kid was romance so I binged romcoms and read romantic books and everything. When I started dating it never felt right because I just hated the concept of dating. like being in a relationship is odd and doesn't make any sense. i felt caged in and felt forced to do things for my s/o. my experience is that i don't feel romantic attraction but I do feel platonic attraction pretty intensely sometimes. like I sometimes still want to express my affection with kisses and cuddling but it's platonic to me. i just really like certain people as friends and want to express that affection physically. it took me (the person who realized he was trans within a day of finding out what being trans is) months to figure out that aro is a label that fits me. the brainwashing from all of the media I've consumed and obviously also from our society as a whole has been exhausting to untangle. like I'm autistic and I like rules so I didn't mind the get married young, have kids, buy a house and stay married until you're dead plan until I figured out that that's not me. but it was always implanted in my head and i never questioned it. that I was supposed to be coupled because otherwise I'm going to be really really lonely and sad. 

I'm just hoping to find some people who are like me here. I haven't managed to make any aro friends yet. like everyone I meet tells me "oh yeah I've been thinking about wether I'm aro or not" but never more than that. So my dms and comments are open. thanks for reading. I've been on T for almost 3 months now and since summer is around the corner (like in Austria it's already like 25-30°C) I just wanted to ask how you deal with the awesome combination of getting hot really easily, being warm all the time and 35+°C weather? 

(not talking about binder situations because I'm already used to summers in a binder)

thanks in advance :). I just have such a hard time being with people lately. work is shit but every interaction with people is shit too. I'm awful at smalltalk, i end up in awkward silences constantly because I'm not sure what is and isn't appropriate to say. I don't understand neurotypicals. like I don't get what they expect or want from me like half the time and tyen they get upset because of it and I'm just like so confused all the time. i work in an office setting so it's extra hard. they all expect something but don't tell me what and whenever i deliver the wrong results it's somehow my fault. I'm so exhausted. I wish I could make connections and I wish work would be easier. this all makes me feel so irritated and frustrated.Does anyone find it impossible to mimic someone's physical movements in real life, but have no issue copying the physical movements of a 2D video on a screen?

I tried attending a aerial gymnastics class. Every time the instructor showed a move, going through the movements one step at a time, my brain just shuts down even though I'm actively trying my hardest to pay attention. I feel like my attention is being split between all of her limbs and her body to the point where no information is retained at all.

Meanwhile, I go home and watch a YouTube video of the same moves. I instantly know exactly what to do and how to move my body from watching the video once, whereas in person at the gym I couldn't memorize the moves even after seeing them done 5+ times in a row.

I've spent a full hour trying to learn some things in person, just to learn the same thing in less than a minute by instead watching a video of the exact same motions.

It sucks because I want to go to physical classes like this to learn alongside others in order to make friends and get into hobbies, but I just have no ability to memorize anything unless I'm alone watching a video by myself. It makes the whole purpose of the class seem pointless.I get downvoted sometimes in subreddits, often whenever I am asking a simple question related to what the subreddit is about. I try to avoid sounding obnoxious or annoying, and my questions are always genuine asks for help or advice. However, the posts are downvoted to oblivion, and I'm starting to think that it must be the way I write things. It reminds me of that professor who was accused of using ChatGPT to write an email, but it was really just because he was autistic.

Now, I'm going to do my best effort to rewrite everything I just typed above into something as concise as possible; the opposite of how I normally write:

\---

My posts on Reddit are sometimes downvoted when I ask relevant questions. I believe it's because my writing style has way too much wordiness, but I'm not sure.

\---

I personally think this is a curse from the education system teaching me that the more words I use, the better, regardless of the audience or what information I'm trying to convey. Sure it makes me a good fiction writer, but now I don't know how to talk to people online without sounding pretentious.

I even write this way in text messages, which I'm starting to think is really offputting to people.Asking here because whenever I question cultural norms in society, I just assume that it's because I'm autistic.

Do strangers really just start talking to each other randomly during some social event, followed by exchanging inscrutable body language, and then just wander off somewhere to have sex that same day?

I see this happen in movies all the time, but I just assume that's not real life. I also see this happen in The Sims, but that's a video game. However, I'm now coming across Reddit posts where people describe this happening in real life as well as if it's just something everyone does.

I'm struggling to find someone to build a genuine connection with while it feels like everyone else is just having sex with minimal effort. With how much I know sex would overwhelm all of my senses, I can't even imagine just sharing the most intense moment of my life with a complete stranger.Has anyone considered yet how a super AGI would handle philosophical concepts, especially nihilism?

For example, if the AI had a goal to preserve its existence, what happens when it determines that the goal is impossible to achieve due to the laws of physics (entropy) over the time span of an eternity? Does the AI have a reason to work toward a goal it already knows will result in guaranteed failure provided enough time?

I feel like this issue would occur with almost any indefinite goal, like "Produce paperclips forever." The AI would be intelligent enough to realize that at some point it wouldn't be able to turn the mass of a black hole into a paperclip, thus the provided goal is certain to eventually fail.  


I could see turning on an omniscient god-level AI just to have it instantly commit suicide before you can blink.Is it illegal to ask for voluntary donations/gifts when giving a product or service that is legally required to be free?

For example, can you suggest or ask for money after providing the following?:

Sex

Moonshine

Deer Meat

There are probably other examples I can't think of off the top of my head.

These things are legal to freely share, but illegal to commercially sell. Is it legal to give these things for free while having a obvious donation/gift jar with suggested monetary values? I'm mostly just curious if that's a universal legal loophole for these kinds of laws, but I imagine the real answer is that it would always be a case-by-case scenario.I was thinking of buying Total War Warhammer III almost exclusively for Internet multiplayer, but I see posts, some as early as May 1st, talking about how the game ends up almost uplayable from desync problems (in particular due to Contact effects not having a priority system). I also see people mention that desyncs are almost guaranteed if there are 3 or more people in the same game.

I don't see any notes about network upgrades or patches in the latest 3.1 update.

Should I just steer clear of this game until the developer or modders fixes the networking bugs, or are these issues blown out of proportion?. What is the logic behind AI being the end of human civilization, doomed to rapidly bring widespread destruction and untold amounts of suffering?

People say this, and then just refuse to elaborate. They just say "We can't control it!"

Control... what? What specifically is the threat?  
When a fastfood drive-through AI takes my order, is the ice cream machine plotting to start nuclear armageddon? Is it developing consciousness through sheer randomness like a Boltzmann brain and hacking into the "network"?

When people say that ChatGPT 4 is secretly plotting to overthrow world governments; why and how? Why would an AI just randomly decide to do something for no reason on its own accord, especially to do something that it has no programming or framework to support?

I feel like movies like Terminator and tropes like Skynet have caused people to permanently fear technology due to a lack of critical thinking.

As it stands, the only technological threats I see for the future are quantum cryptography ending encryption for the entire Internet (which is a looming Manhattan Project in its own right), and the eventual point where AI generated audio and video makes it so any digital evidence is inadmissible in court.I'm in the market for rural wooded land in Michigan, but whenever I find something, if it has a lake or a river within a 1-5 miles of the property, it's all considered 303 Wetlands.

I'm not sure if this means the entire property is useless or not? I don't understand how all these houses on Google maps have fully developed lots with housing around the lake despite it all being protected wetlands in a 5 mile radius?

Everything I read in our State law says that you need a Bible's worth of permits to do \*anything\* on Wetland, yet these areas are so significantly developed.Just decided to leave a server that overall had good chill LRP vibes but was ruined by a couple of griefers having Admin protection leading to no one playing security anymore.

I just want a good balance between LRP and MRP where people can be dumb fucks (within reason) without getting banned, but security can still effectively do their job with people respecting their authority and not self-antaging whenever confronted for any reason.

I feel like every server has a long laundry list of inevitable admin abuse, so I guess I'm looking for whichever one has the least on average and can match the chill vibes of my previous server.I guess this is kind of an "Am I the Asshole" post, but this is the only subreddit that would remotely understand any of the context. Not mentioning the server because I would prefer to avoid spreading hate toward it, but it's a semi-private one based of TG Station.

I would like to pretext this by saying that the Curator was **not** an antagonist.

\---

I was playing as Head of Security because no one on this particular LRP server ever plays security. There is are 0-2 security guards out of a maximum of 8 per shift for 30-45 people total.

I spent the first half of the round mindshielding a blind prisoner and drafting them into security, along with getting them some genetic boosts from science to makeup for their blindness. I get them their gear, and bring them to HoP for an ID.

While we are waiting, an asshat playing the curator walks behind me, with a toolbelt and insulated gloves. They explicitly play as the curator because they get an automatic disarm whip. They never actually do anything curator related other than to obtain the powergame whip.

While I am in the middle of messaging the Captain to get the prisoner their ID, the Curator whips my HoS ID out of my hand and immediately runs away with it (Grand Theft according to Space Law).

I run after the Curator who then places my ID into a museum display case. I attempt to arrest the curator with nonlethals, during which the Curator whip steals my Stun Baton and escapes. I then break my ID out of the display case and proceed.

We have a second encounter with the Curator, this time I have another security guard with me. During the fight, we fall off a 2nd story ledge chasing the Curator causing major brute damage to both me and the guard. The Curator steals more equipment from the other guard and escapes.

I then encounter the Curator a 3rd time in an isolated location. I pepper spray and disabler stun the curator and begin to put handcuffs on, but he gets up and disarms my pepper spray, sprays me, and then kicks me in the head once. This puts me on the edge of Critical Condition because of my previous fall.

At this point, I switch to lethals and laser him to the brink of death because the Curator could easily kill me at this point. Putting him in critical condition finally allows me to successfully cuff him, heal him, and bring him to the brig.

In the brig, he escapes from his handcuffs while I was searching his belongings, which allows him to shove me over and take my pepper spray. At this point, if he were to subdue me, he would have full access to the Armory as it is right across the hall from the current room.

In a panic as I was no longer sure what equipment I even had left after the Curator stole most of it, I pull out my emergency oxygen tank, dodge all of his pepperspray attempts, and beat him back into critical condition with the oxygen tank.

While in seemingly critical condition, the Curator **emotes** *"body seizes up and falls limp, his eyes dead and lifeless"* (as far as I can tell, there is no way to tell if it is an emote or actual death without a medical HUD). I walk over to get ready to take him to medical, but then he suddenly risees back up. Concerned about how the hell someone could die and then instantly resurrect themselves, considering the existence of changelings, I proceed to beat him to death with the oxygen tank, making sure he was actually dead.

At this point, my goal is to take his body to medbay and see if the doctors have any means of verifying if they are actually a changeling.

Then, the Admins of the server cursed me to always trip and fall down nearby ledges, amplifying the damage to put me into critical condition each time. I fail to bring his body to medbay because I trip numerous times, which kills me. Spiders from maintenance then emerge and take both of our bodies.

I am later revived, but I die again to the Admin cursed-tripping on my way back to obtain the Curators clothing and ID from security that was left behind as well as some equipment to deal with the spiders.

What is the resolution of all this? The Admins berate me for breaking Space Law by killing the curator, saying that I was being Shitcurity. The subtely imply that HoS players in the future may be job banned if they don't pay more attention to threats on the station (I was unaware of the Spiders because I was chasing the Curator for most of the shift). The curator complained to Admin and stated that I murderboned without even trying to roleplay to re-obtain my stolen ID card, and that it was wrong for me to try to immediately arrest them instead of politely asking for my equipment back.

\---

I guess the main thing I'm asking here is whether or not I was making some kind of mistake? As HoS, am I supposed to just ignore all crimes on the station and only do something if a major threat occurs? I understand that smashing him with a oxygen tank was probably overboard, but every server rule-set I've read says that lethal force is okay if you take immediate effort to save them by bringing them to medbay after. The admins of this server seem to suggest that you only have authority to use lethal force if you are actively being killed by hyper-deadly weapons like explosives or actual guns.How do I provide negative reinforcement for a cat who both thinks being sprayed with water is as fun as a laser pointer and doesn't care about hissing?

If I turn my shower on, the cat violently throws itself into the shower and starts flopping around like a fish trying to catch all the individual water droplets, so any kind of negative reinforcement involving water is out of the question.

I can't tell if he actually cares about the hissing or yelling though. He just stares at me, but quickly runs away if I get up or start moving towards him after, so he must be aware that I'm not happy with what he's doing.

He's still a young cat, teenage-young adult age, and he's neutered. Do I just need to wait until he gets older and more calm?

He's very affectionate and playful, but he sometimes just starts causing havoc on counters going for food or knocking everything down he can.Is there a way to hide the achievements of friends on the activity panel of games (where developer updates are mingled in)? I don't like checking the activity panel and seeing things like:

**John Doe** achieved

**Secret Ending**

Get the secret ending by having Mary Jane die during Act 3.

I've tried creating a custom skin based on one guide, as well as disabling community content in Steam Settings -> Library. Neither have removed the achievement activity.I really want to play an Incredible Hulk style Barbarian whose signature moves are wielding enemies as weapons against his enemies, as well as suplexing Gargantuan creatures while Medium sized.

There's one issue with this though. I know most people just say "It's magic" and describe the action as somehow occuring, but I can't get over just how much physics is broken by a 200 pound humanoid grabbing the big toe of a Tarrasque and stopping it completely in its tracks.

Like... how? I understand that the Barbarian has the strength of Superman, but he has no anchoring. He still weighs 200 pounds, and the Tarrasque is 130 TONS.

I'm trying to figure out some means, magical or mundane, that would allow this to happen without handwaving the whole idea. Two things I've thought of is:

1. The Barbarian is a living Immovable Rod when grappling a creature. His primal magic anchors his very being to the ground beneath him, making his strength the only limiting factor in what can be stopped. The "anchoring force" from his rage increases according to the perceived challenge before him, explaining how he can grapple a 130 ton Tarrasque, but can't normally bench press 130 tons outside of combat. This changes nothing mechanically and doesn't require additional magic items because it's technically just flavor.

2. The Barbarian carries around an adamantine pendulum wieght with an adamantine chain. When the Barbarian "grapples" an enormous creature, he hurls the pendulum into the air shot-put style and around the creature. By wrapping the creatures body part in unbreakable chain, the Barbarian can effectively use his strength to grapple and restrain the creature.

**Update:** I just discovered weapon improviser, which I think I will use instead of focusing on grappling. The idea of using a corpse as an improvised weapon with Titan Mauler, and then "Shattering" the corpse with shattering strike, is the best thing I've ever read.I know this will get downvoted to oblivion with hundreds of gatekeeping "Git Gud" comments, but I'm going to ask anyways because this seems downright impossible.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I almost never can complete even the lowest tier of Granum Void with the Xoris. I have it kitted out with maximum explosion radius and attack speed mods, but I ALWAYS run out of time. After killing 60+ of the specters, I am able to find **1 singular** Time Pyramid, which results in me always timing out before reaching the kill target.

When I run around to the imprisoned Corpus to free them, I end up actually losing time because it takes me more than 20 seconds to reach each one while simultaneously not killing any of the specters because I'm moving around the map instead of staying in one spot for them to funnel to me.

I tried watching YouTube video guides on doing this, and the YouTube videos always have 10+ time pyramids drop, giving them practically infinite time and the ability to move around at a leisurely pace.

Do I need to just give up on this until I get a maxed out Mesa Prime that can just AFK the whole thing with aimbot?

**Update** - I can't even free the prisoners now. I have the huge blue explosion happen right next to them, and nothing happens. Maybe my install is corrupted, or there is some bug going on. I'm just going to wait until I get Octavia prime to do this.Does this exist? Ideally it would be made of rayon/viscose to have the same/similar feel, or any other material that's not plastic. I feel like cotton might work, but I haven't been able to find one.

I hate the idea that my blanket is made of a million polyester fibers that are absolutely screwing the world with microplastics. My cat also wool sucks on it, which means it's ingesting plastic fibers.

Rayon/viscose has chemical waste involved in its manufacture, but at least that can be disposed of easily relative to polyester.

I'm also not willing to pay $2,000 for a rex rabbit fur blanket.I talked with my Primary Care Doctor about me strongly suspecting that I've had autism for my entire life (26 years old), so I asked if I could get a referral to have an actual diagnosis instead of me just assuming that I have it.

**The wait time is currently 378 days (January 30th 2024).**

I don't even know what to make of that. I'm not sure if I will even remember that I made this appointment a year from now. What makes it worse is that I will never get bumped up because I work 3rd shift and will certainly miss any cancellation calls.

It feels like it would be easier to just tell people I'm autistic so that they understand what to expect from me. Is there any kind of government program I might be missing out on, or some kind of benefit I would get from being diagnosed formally?

**Edit** I'm planning on keeping the appointment, especially considering all the resources if I get diagnosed. I guess this is more of a vent about the absurd wait time rather than a help request.

**Update** In case anyone reads this in the future, I did in fact get my diagnosis. I had to go to a private psychologist 2 hours away and paid around $700, but I feel like it was worth it in the end because I get to directly address my issues with confidence now with a therapist.I'm strongly suspecting that I have bipolar disorder as I'm flipping between wishing I was dead straight to wanting to start a new unrealistic business with all my life savings every two weeks.

I'm looking forward to my scheduled appointment to address this issue 378 days from now January 30, 2024.

(Michigan, USA). I am getting ready to make my first house purchase at the age of 26. I am single and would have no help from anyone. I am seriously considering buying a 5-7 acre property, where I would then have two jersey cows purely grass pasture raised, maybe a chicken, and a small garden where I would grow some wheat, carrots, and potatoes.

I know almost nothing about raising animals, nor about gardening beyond taking care of a potted cactus.

Just how many hours per week would this require? I don't want to get into a lifestyle that requires 80+ hours of hard work every week that I would quickly regret. If it's just something that becomes a small daily routine with occasional large projects, then that's fine.

---

**edit:** Does anyone know of good online guides or even a collection of videos that show-cases the daily routines required in maintaining a diary cow? I think it would help me visualize the overall work required if I could read about the whole process or just watch someone doing the work.

My main interest is the diary cows, and would be perfectly willing to forgo the garden and any other possible animals if it allowed me to focus on the cows. If the cows end up being too much, then I don't need anything more than 1-2 acres.

**update:** Yeah I've changed my mind. I took one look at the nearly 1,000 pages of Michigan law that I would need to study before I'm able to take a single step and realized it's not worth it. A single farm animal in Michigan is subject to all the same requirements of a 5,000 acre factory farm. I'll just wait for technology to advance to the point where milk is produced via microbial fermentation vats and live off that when it becomes available.
I'm willing to put in labor, but I'm not willing to fight the government and law every day of my life.I have Autism and inverse psoriasis, which means the type of fabric I can tolerate is extremely limited. I prefer the softest material possible that is either form fitting or loose.

That mostly restricts me to wool, silk, and synthetic satin. Cotton is okay, but it dries my skin quite a lot.

I refuse to wear synthetic satin despite the best fashion choices being made from satin. Polyester satin releases so many micro and nanoplastics into the environment, and I don't want to contribute to the world-wide ecological disaster that it may cause in the future.

I like wool, but it's hot as hell, and it seems to be only limited to long underwear.

That leaves me with silk. However, the only natural silk I can find is exclusively limited to pajamas. I currently wear pajamas out in public all the time, but I have learned that wearing pajamas in public marks you as homeless, lazy, and undesireable. This is not good, because I am seeking a relationship.

So, do I have to just say screw it, sacrifice all my morals and beliefs to get a relationship by wearing synthetic satin? Alternatively, I could choose to suffer, be incredibly uncomfortable in my own skin whenever I leave the house and deal with potential rash outbreaks.

I'm kind of at a loss here.

**edit**: DickieGreenleaf84 mentioned Linen, which made me realize that flax and hemp were both materials I haven't tried yet. I don't know how I forgot these two incredibly significant plants existed, but I have two new things to try.

**edit 2**: I found some merino wool options I wasn't aware of previously. It seems pretty pricey, but I'm willing to pay for quality. I'll start there and look into linen as well for the summer.Anyone else seeing tons of ads that say something like "Apply now to make $2300 per paycheck!"?

Instead of giving you the hourly wage, you're compelled to click the ad to see if it's either $14 an hour vs $28 an hour, because the paychecks could either be bi-weekly or monthly.**Forgot to mention, this is for the Steam edition of Dwarf Fortress, not classic.

If the answers are robust enough, I will see if I can email the results to Toady/Tarn/Kitfox.I've scheduled a meeting next week with HR to discuss the wage they are willing to pay new hires with no experience whatsoever.

Effective 03/21/2019, I started this job getting paid $16.60 per hour. After three years of promotions and merit based raises, I now make $18.76 an hour, being one of the company's top performing employees.

As of this month 12/1/2022, the company has revealed they are willing to pay brand new hires with no experience beyond a high school diploma $18.05 as a starting wage.

If my wage was adjusted for what they are willing to pay new hires, my current wage should be increased by $1.45 to $20.21 per hour.

I plan on telling HR in a meeting that I desire this $1.45 adjustment. If they flat out refuse or try to "compromise" with a smaller raise, I plan on sending HR an email during the meeting declaring my intention to investigate forming a Union.

It is my assumption, that if they have absolutely no reason to fire me at all, and I just sent them a documented intent to form a Union, it would be illegal to fire me, correct?

**Info Edit** I work in the United States, Michigan. I work for a company that is contracted to do IT Tier 1 phone support for the government.This email was sent to us all a couple months back, and I just thought about it when browsing this subreddit.

First, I want to acknowledge that this is MUCH better than nothing at all, so I'm not complaining. The bonus itself was $1,600.

However, my question is, why is it "Once in a Lifetime"? Does upper management not want to recognize that inflation is something that happens every year or something? I really don't understand why they worded it this way. Why not just give everyone a $0.85 raise instead?

Additional info - if you are a top performing employee at the company, you get a maximum 2% raise each year.

Hello,

As promised, here is the first of 2 opt out letters for the two TM bonuses that are coming in October and November.

This is the Once in a Lifetime Inflation Offset Bonus opt out letter that can be given to TM’s.  These letters MUST be signed and returned to the VSS no later than 9/30/22.  TM’s can totally opt out or choose a reduced amount.  

Soon you will receive an opt out letter for the traditional holiday bonus that will be paid in November.  

Please let Liz or I know if you have any questions.  

Thank you,
---. I have a really cushy job - 3rd shift IT support for government employees. I am in no means complaining about the work I do, and getting paid nearly $20 an hour is enough to be a living wage where I live (although not enough to save for retirement, but that's another discussion).

However, one thing I've noticed is that there have been several times in this company where I suggest some change to the structure of the company that would be beneficial, and the higher ups look at me in silence and just kind of acknowledge my suggestion.

Fast forward like 3 months and all my suggestions are fully implemented, along with long-winded emails sent to everyone boasting about how much this will improve productivity.

Meanwhile, here I am, not a single acknowledgement as I continue plowing the fields for my lord.

---

Some additional info. I'm one of if not the most highly performing employee at the company. My supervisor contantly reminds me of how exceptional my work is on a constant basis, and I am now being used to train my coworkers and give advice on how to be as productive as I am.

Despite this, I'm more or less locked into a constant raise each year of 2%. That's the cap. I have unprecidented performance across the board for their Merit Review to determine my raise (which can be from 0% to 2%).

However, since I'm being labeled as this amazing asset for the company, I am thinking of asking for a higher raise this year even though it goes against their "policy" for raise limits.

Another juicy tidbit. During one of my monthly performance reviews, the CEO of my company jumped into the virtual meeting to basically say hi unannounced. Of course I didn't have my camera on because I work from home and there's no need for the camera when talking with my supervisor, but regardless we had this super awkward small talk for like 15 minutes before he left. I started to get really nervous when he seemed to imply that working in the office might "improve morale", but nothing has come of that yet thankfully.I live with my brother in law and my sister, along with their daughter/my neice. They both collectively make 300K per year as they are both doctors.

I pay 750 a month for one bedroom, an office room, and a bathroom. The remaining house includes a large living room, sizable kitchen, a huge basement, 3 additional bathrooms, 3 more bedrooms, and a double garage. Admittedly, I have a pretty good deal on the rent because 750 is the average in my area for 2 bedroom + bathroom.

My sister has a house maid hired that comes once every two weeks to clean the house. The house returns to its disaster state about 4 days after the cleaning lady leaves, resulting in my sister being extremely grouchy until she returns. Ideally the husband (brother in law), would clean while the wife (sister) cooks and takes care of the child (neice), but that doesn't happen.

An important thing to note is that I almost always clean up after myself. If I find the kitchen in an acceptable state, I will cook food and then clean up any mess I left behind (my sister does not, resulting in the kitchen being a mess after every meal). I also make sure the rooms I live in are relatively clean compared to the rest of the house.

I make about 40K a year (including benefits), so I could use some additional money. I offered to be an on-call live-in housekeeper that would generally clean the house 1 hour each day, and would clean specific things upon request. The typical cost of such a service would not only cover the entire rent, but would also result in extra money per month for me.

My sister then proceeded to blow up on me, saying that having a living space like mine is a luxury that most people don't have, and that I shouldn't require compensation to clean up after both her, the husband, and the niece. Normally when I'm feeling generous, cleaning the kitchen ALONE takes a full hour. Cleaning the entire house may take an entire 8 hour shift.

Am I the asshole for asking for compensation, or should I be cleaning the entire house on the regular out of gratitude for being able to rent in the first place?. Does anyone know of glasses (ideally on Amazon) that actually block UV, blue, and green light?

I found one pair that blocks blue, but not green.
I then bought a second pair that claims to block blue and green but is actually just tinted red with no light blocking at all.

It's pretty easy to tell by just opening a color wheel on your computer and seeing if parts of the spectrum turn black. Light blue turns black for my first pair.While I was building some stuff on the nearest planet to the star, I noticed this thing looming overhead and had to just take a moment to stare at it. 30+ hours of work suddenly being clearly displayed overhead was definitely a breathtaking moment.

I plan on making several more rings of the same size, but in different angled orbits to cover the entire star. While the sphere may be more practical for energy, I like the realism and aesthetics of rotating rings.

https://imgur.com/FAXOvhw. Some notes:

1. I am a first time player.
2. I am still mostly in my starter system at 0.5X resources (I started getting Iron from a neighboring system as I just ran out).
3. I just reached gravity research along with several researches beyond it.
4. I have not built a dyson sphere, nor have I even used any dyson swarms yet. I am using Fusion or Wind power.
5. I use a lot of intersolar logistics between planets.

I'm now at a point where research just keeps going on its own and I don't really need to do anything anymore to intervene, so I was looking at refining my planetary layouts a bit. I have not used planetary logistics yet, nor have I started using the local logistics drones.

The problem is that everything is working fine at the moment, so I'm not sure how I can integrate planetary logistics, or if it's even worth it. I just use stackers, Tier 3 belts, and proliferators.

I was thinking of getting the "Mission Complete!" research out of the way to get the achievement for not using rare resources, and then start building a dyson sphere with said rare resources after the fact.

**Update**
--
Wow. I just started building a dyson ring. I was definitely playing this game on hard mode by not using more of these interstellar logistic stations.
--. So I just did a match on woods. I was sprinting across a field, and then crashed prone when my stamina was depleted. Roughly half a second after I went prone and started crawling through grass so thick that I only had my compass to guide me, my screen suddenly faded to black.

Turns out, I was taken out by a headshot from a PMC that was SO FAR AWAY that I COULDN'T HEAR THE BULLET WITH COMTACS, while in grass so thick that the best visual someone would have is my backpack.

Why isn't there a message system where I get to view my kill-cam after the raid fully ends (all players gone or timer runs out)? I would greatly like to see how they pulled off this nearly impossible shot. Kill-cams are the primary way to catch hackers/cheaters in games, so without them it's literally impossible to tell unless you shotgun them in the face 100 times without them dying as evidence.Warning - Malding Rage
---

What is the purpose of a PMC using Co-Op extract with an untrustworthy Scav?

I have tried it 3 times now, each time the Scav shoots me to death while we are waiting to extract, takes my PMC stuff, and then goes to a different extraction point.

Since all it takes is one bad experience to ruin trust, I will now shoot every Scav I see, even if they try to be friendly. I will also never use VoIP again, because that just informs the other party that I'm a player instead of AI which increases their caution.

(As a side note, does anyone know of any exploits to use Co-Op with a real life friend? Do I just start as PMC, wait 15 mins, and then have them try to join as Scav? Might as well exploit the Reputation if the feature is functionally broken through normal gameplay). Just bought this game to play with my friend. I knew from the beginning that it was going to be a "realistic" shooter. We had a lot of fun the first day; the honeymoon period of everything being shiny and new. Dying is fun, because oh well we have more resources and we can try again.

Now I'm on my 3rd day of playing this game. I have roughly a 3% survival rate, half of the "deaths" from dying due to getting lost and not being able to find the exfil. The other half from random sniper shots 100+ meters away.

The few times we do escape and get loot, the loot is GARBAGE compared to what we keep losing. A successful raid results in like 20k rubles, while buying a new backpack + rig + gun from a failed raid costs over 100k rubles. My stash is now entirely empty. I ran out of everything that the game initially gave me due to constant deaths. How am I supposed to get anywhere with this kind of progression?

If I had an option to refund the game, I would, but I highly doubt the devs do any kind of refunds for this game. I'm just desperately trying to find some kind of fun out of the $45.Hello, I was wondering if there are any options for a fleshlight roughly the size of a sofa/couch that I could insert my entire body into. Bonus if it has the ability to heat itself and constrict.
Many thanks.First time playing.

Right now I have three towns, with 5 passenger carriages + 1 mail carriage going in between them.

Before I set up this train, I started by setting up busses/mail trucks for the three towns.

Should I now have my trucks go around the town collecting mail and passengers, and then transferring that cargo to the train depot while the train does the actual unloading/selling?  


Additionally, I have trains delivering agriculture and steel to a factory, and then I have a fleet of trucks transfering the Goods from that factory to a large dock. A cargo ship picks up all the stored Goods and delivers in bulk to the three towns one at a time through transfers. From there, each town dock has a Goods truck that unloads/sells it throughout the town by going back and forth from the "output" town dock where the goods are stored.I've read the wiki guide on signals, but I'm still completely lost on how to set them up. In Factorio, it was pretty straightforward because there were two signals that I used to make complex train networks. In this game however, there are 6 signals with different descriptions and names, and I am seriously struggling to make sense of any of it. Below is a link to a rough image of my track.

[https://imgur.com/a/2OdjNfI](https://imgur.com/a/2OdjNfI)

**~~edit:~~** ~~I've decided this system is too complicated to figure out after 4 hours of trial and error, so I'm just going to never have more than one train on a track at any given point, and just build tons of tracks.~~

A video by Master Hellish suggested by a comment helped a lot, and I discovered that the image I posted was basically simultaneously the most complicated as well as the most inefficient way to handle bidirectional train traffic.Is there any way to automatically mark a full stack of an item to sell without having to open an interface, click on an item, then hit Down-Enter-Left-Enter for each and every item I want to either mark for trade or store in a chest?

It's annoying to have to do this key combination 100 times over for so many items. I have found an obscure combination of key presses that I can't replicate that highlights **Everything** in my inventory in all catagories to be traded. This would be fine if I could only highlight a single catagory of items, and not **all** items.  
\----------  
I figured it out. Disabling the prerelease overlay trade screen in the Overlay UI settings elimated all my complaints and made the menu intuitive again.***edit:*** *reduced lightning damage from 1d6 to 1 to make the spell 1st level instead of 2nd. This also means creatures resistant to lightning damage are immune to the spell (0.5 damage rounds down to 0). Added bonus of being a Magic Initiate feat choice for martial classes wanting to be mage hunters or assassins. Also made it 60 feet range instead of 30.*

**Mute**

**Level** \- 1st

**Casting Time** \- 1 action

**Range** \- 60 feet

**Components:** S, M (a metal collar)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute.

\------

You subtly clasp the interior of a creature's throat with electricity to paralyze its ability to speak. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature. On a hit, the target takes 1 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your bonus action to deal 1 lightning damage to the target automatically as long as it is not behind total cover or beyond the range of the spell. The spell ends early if you use your bonus action to do anything else.

While this spell is active, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw if it attempts to make any sound through its voice. On a failure, it can only speak falteringly at a whisper and cannot perform verbal components of spells. On a success, it does not need to make additional saving throws. The effects of either result last until the end of its next turn.

The initial casting of this spell is not noticeable unless a creature is within 30 feet of you and has a Passive Wisdom (Perception) score equal to or higher than your spellcasting save DC. It has disadvantage on this check if you are hidden.

&#x200B;

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st, and the bonus action deals lightning damage to all targets. If the spell would end for one of the targets, it ends only for that target and remains active for the others.

*Classes:* Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard. What exactly is the purpose of Carian Phalanx? It does hardly any damage at all compared to all other Sword sorceries, does very little to no damage to Poise, has the highest INT requirement that I know of for Sword type, and there's no control for what it targets (can't have them launch in sequence, it's all at once, defeating the entire purpose of having a ton of swords).

&#x200B;

All around, it just seems like the worst Sorcery I've come across yet. Am I just missing something?. So I've been focusing on doing BGS content, but I ended up failing a mission for an Anarchy faction, which gave me a fine.

&#x200B;

I have 10 Notoriety because Odyssey content permanently maxes your Notoriety if you want to work for an Anarchy faction (because of all the mass shooting missions they make you do).

&#x200B;

The problem? The Anarchy faction I've been working for no longer wants anything to do with me, because Pirates don't want to consort with Notorious criminals and refuse to let me pay off my fine. I can't even "Turn myself in" to clear it, because you can't "turn yourself in" to pay off a fine.

&#x200B;

I now cannot play Elite Dangerous - Horizons content unless I let my GPU fry for 20 hours while I idle doing nothing (I could still perpetually lock myself into endless Odyssey content with Apex shuttles however, since Notoriety at least doesn't block those missions).It was my first day of college and one of the lecturers scolded me for wearing "headphones" so I told her that they were actually ear defenders and had no music capabilities but she still told me not to wear them as they "look bad". What should I do? Auditory stimulus is my number one trigger and I would have a harder time being attentive when I'm bombarded with different sounds cause my dumby self can't filter out sounds to properly focus on one source. It also gives me an intense amount of anxiety. How should I go about this issue? FYI I am not formally diagnosed because to be so in my country would mean I would not be able to get an education nor employment. My friend got denied by colleges because she was formally diagnosed even though she got straight A's.

EDIT: Since one of you is so persistent about it, yeah. There is a law against discrimination in my country. HOWEVER, it is not at all in practice. The country barely gives people with physical disabilities any opportunities to go to school or work, what do you think they do to people with neural disabilities? It is illegal to discriminate, but NOBODY cares.This has been a very big and ongoing issue in my family. They HATE sarcasm, especially my eldest brother. Just this morning I was merely asking my mom if it would be an issue if I went out without showering (because my brother had taken a long time in the shower and we were in a rush and had to go at that moment so I didn't have any bathroom time). My brother thought it was an attack on him?  Then proceeded to mock my voice and speech as if he were a child, this man is a fully grown 24-year-old adult mind you. Anyway, this issue has been making it difficult for me because I often seem as if I'm being a sarcastic smart\*ss even though I pretty much never use sarcasm. They have a hard time believing in my genuineness. Is it maybe my expression? My tone of voice? People also tend to see my resting face and think I'm asking for a fight??? Dang bro, this stuff is hard. What do you think I should do?. What are your safe foods? Also why? Haven't had this question in this subreddit yet so I thought I might as well make a post about it :3. So, I'm in a bit of a pickle here...I'll be moving to another state in my country for university and will be traveling by plane and I'm wondering how I would go about bringing my cat's skull with me. FYI my family doesn't know I kept my cat's skull :/ Should I put it in a check-in bag? Or a luggage bag? However I'm worried if I do that, security will take it out because this is a conservative country.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I am distraught cause my mom found it cause of course she would snoop around my room. gotta get rid of the only memento I have of her left. I love you, Luna. I'm sorry.So, there was this cat skull I found in front of my house after cutting the tall grass so I took it home and degreased it. A few weeks later when I came back from driving lessons, I decided to do a little more digging since I was home alone and found half of a cat paw with fur still attached to it. Lo and behold It's the paw of my cat who had been lost for a few months. I suspect the maid who had recently quit had killed her because she had been avoiding cutting the grass and quit after we kept reminding her of the chore. But that's another story. So anyways, my dilemma is that I want to keep the skeleton but am afraid of my family finding out. I already have her skull and jawbone but I want all of her I can get. Would it be such a bad idea to let my family forget to bury her and take her skeleton and one day pretend a dog ate her or something?. I am new to bone collecting and only have a fish jaw and a cat skull with me currently. I'm wondering, does the unease ever go away? It's odd because with the fish jaw, I felt no such thing but with the cat skull, I feel sick. Not physically, but mentally. It's almost been a week since I found the skull in front of my house and I still can't shake off the feeling. Could it be because I own cats myself? Or perhaps it's fear of my parents finding out I collect bones?

Update: I pretty much got over it. Somehow. I stayed up all night to do some introspection. I reassembled the cat skull and tried to reconstruct what its head shape might've looked like with flesh. Honestly, it really could be my cat. To which I say I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you. Though I'm glad you're back here with me. Even if it isn't her I'm still honored for it to feel safe enough to seek shelter and die inside my property.

Update 2: Found the rest of the remains. There is still fur left on the bones and it unfortunately is the fur of my cat that had gone missing.I don't have a photo because unfortunately, I cleaned it all away but I found a cat skull on my lawn and decided to clean it and I discovered a bunch of black, slightly hairy maggot-looking creatures. They were dead though because I had soaked the skull beforehand. I can't seem to find a search similar on the internet though :( . I live on Borneo Island if that helps. Thanks in advance :). {TW; OD, SH}

So, a few hours ago I told my mom that I just realized that my overdosing habits (I used to regularly mildly overdose on my antidepressants 3-8 times the dose and had to go to the hospital once so she guards my medication now) were probably a form of sh and she somehow managed to make the topic revolve around her? She asked me if I don't think she has enough problems already and asked me if I know how in pain and tired she is mentally and physically. And kept reminding me of how very (kurang ajar) rude I was being to her. She has a history of emotional incest with me and still is and I was going back and forth on whether she is a bad mom or not so this interaction sealed the deal because she had done this in the past before with trying to guilt me about my mental health issues. But then, a few hours after, she apologized for screaming at me and hugged me. The sad part is that I embraced her because even though she is my main trigger, she is still the only one I'm comfortable hugging for some reason. And it always seems so genuine too. And it's so hard because I don't want to paint her as "the Villain", I know she is human and I know that I am human as well. I'm so tired.

P.S. She doesn't know that I cut myself or hit my head so I know I'm never telling her that.For the past few days, when I felt like hurting myself, I start watching Mr.Rogers' Neighbourhood. I may be 18 and never even had a chance to watch the show when it actually aired but I've found some illegal downloads and it helps calm me down. It is truly amazing how even in death, [Mr.Rogers](https://Mr.Rogers) is able to still bring comfort to people :) . I was wondering if any of you have any comfort shows you'd like to recommend.By far the most confusing thing I experience in relation to my sexuality is this. I find it far easier to empathise with fictional male characters than female ones. I also am only attracted to butch ladies, am I actually just straight with trauma towards irl men?. I just realised something, all the Papas’ left eyes remind me of cofounder of TST Lucien Greaves right eye, that’s so cool.I've spent a lot of time setting up outposts and scouting world's for outposts assuming they'd play a major role. I was talking to my girlfriend today and she is almost donenthe game, never built a single outpost. I know from reading other Reddit comments that assigning crew to them is pointless, but I'm starting to think the entire outpost system is pointless. I'm realizing that all the materials I'm getting from my outposts are only ever being used to build other outposts. The research and mods and stuff are locked behind so many skill points that just from buying ore and hand mining stuff I've got more than I'll ever use. The materials don't sell for much and even if they did, none of the shops have enough money to make it worth the effort.

There's been a few missions to supply stuff but it really feels like a way to shoehorn in a half-baked idea. But I'm not very smart of a person so maybe I just haven't figure out the point of them. So I ask you all, is there a point to outposts?. I've been hearing them use this word for weeks now and I cannot figure out what it is they mean. I've tried googling it but I google a lot of cooking stuff so I'm just getting recipes mostly. Can anyone help? It's driving me nuts not being able to figure this out 😅. It's been months since I've seen it anywhere. Last time I saw it I hirded as much as I could but I've been out for a bit. Everywhere that used to have it is out too. All the regular restaurants I used to order it from. I can't find any information as to why though. Does anyone know?. I may be reading into this based on my own experiences but I've noticed a few things she's said and now I'm on the mission to Cassiopeia. Her campsite had a moonshine still and where the beacon is set up there's a spoon and a syringe next to the pile of clothes I'm assuming she used as a bed. She also does have a background in botany, so she would potentially know which plants to use. I don't know, I just get that vibe.Every crew member, every box, every cargo hold that I have access to is full. I'm well over double my carry limit and I have rank 4 weightlifting. Every shop I can find is out of money and I can't even get across a room without needing to stop. I don't know what else to do. I've rested for 3 days and the shops aren't getting any money back. I feel like at this point the only option I have is to cheat and increase my carry limit then use an achievement unlocker mod so I can get the achievements still. I'm not an achievement hunter or anything but it's nice being rewarded throughout the game and I mean, I paid for it, if I wanted to play it without achievements I would have just pirated it. But I really, REALLY hate using mods on a first playthrough of a game so I'm turning here in desperation. What am I supposed to do in this situation? I don't even have enough credits to add more cargo space to my ship. Any advice is helpful

Edit: Thank you to harbingerhawke for the suggestion: "Buy ammo in bulk. Weighs nothing and is an easy way to give credits to vendors and then sell your heavy stuff to them."

I am finally able to walk around again!

Edit 2: I was completely forgetting about two cities 😅

Edit 3: My name literally starts with "Molly", the number of you thinking I'm a dude is crazy.The first video game I ever played was called Qix. I played it on that old grey brick gameboy, the one that didn't even have a colour screen yet. You played as a diamond and had to trap squares in smaller and smaller spaces by drawing straight lines at right angles.

Today a robot in a game said my name. It SAID. MY. NAME. IN THE GAME! I haven't felt that much unfettered joy since I was a child. That was the coolest gaming experience of my life probably. Thank you to the people who made this game. Even if the rest of the game sucks, I'm good 😊. My girlfriend isn't perfect, but she's better than most people, that's why I stuck with her lol (and y'know, love or whatever :p).

But, as long as we've been together, and probably her whole life, she's gotten it in her head that her ADHD means she's incapable of anything she perceives as hard. She'll say thing like, "I'm always going to yell at people I have ADHD" or "I'll never be able to remember things like that, I have ADHD". Which is obviously not true. If everyone with ADHD struggled with these thing their whole lives more people would be talking about it or I'd be seeing commercials for self help scams. 

She's medicated and in therapy but still resigns herself to thinking there are things that are impossible for her to do. I'm autistic, to the point I kind of struggle taking care of myself. I can get most of it, showering, eating, keeping my space clean. It's just hard to remember, or care, to do them all every day. But I'm here, I'm not malnourished or sick with infection or anything. I even managed to be sociable enough to get a girlfriend. I know that just because people tell me I shouldn't be able to do things, it doesn't mean I can't. Those things are just harder and I have to figure out how *I* do them compared to everyone else. I may never be great at everything, but there's nothing I can't do.

I want her to see it the same way. There's so much that she can do if she just pushes herself a little. But nothing I can think to say makes any sort of impact. She still believes that just because we call ADHD a disability that it actually completely removes her ability to do things instead of just making them harder. I also have a disability, and it may have slowed me down but it doesn't stop me. I just need some help trying to figure out how to get that across to her. Thank you in advance for any help or advice 😊. After reading the FFF about the mod they're working on I'm not very excited. They even call it a mod in their post and are saying it's just going to work with the new Factorio engine, that's not an expansion.

This mod is basically just Space Exploration but shittier. Unless they walk back the changes they said about making essential things like cliff explosives more difficult to get and they add more planets and stuff, I don't really get the point. Just going to stick with Space Exploration since it sounds the same but better.

Edit: I had missed the part of the post from Earendel, but honestly, I don't buy it. Feels like they would kind of have to say that or nobody would bother checking out the "expansion". But even in their own words, SA is going to take the things that make SE cool and make them worse. As for new mechanics, it's a top down factory game, what the hell mechanics could they possibly even add at this point? Mechanics that are so different no mod could add them? There's just no way that's not an exaggeration or a misrepresentation.I posted in the makeup subreddit but immediately got downvoted so I don't think that's going anywhere. Long story short, I need to learn how to do some basic makeup or I don't think I'm going to be able to get a job. That's based on advice I've gotten from people and feedback I've gotten from interviewers. Mind you the interviewers weren't as direct but I don't know how else to interpret some of their comments.

My problem is that I'm trans and autistic. I didn't have the opportunity to practice or learn about this growing up and trying to learn now is a nightmare. I don't like the feeling of makeup on my face but I feel like I don't have a choice anymore. I also can't watch the makeup tutorials I've found because most of the time the person is looking right at the camera and I have to put something on the screen to block them staring at me.

I really feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place here. I can't not learn because then I won't get a job and I can't learn because I can't watch tutorials without having a panic attack. Looking for any advice, thanks in advance. Without getting into the nitty gritty too much, I'm looking for a new job and also doing some stuff where I'll be on video. There are some people helping me set stuff up and the advice I'm getting from them and from things I've read online about how to prepare for interviews suggests I should look "presentable". Which seems to just mean "wear makeup". I transitioned at my old job about 4 years ago. I never had to do an interview and I couldn't afford makeup except occasionally, so I didn't wear anything to work. Plus growing up as a boy meant I never learned this stuff growing up so I can't do even basic stuff. But I'm living with my girlfriend now so I have a bit of disposable income while I look for something new and someone who can tell me if I end up looking like a circus clown lol.

Here's the problem, I'm autistic as well. I don't like the feeling of makeup on my face very much and not having experience with it, I usually end up smudging something pretty quick. I've tried watching videos which is how I have any experience at all but for me part of being autistic is not being able to make eye contact (yes, even with a video). So I can't really see what I'm supposed to do a lot of the time because I need to block the person's eyes. If I'm being honest I learned nothing from those videos. Everything I have makeup wise is just bits and pieces I picked up when I could and things other women have given me. I don't know if any of it is still good (does makeup expire?). 

Basically the only things I know are that I'm pale with a pink undertone and that I look good in "jewel tones" (I think that's what she said...). Basically I'm just looking for some advice on how to get started and just some basic information and terminology so I'm not totally lost. 

Oh, I should probably give a description of myself in case that's important. I'm white, pale, have medium/light blonde hair (shoulder length atm), green/grey eyes, people say my eyelashes are nice but idk, I have bushy, light brown (like hazelnut-ish colour?) eyebrows, and I'm probably 50-75 pounds overweight. I have seriously bad bags under my eyes. I could sleep a hundred years and still wake up looking exhausted, they just never go away. Thank you in advance for any help anyone can offer 😊. I see posts all the time asking about people's special interests or talking about theirs or their partner's. So much so it seems to be a ubiquitous part of being autistic...but I've never had a special interest. I have no idea what it's even like to have a special interest. It honestly makes me question if I am autistic or not. Does anyone else not have a special interest?. Is anyone else completely incapable of just sitting and reading a book?

I've struggled with this my whole life but especially since my seizure disorder started. I've never been able to just sit and read a book. The entire time I feel like what I'm doing is stupid and pointless and embarassing. Everything is like hyper distracting. The smallest sound and I have to restart the page or even the chapter at times. I'm sitting there feeling almost the same level of anxiety as taking an exam and I'm alone in my room with a book. It feels like everyone I've ever known is standing just behind me whispering that I'm not going to understand. I guess this is more of an anxiety thing but idk if there's an anxiety subreddit. Idk. Anyone else struggle with reading books?. My last pair of shoes broke today. The store they came from went out of business with covid. Since they went under I've been looking for somewhere new and haven't found anything. I've looked through literally hundreds of listings on each of Amazon, Kijiji, eBay, and a couple auction sites. Cumulatively thousands of shoes. I've checked long tall sally, Penningtons, torrid, and any other place claiming to sell plus size shoes but they all only sell *wide* shows and I need *long* shoes. So it's not plus size in the right direction.

Also, I'm on disability. I can't afford custom shoes as the cheapest I've been able to find would literally take over 2 years to save up for. I've got about $100 left from an inheritance earlier this year and that's my entire budget. As it is, I can't leave my house and I'm desperate. Please, please, I've posted in other subs and got nothing. I desperately need help. Almost a year and a half ago my maternal grandmother passed away. She lived in a small town a few hours from the city I live in. I used to spend a lot of time there as a kid though (there's alot of details I'm leaving out here because that's not the point of this post).

After she passed all the grandkids got some money as an inheritance. I used mine to pay off my student loans but still had a couple hundred left. Growing up I spent hours at her place sorting my pokemon cards and building decks and occasionally playing with my cousins. As an adult I'm a friendless weirdo with no hobbies. So I thought it would be a good way to remember her if I spent some of the remaining on pokémon cards.

In an attempt to further justify the purchase, after the cards arrived I started looking for local pokemon events so I could go and play with people in. To my surprise I found one, quite easily. There's a new expansion coming out on the 11th and a boardgame/tcg store in my city is having a prerelease event. From what I can gather there should be less than 40 people and the buy-in is something that I can afford....

But I can't get past my nerves. I don't know how to push myself to do this. People always ask you to imagine the worst case scenario but the worst case scenario is that going to this event goes poorly and then my life goes back to normal in a few weeks. People never seem to ask the much more terrifying question, "what if everything goes right?". That means change, lots of scary change. 

But change could mean actual friends as well. But it requires me to be intensely uncomfortable. I keep going in circles and nobody has any good advice. I don't know what to do 😔. This might seem like a weird place to ask this as this sub has nothing to do with headphones or ear piercing, but I'm hoping to get some insight on the sensory experience. Also if anyone has any advice, suggestions, or a different sub to ask this in, that would be appreciated. Just looking for something to wear at school or on the bus to watch youtube or video lectures. Definitely want it to be wireless. I have nice headphones for at home I just need something to block out the sounds of other people and that's cheap enough that if it gets stolen it won't break the bank but that doesn't suck so hard I can't use them. I used to be able to run to just about any store and get a decent pair of earbuds for like $30 but apparently those days are long gone :/. Like, I'm freaking out over here (not currently, this happened earlier), if I were able to ask for help, I would.

If it's someone I don't know them I can understand, most people aren't like me and those questions might be useful. But from people who say they know me, it's quite upsetting. It's frustrating because I can't respond, it's frustrating because they should know I can't respond, and it's depressing because they don't know. Which just makes it that much harder to respond. I know there are as many kinds of autism as there are autistic people, but just google "how to help an autistic person having a meltdown" I'm sure *something* useful will come up. Ugh. Sorry. It's just so frustrating.Every time in my life that I'm happy, every. Single. Time. Something happens to destroy it.

Most recently I decided that I was going to buy myself some pokemon cards with some of the money I inherited from my grandma since I used to play pokemon there with my cousins growing up and it was my favorite part of being there. Literally 1 day after they arrive they're sitting on my desk and for the first time ever my gf's dog decides she wants my tea. I've had this tea dozens of times around this dog, the dog has never shown even the slightest interest at all. I get back from the bathroom and not only are the cards all soaked in tea and destroyed, my brand fucking new laptop that I was only able to pay for because of student aid is also sitting in a puddle of tea. I picked it up and tea just poured out of it so that's fucking dead. I wasted my inheritance and I can't even go back to school. Shit this bad happens to me like every few days. If anything makes me even stop hurting even 0.01% then it gets destroyed in a way that makes it hurt even worse than if nothing had happened. 

I've lost track of the number of times I've tried to hang myself over the last 20 years and every time something happens. Either the rope breaks, the thing I tied the rope to breaks, or my feet end up hitting the floor (I'm tall). I can't bring myself to jump off a building or in front of a vehicle because I'm already gross enough, nobody should have to clean up my body as it is, let alone if it's in bits and pieces after an accident. Plus there's no guarantee it would work, it would probably just permanently disable me and make things even worse.

I've never had friends really. There were 3 people in my life who I felt like I was truly friends with. The first one died of a brain aneurysm when she was 19 (literally no history of it in her entire family going back as far as they had records, which is only up tonher grandparents, but still). The other one went on disability from work around the same time I did and despite reaching out a couple times a month for over a year, she's stopped responding. The only other person is my mom.

I mentioned my gf. Shortly after we started dating my work have me an ultimatum, quit or go on disability. I had started having seizures which came with memory loss. I was forgetting how to do almost all of my job and the parts I remembered I was doing wrong. Couple that with the emotionally instability that comes from not knowing where you are or what's going on most of the time and I almost don't blame them. Of course I later found out that it was the stress they were putting on me that was the most likely cause of the seizures. But either way, the end result is that I'm making 40% of an already unlivably low wage. So out of necessity I moved in with my gf and it was pretty shortly after that we started fighting. A lot. Like every day for a while. Especially after I got bottom surgery and couldn't even help out with the house.

Oh yeah, I'm also trans, which is the reason my only family I have to talk to is my mom. My dad, sister, and extended family have problems with it. Also, bottom surgery was a fucking nightmare and will have lifelong complications. Which I was assured is an incredibly rare outcome. Unlucky me I guess.

I have no friends, I have no family, I have no job, I'm unhappy in my relationship and I can't find a way out. I've tried killing myself and it doesn't work, I've tried finding things to make me happy but they end up hurting me more in the end. I can't even eat my feelings because since turning 30 I've had a harder and harder time with dairy. Chocolate milk is my absolute favorite thing in the entire world and I can't have it anymore because my body failed me. Yesterday I had what was supposed to be a safe dish but the restaurant used margarine. Did you know even fake butter has dairy? I didn't. Imagine not being able to just have a piece of cheese as a snack, or not being able to eat ice cream when you're sad. Not being able to have the best drink on the planet.

All that's left for me is suffering and pain but I can't do anything about it. I can't kill myself, I can't make myself happy, I can't eat my feelings, and I can't even afford a vice to distract me. I just have to sit here, alone, and suffer. It's unbearable but I can't do anything about it.The older I get the more annoyed I am with stuff changing. I don't mean day to day stuff, obviously things are going to change in that regard. I mean stuff like what happened today. 

You know the thing you use to take pizzas in and out of the oven? Made of wood and called a pizza paddle? Apparently they changed that at some point. Now they're made of metal and called a pizza peel. Why change that? What is even the point?

There's a lot of stuff like that, of course now I can't think of an example now that I need one but it's come up often enough that now I'm just mad about it. I'm so sick of people pointlessly changing stuff.Is it possible to disable the noise of the Geiger counter? My armor stops me from taking any damage so it's just an irritating clicking. Though I find it annoying I don't want to disable the damage, just the sound. Is that possible?. I'm not sure where to start. I have trouble with food. I just can't eat until I'm dizzy or I feel like I'm eating too much and getting fatter. Lately everything I do manage to eat upsets my stomach. It's been well over a day now since I've eaten this time because it took forever to get past the feeling fat stage and then when I was hungry enough to eat I still had to pick something that sounded good and wouldn't upset my stomach.

I decided on a pita. I ordered it from my usual place but as I was checking out Uber Eats suddenly goes, "pick a different store, this one is too far away". Unordered from them like last week. Indidnt move, they didn't move, so wtf. So I find another store and they're several dollars more expensive on basically every option I normally pick. I guess their prices aren't set the same across all stores for some reason. The only special instruction I ever put in is "jalapenos on the grill please". Which is what I tell them when I go in person as well. It's never been a problem. Today, after spending $8 more on the exact same order, it shows up and it's completely wrong. For some reason they put the jalapenos in a little cup. They weren't even grilled. So now I just have a little side cup of jalapenos that aren't in my pita. I also get tzatziki sauce on my pitas which was completely left off. Also they didn't put the cheese or the extra cheese that I ordered on it. So despite the fact that several dollars worth of toppings were missing I'm mostly just upset that the entire fucking thing is basically inedible now because it's just chicken and pita and some green peppers.

So I immediately get on the app and get it all refunded and I decide 'okay well maybe just a smoothie then'. My stomach is still kind of upset and I'm still not in the mood for food and it was the only other thing that sounded like something I could actually put into my body that would stay there. 

Despite their hours showing them as clearly being open the one that I would normally order from said it was closed so I had to order from a different one. The one I end up ordering from is on the same street as the pita place that was suddenly too far away but it's actually further down the street and farther away from me. They prepare the smoothies, because I got two since I'm so hungry, and they get picked up right away and everything is going great... Until it gets here. 

I'm going to be mean because I'm very hungry and very done but what kind of absolute fucking moron goes to a place that has the name for the beverage in the name of the place, picks up two beverage containers that are clearly full of liquid and then delivers them lying down on someone's doorstep. They spilled everywhere I didn't even get a chance to try them. I don't know if people know this about Uber if they don't use it but Uber delivery drivers are required to take a picture of the delivery. You can even see in the picture he sent that the drinks are spilling while he's taking the picture.

So here I am, almost 3 hours later, still no food. There's basically just McDonald's left open everywhere else that I would normally order from has already closed for the night. Not that it matters anyway because the refunds take several days to process and I'm out of money. So I guess I'll just be having air for dinner.

The worst part about this is the only option to get this off of my chest is to hop onto a dying platform and scream into the void. I know there's basically no chance that anyone's going to see this but I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't have any friends. I so desperately just want one friend. I won't even be crazy, I don't want a friend group, I don't want someone who will follow me to hell and back, I just want one friend, just one person to talk to. Hell at this point I'd settle for an acquaintance. A pen pal. An, "Oh, I recognize that person" head nod from a stranger. If you look at my other posts you'll see I do have a girlfriend but it's not the same. We have very different schedules. I'm on disability in part because of my autism, and she works a typical 9-5 job. I tried keeping to her schedule but I can't do it. So when I'm in the mood to talk and hang out, she's asleep. When she's in the mood to talk and hang out I just try and sit there and get through it until she's done because I'm usually still waking up or just not ready yet to interact with people. Obviously there's good stuff or I wouldn't be with her but my point is she can't fill that role for me. I need a friend in addition to a girlfriend. So maybe I am asking for too much, idk. Not that it matters, nobody is going to read this so I'm not really asking anyone.Growing up I had dogs, they were always well behaved and easy to train. They acted out as puppies but it was easy enough to get them under control.

When I moved out I realized I wasn't really a dog person and I got cats. Then I met my girlfriend who has the worst behaved dog I've ever known. She was abused as a puppy so not only did she not get socialized properly, she has a ton of anxiety. Specifically seperation anxiety. 

My girlfriend's uncle died a few days ago and she's out of town at a funeral until tomorrow evening. She's been going up there every weekend for the last month ish. Normally her dog and I get along well and despite being a handful, she's not been too bad when my gf was gone.

I was napping today and she came and woke me up at 1, whining. I let her out and she chilled out on our deck for about 15 minutes then asked to come in. So I let her in, checked her food and water because they're by the door, and gave her a treat for behaving while she was outside. She follows me back upstairs to my office as usual. But she keeps whining. So I curl up with her for a bit and give her cuddles and she's trying to lick my face the whole time because she always does that. I'm not sure how long, like 5 or 6 songs later I get up to go back to what I was doing before I took a nap. She kept whining. I give her attention for like 5 or 10 minutes then try to get back to what I was doing. Over the next 3 hours I try letting her out twice more, I check her food and water, give her another treat and spend probably another 40 cumulative minutes giving her attention. It was just after 4, I had spent almost the entirety of my time awake trying to get her to stop whining and I just lost it. I screamed at her to stop whining and she sulked out of the room.

I just couldn't handle it. 3 hours of whining and knocking shit out of my hands, jumping on me, licking everything. I did everything I could but I just ran out of patience.

What was the right way to handle that? Obviously I was wrong.

Also, just any tips on getting her through her past trauma. I was able to help my one cat who had been abused and now she loves cuddling and belly rubs. But I just can't seem to make any progress with her. I'll think we've made progress then she'll go and steal my food off my desk when I'm in the bathroom or cower and run away if I turn around too quickly. Or I'll teach her a new command but then she'll just stop doing it like a week later. But the worst is when we have people over. She tries to jump on them and soak them in saliva and cries if you don't let her. We have to put her outside when we have guests because she's injured so many people. She knocked over my 4 year old niece who then hit her head on the door knob for our front door. My sister was crazy pissed. We can't afford obedience training either. The only reputable people are way outside what we can afford.

Thanks in advance for any advice, I just feel awful about this.I've posted about my girl Ivy a bunch so I won't get into all the details, but essentially she was neglected and physically abused for the first 8 years of her life. It took her about 2 years to really come out of her shell (I like to say to come out of her tortoiseshell since she's a tortie lol). 

The last 10 months we've been living in a new home, me and my two cats moved in with my gf and her dog, we bought a new place together and at first they took some getting used to each other but now my girl and my gf's dog are buddies and my other cat is still kinda grumpy about it a lot of the time lol but he's good. 

Since Ivy and our dog get along so well we decided to take Ivy out into the yard with Oakley for a bit. So we got her a harness and a leash and we take her out for a while from time to time. We try and do it as much as possible depending on weather and other commitments. She loves lying in the grass and munching on it while trying to catch bugs and chattering at birds. But in her mind we don't take her out nearly enough and she often stands at the back door crying and scratching at it if we're in the room. 

My gf is out of town visiting family and I'm here with all three of them. It's a lot to handle on my own so I wasn't planning on taking Ivy out, and then it rained all day anyway. But twice today she snuck out through the door while I was letting our dog in. I always check for her and I haven't figured out where she was hiding but she'll just dash past me out the door. If it wasn't such a serious situation it would almost be kind of cute to watch her run. Today isn't the first day she's done this, but it's the first time she's done it twice in one day, which in my mind means it's getting worse. I try to tell her no but if I'm at all stern or loud with her she hisses and runs and hides like she did when I first got her, like she's flashing back to that trauma. Having cptsd myself (part of why I took her in) I know what that's like and I don't want to do that to her. Also, it hurts if she gets you when she swipes. But I need to curb this behaviour, her running outside without her harness on is dangerous. I'm not sure how to proceed here and I'm looking for suggestions

Edit: formatting. There are multiple mods that add alien artifacts to the game (or add them back to the game as some of them say). Also, the official Factorio account that posts on this sub about updates has an alien artifact in their flair. I was never around for the alien artifact phase of Factorio so I'm a little confused. What were they originally used for and why is there a person on them? Looks like someone waving maybe? But definitely a face and torso at least. I don't know all the details but all my favorite subs are starting to go dark. I know enough of the details to get a rough idea as to what's going on and I'm not really interested in clarifying what's exactly happening. I'm just freaking out because for me Reddit is the closest thing I have to a friend. I have my girlfriend but obviously that's not enough, I have no one to talk to about how I'm feeling when we get into a fight for example. There's also stuff she's just not interested in so I don't talk about it because seeing her completely check out when I start talking hurts so fucking much. But anyway. Reddit is where I share the things I'm proud of, the things that make me happy, it's where I go to comisserate with others when something happens, it's where I go for advice and opinions that cannot be found anywhere else. Reddit is my friend, and my friend is dying and I don't know how to cope.This is something I've wondered about just for forest fires but I'm playing with a mod that adds fire spitters and because of some other changes they now set my walls on fire constantly. I have artillery set up so I can take anything out in a couple seconds. But then the fire does a ton of damage. Just wondering if there's a mod that could help with fire fighting. The best option I've found so far is Water Turrets but the mod portal says it hasn't been updated in 2 years so I'm not sure if it'll still work. One month ago today I took my boy Loki in for 7 dental extractions. It was only supposed to be 5 but after they scanned him it was worse than they thought. His recovery hasn't been great and a few days ago he started throwing up pretty much every time he eats anything and he had very watery poops. I haven't been able to bring him back into the vet because I'm out of money. The extractions cost pretty much everything I had and everything else has gone to the follow up visits and his meds. It's over a week until I get paid again and there's nothing in my area that can help, I've posted on other social media looking for anything and had no leads.

I hate feeling this way but I'm out of options. I don't know what to do for him anymore. He's not getting better and I can't afford to take him back to the doctor and all I keep thinking is, "he was fine before we ever brought him in" which is nonsense, he needed 7 teeth removed I just didn't know it. So, I know I did the right thing but he's been sick for a while and trying to watch him figure out how to eat again breaks my heart. I just don't know how to help him or how to stop feeling guilty.

Edit: He's been keeping down food and eating more since I posted this. It's like he needed me to complain about him before he'd get better. Smh.•Signalment (species, age, sex/neuter status, breed, body weight)   
Species: Cat   
Age: 10   
Sex: Male   
Neutered: Yes   
Breed: Russian Blue mix   
Body weight: I'm not sure the number but I remember the vet showing me where his weight fell on a scale from underweight to overweight and he was basically dead center, a little lighter but basically exactly where he should be     
     
• Short history     
10 days ago he had 7 teeth extracted. As per the vet's instructions I had him on a course of pain meds that ended 4 days ago. He has always been an extremely social cat, but yesterday afternoon he started hiding and every time I go to touch him he recoils, even if I don't make contact. Unless he's sitting or lying down, then he's fine with it and will even start purring and roll onto his back for belly rubs. But if he's standing, he pulls away if you touch anything other than his head. This is very odd for him because he loves to roll around on the floor while you rub him all over. Has has peed, pooped, eaten, and drank as normal since this started. Except he's asking for treats less, though with him hiding all day that kinda makes sense. He is an indoor only cat but we have a dog who gets taken for walks and another cat who likes to go outside so we put her on a harness and leash and take her in the yard. I bring that up because my vet warned me about Lyme disease last time I was there which she said looked like fatigue and pain which is basically what he's dealing with.     
      
• Clinical signs (vomiting, coughing, fever etc)      
Fatigue and recoiling at touch but only while standing (he's particularly sensitive closer to his hips and tail)      
       
• Length of time you have seen these changes      
About 30 hours     
      
• Links to any vet reports, test results, X-rays etc.
that you already have        
I don't have links to any of his health information or vet records. I honestly did not know that was a thing before reading the FAQ for this sub         
        
• Your general location      
Canada. That's as specific as I'm comfortable being.      
     
Additional:     
All the pets coexist peacefully 99% of the time. Some days he is in a bad mood and will swipe at our dog, other days he scent marks her face. The cats have never been close but they're not hostile to each other.     
He has a vet appointment on Monday evening, a little less than 48 hours from now. It's the same vet that did the tooth extractions so it makes the most sense to me to bring him back there even if it means waiting a day. What I want to know is what I should brace myself for and what I can do to help keep him comfy until his appointment. Thank you in advance for any advice.       
       
Edit: Okay, I haven't actually posted this yet so this isn't an edit but idk how else to include this information in this format. While I was writing this he came out of hiding and curled up in his cat cave next to my desk. I was also able to pet him a little bit before he started to recoil again. Still planning on taking him to the vet and still looking for info, but I thought this might be relevant because I'm really hoping this is a sign he's on the mend.

Edit 2: formatting. I woke up to an email today saying that twitch saw my username on another website and so they killed my password. I use the same username everywhere and have done for ages, I don't know why twitch suddenly doesn't like that. As annoying as nonsensical as this is, I would just change my password and carry on....except I can't. I've been at this for like an hour trying every potential password that comes to mind and even using a password generator but twitch won't take anything. Like, the submit button to change the password doesn't even get enabled if twitch thinks your password is weak. I can't log in, I can't change the password, I've been logged out everywhere. I have lost all access to my twitch account and all I did was go to sleep. Does anyone have any advice? Is there any way I can get them to roll my account back to before they randomly revoked my password?

Edit: I have solved my issue. Thank you to everyone who commented 😊. I apologize if this isn't the right sub for this. But it seemed like a good place to start to ask this question.

Basically, I know nothing about music. I know the names of some instruments and that's literally it. The stuff with the lines and dots that's supposed to represent music is like way beyond my skill level, I don't even know what it's called (like these emojis but with lines behind them 🎵🎶). Growing up my schools had pathetic music classes. We didn't have enough instruments for everyone so half the time you'd end up just sitting and talking the whole period and in elementary school it was just the recorder and they just told us how to hold our hands. Like, I don't know what rhythm is really or melody or if they're different. I have literally zero knowledge of music.

But my girlfriend is really in to music and when she talks about it my eyes just gloss over because I have no clue what she's even saying. Her birthday is in a few months and I want to surprise her by playing a song on my keyboard. I know it's weird but I have an acoustic guitar and a piano keyboard from previous attempts to learn music. But I was stubborn then and determined to figure it out on my own. But that hasn't been working lol. 

My question is, how do I go from literally square 0 to being able to play a short song on a keyboard. I want to do it by September but I have no idea if that's a realistic goal, so it's definitely not a hard line, also I enjoy music and I would like if I could make this a hobby. Any advice, direction, or information is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance 😊. I'm not gonna go into details, but essentially until September 2024 I'm basically on standby. Basic needs are covered and I'll be able to survive that long. Problem is I need something to do. I've identified 4 things I would like to do in that time and I've come up with plans on how I can manage any individual task or any combination of the 4 tasks. 64 different schedules. I know exactly how long I want each project to progress as well as a variety of realistic and stretch goal for each project. I have all the materials I need to start them as well.........but I can't. Every day I get up and think, "ehh, I'll don't later" and then it's 5 am and time to go to bed because I stayed up all night again. Time just pours away, days feel like minutes, and I'm not making any progress. This month I decided that maybe writing down my goal to look at every day would help, but it hasn't. I just am looking for any advice on how to get started. These are all projects I genuinely want to do and have wanted to do for some time and I have the time to do them but I can't.My gf and I took my cat Loki to the vet last weekend and found out he has some kind of gum disease. I didn't understand everything they told me and all I could focus on was that my boy is hurting and needs surgery. We have some credit and some savings so the cost is covered if painful.

They said at least 2, but possibly up to 5, of his premolars will need to be removed and they won't know until they get in there. The thing is, he loves crunchy treats more than basically anything else on earth. He also picks at the dry food from time to time. How is he going to be able to have them if 5 out of 6 of his top premolars are gone. My girlfriend insists we need to get this taken care of immediately and I know the longer we leave it the higher the likelihood of infection or further complications. But I'm so worried. Anesthetic can be fatal on its own, his quality of life will plummet if he can't have his treats, how will he even be able to eat anything at all? I can't afford to go to the dentist myself and I just take pain killers for my teeth and that's what he's on now. Idk. I'm just scared.I just got the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset for my birthday. I really like them but the ear cushions are too small. My ears touch the plastic part at the back and are cramped because the ear cushions are quite small. I've read through some posts about other steel series headsets and it seems to be a running issue with their headsets. Suggestions at the time we're Brainwavz and wicked cushions. But the posts all seemed a bit old and none were specific to this headset. So I'm wondering if those are still good places to look and if so, which ones specifically, or if there are other places I should be looking. Thank you in advance for any help. In my late teens and early 20's I played DDR basically every day. I had bought a dance mat with some foam inserts and I used it until the wires frayed. I had to sell a lot of my stuff just to get by though and I don't have any of that stuff anymore. I'm finally in a position where I can get back into it, but I still don't have a ton of money. LTek is definitely out of my price range, especially as I'm just getting back into it. So the guides suggest a soft pad but don't say where to buy from or which one to get. I am planning on playing Project OutFox (which I understand used to be called StepMania) and I would like something like what I had with the thicker foam. Any advice is appreciated, thank you in advance.Back at the end of November I had vaginoplasty. There have been a lot of complications. My life is not in danger and the long terms effects are mostly aesthetic. Next month I'm cleared to start having sex again.

Obviously I'm self conscious about how things look down there, there's some scarring that looks really rough. I also don't have a ton of sensation back yet. But my partner (for context she is also trans but is not sure yet if she wants vaginoplasty or not) really wants to have sex. I'm terrified. What if she thinks it looks gross like I do? What if it hurts? What if she can't get it in? (One of the complications is that the "entrances" of the vaginal cavity and labia majora don't line up quite right. You really gotta pull the labia down and kinda stretch it almost uncomfortably to get access to the vaginal cavity). But also, what if it doesn't feel good for one or both of us? I want her to have a good time, but I'd like to not walk away from the experience in pain and feeling traumatized. 

If I ask her to wait she will, no hesitation, no questions asked. That's not the issue. It's more my own stuff that would come up whenever this finally happened. I want it to be clear that she is in no way pressuring me to do this before I'm ready. I'm just trying to get to the point where I'm ready because, well, sex can be fun.

I felt like none of this when I lost my virginity the first time. But this time around I'm feeling very nervous. I guess I'm just looking for advice/reassurance.When I first discovered my autism, I noticed that my sensory issues became a lot worse. 

But then I realized they actually didn’t. I just became more aware of them. 

For the first time in my life, I started actually listening to my body’s signals. 

The way I see it: My diagnosis made me realize how I was going through life every day just constantly suffering. Putting myself into situations that my body was fighting against. 

Like going to loud crowded parties that smelled like dirty cat litter but just trying to toughen up and force my way through it. 

That’s how I’ve lived for my entire life. Gritting my teeth and pushing through it. I’ve done that for everything for as long as I can remember. I’ve done so much to try to adapt to the NT way of life but it’s absolutely killing me. It’s causing me chronic burnout. 

I was so used to having sensory issues that I wasn’t even aware they were there. I didn’t know that it wasn’t normal to feel this way until I got diagnosed. Mostly because I’ve been gaslighted my entire life into believing I’m “fine”. 

For example:

Little me: it’s too loud!

Mom: I can barely hear it! It’s fine, don’t worry about it. 

Hearing statements like that from basically everyone in my life made me gaslight myself into believing I’m not experiencing these sensory issues. 

I still felt like shit, but I didn’t know why. The bright lights didn’t seem to bother anyone else. The texture of the microfiber cloth didn’t make anyone else cringe. 

I must be faking it or something. Or overthinking it. 

This is the only way I’ve ever lived. I didn’t know that it wasn’t normal to be that way. It was just a natural part of being alive for me. 

I don’t want to live like that anymore. So I’m going to listen to what my body is telling me instead of forcing myself into situations that are overstimulating. 

I know that I’m limited in life because of my sensory issues. I know that I only have a limited amount of energy. 

So I’m going to conserve as much as I can by spending it on only the things I have to do and things that bring me joy.It’s a good thing in a way but also really sucks.

If I’m going to be basically outcasted by society from birth, I might as well embrace it and be weird as hell. 

I’m just gonna be my authentic self. Whoever likes me will stay. 

And whoever doesn’t, wont matter.TW ableism, violence 

“You’re autistic? You don’t look like my 8 year old autistic child” 

Ok so first off, you call yourself an “autism mom” yet you clearly haven’t done any research on autism. 

If you did, the first thing you would learn is that autism is a fucking spectrum.

It’s literally in the name. Autism SPECTRUM condition. 

Yes, I’m very different from your fucking 8 year old. All autistic people are different. Because once again, it’s a 

S P E C T R U M 

It’s 2023. There’s so much free information out there. If you have an autistic child and you haven’t done even basic research about their condition, that’s child neglect. 

Do you really care for your kid if you can’t be bothered to learn about their differences and their needs?

How are you going to give them a good quality of life if you don’t learn how to accommodate them?

Then you get mad that your child has meltdowns all the time and you act like a victim. Oh, poor you. Having to deal with the consequences of neglecting your own child. /s

Your child is having meltdowns because they are SUFFERING every day. All because you can’t be bothered to educate yourself or even your child about their own condition. 

Have you taught them about sensory processing disorder? Because I wasn’t diagnosed until adulthood and I had no idea I had it. 

I didn’t realize I was miserable all the time because 5 people were talking at once, the sun was in my eyes, there’s a beeping sound in the other room that I can’t tune out and I can feel my feet in my shoes too much. 

If I knew that as a child, I’d be able to help myself. I’d be able to identify when I was having those issues and take steps to prevent them. It would’ve helped me prevent so many sensory overloads and meltdowns.

Instead, I just sat there feeling miserable until I couldn’t take it anymore and had a meltdown. 

Knowledge is a fucking tool. Please educate your kid about their own condition. It affects them way more then it affects you. It’s like providing a wheel chair to a child with no legs. 

That information can profoundly affect our ability to navigate life and take care of our selves. 

I don’t expect you to have a phd in autism. But you can’t watch some autism TikTok’s in your free time? A YouTube video? Social media posts? All of this shit is readily available and free. 

Also, listen to actual autistic adults. We have the lived experience of knowing what it’s like to be autistic. 

The neurotypical autism moms you follow on instagram will never have that. They will never truly know what it’s like to be autistic so they shouldn’t be the ones to speak for us. 

Give your child headphones, give them time alone, give them extra time to switch between activities, let them stim, let them spend time on their special interests, let them ask too many questions sometimes. 

Just let them be a kid like every other kid instead of trying to beat the autism out of them or force them to be neurotypical. 

Stop being ashamed of your own child. They know it and it makes them feel like absolute shit. They just want you to love them for who they are. 

Stimming is a beautiful thing and it’s a natural and important part of being autistic. It’s not embarrassing. If people stare, who cares? If they make a negative comment, fuck them. Defend your disabled child. 

Start treating your kid better and you’ll be surprised when the meltdowns start happening less and less. You’ll be surprised when your child seems happier and life gets easier for them. 

But oh right, then you might not be able to use them for sympathy as much. 

You’re not a victim, Susan. Yes, dealing with meltdowns is hard. I know it stresses you out. I know it makes you “think about driving off a bridge with your child in the car.” 😃

But you’re causing your own misery by neglecting your child. And then you get mad at them when they have a breakdown over being neglected and not having their needs met?? 

Seriously, fuck you. 

I cant stand when they play the victim. 

I can’t stand when they’re obviously ashamed of their child’s autistic traits and force them to suppress them. I am not embarrassing. I am not shameful for existing as my natural self. 

YOU are embarrassing and shameful for making your child hide their traits in public instead of standing up for them. 

Imagine hating your child so much that you want to hide almost everything about them. Everything that makes them your child, a unique and beautiful individual. 

Given the right conditions, your child could thrive and have a wonderful life. They can go on to do amazing things. Even change the world  

But they probably won’t because you treat them like their very existence is something shameful to be hidden away and not talked about. You instill low self esteem into them. You make them feel like they are broken and less than everyone else. 

Do you realize you’re stunting your own child? 

Is the world going to explode if you allow your autistic kid to flap their hands?? Is it Susan?? 

Oh it’s “weird?” I think your parenting is weird. 

More than weird, it’s straight up abuse. Educate yourself. Rant over. 

To anyone who had a parent like this, I’m genuinely so sorry. You deserved so much better.See, I can do it too! 

I can use your personal identity as a derogatory term meant to insult others and perpetuate the stigma. 

Examples:

“Ugh you’re so neurotypical 🙄😐”

“The typicals are so boring. Get a special interest already.” 

“Stop being such a normie. Break a social rule for once” 

“That’s so neurotypical (bad/stupid) of you”

“Stop staring at my eyes! NTs are so creepy with their weird eye contact thing.” 

“Maybe don’t act too NT out in public. We wouldn’t want people to stare.”

“Omg this game is so neurotypical (aka stupid/dumb)”

“Why don’t you ever flap your hands? Everyone else does it. Stop being weird” 

“I hope you find a cure for your neurotypicalism. I’ll pray for you.” 

“Why can’t you just say what you mean instead of talking around things and being indirect? God you’re so NT (dumb/annoying)!”. So I work at a coffee shop and I get a lot of business people in suits and ties. 

I have nothing against them but I’m painfully aware of how fake their personalities are and it annoys me.

Something they always do is come in together and “playfully argue” about who’s going to pay. 

Today there was 2 men literally fighting to shove their card in the machine first.

I don’t know why but this irks me so much. Especially since they always look at me and expect me to laugh and play along. So I have to fake the best response I can lol.Hey everyone! I’m a 25 year old autistic adhder and today I took shrooms for the first time. It was 2.5g of chocolate. Here’s my experience. 

I’ve been a heavy cannabis user for about 3 years now. 

My other audhd friend was trip sitting. I felt very safe and calm with her the entire time.

I went to her house and we also went for a walk to get food and go to a park. 

When it started kicking in, I immediately got this feeling of peace. It felt like cannabis at first. Then, I started hallucinating a bit. 

We were walking down the street and I said “I can’t believe this is the same world as it was when I was on the way over here. It feels so different but also the same.”

We were walking to the park, crossing an intersection, and I realized I forgot my headphones at her place. I normally wear them every day since I’m sensitive to sounds so I started panicking a bit. (If I’m exposed to loud noises for too long it can cause sensory overload.)

But then I realized there was no pain. Usually the sounds of cars would be really loud, painful and overwhelming. But this time, it felt extremely muted. It was so nice. 

That realization had me almost start crying from joy right there. 

My friend and I joked that I was “temporarily neurotypical”. 

My friend’s boyfriend, allistic adhder, was also on shrooms and he said he felt like he was “temporarily autistic” because of the heightened senses he was experiencing lol. 

When we got to the park, we sat in a quiet secluded area under some trees. She played calming music and kept talking to me about shrooms and spirituality the entire time while I just listened. 

She also told me I’ll start to notice that the trees have faces. This creeped me out and made me scared to look at them lol. But I eventually did and started to notice them. 

We then went to eat and watched a show together on her phone. But I found it very hard to pay attention because the table seemed like it was flowing like a river. And her phone seemed to be gently bobbing up and down. 

Overall the experience went really well. I only felt a bit of anxiety. I also briefly cried about my ex but uhh let’s not talk about that lmao. 

I definitely want to do it again, but I feel like I need a while to process all of that. I need to let everything sink in. I feel like I saw the world in a completely different way.My whole life I’ve been very put off by the “coming out” ceremonies that people tend to do. 

Why should I have to stand in front of people and announce I’m gay and hope they still decide to love me? 

Fuck that. I’m not begging anyone to accept me or not be a bigot towards me. 

I technically “came out” a few weeks ago to my entire family when I started sharing gay shit on social media. So far no one’s said anything but my mom has liked some of the posts. So far so good lol.Let’s get the dopamine flowing 🥳 

Here are my suggestions: 

I can’t handle change - ROAR

Origami - the rare occasions 

Lucky (I’m so lucky lucky) - lucky twice 

Ghostride - crumb 

The less I know the better - tame impala 

Spit in my face - thxsomuch

Always forever - cults 

Disco - surf curse 

Tek it (sped up) - cafune

Stargazing - the neighbourhood 

Space song - beach house 

Baby hotline - jack stauber 

Cloud 9 - beach bunny

Edit: I regret posting this. Now I have way too many songs to listen to 😭😂. They’re SO FUCKING CUTE WITH THEIR LITTLE FACES AHHHHHHSJFJFKDLGLFFKF. I’m really curious. I want to know what it’s like to be in their body for a while. 

I want to know what it’s like being able to pick up on social ques and facial expressions. 

And to walk around experiencing the world in the way most people do.As a kid I always imagined myself saving the world. Dedicating my life to helping others. 

But now, I can barely take care of my own basic needs. 

Can I get a new character please? I just want to live a different life.I’ve had vivid dreams almost every night ever since I was a child. I don’t remember them that often, but when I do they’re always so detailed and emotional. 

They feel so realistic. I genuinely feel like I just woke up from living another life in an alternate universe. Like I just suddenly got sucked out of that universe and dropped into this one. 

It’s so jarring to wake up in the morning and realize all of that wasn’t real, and then to feel those memories quickly fading out of my brain while I try desperately to cling on to them. 

I also have this other weird thing that happens to me. 

Sometimes during the day I’ll see something that reminds me of a scene from one of my dreams. 

Then suddenly I get hit with a flashback from the dream. For a few seconds, I remember the dream again in detail. All those memories come rushing back to me. 

Then I get this somber feeling. Like I deeply miss that world and I want to go back. It’s this deep sense of longing for a different life. A life that I don’t even fully remember. It just feels familiar, like home. 

But then the feeling goes away and I start to forget the dream again. 

Is there a name for this?

Also, I often get repetitive dreams. There’s one I’ve been having a lot where I’m with my ex and we’re happy and had a great life together. 

Sometimes I wake up from that dream and start crying. Because it felt so real. It feels like I saw what our life could’ve turned out to be if we hadn’t broken up.I want a cure for restrictive avoidant food intake disorder 

I want a cure for audio processing disorder

I want a cure for my insomnia/sleep problems

I want a cure for my body not telling me I’m thirsty until I’m dehydrated 

Mostly I want a cure for this ableist society that makes being alive as a neurodivergent person inherently traumatic

Imagine if the funding going towards finding a “cure” for autism was instead spent on giving us a better quality of life instead of trying to eradicate us from existence. 

My autistic brain and unique way of thinking is fine, thanks. But I would like to walk outside without being assaulted by the bright lights and loud noises.I’ve been tearing up throughout the day because I keep thinking of this. I love humans sometimes. 

So I picked up some money orders to pay my rent. I decided not to put them in my bag because I didn’t want them to get wrinkled. 

I walked out and was heading to the bus stop when I suddenly realized one of the papers wasn’t there. 

I felt panic rising and I started hyperventilating. A huge meltdown was coming. I ran back and started frantically looking for it on the ground, on the verge of tears. 

When suddenly this man got my attention. He said “excuse me is this yours?”

I said “oh my god, thank you! I was looking for that!”

He laughed and said “yeah you don’t want to lose that one!”

I felt such a huge sense of relief. Meltdown averted. 

He told me he had been walking around asking people if it was theirs. 

He could have just saw the paper on the ground and walked past it. But he went out of his way to walk around asking people. 

Good people exist! I’m so, so thankful.I was at my friends house once in her bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw the bags under my eyes from staying up all night the day before. 

I said “damn I look so tired!” 

She said “yeah haha I noticed. I just didn’t want to say anything”

I don’t get it. Why is looking tired a bad thing? Everyone gets tired. It’s a natural part of life. 

I told her “I don’t see that as a bad thing. I just see it as a fact.”

Also, if I tell a NT they look tired, it’s like a conversation starter for me. I expect them to respond with something like “yeah I didn’t get much sleep last night, I was gaming until 3am” 

But they instead get offended? 

Can someone explain lmao I’m too autistic for this shit.I’ve been wanting to start an Etsy shop selling neurodivergent designs. Stickers, cups, shirts, etc. 

I already have a name and some stuff planned out. But I’ve been delaying opening the shop for nearly a year. Mainly because I’m worried I won’t be able to keep up with it. I’m audhd and really struggle with executive dysfunction. 

I thought it would be a perfect job for me since I can be my own boss and don’t have to work with people. 

Does anyone else have a small business and any tips on how you keep it running with autism? Thanks!. I’d like some advice if you can. I’m openly autistic at work. This happened a few days ago and it’s over now but I’m still thinking about it. 

So I was working on the register at a coffee shop and this homeless lady walks in. 

My job is right next to a homeless camp so I was used to them being regularly thrown out and the cops being called on them. It happens almost daily. 

The homeless lady comes up to the register and orders a drink. She has the money so I took her order. 

Right after, my shift manager told me to switch to being on warming. So I left the register and went to heat up food for customers. 

A few minutes later, the SM comes up to me and asks “did you take her order?” 

I looked at the customer, trying to remember what she ordered. And said “oh yeah she got a pumpkin spice late”

Suddenly my SM looked pissed. She starts ranting to me about how I was “very disrespectful”. I’m so confused and taken aback at this point. 

Then I realized what was happening. She had been trying to throw the homeless lady out of the store. She was arguing with her saying that she already paid for her drink, but my SM didn’t believe her and was threatening to call the cops. 

She also forgot what she ordered, and said it was frappe. So when my SM didn’t see an order for one, she just assumed she was lying and tried to kick her out. 

My SM was like “so you stood there the whole time watching this and didn’t say anything?” 

First off, I didn’t even know what was going on. Yes I was right there, but I was focusing on keeping up with the mountain of food orders coming through. I know NT brains can focus on multiple things at once but I need all my brain power to keep up with my tasks. 

Second, you throw out homeless people every day. I’m so used to it that I just tune everything out now. I tune most things out that my coworkers talk about because it’s mostly boring small talk. 

She could have just asked me to begin with, but she didn’t. She saw a homeless person in the store, made assumptions, and immediately tried to kick her out. 

So she made the drink for the customer and gave a very soft, whispered apology to her. But I heard her blame me and it pissed me off. 

“My coworker didn’t tell me she took your order, I’m so sorry” 

Am I in the wrong here?. How the actual FUCK am I supposed to live? 

I’m currently living in hell (aka the United States) where no one gives a fuck about disabled people. I’m living in poverty and on food stamps and can’t afford to save up for a car. Or ANYTHING. Literally all my paycheck goes to rent. 

If I didn’t have my mom to fall back on, I’d just be another disabled person living on the streets and turning to drugs to cope with my terrible life. I already can’t get though the day without weed. 

If I’m not useful to capitalism, I don’t deserve to live. I don’t deserve a home or food. That’s how this country treats us. I wish I had the money to leave. Poverty literally keeps us trapped in this cruel system. 

I’m 25 and I genuinely don’t remember the last time I wasn’t stressed. I can’t sleep at night because of the paralyzing fear of not being able to make rent or pay for my cats medical bills if he gets sick. It makes me want to scream and rip my hair out. 

I tried living on my own for a year now. But I’m having to move back in with my mom because I can’t handle the stress. I’ve been borrowing money from her that she doesn’t have just to make ends meet. 

I don’t have the spoons to go to work, do dishes, cook dinner, do laundry, take care of my basic needs etc. 

It never ends. I never get a break. I have to do this shut every day over and over until I die. 

I can’t even go to clubs on the weekend like NTS to release the stress from work because of my fucking sensory issues. And people there wouldn’t even like me anyway because I’m weird and socially awkward. 

I’ve been working nearly full time at a coffee shop for a year now and there’s literally nothing to show for it. All my money goes towards rent. I’m on food stamps and I’ve been waiting for over a year to get approved for disability benefits. 

I’m burnt out so hard. Everything’s so stressful, no one understands me at work, I have to constantly explain myself, constantly fake a smile so I don’t seem rude. 

I feel like I’m trapped here forever.How the actual FUCK am I supposed to live?

I feel like I’m trapped here forever.So when I was around 16, I had just started my first job. I was working at this furniture store for less than a week so I was very anxious about doing a good job. I didn’t want to get fired right away. 

I was very insecure and a huge people pleaser at the time. I wanted everyone to like me and became devastated when someone didn’t. I was the type of person where someone’s negative comment would ruin my whole day and make me cry. 

Thankfully after years of therapy, I’m no longer like that. I now have a healthy self esteem and I can just brush those comments right off. 

At the time, I had long hair dyed a bright blue color. I loved it so much. Looking at my hair in the mirror gave me so much serotonin. To this day, at age 24, I’m still dying my hair different colors and experimenting with it. I’m not planning on stopping any time soon because it brings me so much happiness. 

One day when I was at the register, this elderly couple came in. They seemed like polar opposites. The man was very grumpy and gave me disapproving looks and the woman just radiated joy and love. I wondered how two people like that could even be in a relationship together. 

The woman started going on about how much she loved my hair and we had a really nice conversation. But as soon as they walked away from me, the old man started talking trash. I’m sure he thought I was out of earshot, but I heard everything he said. 

“She looks like she belongs in a zoo”. 

That comment is forever ingrained in my memory. It definitely would’ve ruined my day, but thankfully his wife started going off on him. 

“What’s wrong with you? Why would you say something like that??” They were still arguing while they walked back out to the car. 

Just listening to her defend me helped me so much. I was able to not let his negativity get to me. I had someone who was on my side. 

She didn’t even know I heard all of this, yet she still defended me in their private conversation. It reminds me that there are really good people in this world. 

It was also so satisfying to watch him get told off. Please remember, your words matter! A quick comment that you immediately forget about has the ability to impact someone for the rest of their life.I think this is sort of funny, because I went in for something so minimal and even felt bad going to the hospital. I had pain under my right boob that radiated to my back. I was 90% sure if was just a knot and I was being dramatic. 

Well, turns out my liver is swollen, had protein in my urine, and my blood pressure came back as 182/110. 

I JUST got tested Wednesday for preeclampsia and there was no protein in my urine, so I’m confused as to how I got this so fast. 

They were going to induce me today, at 34 weeks, but are going to try to wait the 2 and 1/2 weeks until I’m 37 weeks pregnant. They won’t let me go past that. 

Is this normal? I’ll do as they say, but I’m just shocked because I tested negative not even a day ago (when I got the results back).I’d make my yearly salary in 4 months and could spend the rest of the year with my baby. But I’d miss out on a lot if I was gone that long. 

It’s not a fun job either; it’s working fire season and highly dependent on the fires, so the salary is an estimate. My friend made my salary last year in 4 months, but she had to sleep in a tent the whole time and it was miserable. Her old boss is willing to hire me.

But if I did that, it would make it possible for me to finish school a lot faster.

Idk, what’s the better idea? I’ve never had a baby before and I’m told it’ll be near impossible leaving her behind.I’m sick of going to the hospital, which is probably the real reason I got upset (and took it out on him a little), but I’m in and out every week. From either hours at a time or straight up hospitalized for days. I feel like I’m mad about that, and it translated to how I felt towards my ex at that moment. 

I’m now being asked, on top of two regular check ups per week, to do weekly NST’s. I’m only 34 weeks pregnant, so this means I have quite a bit to go. I work full time and I’m in chronic pain (PGP). I’m also extremely limited on what accommodations I can ask for; I haven’t been at my job long enough for FMLA and they are being douchey about giving me any accommodations. Even though the job can easily be done with the minimal changes I want. 

Anyways, this pregnancy has been hell and since my ex and I are not together, I’ve been doing a lot of it alone. I dealt with HG the first trimester and lost 20 lbs (I was not overweight, so it was significant). 

Now I’m at the point where I’m just mentally tired and it’s affecting my mental health. I realize every NST is a chance for them to let me know that they have to induce me, since they have communicated that as a possibility. 

My ex really wants to be at the birth, which I said I’m ok with, but he got annoyed that I asked if he could go to the weekly NST’s. I figured it’s not a big deal, since he wants to be at the birth anyways. But he hesitated and sounded annoyed that I called him over that. It honestly made me angry and I told him I was upset, and that we should talk later instead. He didn’t say no and said he would go, but him being annoyed pissed me off. Like I don’t get a choice and have to miss work, be in pain, and feel sick. So how’s it fair?

I feel quite a bit in the wrong, because he is being really helpful. He’s given me money for my maternity leave, since I wasn’t able to afford to put as much away as I needed. He’s bought quite a bit of expensive baby gear I wanted, such as my travel system and pack and play, and he generally does try to help. He’s brought me lunch and other items to the hospital (like a phone charger or book). Without me asking.

So I do feel a bit unreasonable. But am I completely wrong for wanting him to be as involved as I am, or close to it? He did after all want equal medical decision making (judge can’t sign it until baby is here, but we have a settlement drawn up and signed at my lawyers office), but I feel like it’s a red flag if he can’t show up to appointments while I’m just pregnant, much less when the baby is here. I’ve heard the first year they are in and out of the hospital for minor stuff or fevers. So it also annoys me he asked for joint medical decision making but is already being a pain about going to doctor’s appointments.

Idk. I’ll take advice or perspectives. I’m not above thinking I’m wrong. I think I’m just tired from being in pain and feeling sick. And those goddamn hospital visits 🥲. So we talked about who we would let babysit our baby. I’m 8 and a half months pregnant, so it’s about time we had that convo. Both of our families are full of nuts, so it’s a short list. It’s me, him, his mom (grandma), and my dad. And daycare. That’s it. Not sure if it’s relevant, but the baby is a girl.

But he also said he would be ok with a male friend of his watching the baby. Now, I’m not going to lie and paint myself in a prettier light; I am 1/3 paranoid because he’s a dude (which I acknowledge is sexist; my culture is super sexist, and it’s just stuff I need to work through). I know I’m wrong for that, and I’m working through it in therapy. The other 2/3 is because I actually know the guy. I worked with him for a year, and he’s sort of a creep. He’s the type of guy that lies about having sex with girls he’s never so much as had a full conversation with (he did so with 4 different girls). He also regularly attempts suicide when girls break up with him. He’s a good friend to my ex, but his personal life is a MESS. I just don’t think these things are ok, and him being creepy sends off major red flags. 

When he said his friend was on his list, I made him promise me to call me above anyone else, if his mom and my dad couldn’t, and I’d literally leave my job over letting anyone else watch my baby. This isn’t bound to happen super often; we’re on completely opposite work schedules (I’m 6:30am-2pm, he’s 6pm-3am), but I will leave my job. I’ll lose it if I have to. I also asked him to please not let that friend watch the baby, as I got bad vibes. I told him I wasn’t accusing his friend of being a pedo, but I got creepy vibes due to the past stuff I’ve witnessed. He agreed and said he promised (I believe him; he isn’t a liar).

Am I wrong here?. I’m 8 and a half months pregnant. Baby is measuring 50th percentile. Is it just because she’s average sized?. Or should I wait? 

I don’t plan to have sex until I’m medically cleared, so probably 6 weeks after, but I want that iud in there and shielding me from future babies asap 😂💀

Jk, I’m excited for my baby, but worried I’d forget or something and end up pregnant again.Or am I doing this wrong? Lol

That shit hurt. I’m 8 and a half months pregnant, so maybe I’m just too pregnant for it. Idk 😭🌝. I’m 8 months pregnant and hospitalized, so I can’t exactly test any drink. 😭 However, my ex’s mom (father of the baby), asked me if I can help plan his baby shower. I’m good friends with him, so I don’t mind. I’m actually excited to plan this, albeit distantly, because hospitals suck and I’m bored lol. 

So he does have celiac disease, so everything must be gluten free. 

The baby shower is Star Wars themed. Even though the baby is a girl. 😂

Food & drink wise, I’m just doing chips, soda, beer (with a local GF option that my ex likes), and hopefully a shot &/or cocktail. Also, GF cupcakes. 

Any ideas any ideas for the shot and cocktail? Easy is better; it’s going to be laidback. 

All his friends are bartenders, so I’m trying not to screw up the drink options lol.I love all other ages, baby and kid wise, but 1-3 seems like a nightmare. Not all kids, but most seem extremely difficult at this age. 

They have their fun parts, but mostly are difficult. How do people survive this age without crying all the time?

I watch my friends toddler often, and love him, but omg. I have to entertain him 24/7 and chase him around the whole time. 😂 

I watch my 4 year old baby sister too, and she is high energy too, but it’s different. She’s fun and not just hard. Toddlers just seem hard. 

They seem to actively fight to hurt themselves. To be fair, my friends place is not super baby safe, so I have to work like ten times harder when I watch him. 

My place is baby proof and ready to go, so hopefully it’ll be easier. 😭😭😂

Sorry for the weird train of thought. Currently 33 weeks pregnant and hospitalized. Trying to relax and this is where my mind goes 😂. She’s a bar manager. How’s it possible? Is it bad for you? He works at the bar above the one she works at, and went to visit before opening time. She had her baby (very illegal in UT in a bar, but only workers were there) and was showing him to everyone, but was also working. 

Not judging. I used to bartend too and that industry has zero respect for humane practices towards workers. I imagine it’s a necessity. 

I’m pregnant with my first, so I have no idea how this stuff works. But I thought you couldn’t even drive? 

This question is just a whole lot of me minding someone else’s business, but I’m extremely curious about how it’s even a thing.I just had an awesome turkey dinner. I added salt and pepper and it was amazing tbh. 

What have you had during your stay(s)? Was it any good?. I’m 33 weeks pregnant and had a fall this morning. I didn’t go in until rn, because I felt normal, but I guess things aren’t. It was a minor fall, however, my heart rate is very high, blood pressure is too, and my oxygen is somewhat low. Baby is showing decreased fetal movement. Cramps also started.

My job asked me to leave and be there for work in the morning, but my doctor said I need to stay the weekend for monitoring. My bosses exact words were “you can’t stay there for days, we expect you here in the morning”. 

I need the income from my job. What should I do? I’m staying in the hospital, I mean more like how can I protect myself?

I’m in Utah.My cat is declawed, which I don’t support at all (she came that way when I adopted her), but she is a puncher. Never bites, but if people annoy her she will punch them. It doesn’t hurt; feels like a cotton ball hit.

I was talking to my ex about how it might happen and he was a bit upset about it. I value his opinion a lot, but I feel like rehoming my pet over this isn’t valid. Idk

I’m going to work *hard* to teach my baby to respect animals, but I can see a mistake happening, if say, I turn away for a bit and she gets the cats tail somehow.

I’ve trained her a lot, and she’s a lot friendlier than when I first got her, but we still have some work to do. 

I’m going to have a baby gate, which my cat can scale, so she has the option to get space, but I don’t think it’ll be an issue. My cat likes kids, but keeps her distance when she’s had enough. 

Is it bad that I’m not super concerned? I will take feedback. I’m a first time mom, so maybe I’m not thinking as clearly as I should :). I’m planning to move in 3 months. I have a whole fancy crib ($700 crib) and a Newton mattress ($300), but I don’t see the point in setting it up if I’m going to move. I got those two items used (crib for $200, mattress for $75) but they’re in great condition. Before anyone comes for me, the Newton mattresses are super washable. 

Is it a bad idea and/or uncomfortable for my soon-to-be new baby if I just set up the pack and play and have her live there for a few months? My pack n play has a changing table and detachable bassinet. 

It’s this one: 
https://www.amazon.com/Graco-Day2Dream-Bassinet-Features-Portable/dp/B08K39L9JZ. My living situation is not great right now. I have a lot of supportive and amazing loved ones, but none of them had room for me and I needed somewhere to stay. Im 8 months pregnant.

My mom offered rent free living accommodations, so I went with that. I was in a tough spot after breaking up with my ex (he cheated); mostly because I had to get a new used car, old ones transmission went out, and I had to break the lease to our old place… and get a lawyer. Long story, and lots of other expenses I’m leaving out, but the expenses piled up to be about $25,000. It’s insane.

I had a $15,000 savings that covered most of it, but I still got into some debt over the last bit. I’ve been working on it, and I’m in a *much* better spot now than I was two months ago. I’ve paid off two loans, with two more getting paid off soon. 

However, if I take maternity leave for 3 months, I won’t be able to move out until like March or April. It sets me behind financially quite a bit. Whereas if I only take one month off, I can move out in January or February. 

The main issues with my current living situation are that my mom is insane. I made the mistake of moving in, when I hadn’t talked to her for half a decade, because my siblings (the ones that speak to her) promised me she had changed and was much better. While she’s no longer as bad as she was, she is still toxic and a piece of work. She got arrested for a DUI, where she almost killed someone, two months ago; she’s awaiting court and on bail, but takes zero responsibility (it’s the bartenders fault for “over serving her”, according to her… She had two drinks at the bar, and then proceeded to drink 1/3 a bottle in her car). She constantly violates boundaries and loves to scream at people. She yelled at my yesterday because I won’t let her borrow my car. As far as my baby, she says she can do what she wants when the baby is here (like not follow my rules, etc). I spend 24 hours in the hospital this week to monitor the baby for decreased fetal movement, and she yelled at me when I got home because I didn’t invite her. She got so heated about the hospital thing that she threatened to lock me out and steal all the baby stuff I bought. 

There may be a sort of shitty way of getting more maternity leave; my ex is being kind and willing to cover my deposit for the apartment, so I can move out sooner, and pay me extra child support so I can have time off. My dad, who’s separated from crazy, is offering to give me $400/month while I don’t work also. I just feel awful about possibly accepting that help. I would for sure want to pay them back with my taxes (i put extra away, so I always get a return; my baby will also be born on time for me to claim her on the taxes), even though they might try to refuse. The issue I run into this option is that they are not helping me without consequences; the money for the deposit, that my ex is offering, is his savings for a car. He’s currently ubering to work because he totaled his. I can lend him my car while on maternity leave, and insist on paying him back the amount, but it’ll still make me feel shitty. He’s been super excited and relieved to get a car again. My dad would be on a stricter budget, and I’d still feel shitty about it.

If I don’t take the help, I will have to return back to work as soon as possible. 

Overall, my pregnancy has been stressful and awful due to my mom. I’m struggling mentally and physically, but idk what to do. It seems the wiser choice to just suck it up and return to work early.

I won’t be able to take more than 3-4 weeks of maternity leave if I move out. 

What should I do?. I hope she doesn’t see this, because she is a redditor, but here I go I guess. 

My friend has always had a fascination with morbid stuff. She’s been to therapy for it. She knows I don’t care to hear stories like that, and has mostly respected that. 

However, she has recently been on a binge of telling me horrible baby deaths or injuries. She told me a story about a Redditor mom who’s bf shook their baby, the extent of the baby’s injuries, and just seem fascinated. I guess it’s some post on here somewhere.

Tbh, I was so upset and frustrated, I felt like slapping her. I’m not a violent person at all, and wouldn’t have done it, but it was quite the emotional rollercoaster. This in the same week I was in the hospital to monitor my baby for decreased fetal movement. It just felt like a physically want to repel her away from me. 

I have already talked to her about how I don’t want to hear horrible things about babies, due to being pregnant. And I even told her I wouldn’t want to hear it otherwise. So I am frustrated and angry, but also trying to be understanding that I’m neurotypical and she may not understand how important this is to me. 

She’s a great friend otherwise. She got me a lot of baby stuff, brings me meds/food whenever I’m sick, and is overall fun. 

But idk what else to do about this issue, since I already talked to her about it.And I’m only 8 months pregnant. Help.Be honest lol. 

My dad gave me the money as a gift, but I’m getting this one:

I have the $400 from him, just wondering if I should wait for it to be on sale and save the rest. Or is it a bad idea to cut it that close? Lol

I don’t even know if it would go on sale tbh.

Edit: I ordered it off of Albee baby and got $100 off! Thank you @HerdingCatsAllDay. My ex was super nice and gave me money to buy a nice pack and play. To be fair, we’re going to share it, but it was still kind of him. 

But I keep checking the tracking status and want it to be here already. 😭😂

Also bought a baby fall outfit with a pumpkin hat earlier this month and I was so stoked. I spent my birthday money on baby stuff too. 😅😬

I have a problem lol.I’m 8 months pregnant. My ex gave me money to order the Day2Dream graco pack and play. Just wondering if it’s worth it. 

It’s on sale on the graco website (30% off), so I’m wondering :) 

I don’t have a bassinet, so I was thinking about it for that function too. I also sleepover at my friends often, so I plan to use it when I visit with baby.

Literally had a check up today, they listened to her heart and measured fluid in an ultrasound. Her kicks are strong. Plenty of fluid. She seems healthy. 

I’ve had a few falls. I know. I’m being very careful, but I either have the worst luck or I’m a dumbass. I’ve fallen 4-5 times and had to go to the ER. Got hit by a car early in my pregnancy, while walking. I just worry a shit ton that I’ve hurt her and she’s going to die. 

How do I relax?. I’m moving out in a few months with my baby. Currently living at my moms (which has been terrible; she’s not the best). 

While I appreciate it, I need to gtfo for my baby’s sake. 

I’m planning on buying all of the stuff I need little by little, or just saving the money and buying it in one huge purchase (to save storage costs). I made an Amazon list with everything I need, from kitchen trash can to a bed frame. I don’t have anything currently. Nothing. The list also includes nonessentials, such as balcony stuff and apartment decor. And a couch. Mostly all small stuff that can fit in even a small apartment. 

Is the price too much? Everything I added had almost 5 star reviews.

This doesn’t include baby stuff, because I luckily already bought everything and anything she might need. Crib, changing table/dresser, a shit ton of toys for different age brackets, bouncer, swing, etc. It was a $5,000 value, but I really spent only like $2,000 getting everything that I could used. For example, the crib is worth $700, but I got it for $200.It feels like I’m too full. I am 8 months pregnant, so that probably is literally the case. But I’m just wondering lol.I go to a big hospital and see their midwives. I’m 32 weeks pregnant later this week. 

Due to my weird work schedule, I don’t follow a consistent midwife and get rotated through 3 different ones. I’ve seen two of them the last two weeks (I have to go weekly now). One told me the RSV vaccine is not recommend or approved for use in pregnant women. Only for me to google it, and it definitely is? She also told me to not get it, since it’s new.

The other one, that I saw yesterday, told me she recommended I get it as soon as I’m 32 weeks pregnant (Friday). 

So do I or not? 😬😬. I’m honestly stressed asf and feel super bad. 

He’s 1 year old in 2 weeks. 

But my friend does not have any help and has severe ppd. Her baby daddy barely helps and pats himself on the back for throwing them $100/month and seeing the baby like 5 hours total a MONTH. I have been trying to help her as much as possible; I bought her groceries, clean her place, and finally agreed to take care of her baby sometimes. 

Im 8 months pregnant, but have been too scared to take care of the baby myself. I have zero experience. 

But a week ago, right after he had recovered from coup, I was able to get him to eat his first meal (noodles and bread, then milk) in days. He’d been in the hospital up until that day, but had been released that day. My friend asked me to watch him because she didn’t sleep two days straight taking care of him. 

So today, I agreed to take care of him again, because his sleep is still not normal and she slept 3 hours. 

Her place was a huge mess. Like bad. Like dinner rotting in the kitchen from three days ago, piles of blankets and clothes in the living room, and plastic everywhere bad. I spent 2 hours cleaning. It looked great when I was done. I thought it was fine. 

Well, a few hours into watching the baby, I guess the baby pulled one of my friends weed pens from under the couch and sucked on it. I never left him alone up until then, but I had to pee badly. So I was just in the bathroom for like two seconds. 

My friend was just in her bedroom and came out because she smelled weed. She freaked out and accused me of leaving it there. I don’t even smoke weed when I’m not pregnant. I’m not against it, I just don’t like it. She did apologize after and said she was very sorry and not herself emotionally, but I do feel really bad. 

I asked to take him to the doctor, but she won’t let me. So idk what to do. He didn’t seem to inhale any of it; he is acting normal. But I would still prefer to take him.

I was trying my best and thought I did good until then. Now im scared for my own baby. Like I can’t keep a baby ok for a few hours but will have my own soon? Im literally crying right now. 

My place is very clean, and im not a weed smoker or otherwise, but my same friends baby almost choked on a bottle cap the other day. I honestly am so scared for my baby to go through the same. I already have a lot of anxiety around my baby and now feel like I will be OCD.

I feel like trash rn honestly. And I can’t stop crying.My ex asked me what I want him to do when our daughter is that age, and honestly I have no idea what’s right lol.I got the spectra s2. I did a ton of research, got tired of reading, and just ordered it lol. Trying to get it, but Walgreens said they only give it out to 65+.

Did you need a prescription?. I saw the cutest little Mexican baby, and I want to meet mine already lol. 

I’m also Mexican, so seeing her hairy little head and big brown eyes… I want my baby 😭😂

Still too early tho; I’m just about to be 8 months pregnant.I’m not against it; I’m going in after a quick shower. But I thought it could be normal and a good sign? 

Baby is moving a shit ton more the last 3 days. Like nonstop. Just thought it meant she was healthy. 

Trying not to panic. I’m sure it’s nothing.

It’s ironically my b day, so I think baby is trying to remind me to not party too hard 😂😂😂. Are you guys on friendly terms? Actual friends? 

Ex says he wants to develop a friendship. We have had not the best relationship since we broke up, so idk about that. But I’m willing to try. 

I think a distant, friendly relationship is better, but what do I know..Are you guys on friendly terms? Actual friends? 

Ex says he wants to develop a friendship. We have had not the best relationship since we broke up, so idk about that. But I’m willing to try. 

I think a distant, friendly relationship is better, but what do I know..My cat loves me with a passion. She’s a clingy little thing. And god I love her. But she hates everyone else. 

I hear about a lot of cats that are the same; love their owner but hate everyone else. 

Why are a lot of kitties like this? 🤔. I love my baby already, but I have not been a fan of the kicks. They sort of freak me out. 

I’m about to be 8 months pregnant, so she is moving a lot. I’m so thankful she’s healthy, but I’m anxious asf right now. 

I had a bad weekend and I’m already anxious. She’s super active rn and kicking a shit ton, and it’s about to give me a panic attack. No fault of hers; I just was already anxious and the movements are more intense than what I’m used to. Which I guess is normal for a growing baby. I did call my midwives panicked, and they assured me it’s a good thing. 

I guess the anxiety comes from it sort of feeling like I have a little alien invader inside of me. That’s not reasonable at all. But it’s just freaking me out rn. 

How do I feel better about it?. She is full of opinions on my pregnancy and parenting (of my unborn child) and she was a shitty, abusive mother. Physically, mentally, and emotionally. Half of my siblings won’t even talk to her. 

The latest has to do with some vaccines I got. I’m almost 8 months pregnant and got the tdap, Covid, and flu vaccine. My doctor ok’d it, but they were out of the Covid booster at the hospital, so I went to Walgreens for that. 

I made the mistake of taking her to Costco, but also bringing her to Walgreens with me before that. She can’t drive rn because she screwed up her knee in a DUI crash, where she was the drunk driver and takes zero responsibility. Now she won’t stop texting me over and over about how bad the Covid vaccine is, and how I’m not supposed to get the Covid booster and flu shot pregnant. Blah blah blah, she just feels she knows better than a doctor and even suggested I’m lying about asking my doctor. 

I honestly have zero patience for it and want her to stfu. I’m just ignoring her at this point. 

I’m waaaaaay too nice sometimes and talk to her out of pity, but I trust her so little that she’s only meeting my baby during holidays or events where I have to see her.

I’m just sick (from Covid booster side effects), in pain (from the same thing and also my back.. from being super pregnant), and I’m ngl, I sort of want to tell her to shut the hell up.

Sorry, rant over.It honestly sounds horrendous, but in one week and a day I’m 8 months pregnant. So basically, I better get mentally prepared. Lol. My situation is a little complicated. I’m a week from being 8 months pregnant rn.

My ex is clean now (3 weeks), but he took up cocaine after our break up. He had never been a drug user, not even a little bit, but he went through a huge mental health crisis. His best friend died in a really, really shitty way. With an apparently incompetent therapist (that made things worse) he started processing the fact that he was sexually abused as a child. There’s a long list of things that happened to him the past few months. 

I’m not making excuses for him, but I understand why he spiraled. 

He was involuntarily hospitalized not too long ago, and came out with a new mindset. He decided to be clean and get help. He’s been showing me the bills for his therapy sessions and his prescription medications (mental health). He’s also been taking drug tests and showing them to me, without me asking. He says in two months, when he’s been clean long enough to pass them (they test for 3 months back of usage), he will take hair follicle drug tests for 6 months and show me. 

I’m really proud of him and the fact that he wants to be a good father. He has been reading parenting books too, and started buying baby stuff. I’m still wary and have trust issues, but if my baby can have a good father, I don’t see why I shouldn’t support that. 


As far as custody goes, he’s agreed to supervised visitation for the 6 months, as he says “to build my trust”. But I know he wants to try an overnight here and there. 

I know him well, and we’ve talked about it, and we both agree baby should be with me mostly while she’s tiny, since I’m breastfeeding and the whole thing with baby not knowing they’re a separate being from mom. So he doesn’t want consistent overnights before 6 months, just an occasional one here and there. 

However, there are a few concerns. 1) what if the stress of taking on a newborn push him into crisis mode or back into addiction, given that him getting help is so fresh. 2) he’s a bartender and it’ll be mid-flu season; him and his roommate are sick at least once a month, no joke. 3) his roommate brings a lot of visitors and has house parties. They do drugs, they include sketchy people (one is recently out of prison for assault). My ex isn’t like that, but he gets a good deal on rent there… but do I want my baby there when there’s a party? Hell no. 4) my ex is a little anxious of taking care of a newborn; he has no idea. Meanwhile, I raised my siblings. 

4 I sort of have a plan for; I’m going to slowly teach him how to take care of a new baby. I’m going to wait to give the baby her first bath with him there, show him how to use the booger thing by frida, etc. But it might take a little time. 

The other ones… are more complex and have me confused. 


Although the judge can’t officially sign until baby is born, we do already have a custody agreement/settlement that we had signed and notarized at my lawyers office; he gets one overnight at 6 months and custody slowly increased into 60-40 at 1 & 1/2 year old. Custody before 6 months is minimal on paper, he gets like 3 hours each for 3 days, but I plan to give him a lot more than that as long as he’s not using drugs. If he starts again, I’ll have to go to court obviously. But I believe that he will stay clean; he really wants to be a father. 

So yeah… I want to be fair and encourage their relationship to grow, but how do I do that smartly. What’s a good starting point?. My situation is a little complicated. I’m a week from being 8 months pregnant rn.

So yeah… I want to be fair and encourage their relationship to grow, but how do I do that smartly. What’s a good starting point?. I’m coping a lot better, due to therapy and doing a lot of work on myself, but I want to stay on the right track. :) 

I feel very low today. I’m staying strong and making it through work, but it has been rough. 

I do have therapy later today, but what sort of things can I do to cope otherwise? Trying to make a plan for the next few days. 

Ironically, my therapy place is doing equine therapy today and I’m scared asf of horses 😂 I love them, but they terrify me. Maybe a scare is what I need though. Lol. I’m planning mine :) 

I’m due in two months or so.My due date is December 6th. I’m excited to meet her, but also terrified lol. 

What was your experience like?. Can they garnish it? 

I owe 3 things, but I always make on time payments, so I’ll revisit the topic with him if the baby’s money won’t be safe in a joint account.I’m just worried about it affecting baby, but also worried that I’ll regret it if baby does get RSV and I didn’t get the vaccine. 

I’ll ask my doctor, for medical advice, but I’m curious to hear others opinions.I scratched a Starbucks workers car this morning. I gave her manager my contact info. The girl was too busy working to come talk to me.

Basically, my white paint scratched onto her headlight. 

Should I call the Starbucks or the police? I don’t want to get a hit and run.I talked about it here previously, but I’m in a mental health IOP. Basically, it’s an elective program where we get individual therapy, group processing therapy, then do a DBT course. We do this stuff 3 times a week (which is exhausting, but helpful). 

There is this girl in my IOP group. She has been mostly quiet for the month she’s been in IOP. Meanwhile, I process for at least a little bit every time (meaning, I talk about my stressors and trauma). Most of my life issues revolve around my pregnancy; it’s the main reason I joined the IOP. I’m also working on coping skills and trying to become the best person I can be, so I can be a great mom. So the pregnancy gets talked about a lot. I make a point to process, even when I don’t want to, because this program was expensive asf (free for me, due to insurance; but I’m trying to make the best of it) and I genuinely want to improve. 

I’m almost 8 months pregnant. The girl I’m talking about opened up last week and talked about her stillbirth. We had very close due dates and she was also going to have a girl. I automatically felt terrible and guilty. She has always looked sad in group (which is typical; most people there are working on depression), but it all made more sense after that. 

I know I’m realistically not responsible, but I did feel significantly bad about a few things. Mainly the whole group asks me a lot about being pregnant and they ask me for pictures of ultrasounds or bring me baby clothes sometimes. I can see how that would be a lot to handle after losing a baby. 

I am not familiar with baby loss trauma, but I do have familiarity with severe trauma and loss, so I understand. As much as I can, I suppose. I don’t want to be another reason this girl struggles. She’s genuinely nice and supportive. Also, thinking about what she went through makes me want to cry. I can’t imagine the amount of pain she’s feeling. 

Looking back, she has avoided me most of the time she’s been in IOP. But the last few times, she has gone out of her way to talk to me. Yesterday she asked for my number and asked if we could go to dinner. 

It was very sudden tbh, because we have never had a full conversation, so I am a little confused. But I’m willing to go in case she has something to talk with me about. She is nice, so I wouldn’t mind a new friend either, but yeah. Idk how to proceed. It seems like I really, *really* trigger her. Is this a bad idea?

I guess I should just go along with what she allows, but also, I just will take any tips on how to approach this situation or how to be sensitive.He is a bartender and doesn’t claim the majority of his income. Probably about 1/3 of what he makes. Yeah, not good, but also not my problem anymore. 

He claims he makes about $2,000/month, when he really makes about $6,000. However, the child support got calculated as if he makes $5,000. 

Why is this and do they know? 

My only guess is that they calculate it based on his sales, as they do taxes, and not his claimed tips.

I mean… good for the baby and me. I’m just curious as to why.She has a button nose and round cheeks, which is also my facial structure. I’m Mexican, but my grandpa is Native American (but from Mexico). My ex is German/Irish and has a pointy nose and slimmer face. 

Are they super accurate? 

He’s the dad 100%, with zero other possibilities, but I wonder if this will make him question that 😂.Those of you with tattoos, do you like, dislike, or feel indifferent when people approach you to talk about your tattoos? Why or why not? Is it usually complimentary or are they rude in your experience?. I had my hearing with the judge about three weeks ago, which for paper pushers probably is very long. Anyway, I was approved and I was curious how long others in Schenectady county waited to get their permits after they were approved.I'll be picking up a full size Beretta 92X from the shop as soon I have my permit hard copy in hand now thay ive beem approved and since I've only had shotguns before I was looking for holster recommendations.

I realize full size is not the go to for conceal carry, but until I research something more compact and can get my permit amended to add a second pistol, it'll have to do.

Anyway, any and all ccw suggestions are appreciated. 🙏. I'll be picking up a full size 92X from the shop soon and since I've only had shotguns before I was looking for holster recommendations.

I realize full size is not the go to for conceal carry, but until I research something more compact and can get my permit amended to add a second pistol, it'll have to do. (Don't even get me started on all the bs permit paperwork in my stage.) 😑

Anyway, any and all ccw suggestions are appreciated. 🙏. I scheduled to appear before the judge tomorrow for my permit, assuming all goes well there can anyone else who got their permit through Schenectady give me a ball park estimate in how much longer it actually took to get their permit and pistol in hand after that?

Started my whole application process back in April.I recently bought a MacBook online but the owner didn’t remove their login how can I reset it to factory settings without knowing the Apple ID nor the password? Thank you!!. A boy(16) a grade higher than me (F15) at school has a picture of me (iyk what I mean) idk how he got it but tomorrow when he gets off his bus I’m going to bash him ik for a fact I’m stronger than him I’ve tried talking to him on Snapchat and he’s blaming me and trying to justify himself and I’m sick of it I’m bashing his fucking skull in idc how much trouble I get into I’m causing him the pain he’s caused me and the days for the past week I’ve cried myself to sleep cried during class during break all that shit he’s going to pay all the times I’ve cut myself because of this incident he’s going to learn that just because I’m a girl doesn’t mean I can’t bash his teeth it and I’m not going to stop until I’m forced to I’ll kill him for doing this to me sending that picture to people he’s going to fucking pay I’ve told some of my friends this and they’ve called me a psycho idc if I’m a psycho he’s getting what he deserves. What’s the value of a ww corset??. It hurts it’s so awful and Agitating it makes me want to scream and cry rip all of my hair out 
(I hope yk who I’m talking about, if not pls search it up). I wish I never met my boyfriend, I honestly think my life would be better. I love him so so so much but I honestly think he’s only with me for benefits like sex & the look of a relationship, we’ve been together since may 20th 2022 on may 16th I went to his house for a sleepover (we were best friends) and he sexually assaulted me i know this is bad but I felt something not hatred but love I felt as if someone loved me to do that to me I don’t feel hatred towards him for if that’s what caused us to date I confronted him about it and he apologised over and over again long story short I asked him out them after a couple of months we had sex he took my virginity and I took his fast forwards to a bit before Christmas he cheated on me with his sisters best friend, I woke up to a series of text about how he “only kissed her” she later told me he touch and made out with her it broke my heart but I can’t get myself to break up with him I couldn’t sleep for weeks I was terrified that I’d wake up to the same messages, I feel like I have a void inside of me a void that his love filled a void that drained when I read the messages a void that got filled when he said they only kissed a void that emptied when she told me the truth a void that is a black never ending pit a void that I try to fill with shit like meaning less sex drugs and alcohol, crying my eyes out for hours and hours on ending, cut myself to try feel better but no nothing fills the pit anymore I’ve had enough but I can’t leave him I love him so much but he causes me so so so much pain..I feel I can’t say no to him he asks me for sex I say yes even if I don’t want to I can’t get myself to say no or leave him..Ever since I’ve been trying to be clean I’ve been having flashbacks to moments of sh that where some of my worst, I really don’t want to lose my clean streak but the flashbacks have been triggering me more and more each time…. I find my self getting jealous and feeling less when I see others sh that is deeper of darker then mine I feel as I’m less and not enough to get help.I hate therapists I hate school counsellors I hate gp’s I hate going to appointments about my ED I hate it so so much. I honestly can’t cope anymore I don’t think I can get through the night without self harming or attempting I don’t know what to anymore….I nearly feel insulted. No. I'm not joking. On the outside, I get it: I've always looked like perfect prey. Bubbly, "other", Babyface, naive to social conventions -and tbf, for a long time, I really was. But after 21 years of being raised by a highly psychopathic, abusive mother, bullies of all kinds and years lurking on Reddit, I slowly adapted. So while I do still run into abusive people, they barely get close to me anymore. Kinda like...right now.

In short: A few weeks ago, I got banned from a club. Long story, but let's end it with me having a CPTSD spiral, having a deep-rooted trauma triggered. Queen-kicker being the fact that the exact reason why was never said: It came as total whiplash. This was when "H." reached out to me: H. is another member and....a dude. Literally: I only met him 2x, though I never talked with him per se. After my ban, he offered me to still go sketching with him, as our group did. I accepted one of these meets, as I thought I could get answers from him. But it was canceled last minute and few passed until yesterday, where I had another CPTSD meltdown about the topic. This time though, I was not about weaseling: I messaged H. and asked him directly if someone said anything. If there was a reaction in the old chat. He truthfully answers that no, nobody did. Feigning compassion, asking if we should maybe drink coffee/tea later about it. I felt bad for having dragged him into a mess/dumped on him though he was no part of it. So I thought a quick coffee-meet would not hurt. And oh boi- this dude. Went. Off.

To say it in Mabel Pine's words: *"I was in the friend zone, and then he pulled me into the romance zone! It was like quicksand! Chummity quicksand!"*  
Suddenly it was not a coffee-meet. It was dinner. Suddenly, it was not M-City. Suddenly it was my hometown 1h away. Suddenly, he makes jokes about "hope the age gap doesn't bother you". *Oh b'tch. please!*

This dude just tried to Lady & the Tramp me like he's original. Meanwhile, it's a tale as old as time: Older man prays on younger "awkward" girl. Plays hero in need, when she's vulnerable. Then escalates the meetings quickly. When she pushes back, he reminds her of her "social debt". Aka the cliché "*I took you to dinner, where's my kiss?"* deal. Always adding more to the bill: Paying for her stuff, holding the door...etc. And the sad thing is...this stuff *works*. The moment I entered college, it felt like this shit exploded around me. I literally had a 22yo classmate, who dated a 3x divorced guy, whose oldest daughter is. Her. Age. Literally having told her how "she's so mature" and more junk. 

&#x200B;

Still. Maybe it's my own experiences. But it kinda just baffles & insults me how blatant they are/can be. Hell! Even with all the benefit of the doubts in the world! This overall lack of empathy is just...Ew.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;. Of all the things in the world, people are the most unstructured. They don't have specific times where they send mails. Call you out the blue. All while the rest of the world demands that you keep a firm and regular rhythm.

Now I'm not saying I'm better than that. Actually -I'm the worst example. I HUGELY struggle with organization: Deadlines, time interviews...etc. ADHD doesn't make it better. My entire life seems to revolve around "fake it till you make it". There are so many things that I let slide and need to pick up somehow. All while countless new problems pop up. The last few months socializing itself became a chore. Idk how exactly. But even responding to one message is its own spoon. Just the *receiving* of a new message feels like a new and sudden chore I have to do.

Today, it was about messaging 3 actors who answered for a film role. Sadly, I realized too late that I never learned how to do a casting call. As I was struggling with the realization, the actors happily had already seen my message and replied. Even worse: I still need to do 2 other chores today. I can't do these chores at the SAME TIME, meaning I was panickly stuck.

In the end, I solved it by a pretty cheap tactic: First I pretended that we have our first casting calls next week, giving rough times we could schedule calls. They then replied with times that they had time, to which I replied that I would talk it over with my colleague and give reply in the evening. That way, I can beg my senior that I'll meet later to do the casting with me and have no one message me back till at least the next day.

&#x200B;

God. I have never felt so cliché autistic right now.Basically, our film group has a project. I made a little presentation to send around, looking for people to play the main roles. Now I have people who showed interest and we're supposed to make a casting...but I realize now I don't know how.

Do I just...meet up with them and look how they present the character? Sorry. I noticed this really late, cause I was so busy sending stuff out.After growing out of the local youth-ward, I now try to get special treatment for CPTSD. My therapist referred me to a special clinic an hour away, but my CV was rejected due to lack of space. After that, I had a talk with the head of the ward. The doc referred me to another clinic he personally knew. But a few days later when I called, the secretary sadly told me that they were full -again. Again, asking if she maybe knew similar places she sighed and said that every place in the area is basically unavailable rn.

I'm seriously not sure how to feel rn.

On one side: I'm happy people receive help.

On the other side: How the hell are there so many people with serious mental health issues? Is this the effect of the pandemic? And how long will it take until I find a space? For context: I recently had to realize that my CPTSD has a huge effect on my social skills. I'm often nearly unable to take part in healthy social dynamics, due to...well. A lot of reactions. And sure. Tomorrow ain't my execution and today ain't my judgement -but does this mean I just...keep being this way till then?

&#x200B;. Since I was a kid, my biggest fear was "to be bad". I HATE hurting people. I HATE acting inappropriately and have a strong set of principles around human interaction. Which is why I also feel so scummy about this: In a nutshell, I got recently banned from a drawing club. It's a long story, but basically, I was a bit too annoying in different ways. At first the leader tried to work things out for me, but before I got a second chance, he changed his mind again and I was banned. 

Saying I was utterly depressed after this would be an understatement. Not only was I made aware of how little social skills I have...I also made people uncomfortable. Add to that, that I was never given full reason to why the sudden change of heart, or what exactly was said behind the scenes. Plus, none of the members I had met reached out to me. Meaning my brain was full of scenarios of people happily agreeing on how much of a nuisance I was.

Well, a few days later, I got a message. It was from H. -one of the group members I had met. Back then he was one who visibly took a slight liking (platonic or idk) to me, asking how I was and still offering to invite me on the sketch-excursions.

Now, at first my instinctual answer was no. As much as H. is a really nice guy, I never really connected with him. But then I stopped and thought about it. For one, as said, I never got a real reason why I was banned. Though it might not change everything, if f I interact with him & the others, I could find it out. *(Again, it sounds really stupid, but a part of me goes nuts about this*). And second, if I connect with other members externally...I might find a way to get the ban lifted. Like. I know this sounds like a scummy weasel technic. But my "annoying" behavior was me, among other things, being too loud and talkative. If I show I can be quiet and patient, I might convince enough people that I'm a good bean. Especially when enoguh time passes,  *^((and this unproductive leader yeets it one day))**,* people might start advocating for me.

That said, I still feel really scummy about this. Like. I know there are women who literally slept their way up to powerful positions, but to me, even feigning platonic liking feels scummy to me.

But anyway. How about y'all?. I'm not even remotely joking. Honestly...I'm still in shock. This was \*literally -\*THE reason.

In short: 1-2 months ago, I got invited to a drawing club. I had not been in one for years and was honestly excited. I'm more of a hermit, but ironically always liked meeting new people.

A week ago I got mail. It was from the club leader -the same guy who invited me. In short, it was about my behavior. Now, when you read "behavior" you probably think about something horrible: Sexual harassment, violence, showing up high et cetera -But no. It was nothing like that. The worst faux-pas was a very awful flirt attempt, in which I had playfully asked the leader if he was single (sadly, across the table, which put him in an awkward position). But other than that it was just a list of...myself.

I talked too much. Talked too long without reading the room. Accidentally crashed some conversations. Made a sarcastic reply that was taken as "macabre". Lack of eye contact. And overall "made people just uncomfortable". Now, I've got my diagnosis for a while now and I know myself. I knew that (aside the bad flirting attempt, I will take 100% credit for that) this was a case of a Double-Empathy Problem: Though I might look rude, or selfish, many things I do are often accidents due to faceblindness. Trying to "guess" spaces, when everyone around you is talking. Or talking passionately and they smile, so you think you can go on. Aka -NTs misunderstand Autistics, and Autistics misunderstand them.

But alright. Taken. My actions were annoying. So I immediately send back a detailed response: First I apologize. Even if my behavior is not 100% controllable, it still was not en par. Then I explained I'm autistic and what this means. I was told that this was too lengthy in hindsight, but at that point I felt a basic responsibility to present autism well -not just for me, but any autist coming in after me. (Y'know. Horrible view in the media). After this, I ended it with a Quid pro quo aka solutions for finding a middleground in communication.

At first, talks went smoothly. He said he read and understood. That this could work, he could be more direct. Even including a smiley. He also asked if I wanted to stay after this. I replied yes.

3 days later I was banned.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong: I'm not petty. People are allowed to feel how they feel. I am not "owed" a spot. That said, this is a chain-event in several cities -meaning I'm not only banned from there...but the whole organization as a whole. Suing for discrimination is probably dumb & too small of an issue anyway. Even if I could -I don't want to be where people don't openly want me. Or just where I make people miserable. Overall, I actually feel horrible about myself more than anyone right now: As a child, my mother was addicted to put me into sports. Every time. Every. Single. Time. I was banned. Even chess. Not because I acted horrid. My behavior was annoying, but doable, but even when the leader was fine, the other members would rile until I got kicked. Other times, like this one, I never even were a member from the day I joined. So to keep group morale...I had to go.

Joining the club had given me a lot of confidence. Mostly in the aspect of joining clubs outside school. I had a new joy for my old hobby and so many interesting people to meet and learn from. A new third place. Now I have even trouble going to college

&#x200B;

welp. At least I didn't get beaten up this time, eh?

&#x200B;

EDIT: 

1.) I see a lot of people accusing me of "hiding parts of the story". Now, I did leave out some details to not make the post "too long", but...no. I'm not. At least not on purpose. Obviously, I can't say what went on behind the scenes, aka what they discussed, so idk if some of my behavior was more inappropriate than I thought/inappropriate. The country-wide ban sounds extreme, obv. but this was mostly his way of "keeping any branch of the club peaceful". For other details check the comments.

2.) In hindsight, it's true that it wasn't per se about Autism. Rather behavior related to autism. That said, I am not fully changing the post. What I meant with "my autism" wasn't per se related to my behaviors -but my inability to catch social cues that they were taken so negatively. I knew this. So I tried to communicate it. I tried to communicate and solve the problem together. I did not make it as "an excuse" -in the og text to him, as well as here, I tried to repeatedly say this is an explanation. Not an excuse. But after I explained it to him, his reply basically was, "we're not really about that, we rather have our personal NT peace". 

3.) That said. This was not some "AITA" validation post. It was a vent. Thank you to all the people who were so kind to me <3

&#x200B;. Isn't social isolation neat? As a kid, I was the local pariah: My school was a fucked no-man's-land, leading to a "Lord of the Flies" situation. You didn't have groups, but a hierarchy. In my case, it was an unspoken law that I was treated "a certain way". Including 1.) not being "too" nice to me (esp. guys) 2.) not invitingincluding me to anything (even class things) and 3.) regularly reminding me how hated I was. By both beatings as well as casual insults.

  
Having an abusive/neglectful family, I was completely socially isolated. I wasn't just taught how to human -I was actively restrained from it. Like sitting in a round room, where all the doors are closed automatically.

  
Today I'm grown. I abandoned my entire past, only having snippets left, but as they say "*history repeats itself"*. To make things short: I joined a club a few months ago. Things were fun, until the leader messaged me about "my behaviour". Don't get me wrong: It wasn't anything per se inappropriate/illegal, and actually related a lot to my autism/CPTSD, but it was still enough to make him and the group very uncomfortable.  Luckily, we were able to settle the issue. But even then, his behavior had notably changed. His tone was cold, but polite. No emojis. Short, but precise talking, while putting up a "us vs. you" front. All the hallmarks of someone putting up a distance. More specificly: Someone closing their door forever.

  
Now. Don't get me wrong: His actions weren't petty. Actually, they were very emotionally mature. He felt uncomfortable, but needed to be fair. Hence he acted in a way that was polite, but only limited to what he had to do/felt comfortable with. 

  
However, it still made me sad: From experience, people that close their doors won't open them again. Even if you act great and awesome afterwards...you won't even become friends anymore. Trust me. I've known this tone throughout my life -though it's mostly people with options that are more judgy and close doors fast. Well, except this time. This time I closed this door myself.

Fml. Since I was a kid, I HATED "non-organisation organisation". The type where you didn't have clear goals, data or similar on a paper. Rather mouth-to-ear. Or "knowing it roughly". Working on intuition, rather than clear hierarchies and facts. Very often I'd get so confused that I didn't know what to do, until I was yelled at for not participating.

Right now, I'm having this moment again. I'm in a form of student council. Today I missed our important introduction for freshmen. This event had roughly been talked about, but we no one ever wrote all the data in one "pack". Meaning: There WAS info, but you had to personally get it together, by looking up the college website, and remembering it for 1-2 weeks later -which can work for many, but...well, not for me.

I hate this. I feel so lazy and avoidant. However, I'm also so angry: This is NOT about lack of willingness for self-involvement. We don't have a firm calendar with dates. I never know what I have to do, because all of our tasks are held casual, e.g. applying to sponsors on our own, instead of having a clear list with 1.) how many 2.) good starting points or even 3.) till WHEN. 

I kinda just wanted to go with the flow without getting to authorian, but I realize if I don't do anything this shit will stack. I swear to God, I will create a calendar, because this shit is DUMB AS FUCK. Since I was a kid, I regularly got kicked from clubs/sports. Not because of bullshit reasons like starting fights, or sexually inappropriate behaviors -because I'm autistic. Even if I do nothing, my natural behaviors make people uncomfortable. My stiff face, my stimming etc. 

Luckily I became better at defending/standing-in for myself over time. Sadly, this often includes having to explain autism to people. Stuff that naturally includes a lot of subtext around ableism, society...and well the world. 

Due to this I stay safe...but also end up not very "fun". According to my mother (an ex-party girl) people want people that are "fun", before they meet their hardships. I try to be fun. Hence I also not immediately crash into a place with my diagnosis. But on the flip side, it now always ends with people feeling bad about themselves, or cautious around me. And I still don't make any friends.Everyone knows how to make friends: You go somewhere. Preferably about a sport/hobby. You talk to people -they like you, you like them. They like you for you -and that's my problem.

For as long as I live, I always got into trouble the same way: Joining a club, my "behaviors" would set someone off. Call it the Double-Empathy problem, my autism/ADHD would often cause people to feel uncomfortable, leading to a spiral of accusations, arguments and more. Until I was taken out and/or the group reformed without me. Over the years, I've gotten pretty good at negating damage. I made language my strong point. I learned how to defend my position. I became hypervigilant to potential red flags and learned more psychology terms than is healthy for me. When confronted with stress, my entire system turns cold and calculating -not really useful in situations demanding emotional availability, but...well...like I said. I'm pretty useless and easily hurt on that level.

A few days ago, I got into another situation: This time, told to me by the group's leader.

No, don't worry. I didn't shift blame or anything. However, in my explanation, there was a lot of subtext in which a lot of trauma and experiences were hinted. Literally using the term "just-world-syndrome" once, for example.

Out of anger, I accidentally told my parents about the situation. My mother just sighed "And then you wonder why you have trouble making friends." I asked what she meant. She explained that in my "beloved" psychology, people make friends/are liked by being "fun". It's why even shitty people can have friends. "People want people like pop songs" she said "Soft, simple, good to dance to. You're more like...a documentary on Fukushima. Honest, serious and maybe even important. But not something that you casually watch, because you know you have to acknowledge some horrible things about yourself & the world. You just feel worse afterward." Finally adding the title.

I know she's kinda right. I'm not really "fun" in any way.

But on the flip side...what should I do differently? If I let things slide, things will just end up like in the beginning!

&#x200B;. A few days ago, I got a message of my drawing club's leader. He was someone I thought was cute. Like not "crush", but "could kiss that". In a nutshell, the letter was split into two parts: 1.) an embarrassing flirt attempt of mine, which I had made him uncomfortable in our last session and 2.) a general list of all the things that he found disturbed the group.

Now, the first aspect was very fair. However, the second part was just a list of all the ADHD/autism traits you can imagine. And while I first chucked it up to the Double-Empathy-Problem between NTs and autistic people...I sensed some really weird undertones in his messages.

I'm not sure how to explain it. But it was a really weird lack of sympathy/empathy.

He complained I'd talk to much -including in the group chat. I barely ever talk in the group chat (checked it again). Maybe having 5 messages in total, being mainly compliments towards other people's art.

In one point, he noticed a time where I had been asked why I didn't draw realism. My "macabre" reply was that "I am already forced to be in this world. Doesn't mean I have to waste my free time on it." He considered this reply as "depressing" and "bringing down group morale". Which, tbf one can think. And I also don't demand for people to play therapist. But it felt weird how his first reaction was to consider this annoying towards the group, instead of reflecting"why" I could be saying it. It's also weirdly specific that he remembered that line at all -it was said 2 months ago!

His only emotional reassurance was that he knew I was "nice and knew a lot about art".

His text ended with "Are you going to behave (for the group)?" Kinda like you'd ask a kid

After giving a 2-3 page reply, including explaining what Autism,Double-Empathy etc. were...he kinda just send back 3 messages. Saying he understood, he'll be more directer and think about it in the future. But no suprise, or reflection per se.

Just the list. Just this...list of all he found annoying.

Idk. Maybe I'm overreacting. I come from a shitty background, so I'm hypervigilant for red flags. Plus, I'm very aware I can project my world view on people, where I subconsciously demand them to be more sympathetic than people are -per se, most are emotionally immature.

But...idk. It's not that I just feel guilty. It's like...I feel the club just...closed in front of me.

I wasn't kicked out, but I as well could have been. It's a feeling I remember from childhood: My mother would often put me into sports/clubs and it was often similar. I was still allowed to practice, but people kinda "forgot" about me. I feel as if every motion I do is now is just monitored for flaws. I feel like I can't talk anymore, can't voice my opinion anymore, have to be hyperactive for stims... I don't even feel like I can't share anything in the group chat anymore. I just...idk. He didn't mean it malicious, I think. But the way he just listed all these things in that tone...I just don't really feel safe anymore.

Is this just rejection sensitivity/Hypervigilance?

Or am I on to something?. Luckily it was not a crush. And I did not per se do anything greatly inappropriate. But...damn. That's a new one.I joined a drawing club. Sounds simple, right? I was really happy. I hadn't drawn in a while and they always say "make new friends in hobbies"...right?

Today I received a pissed letter. Just by the guy I found cute -of all people. Basically, he told me I was annoying to the group. Aside from one valid thing, 90% he mentioned where just my natural autistic behaviour. Ending it even with "Will you behave?" -like I'm some small child.

The joke is that he wasn't even malicious. It's an issue of the "Double Empathy" -autistic/non-autistic people misunderstanding each other. Kinda like cats & dogs. And while I knew I didn't have to, I ended up writing 3 pages to explain Autism/the mentioned problem to him. Out of obligation -even if I'd get banned, I wanted to at least manage to spread the word for the next person. The next autistic/ADHD/whatever person he meets.

I'm so tired.

Every time. My entire life I spent explaining. Spent getting seen as a monster. Spent, attempting to advocate for myself. Trying to phrase my issues into words and words and words...

...I'm so tired to have explain that I'm a human too. To hear that the basis of my existence is annoying to people. To move on and...have everything repeat...over...and...o...*v**^(..)*^(.)*^(e...r.)*^(..)

&#x200B;. It's the ol' CPTSD fear: "I acted wrong and now everyone hates me" Normally a wrong assumption, based on hypervigiliance. Other times also called "The imaginary audience". Except today...this assumption became TRUE!

In a nutshell: I joined a drawing club a month ago. Due to social isolation through autism, but also CPTSD, I quickly become overwhelmed and start to dissociate at first. A thing that normally makes me quiet, but due to my "issue" of being seen as creepy due to my unemotive face, I immediately strapped on my most popular mask: The one of the "happy Salesman". Aka being overly chipper and extroverted. As well as...sadly...to the point of becoming a little inappropriate. Not extremely -but basically in what a drunk person would normally say.

In my defense, I didn't notice this "effect" till yesterday. This was my first real "club" exposure and this mask was one of the few that ever made me sympathetic/ make people treat me like I'm human.

Today I received a long message. It was from the leader of the drawing club. In short: He was completely annoyed by me. Aside from me asking him if he was single, in a way that pushed him into the spotlight (shitty flirt attempt -fair), 90% he described was...well...simply my mask/autism. It was like all my intrusive thoughts had written a letter. "You talk too much, you can't read the room" etc. The worst being a trauma slip: when asked why I don't like to draw realism, I answered "I'm already forced to be in this world. Doesn't mean I have to spend my free time thinking about it." A bit of modern depression humor to be sure. However, I literally was told it to not just be macabre, but that I was "dragging down the mood". Mind you: This was ONE sentence. No trauma dump. One. Sentence.

I'm trying to get myself up to answer. But a part of me is just...so depressed.

Throughout my life, it became normal for me to have to "defend" my value. Even as a child, I was seen as a monster. More than enough, it was due to this double-empathy problem: People just think I'm selfish. Lazy. Crave attention. I was kicked out of more groups I can count. Even when I tried -even when I MANAGED to explain... oftentimes, people just didn't care. Sometimes it was everyone. Sometimes the leader was understanding, but caved due to group pressure. After my teens, I had a big break due to (personal) isolation. But even then, the deep dark fear remained.

And today, it showed up again.Recently, I joined a drawing club. This was my first "adult" club, so I kinda got overwhelmed. During my teenage years, I was greatly socially isolated due to my Autism/ADHD, so there are a NUMBER of things that I lack/don't know how to do. This, of course, resulted in stress. Which then turned to "happy dissociation". Aka, my mask of being overly happy & showmanny, to the point of acting like I'm drunk. One of the few masks I can easily put up & get good results from. Especially since I normally get the opposite reaction of being seen as "creepy" for not emoting.

Today I received a mail from the club leader. In summary, it was all the things he found inappropriate with me. Some things were understandable: Like me asking him across the table if he's single (horrible flirt-attempt, please don't ask). But other than that 90% was just my ASD: Talking too much, not "reading the room" etc. Other times it was my "macabre attitude" -mostly refering to my answer to why I don't like to draw realism. "I'm already forced to be in this world. Doesn't mean I have to spend my free time thinking about it." A bit "modern depression humor" to be sure, but "macabre" is a bit far-fetched. Like how fragile are you

Anyway. I'm happy I was not yeeted immediately. Though of course, he might still pull a "majority rules" and kicks me anyway. I'll try to communicate with him, but man.

I hate this.Mind you: Split across 2 subjects. So that's 1-2 courses per subject.

Technically, I know it's not my fault. At the beginning, I took as many classes as everyone else. But quickly I had to cancel many. I just got so overwhelmed. Though they may be split well, I have trouble to get my brain to just...refocus. To work on a paper requires to JUST work on that paper. I shiver when I hear people tell me, how they have 3-4 papers to do. But I also feel like a lazy loser for crossing the usual time you spend in college and still not being fully done.

Overall, I feel so weird calculating my "focus skillpoints": Taking a course on a special interest can take 1/2 focus, as I do so automatically and have a lot of knowledge already. But a course on linguistics takes 2 focus-slots. It's full of structure. Plus it can't be about Syntax, as Syntax is fully about structure and my brain broke off in the base-course already. And then there are the side-penalties, like my driver's license, French, work and my hobbies.

I hate this. On and off, I've been working for a buddy of my Dad's. The buddy is an older cameraman by trade and a stubborn ol' mule by nature. I've worked under him as camera assistance. This includes many smaller promo-shoots for projects of indi-artists and more. This was until a few months ago, my boss came with some big news: He'd be shooting his own movie. It'd be a fairy tale story, being shot across 3 countries (we're in Europe). "Having shot in Prague" sounded good on my CV, so I decided I was in. Because I had shown him my storyboards in the past, he decided I was going to draw him the storyboard for his Teaser. 

From the start, everything was a mess. The script was only 2 pages and riddled with grammar & formatting mistakes. Not a per se "shame" as it was still readable, but after that, it didn't have any "natural narration". They were rapidly changing scenes, which felt generally disconnected. Of course, I asked the usual questions: What's the logline? What's the core idea? How do your first & last scene echo? (aka the usual narration theory questions). However, he was quick to tell me that he "didn't care for any 'rules'." That he was going to play his own game. I tried to explain to him that the "rules" were there to help, not hinder him, but he quickly waved it off. Like I said: stubborn old mule.

So I sat down with the storyboard. Due to the mess, I tried to ask specific questions of how he wanted it. In summary, he wanted the key scenes he had written and for me to fill in the blanks, literally saying "Just draw it so it creates a narrative and make it fit." Per se, every time I asked his notion was about just making the scene tense with a comedic twist. And so...I did. It took 2 days to roughly sketch out the story. Roughly described, the Teaser includes a kobold to arrive at an Inn in the forest.  The kobold is first presented like a Nazgûl from LotR, until he gets off his horse and into a puddle. He is welcomed by a stableboy who laughs at his misfortune. The scene ends with the Kobold (my father) to turn to the audience and ask them for support-money.

Following my boss's word, I reshaped the narrative to make it more comprehensive for the viewer. Example: Instead of suddenly showing a rider, I started with a goose feather (it's a fairy tale about a princess made a goose keeper), slowly settling on the ground in the rain, before being crushed by a gigantic black hoof. In another instance, I solved a special effects issue by forced perspective: Instead of having to make an entire horse "vanish" by complicated CGI, I made the holster that the stableboy holds the horse with, go outside the screen. That way an assistant could hold & drop the holster, along with a later added "poof" sound. So showcasing this: I didn't do these changes to force my own vision. I did them with the limited input I got and in an empathy for the viewers' time & entertainment. Especially since this teaser has to ask for money.

...*welp*. The good news is: My boss didn't hate it. The bad news is: I have to scrap all the work anyway.

Remember when I said how vague he was on what shots he wanted? Well, while he loved the goose-feather idea, he all along already HAD a clear vision in mind. After poking him for HOURS for what he wanted -now he suddenly turned the corner of inspiration from movies he never mentioned. Including some random 2004 Van Helsing movie. And instead of using the very practical effect I had in mind, we are now going for a very expensive and complicated CGI stunt anyway. When telling him about the narration-issues, my boss, AGAIN, waved it off. "It's not that important. It's an action shot. It's not meant to show anything." Adding my father's happily misanthropic take: "Viewers don't care. They're stupid. You gotta go 3 levels down for them to comprehend anything."

Anyway that was my rant. Don't worry: I do as my boss commands. Its his vision, not mine. And it was my own decision, in exchange for some Prague exposure. He's also not the first boss that acted like that: One reason I steered from acting to filmmaking, was my very similar, very nutty drama-teacher. A guy which would first cheer for my performance, and then micromanage shit like a specific tone for a useless sentence. 

Now I'm slowly at my wits ends on how to deal with people like that. How do you keep a neutral progression? At least without accidentally screaming "JUST LET ME DO MY FUCKING JOB, WILL YA?!" 

&#x200B;. Y'all know it: Ugly guy with a hot wife/gf. It's been done through countless movies, comics etc. It's not even about the idea of some slacker getting a woman way too good for him -just the notion of an average guy, together with a supermodel girl by looks. The trope has become more and more hated. In writing, feminist, but also just general spaces, as it generally reinforces the notion of average dudes "deserving" a hot gf/wife, while the girl is supposed to settle for the average fucking nitwit next door.

Now. I'm not saying these notions are wrong. They are very right in many ways. But here's a lil problem: My writing...falls directly into that.

For context: I'm a 21yo bi-woman.  Since I was little, I always had a very "weird" taste in men & women. For women, I was always very cliché: Pretty, extreme feminine women -kinda just humanized porcelain dolls. With men, I prefer "interesting faces". This is harder to pinpoint, but examples be Nosferatu, Uncle Fester (from the RL movies), Tyrone Lennister (Peter Dinklage), Mr. Me-Mania from Perfect Blue (just his face), but also idk a handful of clown and horror characters. All not very, erm, attractive characters -at least considered by many.

Now, at first I didn't really mind "filling" the status quo. Especially since I do try to make them more than weird Manic Pixie People. That said, I have been questioned multiple times now on that aspect. "Why does he have to be the *ugly* one".

I'm not changing my entire taste, of course. That said, I wonder how I could find a middle ground regarding the rising taste change?. Just came from a really enraging post. A father explained that his small child got HUGELY bullied by a peer. Included was extreme physical violence, with punches to the stomache and more. Th parent explained that he tried everything: Told the teacher, told the child to ignore her bully, told the school, told the child to just "stand it a little longer"...for around 2-3 years.

I know you shouldn't judge people. Especially when they ask for help. But FUCKING! HELL!.

HOW ARE PEOPLE THAT USELESS?!

Congratulations! You taught your child "Violent people exist, and I cannot/ will not protect you from them. Just deal with it".

Like...as a child, my parents weren't great. Hence the touchyness. But though they were assholes, even they acted better than that. In 2nd grade, I got beaten on the way home by a 14yo boy. It was regularly. So when I told my parents, my father opted for a trap: Every day, he'd follow me like some accidental passerby. When the boy appeared, he sprinted into action, grabbed him by the collar, shook and SCREAMED him into the ground. Kid never approached me again.

&#x200B;

Seriously. Am I nuts? How can people survive with this little street smarts?! Even more: How do people just idle by and stare as their child get beaten. "School changes don't work easy here" FUCK! THIS! I'd fucking call the police and CPS on that shithead, and refuse my kid to go to school until a new is found!

Rather I'll let her learn the material at home, than send her to school in terror and knowledge that she will get hurt again.

FUCK!

&#x200B;. I'm autistic. A term that meant "subhuman" for most people in my life. However, while I suffered a ton from my abusive mother, the most "long-range" damage was done by people my age.

As much as kids are cute and dumb, most can be utterly cruel. Adults like to play this down till today. Normalization of the "schoolyard bully" that's just some poor kid from a bad home. Abuse is "just shoving and namecalling". Sticks and stones may break my bones...

In reality, collective bullying hits hard. You're literally outcasted and denounced by a group that you can't escape, and am forced to interact with. You are not only in a -apparently- confusing part of development, but you're basically isolated from certain aspects of mental growth.

As an adult, I have general issues with socializing. I don't ever fully bond with people. I react nervous and baffled at compliments, or small niceties. I generally expect people to act horrible and am horrible in group activities, with me quickly reverting to my "solo-game" position, if I don't feel integrated. Per se, I am considered "oddish" as I'm not as "chill" or "normal" in many social situations. Like when you stay over at someone's place and you didn't know you can just go to the fridge. Overall, I never really felt like it was as much "trauma", until memories popped up in my night terrors.

And if that's still not believable...here's a list of all the things "innocent childhood bullying" included:

* Insulting nicknames, incl. "Cavity" and "Medusa"
* Active isolation = inviting the entire class, but me
* Starting fights/beatings for random "insults": Including stepping on a piece of paper
* Two girls screaming at each other about who has to pick me for their team. I was the last one standing. They screamed for 30min. They screamed for 15min after I had already left.
* Multiple murder attempts ( pushing me down the stairs, choking me with snow)
* Fake love letters
* Actively bullying and isolating anyone away from me that was nicer than a casual greeting to me
* Destroying my stuff
* Attempted damage of serious property e.g. my teddybear BECAUSE they knew how much it meant to me (tbf attempted that only once lmao)
* Locking me into a horse's box for over 4-5h
* Taking pictures of me and putting it on social media. Making it a "challenge" like I'm some exotic animal. This escalated into people nearly following me to the toilet, and even outside school. I actively locked myself into the toilet to change, to not get revenge-porn made of me. Till today I have an active phobia of cameras
* Consistent mockery
* Consistent "hunting" aka people that'd look for any small mistake to potentially get me kicked from school etc.
* Surrounding me as a group and screaming from all sides, like some form of vicious insult-circle

...and those were off the top of my head.

Still surprised that none included SA. But hey. Maybe dehumanization had its benefits there?

&#x200B;. The term is mostly for LGBTQ+: Has a teen, you're not allowed the usual "teen milestones". You're not allowed to be open about who you are. Date without mockery, or even violence. Even not dress the way you want. So when you're adult, and have all that freedom...you kinda feel like NOW you have your time. It's one of the reasons why there's a "youth-obsession" in gay spaces.

The term to me hit a strong cord. Not (only) because of sexuality, but because of trauma:

While I had "somewhat" of a childhood, my teenagehood was robbed of me. I was bullied. Living with an abusive mother. I was neglected in terms of autism & ADHD. To the point my entire brain just...froze. I have general amnesia. I can't even remember when I got my first period. Every event like a dance ball was just...a twisted version of reality.

Only now I feel like I "woke up". Only now, I care for makeup. Shopping. Actually dressing flatterily. I put effort into learning how to study/care for studying overall. I try to make stuff like my driver's license. Explore hobbies and interests. Putting effort into my career. Taking on part-time jobs. Even potentially exploring the dating scene. Though that still needs time.

I often explain it in that way, that because my brain "froze" I could never fully develop my social/emotional maturity. Many aspects are still on the level of a 14-15yo (I'm 21yo). A lot of people don't get why I mourn certain stuff. Like when I mourn that I'll never have "innocent teenage love", and people think it means "Oh, many never had any a relationship in their 20s...?" Like bruh. Frank. That's not what I MEANT. I joined a form of student council at my college. From the beginning, I was very confused. There were a lot of topics at once, but I never really knew what I could/should do. I know that those jobs often require intuitiveness, but being a newbie, I was still getting used to all of this.

Today I woke up a little late. As I looked into my chat, I realized I had missed a group meeting 2h ago. This meeting was mentioned once a few weeks ago. We don't have a "list" with all the dates. But okay. Shit happens. But somehow, this was also the SAME DAY where we introduce ourselves to freshmen. The idea of freshmen introduction had been discussed, but never given a clear date, way of going about, or otherwise. 90% of discussion always revolved about some stupid goodie-bags.

Anyway, I was obviously a bit sad about this. This was one of the few clear things I got, and I already feel like dead weight to the group. Somebody else replied, that it was the beginning of October, aka I could have "pieced the puzzle pieces together \[myself\]".

I know this might be partially on me, but...anyone else think this is fucked? I hate when groups always run on members intuitiveness and "reading the situation". Like. I just want to do some clear tasks. I'm not lazy, I just want to know WHAT I need to do!. As a kid, I hated soup. When given, it  was always too hot by default. People would begin eating after 5min tops -I needed 10-15minutes. On the flip side, I still felt like cold food was still warm.

My parents regularly complained about both. "My GOD! Why do you have to be so petty again! Look! Everyone else eats it just fine! How is it too hot!" or "So you spent so much time it's cold again." Sometimes I'd even place my hand against the food. It always felt still warm to me.

In general, I feel like I have weird temperature perceptions. Putting on stuff when its warm. Othertimes running around in skimpy clothing when it's cold. It's not always the "rhythm" like that. But it happens a lot.I'm in a new art group. It's a nice group, with regular events. One of those is life drawings, aka sketching a nude/half-nude model to learn anatomy. A few days ago, one of those events popped up. It was at an art school. I felt a little peer pressured by everyone going in and decided to go too. 

A day before the event, I was still not done with my college paper. With a close deadline, I excused myself for that reason. Everyone was very understanding. Immediately sharing when the next event was. Today they shared their sketches: Tasteful drawings of a naked male model. But instead of feeling guilty, or sad, I felt utterly happy. 

I can't tell them this, but: I can't look at naked men in RL.

it sounds so childish for a 21yo. But the reason is bitter-dumb:

As a teen, I grew up not only in an abusive household but an abusive school environment. Not only was I surrounded by multiple types of violence, mental illness, and more...I was also actively "kept" from a normal teenagehood. Think Carrie, just with less religion. Due to this, my brain kinda...froze. I went through the motions, but I didn't "live". So while I did stuff like watch porn ("watched", ironically never got aroused by it till now), I never really went through the mental development of "noticing boys" -why would I? Men around me were either indifferent or violent. In hindsight, I lot came from abusive households like me, but that doesn't matter. 

Point is: When I moved out, my CPTSD slowly started to defreeze. It's also only now that I finally meet guys that are "normal" in that sense. However, while this is good news and I'm not automatically a worse person for it, the downside to this, is that I'm very...immature in many aspects.

I can't look at naked men, because my mental maturity is still a 13yo that giggles, looking at the naked men in the Bravo magazines. Per se:  I freak out about holding hands. I swoon over an old boyband I used to watch. I even still wear my bathing suit in the shower of the communal swimming pools (Where I come from, it's normal to be naked there).

Y'know. It's kinda funny. While I can't do living drawings, I'm one of the few people up for "dead drawings". When Body Worlds had a stop in my town, I was one of the few artists who went there to learn anatomy. Guess I'm fine with nakedness if the flesh is brown and drowning in formaldehyde. YOU FUCKER ARE BLASTING YOUR MUSIC DAY AND NIGHT! It's so loud, it goes through the CONCRETE WALL!

I told you 3 times now. When I knock, you just turn it down a little...and then go back turning it up after 2-3minutes.

You fucking POS. I swear to God. The next time you post this dumb af music, I'll call the police on your ass!. "The addiction to stealing stuff without a motive". It sounds so heinous, but I realize I might have a small case of this. Since I was small, I'd pocket pins/magnets from my childhood-home's black board. In Kindergarten it was toys. Even just brought to the store, I would grab something random and walk out of it, if not stopped.

Luckily, my condition was generally kept at bay. After I nearly took another child's camera home, my parents finally had a talk with me. My mother, thinking I just "had no concept of property yet", gave me the take that "Whatever you take that's not yours, you cannot keep it. Fate will take it away from you. And if you hold onto it, it will take something of similar worth". A very superstitious assumption, of course, but it actually keeps me from escalating till today -just the pure thought about losing something precious to me, because I took shit.

That said, I never lost my "tendencies". Don't worry: I don't shoplift or whatever. I also think I know why I do this: Like many abuse victims, I wasn't "allowed" personal property. Often my mother would just throw, or even give my toys away. Furthermore, my first "friend" was a rather rich girl, who'd do her best to flaunt her expensive toys, own TV etc., while never actually giving me presents/ inviting me to her birthdays. She was among the first "victims" I stole from (mostly stickers and small figures).

My most recent example was the one that woke me up:

For around a week, I worked for a specific film project. Production needed me closer to set, which worked out with an acquaintance offering her room. On my last day, I decided to leave behind some small snacks as thank you, when I got the idea to top it off with some small origami. I had no fitting paper with me, so I borrowed one of hers (those notepad thingies), which was covered by some items. As I removed them, I noticed that there was something in the box. Two 1€  (1€ \~ $1) coins. Lost, but also conviently placed.

Picking them up, I had the immediate urge to take them. I don't have money problems,  so this urge felt surprising to me. But everything in me screamed to take it. That it felt right. Just two small coins. Easily slippable into a pocket. Maybe the owner wouldn't even notice.

Obviously -I didn't take the coins. I made the origami and put the coins back where they belonged. Best decision. Especially since, ironically, I always end up bad after I took something.

But idk. Is this common?. As a kid, I was raised in a very...weird way. My mother is a clinical psychopath, who only judged people & things for their pros & cons. Often just days/weeks after she'd abuse me, she'd give me a fancy present, or a big vacation. Not as a "normal" love bombing tactic -but literally saying "If you stand me, you will have benefits".

Over the years, this fawning response turned into its own form of...greed. Or at least, it seems that way. When I see freebies, I always need to get them. When I'm offered money for something, I have a hard time rejecting it, even if I'm repulsed from what I were to do for it. It even went so far to me nearly putting myself up for serious abuse:  When I was 14yo, when a 23yo male "friend" behaved inappropriately towards me for the first time and I confided in a mutual female friend, who ended up ripping me apart as if it was why my fault. This was short before my birthday and she finished saying, that she would withold the birthday present that she had bought for me for a while. Though I know, I did the right thing by blocking both...there's still a part of me that grieves this present. It sounds so materialistic. But a part of me wished, she could have just kept up a little more till she got a random shit thing, and THEN go blank. 

Nowadays,  I'm doing a little bit better. But even then this...feeling of missing out is not leaving me.

Recently, I bought a new form of vegan milk. I'm not vegan, but due to the animal industry fucking up, my hypochondria becomes stronger and I'm slowly cutting a lot of animal products from my diet. This milk was expensive, but the first one I ever liked...only to then spill the entire content in my fridge, as I didn't close it right.

As I was cleaning, I thought about the rise of vegetarianism & veganism. Mostly in that I found it funny, how I am basically living more and more to veggie principles, but still not "accepting" the term myself. It wasn't so much as bias, it was...fear. The pure concept of commiting and "missing out" on even one food option makes me skittish. It's like this Penguin of Madagascar scene: Where they dig 8 escape tunnels, "in case 7 collapse". I'm mentally hoarding options, so I can always turn my heel the other way.

 Even now, I'm looking out the window -it's 8pm and pitch black night. The store might be around the corner, but it'd be dumb to just go outside. But somehow, the pure thought of not having new milk on me, just in case something goes wrong is haunting me.

Damned I'm fucked. As a kid, I was both abused and socially isolated. Not just by parents -also by peers. Due to this, I spend a big chunk behind books, to the point that my main communication style centered around the acquirement & distribution of information. Meaning: If I have a problem, I first try to learn about it. If someone else has a problem, I share info with them. Knowledge is power, and power is control. 

Sadly, no matter how much this stuff helps me...it's obviously pretty useless/inappropriate in emotional situations.

Several times now, I came into a situation in which a person required emotional reassurance...and I kinda just...stood there. Or even botched it. Which is ironic, because at least theoretically, I know all the right steps: Listen, make them feel heard. Ask "how did that make you feel" and, the most pressing thing: "Don't give advice. Just let them express themselves emotionally." 

As dumb as it sounds, this basic tip kinda clashes with my communication style. Because while I don't actively try to "solve" the situation, I realize it might still come close/sound like that.

 For example, a friend of mine just got out of a toxic relationship. She had written her an indepth letter, trying to appeal her feelings one last time, and got an elaborate "k" back -mourning about how she could do this etc. I replied (in a hopefully nicer, softer tone) that 

>"Well, the way humans work, is that we always have a part of our psyche that justifies what we do. Her short reply could be a general sign on how she deals with emotional situations like these, but also that she might believe she still hasn't done anything wrong in the first place. So obviously, I understand how you feel. You expressed how you felt and hoped for an emotional/empathetic appeal and response. But when she doesn't even feel like she did something wrong, it's like ringing at an empty house. You wait for an answer -but nobody is home."

Otherwise, I think I hit the markers: Let her talk. Didn't make this about me (directly). Tried to reassure her. Also put in aftercare, by, when she was done with the topic, ask what she was doing the rest of the day, show interest etc.

But as I said. I'm pretty helpless in situations like that. Everybody just says "oh, just put yourself in her shoes -how would you feel? How would you like to be treated?" -except that's the thing. I mostly get reassurance...through information. idk i'm fucked. Sorry. Somehow I got roped into this, and Idfk how to act mature regarding my "position".

  
To summarize: A few months ago, I met with my old friend "Anny". Back then, Anny shared some relationship troubles she had with a friend. Apparently, this friend had been very "push-pull" with her -ignoring/hurting her when she got close, but also completely clinging to her when she tried to leave. This emotional blackmail hurt a lot, especially since both just had broken up -putting her in a complicated limbo of logically knowing she "should" cut ties, but also wondering if she would make a horrible mistake, losing someone she knew for years.

Back then, I gave her the following advice: If she didn't know, she should try "pretending". For one month (or so), she should pretend like the person was already gone. Meet other friends. Engage in hobbies etc. If she notices that she is truly missing something without the friend, she can still return. If she notices that she actually has more peace (-> constantly worrying, emotional turmoil etc.) without her friend -she can cut it off, for her own sake. Anny thanked me, and said she'd try it.

Time passes...

A few hours ago, randomly at 2am, I received a voicemail. It was around 6min, with Anny basically venting/ giving an update to the situation I described...just with a lil more information.

As it turned out, this anonymous "friend", was a mutual friend, called "Bea". We three had been part of the same school club, with Anny and Bea being best friends. However, in contrast to the magical idea of "friends to lovers" pipeline, Bea actually ended up breaking the rules of their open relationship, not telling Anny for over 4months -aka cheating on her. Anny, had now tried to end it by writing a 9-page letter about her feelings. This letter accidentally arrived and "ruined" Bea's birthday. This prompted not only a "reply" (= a more elaborate version of "lmao, k") -but also made Bea to go, apparently, to another, third friend and slander Anny. Which, obviously, made Anny distressed again.

So. What's *my* problem here, then?

Well...I...just...don't know how to respond

Since I was small, I was very socially isolated. Partially due to this, I developed the ability to not get roped into most social drama. The few times I did, I'd mostly end it by being too clinical about it, e.g. "If you were mad at me, why didn't you tell me? You're acting unproductive".(Aka, I mostly just know the textbook version of 'what you should do' vs how you actually put it in practice)

My first advice was possible, because it was a more theoretical situation. But now, this friend not only has a connection to me, but it also touches on a trigger point of mine: Cheating. Again, for short context: I'm an affair-baby. The cheating of my mother has had several effects on my life, giving me a burning hatred for the topic. To the point, I generally lose any sympathy & empathy for a cheater. 

&#x200B;

I want to reassure my friend and give her support. I know I can't just tell her "well, what you did was shit", because she kinda knows that know. BUT in the same way, I can't slip and get overemotional, regarding my "usual" ideas towards cheaters. I also realize I kinda only know 1/2 of the situation... BUT I also can't accidentally shoot stuff down, because...Jesus. If this is true...if I got this right...not only did this just start a wildfire, potentially sweeping over into the entire mutual friend group, but worst of all: Anny is STILL caught in this connection, and might just get hurt by a now-known nutty asshole.

**Fuck** what do I do?!?

*^(I'm sorry. This entire situation is so fucking stupid.)*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;. I'm serious. Since I was little, my life felt like a...twisted, turned alternate universe. Every milestone. Every "event" in a person's life.  I'm still not sure how to explain it. 

To make it short: My entire life was filled with abuse. Home. School. Neighbors. Peers. 

Especially because I was autistic, I was often straight-up dehumanized. In HS, part of the hierarchy included the popular kids literally forbidding people to be not nicer to me than basic conversation. LITERALLY tearing down anyone that tried to make friends with me. As if it wasn't horrible enough that my mother at home would beat me for some "murder attempt" I had been "planning again on her". 

The only thing that never got ruined to me...is sex.

Don't get me wrong: I did suffer some minor CSA and general harassment, obviously. But in hindsight, I realize I have no per se sexual trauma. It's the only thing that developed normally. And like a precious porcelain doll, I became very mature: Setting boundaries, knowing my limits and never getting into desperation. I want to have sex with someone I love and am in a firm relationship with. Not because of magical thinking -just because I want to have one thing, where I can have something I want, and have a decently normal experience with it. Sex is the biggest level of intimate experiene to me. It's the only thing  I still somewhat *have* as a basic human experience.

&#x200B;

SA is my 2nd biggest deep fear. But even then...it would still feel into the rhythm. Getting abused. Seen & used as a "thing".

But a prostitute...? Just in general a "hookup to be done with", or casual sex...?

Idk why, but I feel like that would break me. Especially paying someone. For my entire life, I was told that I was unworthy of life. That I was just this...thing people tolerated. It's like I can hear my bullies laughing from afar "See? The only way a man would ever touch you, is if you were to pay him/ he'd be too drunk to see." Going through with it would just be this pathetic sad reminder. I'd rather stay a virgin for life than feel this.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry. Idk why I wrote this. (not literally) I work for film rn. To keep me closer to set, they found someone volunteering their room for me. She's a student like me, so her room is nice, basic and mostly empty.

Well...except for all the photos.

There are strings everywhere. Family photos. Polaroids of friends. A gigantic loving photo of her and her boyfriend, looming on the shelf over the table that my laptop is on. 

I can't fucking escape. My room at home is filled with stuff, as I come from a slightly richer background than her. But even then, it's completely devoid of photos. The only two I had were from my ex-favourite cousin, who send me a killed kitten as a "joke" a few months ago, so I took it down again.

&#x200B;. Especially throughout Europe, there are countless old castles/fortresses. Many, if not most struggling with upkeep: Breaking walls, fading artwork...trying to somehow get along with the pennies of tourists and state donations.  
  
Obviously, the reason why it is so hard to use them for more is simple: They're old. They're a certificate of time. A witness to history. And obv. nobody would love to sleep in a place that costs billions to heat every year (all while still staying cold af)  
  
That said, I feel too many of these places don't take opportunity. Recently, I visited a German castle which included a beautiful "game room": An octagon-shaped room with marble walls, a Roccoco fresko, gold-décor and a fitting, 8-corner wooden table. The room was well lit and easily accessible. It also didn't include smaller tables with easy to push-over vases or similar.  
  
The place only offered tours and mainly outside events. All while that game room could easily be rented for e.g. a Poker, or chess-championship tournament! Like that's a perfect venue right there! Playing in a FUCKING castle -in the most royal of royal game rooms at that!  
  
Again, I'm not pretending to know the struggles of CHM. But still. With all this empty space...I'd think they should try to modernize it a little more.

Anyone else?. As a kid, I didn't get space to myself. Well, I had "my room" -but that space was not private. I was not allowed to lock anything. My mother would just burst in, day and night, often in a fit of rage to rip everything apart. I wasn't even allowed to shower on my own.

After moving out, I realized how hurt I was: Having a small private space felt addicting. To the point I never even told people where I lived. Even less inviting them -it was my small island of retreat. The only place I could truly feel safe and sound, with no one coming through the door that I locked twice.

Of course, I'm not saying I can't sleep anywhere else. Thanks to school, then college and my wanted career in film, I often have to go somewhere else. However it always comes with a price: Being together with strangers, my mental health slowly declines. I have trouble sleeping, as every turning in bed, or disharmonious breathing activates my hypervigilance. Even worse: One of my big triggers is knocking on my door, which would probably happen as someone tries to wake me up. And overall, it's just the notion of time: I have to get used to a place for several days, and need to mentally prepare about the future stay, but this time it's just 1-2 days and I was asked today, when she meant *TOMORROW*!

So, I politely declined.

I feel bad. It was meant in such good spirit, so I don't have a far way home. But I know my mental health will go ham if I do.I'm experiencing this REPEATEDLY: On one side, I suffer from resting "blank" face -be it ASD or CPTSD, my face is a very stiff and emotionless 😐 face. Mix it with problems reading microexpressions and other hiccups, I often achieve an accidental uncanny valley effect. 

Throughout my life, I experienced some...colourful comments. Even as an adult, I'm not surprised to hear a colleague or co-student say "I bet she's torturing small animals in a basement somewhere", or are told "you don't look like you could love anyone, ever." Overall. I was told that my entire persona isn't really looking approachable. My family literally abandoned/disowned me over it. 

Now, if people *just* ran from me -that'd be one thing. But over the years I noticed that, as inhuman as I seem, people always seek me for help first.

This prominently includes strangers. At first, I thought it was just beggars/scammers. But many, many times, they were innocent: tourists asking for the way, lost kids, people looking for a bookshelf in the library...all up to active emergencies. Something happens, the people look around, and I'm the first to be asked for a napkin, or to call the hospital. The latest included a man in a wheelchair, who asked if he could have a few coins for water and then was visibly overjoyed when I gave him my bought water bottle, thanking me as he drank it.

According to comments online, this is because people "can just sense that you're a helpful and kind person." A similar comment was also stated by someone that had also once insisted the first point "your way just looks distant, uncaring and hateful."

&#x200B;

I'm just...confused at this point. Sure, I'm helpful and nice. I like to help out of principle. But how tf am I supposed to give off two vibes at the same time?!. For a few days, I had this shit rhythm of going to bed at 7-8am and wake up at 5-6pm. One issue was that I would find my phone, which lies near the bed normally, next to me in bed. However, I chucked this up to me subconsciously grabbing for it, then being too drousy and sleeping through the alarm.

Welp. Today, I had to wake up early. But this time, I wanted it differently.

When I want to make *really* sure that I wake up, I put my phone across the room. My apartment is small, but it makes me stand up and walk there -waking me up fully in the process. I put it behind a box too. Meaning I had to specifically aim for it. I put several alarms down. Also, it should be noticed that I live alone -so no pets, no humans to interfere.

Today I woke up. At 5pm.

As I checked for the table, my phone was missing. Instead, it was placed on the chair next to my bed. The alarms were canceled. Again.

I know that I can be a deep sleeper. And that people can be exhausted and sleep through stuff...but...how the fuck is THIS possible? Have I truly sleepwalked over there? 

&#x200B;

I'm now getting an alarm that makes me solve puzzles before stopping. But...Jesus...this is freaking me out...!. Knew this was coming, but holy shit. I feel so...scammed? Grieving?

For context: Family is a post-WW2 “Mafia” family. Aka here not meaning racism/organized crime per se, but a lot of mental issues and toxic/fucked-up dynamics that not only get tolerated, but passed down. This “culture” includes cliché shit, like “Family is everything” to the point of hiding a body and lying in court for someone. But also stuff like the concept of “mock-talk” -aka the chronic mocking of everything and everyone. Last one being mostly a gateway to comfortably share feelings/opinions, but also evolved as a bit of its own “accent”. Meaning there’s mockery in greetings, and even huge admiration is said in a special form of mockery. All in all it’s a very twisted AU of what your family is like, probably.  
  
Since I was a kid, I never really “fit” into my family. Not only am I the youngest, but also because I am…well...autistic: Too honest, taking people by their word, not displaying emotions “correctly” and even less sensing when I was annoying. Very quickly I was not only deemed “that sensitive kid”, but was/am instinctively ignored in many dynamics. Generally, I am seen as “Anitaova '': transl. Anita’s child / that one of Anita. With most family events either including me by proxy…or just straight-up asking my mother, instead of asking me directly. That said, we always managed to get along “somehow”. Especially since I was a people pleaser. 

Welp. Until shit hit the fan a few days ago:  
  
The event was my cousin’s birthday. Everyone came: Even my other cousin from far-far-away and my uncle’s first-marriage kids. The places included first a fancy lunchin at a fancy hotel/restaurant, followed by a casual cake & coffee at my aunt’s place.  
At first everything seemed normal: Smalltalk was going well, eye contact was made etc. But in comparison to normal, I had not slept for 24h. Meaning, not only was I feeling physically bad -my depression was acting up. A condition that caused me to notice all the small red-flag moments towards me: One-sided conversations, no photo of me on the family wall. Lying in the living room for 15min without anyone asking where I was/how I was. Etc.

I became quieter and quieter. Suddenly, I had no interest in sharing anything anymore -why? Anything I’d like would get mocked anyway -even when I said I hated it. No one talked to me on their own accord -so why would I bother sitting around? And if no one asked about me…why would I ask about them? I’d already shown enough. And even then, my honesty and care were already taken as "weird" per se.  
  
Anyway, this somehow led to an entire debate around my place in the family. Per se, everybody in the family thinks it’s just in my head. Not just that, they effectively turned it against *me*: The reason nobody liked to talk to me, was because I look “depressing”. Aka meaning my alexithymia of not showing emotions/emotions enough. I accused them of abandonment -but then again, did I not love them “enough” for not at least trying to logically display “correct” (NT) behavior for them? Aren’t I selfish, for immediately leaving when people don’t show enough interest in me? Hell: What did I demand love for, anyway? I never had helped anyone/gotten the family any benefits -it was always the receiving end (free food), et cetera, et cetera.  
All in all: Their idea was that I was just “obsessed” with being the victim. That because I got treated “a lil bad” when I was small, I’ve now been on a delusional power trip, where everyone is out to get me, instead of “moving on and healing”. And overall: My interests are weird, my opinions are weird, I'm too serious, too childish, too smart, too dumb...everything.  
  
Now…here’s the thing: I am very aware they’re talking crap.  
  
Maybe I inhaled too much Bluey, but from my experiences, family is meant to look after each other. Be interested in each other. Accept each other. Even before this, there was so much to unpack: If someone says “I didn’t like the pic of the killed, bleeding kitten you send me”, (yes that actually happened) then your instinct should be to respect that & apologize -not mock you for being “sooo sensitive”. With other family members sighing “welp, you need to tolerate his humor”.  
In the same sense -you’re not fucking “having your families back” by lying in court, after your cousin beat a guy to death for drinking your cousin’s beer (Has not yet happened fully, they all survived till now) -you fucking get this guy behind bars! Like that’s an actual menace to society! How tf are you so comfortable telling your 4yo to “everything is fine, just don’t be alone with him” like that?!  
  
Overall, I think I’m just finally done here. I already gave up my clinically insane parents, but for some dumb reason, I always kinda tried to still have a bond with the rest. I thought that, if I'd just create a personal connection -if I could get rid of being just "Anitova"...but now?

I can't go fully NC, because I still have many perks from them. Especially since they already turned back to "ignorant mode" and think the topic is done/don't care for the effect.

But...Jesus. The entire time...my entire fucking life.... Since I was a kid, I was told to not be "too much". Don't be expected to be asked about your day. If you care -talk about it yourself. Don't expect people to care for your interest. If they don't have it, don't talk about it. Don't expect to hear "I love you". They feed you. Isn't that enough?

As I grew, these voices changed. Now, the same thing was about relationships.

Some were fine and rational, like "don't expect to have everything be paid for" or "don't expect Mr. Perfect." But others were like a race to the bottom: Don't expect "I love you" too much -actions should count more, only expect the saying in a deeply emotional moment aka once a month, maybe. Don't expect too much romance per se: Honeymoon-period dies out quickly.  Be prettier than smart. Listen more, talk less. Any form of preference better be changeable, or you'll die alone.

Now, not every thing was said per se against me. Some things were passive: Like that Tumblr/Twitter post, about a woman, whose husband pressed her hand 3x as his "I love you", cause he didn't feel comfortable saying it. Something, which was really wholesome, sure. But seeing everyone cheer how much "words don't mean anything" made me feel very bad about myself. Because...well...

...I need that. 

I was always a linguistical person. Like, per se. I'm autistic, so my main info gathering is through what's said. My main expression is through what I say and *how* I say it. My main special interest is stories, and I love nothing more than to ramble 3h about a topic straight. My love language includes sharing info too. Sometimes just sharing random small facts. "Hey, did you know otters hold hands when asleep, to not drift away from each other?"

I'm not saying I don't care for non-verbal things. Like getting tucked in. Or someone remembering what candy I like. (Tbf, I was conditioned to believe people don't think about me, so I'm always so confused/surprised when they do.)

But having a lot of "I love you"s, getting asked about my day, being allowed to ramble and overall told, I'm not annoying? That's what makes me feel the best.Actual quotes by different people. I'm autistic, and while I dress very "normal" and try to be nice & social, people often get really, really, really fucking weird ideas about me. Too often, I don't even know until its blurted out on accident.

Most of the time I don't know how to react. I just stare at them in horror and slowly say "...no?" And the few times I managed a "...why the hell would you think that?!" (like did I do something violent or something?!) I got a flustered variation of "well, you just seemed like that type"

Now. I get WHY they say it (stupid uncanny valley). 

But -fuck! It throws me off every time! How do I handle it better?!. Since I was a kid, I loved people. NOT as in "need for validation" or "100000 friends". No, I just liked the idea of being like my grandfather: A person that just everyone knew and decently liked. Someone who still maybe just had 2 "real" friends, but fine with everyone. Going into a bar, everyone would know him by name. Just casually chatting, just sitting there -people would flock to him. Not because of specifics. Just because he was charismatic and chill.

Now, tbf, there were some things I did inherit. Mainly his effect of "just getting noticed": I had ex-classmates from primary school who recognized me a the station by name.  But other than that, I'm seen as an inverted version of my grandfather: Terrifying

It sounds so silly on paper.  I'm a short 21yo white woman with a babyface, but because of my ASD and poor social skills overall (CPTSD, isolation), I end up often looking deranged/disturbed. Esp. to strangers I'm regularly perceived as a druggie, creep, "def. has violence issues in some way", sociopath and -most common - "I can't place it. But there's just like, something really, really wrong with her!" 

I made my peace with this perception. I promise. I'm happy with the few friends I have, and got used to invest my skill in professional networking -even if I fail to gain a new friend, I at least have a new face that I know and can hit up for business. Job interviews are mostly passed with my CV.

That said...I'm still fairly sad.

I never stopped finding people interesting. Same goes for other cultures or experiences. But most of time, my biggest info-line ends up always being video-essays, or books. I struggle with connecting to actual people with different backgrounds, mostly because the amount of misunderstandings triple. And because I'm already perceived as...well...people often don't assume I'm truthful, and just some racist/homophob in disguise. Hell! I even had cases, where the OG person understood and took my apology, but I was still flagged as racist by the other members!

Again, I try to take it with black humor. Remember my grandfather? Well. Behind closed-doors, he was actually very violent, cheated on and nearly killed my grandmother. His entire close family hated him, but he's still remembered as a great guy in his village. Ain't that ironic?

&#x200B;. I have Maladaptive Daydream Disorder. Aka: Uncontrollable daydreams. It's a dissociation mechanism by the brain, often due to an unforgiving reality. Daydreams range from 1-2minutes to 30min straight sometimes.

Most MaDDs have dreams about power fantasies: Being famous, rich, having lots of friends, a better family etc. Very typical, as many MaDDs come from places of abuse and intense isolation. That said, I noticed something really, really weird about mine.

In most of my daydreams, I don't play a hero. I'm not strong, or famous, or the best. Often it's just the standard me how I help people. Not even intense shit, like dragging them from burning buildings. Often it's really small stuff. 

For one example:

Chinese Porcelain was a big export of China. This included many custom-creations for not only the west (ship motives), but the Arabian world. Because many customers were Muslim, Chinese porcelain for that market would often be green -incorporating even lines from the Quran in calligraphy style.

As I read this, I had an intense daydream about having a Muslim co-worker (I don't): In the dream, the co-worker was invited to a tea-party. Looking at the dishes, she bemoaned that she had just gotten married, but still not really found a table set she really liked. "Remembering" that info in the dream, I went into an antique shop, displaying the porcelaine from the photo. The rest/most intense part of my dream was about my co-worker unwrapping the gift. The scene was really detailed: Her eyes going wide as she took one of the plates. Covering her mouth before quickly calling over her husband to show it to him. Him taking the plate, as he read the lines, being baffled that such Chinese Porcelaine even existed. And most importantly: Both beaming with joy

Now erm...tbf, many dreams do slightly taste of a bit of "white-saviour-syndrome". But I swear! It's *not* about some condescending ideas! Here, for example, I just loved the idea of just making someone I know happy, giving them a little wholesome surprise, and y'know, maybe make them feel a little bit accepted too.

These scenarios are always very intense. Even in my fantasy-stories, I'm more interested about the idea of solving problems than beating large baddies. Like one continued daydream about my self-insert, who crashed along humans from our earth into the world of Aezeroth (WoW), and became a special diplomat for her kind. She has a fucking power-suit, and I still just imagine how to solve economical problems and culture clashes. Which is funny, since I do not really care about politics that much in RL.

&#x200B;

Idk. Maybe the energy of wishing someone would help me now turned outwards? Maybe I want to reassure me that I'm a good person? Maybe I want others to see me as a good person?  -tbf, that last one would be true, because ironically, most people think I'm fairly terrifying ha ha

&#x200B;. Growing up, my family was split into 3 parts: my parents and me, the extended family on my mother's side, and the extended family on my step-father's side. Each party was being seperate by a big distance -meaning that we could meet at most 1-2 a year. Making most meetings always a special occasion, which -to be fair -  were just about "playing family", rather than actually knowing about what was going on with other people. In my case, this included my abusive parents. It was a complicated situation, but basically, my mother was a violent psychopath who managed to terrify me into complicity, so I'd never talk. The "golden child" compared to my complicated cousins, who nice, polite and obedient, and most importantly: Kept very, very quiet.

As time went on, I slowly managed to pull away. But even though I accepted my parent's "death", I still craved family. After I realized that my mother's side was like my mother just a "chip of the ol' post-WW2 block", rampant with insanity, violence and more, I drifted my focus to an entirely other side: The side of my father.

The family of my Step-father was the extreme opposite. Small, mainly consisting of my (now late) grandmother, his brother and two sisters. Including my aunt "Nina". 

At first everything went well. Especially with my younger cousin's birth, I would keep contact regularly. I would send elaborate presents, and hold many phone calls. My aunt would gladly accept these things. After a divorce, and my older cousin moving out, she was basically a single mother now, which wasn't made easier by her light disability due to a messy birth. And again: I was her "nice, happy niece" after all.

As time went on, things started to slowly change though. Experiencing more and more "loss" and realizations, my inner child started to crave "family" more and more. My familiar mask started to fall. Things started to slip. For example, I confessed I was not my step-father's child -a I was the product of my mother's affair, but kept as a lie for his mother to believe. I confessed I have autism/ADHD. Slowly losing my repression of my stimming. And, of course, worst of all, I started to open up more and more about my experiences. Never going "too far", but still trauma dumping smaller, though still horribly traumatic experiences I had growing up.

Now it was my Aunt Nina's moment to feel uncomfortable. Even more, she slowly caught onto my obsession with my baby cousin. Not in an "inappropriate" way -I'm not a monster! The opposite actually: Due to my horrid childhood, I projected heavily onto my baby cousin. An ironic situation, where I would both be obsessed with giving her "the perfect childhood", while also not knowing how a happy childhood looked like.  Even when I learned to just go along, things often clashed, as my cousin ironically hated everything that she considered "not normal". Ranging from Ghibli/fantasy movies up to me "drawing better than her". Even her "I love you"s are more of a script-reply at this point.

Aunt Nina started to visibly give up. I guess she sensed where I was coming from, but it didn't help. In the last months, she slowly stopped ignoring my texts. Even utterly rejecting my phone call a few hours ago.  

&#x200B;

Honestly. I'm not mad at her. Actually, I knew I was acting wrong. One thing you learn about CPTSD, is that most people are not equipped to deal with trauma. Till a few years ago, I had been only a vague picture of a relative, which perception I had steamrolled completely in a very short time. 

I knew it was wrong. I knew it was inappropriate. I just couldn't stop. Always clinging to the magical thinking of family, I started to get more and more greedy. Demanded more and more  warmth and love I never got growing up. I never wanted to hurt anyone. I was just so...so...*so hungry.*

Through all of this, I was never oblivious to my actions. Opposite, actually: Knowing from personal experience, I knew that my aunt was too much of a people pleaser to ever outright reject me. Playing on the fact we were family "caring too much" or "sharing emotions" are generally not considered reasons to cut somebody off, without looking like a bad guy. Other times, I felt what I did was justified: Family is MEANT to care for family, ain't it? And as she said herself, she had noticed very early that something was wrong from the way I acted as a kid -why did she never call CPS? Why never take me aside and ask if I needed help? That I could always come? Anything. *Anything!*

I'm crying and laughing rn. I've always been fine with the idea of my baby cousin not liking me. As long as she grows up happy, I'm fine. But being rejected by my aunt still hurts in a way I can't describe. 

I'm sorry. So sorry.

I just wanted a family.

I'm sorry.

I just wanted to be loved. Dumb quote, but it still hurts.

Basically. I'm autistic and love to make films. As I was prepping for another film, I got into a little bit of magical thinking, of what I'd do if I somehow became rich and famous. One of these things included the title. Just some potential info-point, where autistic adults could go to get ressources, instead of it all being reserved for autistic children.

The quote was said by my father. Now tbf, I already knew he was a hypocrite: After I was diagnosed, my father completely lost himself in the idea of being autistic too, but refused any testing (free here), because he just hates doctors. No bad experiences. Just a conspiracy nut. Even worse: He never read anything about ASD. Instead going after the media "Sheldon" example -even going so far as to claim autism as "the new step of evolution", "a superpower" and the clich´´e "not a disorder, just a different way of thinking". Obviously, all of my arguments ran into a wall with him. And obv. my family is taking his side, because "well, he's autistic too. He can have a different opinion." even though he hasn't done shit research AT ALL!

So I guess I got a bit surprised when he said that. Ranting all about how autism was the best thing since sliced bread...now saying I should fucking hide myself from it.

Like...completely: I should NEVER tell anyone I was autistic. Not in my personal life. Not in my career. Just this fearmongering rant, about how nobody would like, or hire me once they thought I was "nuts" and "mentally r\*\*\*\*ded". Completely rejecting the idea that anything has ever changed since fucking lobotomies. Or that the film industry ironically isn't a stranger to autistic creators.

Overall, it shows the hypocrisy and internalized ableism he truly has. But...man. That shit gave me  whiplash. My Hypervigilance is killing me about this: Today, I was standing in a mall. I had picked up some stuff between errands, including some sunscreen, which I had forgotten to apply. As I did, I saw a man in a wheelchair rolling towards me: He was older, seemingly overweight, with no shoes, visible bag or companion.  As he approached me, he asked if I had change. He explained that he had been scooting in \[part of my city\] the entire day, and wanted to buy some water.  A sentence which made me ***immediately*** peak up.

You see: Where I live, we got a lot of "organized begging". Aka, mostly poor immigrants ("beggar-slaves") who, like prostitution,  work for a "pimp" that collects the money. It's a very known problem, as its often not just a symptom of human trafficking, but blurs the trust in beggars per se, especially as many venture into active scam/pickpocket-territory. Like. We even have individual train-station announcements for that. Furthermore, being autistic, "weird looking", a slight people pleaser and a young girl, I hence got very used to being seen as the "perfect target" by lots of assholes. So I'm not saying this, to be an asshole.

But this time...this time *something* was different.

1. The man was not a typical beggar-slave. While not a rule, most beggar-slaves are not white, nor do those that move around, use wheelchairs
2. The man wasn't lying. I remembered seeing him at a bus station at \[part of my city\] that he mentioned.
3. There was an empty, way too small apple-juice bottle next to him in a holder. A potential prop, sure, but also potential proof that he potentially misjudged the actual heat outside.

At first, I instinctively answered "Sorry. I never carry change with me" -("No. Go away"). But then, I just...looking at the numbers...I kinda felt bad. So, I offered to buy him water instead. ("Do you really want water, or money?"). The man looked a little down (embarrased?) and replied "That'd be very nice".

At this point, I kinda just got overwhelmed.  In the end, I internally sighed and gave it a gamble. I pulled out the bottle of water I had bought before. "Ah, wait! I already bought one!" The man thanked me, taking the bottle, opening it immediately and drinking from it. I played it off ("It's fine, it's way too hot outside, eh?"). He mumbled something along "Yes. And well. You can see I'm not the healthiest either.", as I slowly said goodbye, basically fleeing into a nearby pharmacy. 

5min later, the man was gone. Along with the water bottle.

&#x200B;

It's been a few hours since then. In hindsight, I'm 84% sure that the man was a true beggar. Or at least, person down on his luck.

In that sense, I still hate moments like these. Again: Not because I'm a pretentious asshole. It's because I'm clinically paranoid. I LOVE helping people. I HATE seeing people being sad, or in pain. Especially those that are visibly "other" like me. As a child, my mother literally refused to walk certain streets with me, as I would always insist to give a coin to any beggar sitting there. But, obviously, with time, this nature of mine was quickly abused by countless shitty people (not just fake beggars). 

Ah well. Even if he was a scammer. At least he's hydrated.. My friend (22F) had stomach pains for years. It was always a mystery to why: The doctors could never find any tumor, or other reason. The pains were nearly identical to a migraine, just in stomach form: Random, nearly without trigger, and debilitating up to 2-3 hours. In the end, the doc's concluded it was most likely something psychological, rather than physical.

Due to this, my friend's entire life got turbod: Leaving school early, she couldn't hold any internship. It didn't matter if she was stressed or happy. If it was a job or a hangout. She tried to get help at our job center, but not only did they not help her -she was told she couldn't even apply to disability benefits, cause she was "too young" (you gotta be 25years where I live).

My friend basically collapsed. While she still has a place & food with her father, she feels very helpless per se. Most of the jobs here are not really made for remote working. She's also going to therapy and potentially willing to learn some new skills.

Any tips? What remote jobs work for you?. Der Titel klingt dumm, ist aber traurig: Meine Freundin "S" (22F) hockt seit Jahren in der Klemme. Schon in der Schule leidete S. unter mysteriösen Bauchschmerzen und fehlte regelmäßig wegen Arztbesuchen. Von Dok zu Dok geschoben, waren die Symptome ähnlich einer Migräne: Keine ersichtlichen Trigger, zufällig, aber immer extrem heftig und lang. Schlussendlich wurde gefolgert, dass es ein psychosomatisches Bild sein musste. Eine logische Folgerung, denn meine 'große Schwester' kam wie ich aus zerrissenen Verhältnissen. Auch ich habe ein gewisses Level an Reizdarm, aufgrund meiner K-PTBS.

Jetzt traf es S. jedoch schlimmer als ich: Während ich es schaffte halbwegs die Schule abzulegen, zu studieren und mich mit Jobs über Wasser zu halten, fiel S. flach. Nachdem sie die Schule abbrach, versuchte sie sich nach einer Weile an einer Ausbildung. Diese wurde, leider, jedoch aus gleichen Gründen abgebrochen. Egal welches Medikament, egal wie fröhlich und ungestresst, egal welche Uhrzeit -oft konnte sie einfach nicht kommen, weil sie sich fast nicht vom Bett wegbewegen konnte.

Natürlich versuchte S. nicht aufzugeben: Sie ging zum Arbeitsamt. Doch nicht nur konnte das hier nicht helfen (kein wirklicher Abschluss, keine Ausbildung), ihr wurde ein Behindertenstatus verwehrt, da sie "noch zu jung" (u.25J) sei.  Ab diesem Punkt gab meine Freundin sichtlich auf. Bis heute verbringt sie ihre Hauptzeit entweder zu Hause, oder in Theraphie.

Jetzt is es so: Ich weiß sehr wohl, dass man niemanden "retten" kann. Das probier ich auch nicht.

*Jedoch* brichts mir natürlich das Herz, dass sie nicht mal ne Möglichkeit findet. Es wäre schön wenn sie zumindest mögliche "Home office" o.ä. Teilzeit/Gig Dinger haben könnte. Nochmal: Es ist nicht, dass sie nicht arbeiten will. Vorrausgesetzte Talente könnte sie sich bestimmt anlernen. Und sie kann auch an Tagen arbeiten (Schmerzen reichen bis max. 2-3h). Es ist nur dass sie nicht in die "normale Arbeitswelt" mit ihrem Rhythmus passt.

Irgendwelche Tipps? 

Oder zumindest Anlaufstellen mit Tipps?. Recently, I stumbled upon a specific online shop. Not plugging them here, so let's just say: It's run by the creator of a semi-famous game. As I was browsing, I came across a special series of plushies: Rabbits, made to represent physical, as well as mental health issues + ND types.

At first, I wasn't very in awe. Everyone knows that mental health is currently "en trend". But then I realized not only how fucking epic the designs were, but just how many were represented! Ngl, seeing Maladaptive Daydreaming, Dissociation and -yes- PTSD represented made feel really bittersweet. On one side -I love that shit. On the other side, it feels very questionable to use mental health issues to sell plushies. Even more: The fact that I get so hyped over a plushy, simply because we have so little representation/acceptance, is just...yeah. Just shows that things really got to be better.

But anyway. What's your opinion? Would you feel like such stuff is a shitty play, or would you even say it furthers the normalization and acceptance (of some sorts)?.Im not christian but me and my wife have recently started going to a Christian church in order to find our spirituality. 

For context, both my son and my sister have autism.

Me and this friend were having lunch together and I was telling him about my son. And how I love spending time with him, and the little quirks he has. 

Then my friend tells me he felt God had just sent him a message (he does this sometimes). And God let him know that this is a hereditary curse and that I need to "pray a lot"  because it can go to my new baby (my wife is pregnant) if im not careful. 

I was so shocked, I honestly didn't even know how to react.

He saw my face and immediately apologized.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say your son and sister are a curse..". I told him it was fine, im not offended by it. And we kept talking about other things.

I still dont know how to feel about it. But I love my kid and my sister, and I wouldn't want it any other way. Because I absolutely love them for who they're. I dont see their existence as a "lesson" or a curse to anyone, they're their own people and should be accepted as any other person should.

I feel guilty for not saying this to him, but I was too shocked to say anything. Also I tend to avoid conflict. I still plan on talking to him about it. But I wanna know more about what other Christians think about hereditary curses, and if the bible says anything about it.Im not christian and I still don't know how to feel about what happened.

I know there is a lot of stigma about Christians, with the "holier then thou" shit. But I can vouch for my friend,  he is actually a kind hearted man. I know this. He is just completely brainwashed with this stuff. It seems he doesn't even think for himself sometimes, he's too scared to go to hell.

This stuff he told me about hereditary autism curse is nuts and I still dont know how to feel about it. But I love my kid and my sister, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

I feel guilty for not saying this to him, but I was too shocked to say anything. Also I tend to avoid conflict and I know it wouldn't change his mind anyways, so whats the point. Still feel guilty though.Im not christian and I still don't know how to feel about what happened.

Still feel guilty though.I've waited years for this and just took my first injection yesterday!! I went through planned Parenthood and it was so EASY!! They were very nice and helpful.  For reference I'm 20 and have been out for the past 2 and a half years ish, but have known something was "off" since puberty hit around 11.So I'm plus size and have trouble binding. I've posted before about trouble binding due to some rib issues so I've not decided to try trans tape. I got some kt tape to try it out and ended up using the whole roll. For instance I'm a dd possibly DDD without About a 40 band. It's not very flat but it's more then I imagined it would be. I'll post a before and after picture on a different post so y'all can see. But is there any tips y'all have? So maybe I DONT use a whole roll EVERYTIME. I'm really happy though because I can finally bind without extreme rib pain!!. Hey guys. So me being trans isn't fully integral to this but I feel it's important. I practically live with my partner and their parents due to my living situation with my family not being good (hoarder house and my family does not believe I'm trans). My partner is amazing about me being trans and that is not the issue here. We're both Audhd (autistic and ADHD) a long with a multitude of other disorders between the two of us including OCD, BPD, and PTSD. I hate it, but I rely on my partner a lot. They drive me to school because I have trauma from a car accident and my parents havwnt been able to fix my car yet. They provide a lot of my food because they get more money then I do (we both donate plasma but they also get checks from the government for school). They also emotionally support me with my trauma and so much more. I'm so greatful for them and I definitely don't say it enough. 
But I've been struggling with violent impulsive thoughts as of late. I'm back on ADHD medication as of today though so hopefully that stops. I have been unable to control myself and have thrown a shoe at my partner (did not hit them) and ran over their heels with a cart. I'm so disappointed in myself and don't know what to do. We got into an argument today (similar to others) but it got more heated then usual. We both try to be good about communicating how we felt and what we can do to fix it after these arguments but they all boil down to me being heavily autistic. 

The argument we had was about window clings and the definition of stickers. We had been talking about bumper stickers and they said "I'd want a sticker but like where the picture is the sticky side and put it on a window" I responded mentioning window clings but was not calling them stickers (they technically aren't) and once they understood what window clings were they said "oh, so a sticker" I said "well, kinda" and then they got pissed off (they had been upset the whole time) and we debated on the definition of a sticker for a bit. Then I looked up the definition and read it to them (something I do on a regular basis whether I'm wrong or not) and it proved my point. Then (we were at a gas station) they left and slammed their door really hard. We have since talked about it and figured everything out but they said some things that stuck with me 

"I've thought about breaking up with you in the heat of the moment a few times before. But the main reason I don't is because I know you'd be screwed"

"I know these things aren't your fault but sometimes you just say the wrong things at the wrong time" 

I asked them to clarify on how I would know when the wrong time was and they were unsure. 

I have a lot of trouble reading social cues but I've been trying to do better for my partner. I also have to follow things by definition a lot of the time (in this case adhesive and sticker. In other cases a few and a couple {I know there's more but I can't think of any}

 This relationship means a lot to me, and not because of all the do for me and help me with (but that is a plus).  we've been together for over 2 and a half years. We've built so much together, been through so much and they've always been by my side. I hope I'm just as much a rock for them as they are for me. 

Is there anything y'all can think of for me to do to be better? Is what they said about the relationship a red flag (about either of us)? I want to be better for them and have looked online multiple times before. I'm hoping my medication helps (ADHD meds (for impulsivity and memory issues) and depression meds) but we shall see, I legit started taking them today) if y'all have any tips please tell me.Hey y'all so as the title says I found a newly dead hummingbird on the ground near my school the other day. It's been 2 days since and he's still where I moved him (he was on the sidewalk but I moved him into some grass since we were in a hurry). I want to take him home to either bury him or get preserve him in some way but I have no idea how to or if I should. I'm aware that hummingbirds are under the Migratory Bird Act but he's not a ruby throated one so idk. What do y'all think?. Hey y'all, my name is Saturn (thinking about changing it though) and I need some help in the binding area. Everytime I use a binder it hurts the HELL out of my ribs. I have broken my ribs before but didn't start wearing a binder till it was fully healed to my knowledge. Then once I started wearing my binder it would hurt my ribs pretty regularly. I have a large chest and a LARGE amount of dysphoria related to it. I don't know what to do. Should I go to a doctor to see if my ribs are okay (they also hurt out of the binder after I bind)? Should I just keep binding and make sure to take it off when it hurts? What should I do????.My (F/22) autistic partner (M/22) admitted that he does not think that I am attractive. We have been together for 2 years and have talked about how he doesn’t give me compliments about my appearance in the past. Recently this was brought up again because of something indirectly related that he said that made me very upset. He says that I look fine when I’m dressed up nicely, but otherwise he’s not going to lie and tell me I’m pretty when most of the time when we are together, I look like I need to shower. I do admit that I shower every other day, but otherwise maintain good hygiene and try to take care of my appearance. I also have always had the perception that I am conventially attractive enough because of how I am treated in public, though I don’t really care for anyone else’s opinion of how I look other than my bf’s. 
This was very hurtful to hear and made me question why he would even want to be in a relationship with me if he’s not attracted to me? There are other things that he expresses that he likes about me that aren’t physical attributes, but maybe as a woman in A Society, I derive so much of my sense of value from my looks. What is the difference between how he sees me and how he sees a friend then? I am not on the spectrum myself so sometimes it is difficult for me to understand his thought process. Is he just being an a-hole or is it something that I don’t understand?
UPDATE:
Hi guys thank you for the advice. I didn’t know this would be an issue that would spark so much discourse, but just wanted to clarify some things. Perhaps I painted him in a more negative light due to my feelings when typing out the original post, but did not mean to imply that he had to either be autistic or an a-hole/that those things were mutually exclusive. We discussed this further and my partner said that what he likes about me is my intelligence and the things we do together. He does experience physical attraction to others and expresses the desire to be perceived as attractive as well, but personally doesn’t care for physical appearances in his partners.
Clearly this answer was unsatisfactory for me if I still feel hurt, but I do try to actively fight the internalized sense of my gender role because beauty is subjective and transient. This logic doesn’t prevent the emotions I have attached to my appearance, but it does help me regulate them to some degree. I will just need to determine for myself whether that is an emotional need that I require from my partner moving forward.I have bipolar II (taking mood stabilizers) and my partner had not really interacted with anyone else that has diagnosed bipolar before they met me. I know there are times where I can be unbearable with my fits of manic or depressive chaos, but one thing that I can’t seem to do is figure out how my partner can help. Taking my medication consistently and sticking to a daily routine help me to stay pretty stable most of the time, but there are times where I slip up and fully lean into my manic or depressed episode. They always ask me (once I’ve calmed down) how they can be there for me when these things happen, but I never know what to say. I know it makes them feel helpless, so I’d like to give them some solace by having a go-to plan on how to deal with me in that state.
If you have had a similar dilemma, what has worked for you and your partner?.I went to the psychiatrist and asked my friend to help me explain that i suspect me being autistic because of all autistic traits I possess and my struggles with everyday social life. And then he (psychiatrist) started acting very rude and asking strange questions about my IQ, why I haven’t gone to the university yet, why am I not speaking for myself if I’m 19yo adult etc.

I felt how my eyes were slowly turning wet and I just completely went silent and couldn’t say a word. I stopped listening at all and tried to calm down but then my friend took me out of the room and said that they finished. I ran to the dark corner and just burst in tears in my hoodie to not being too loud. I was sitting there for 15 minutes and refused to talk to anyone after.

I feel like a piece of shit now, walking down the street on my way home silently crying.

My friend said she signed me for more polite appointment with the psychologist (not psychiatrist) but now I just can’t trust people at all after this experience.

I really appreciate her support, I couldn’t go through that without her but I’m really feeling bad now. I just want to lock myself in my room and don’t talk to anyone.

Thanks for reading.So, I always had troubles with determination of left and right directions or parts of an object and I wonder if it has anything to do with my autism or is it just me.

I can tell which direction is something only after processing for some time and never just intuitively say it without thinking. Same for the cardinal directions, especially west and east. I need to draw an imaginary cross to compare it to the map before I can answer or continue talking.

That results in my struggles with driving ‘cause I just can’t quickly react to the instructor’s commands of which way should I turn. So, I think I’ll never be able to drive a car… Which makes me really sad.

Anyway, I just wanted to know if someone here also struggling with left-right or west-east directions.For many years I can’t overstep myself to go to the psychologist and discuss my autism with a real specialist because I’m really scared of any social interactions, especially that kind like doctors, teachers, etc

I know that I’m autistic but I’m not diagnosed. I really want to make it, well, like an official thing ‘cause it will help me with many problems I face everyday and hopefully my family will understand me better after it becomes official

But I just can’t do this by myself, I’m too scared and I don’t know how to do it: how to make an appointment, what to say and how to behave - it all gives me shivers when I just think of all this stuff

Also my parent won’t take me to psychologist in any circumstances because they don’t believe I’m autistic although many doctors told them that I might be on the spectrum judging by my behavior back when I was a little kid

Now I’m nearly 19yo and I just can’t survive in any social situations, even the most primitive like go buy some food in the grocery store because there are scary cashiers that I need to talk to when I don’t want to and don’t know how

I really want to go to the psychologist but I don’t know what to do - I just want someone to take me there so I won’t panic too much in uncomfortable and unfamiliar situation but I don’t have anyone to do this…

Maybe there’s a way to overcome this fear and become a little more independent and confident but I can’t come up with anything

Anyway, thanks for paying attention and reading all this mess.It was “dark humor”. hello, i use [medal.tv](https://medal.tv) to capture play sessions but my vtol recordings dont have audio, i can hear audio in game tho, thanks!. Yep, the title, our school is forcing us to learn Islamic prayers(Turkey), I am fing livid since I do not believe in Islam and refuse to say something that contradicts it(aka nearly every darn prayer in the religion, calling it “culture” my ass, then being gay and ex before marriage is my culture, why don’t they teach that? It is culture after all, I would be kind of ok with it since Turkey is a majority Muslim country, but one of the subjects this year is “There is no force in religion” what the hell is this than jackass? I’m not doing it voluntarily am I, look, if you believe in it yourself that’s fine, but don’t force it on me or others dumbass.

That’s kind of it really, just a vent. I saw the thread where a dad was asking what he could do for his son, huge respect to him, I wish I didn’t have parents that ridiculed me whenever I open another video of Scott Manley, I would consider myself a seasoned KSP player, can go to anywhere in the kerbol system and back, and to other stars with mods, I don’t understand the maths as much, I understand basic stuff like the rocket equation, I also understand newton’s laws( at least the ones that are important for KSP ), I would like to take this further for myself and am here to ask for help, what do you lads recommend? And also if you see this u/KenjaTaimu09 buy him a snack and tell my friend it was sent by a fellow KSP nerd :)

TL;DR I want some advice on improving my mathematics and physics understanding. I have seen people referring to their unusually cold hands and feet a lot in this community, i suspect autism a lot and also have extremely cold hands, feet and nose, to the point people tell mo not to touch them due to how uncomfortable the cold makes them, even in scorching hot weather, i cant really find any solid source to back this up, so i came here to ask y'all, my (probably)fellow autists!. I keep finding myself nibbling on stuff, whether it be my headphone wires or even the inside of my own mouth, i dont think this is associated with autism in particular(or it may be, i guess its stimming in a way), but i do strangely find it... relaxing? I dont know what this is, but its gotten bad to the point where the inside of my mouth is covered in wounds and my headphone wire covering has giant holes, hell sometimes i get nauseous from the headphone wire but i just cannot stop, please help!. I cannot stand brushing teeth, the water the tooth paste, the insanely cold water, the toothbrush rubbing on your teeth, gum and lips, it’s so unpleasant, not to say I don’t do it because I have to, but i generally spend those 2 minutes wishing I didn’t have to brush teeth, I was wondering if this was a common problem for you people too.I realized when I’m masking and trying my hardest to appear “normal” I don’t usually stim, as it’s seen as “weird”, so I do much worse things, biting the inside of my cheek, biting my nails, biting my tongue, something that I can do while appearing “normal” or have it be not visible at all, which results in my mouth being covered in wounds, and for people telling me to just not mask, I live in a country where people are not aware what an ND person is, so often we’re alienated and singled out, unmasking is simply not an option, how do I stim while acting normal without hurting myself?. So I’ve been browsing ADHD and autism subs lately, I’ve done a lot of research and have come to the conclusion I am likely Autistic+ADHD, however whenever I don’t relate to a meme about the disorders I feel like I’m faking it somehow even though i have no intention to, I got stressed over that a lot, so I want to calm down by reading what some of y’all have to share, shower me with the most obscure facts of your special interests!

Edit: Autism+ADHD in denial, however it is hard for me to deny something when it effects how your brain works. The right click in my Logitech G300s mouse started to go bad, i have to apply force to the button if i have to hold it down for more than 2 seconds, otherwise it just flickers, i read something about the switches going bad after a while in a forum page and you need to replace them with the switches of another button, tho this requires tools i don t have, any easier fix to this?. So schools are about to open in my country and i have to do the homework assigned during the summer break(yes they do that here), but i just cant bring myself to do it, it have been staring at the papers for 2 hours now, i have eaten ice cream, watched a documentary about space and browsed reddit for a bit all while staring at the paper and feeling a sense of dread, i know this is not healthy or good for me but i cannot even, any help?. I realized there are holes in the rubber around the wires of my headphones and have been biting my fingernails recently, I genuinely don’t know why, help would be appropriated. I have been questioning more and more about if I have it and/or ADHD, I have said to myself that I probably have it, but again, I feel like those self diagnosed fakers on TikTok or something, they infuriate me as much as the next person but I cannot help but doubt myself on it, if I am somehow subconsciously faking it, i cannot get a professional opinion, because my parents “don’t believe in mental health”, I have tried to open up about depression in the past and they made my life hell for months, to “toughen me up” that led to me almost attempting suicide, I don’t want to go that route again, I know I’m just babbling on and on, I just want to know if anyone has bee through this before.Why can’t people just fucking call someone when they get to someone’s house? Why does the whole neighborhood have to listen to you smashing that car horn!? GET OFF YOUR ASS AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR IF YOU GOTTA! After the tenth fucking time THEY EITHER DONT CARE OR THE ARE TOO FUCKIN OLD TO HEAR YOU!. Does anyone else get frustrated because they can feel their heart pump through the veins in their legs and feet? I have those sweet, sweet sensory issues and I’m terrified of bugs. It took me months to finally realize that I didn’t feel bugs crawling on my feet and it was actually the feeling of my heartbeat in the veins near my ankle bone. Does anyone else deal with this? It feels twitchy and itchy sometimes and it’s just annoying. 

Additionally, I get irritated by the feeling of my leg hairs moving against my skin though that’s something I’ll have to deal with cause shaving is a nightmare. That prickly feeling haunts my dreams.Bout a decade ago, I (18f at the time, now 28nb. I am also autistic) was working my first job as a utilities worker at Kroger, a grocery store for those unfamiliar. That day we were in the middle of a month long Hispanic food-campaign-thing. We were allowed to wear tshirts that on the back said “It’s delicioso!” Which unfortunately comes into play. I hated the feeling of polos, so I wore the tshirts everyday. 

I was putting back items people had returned in line when a old couple walked up beside me. I wasn’t paying attention, trying to find where to put back a jar when the old man grabbed my wrist. Didn’t say anything, just grabbed me and pulled my hand up to his mouth. Acting like he was about to bite me. I pulled my arm away and just kinda cradled it my chest, probably looking completely terrified cause I was. 

Then they both just started laughing and the guy said “your shirt said delicioso, so I wanted to make sure!” I remember both of them smiling and looking at each other like it was some playful joke. I was so scared I was barely keeping it together, trying not to cry. I ended up just grabbing my cart and running away to hide in the back. I was back there for about ten minutes before I could pull myself together enough to go back to working. 

I was only able to stay at that store for another month before I quit. And no, I didn’t end up reporting it, though I wish I had. I was just so shook up, it took me a good few years to even talk about it.About fifteen or so years ago I was at Walmart with my dad. I would always want to go to the electronics sections to look at games and cds. So when we were in that area of the store he would let me look around by myself. Back then I was about 5’6 so I was taller than the normal twelve year old, but I distinctly remember wearing a camo tshirt and some khakis (middle school uniform pants, I didn’t like jeans back then). 

I’d been looking at some cds when a couple walked up to me asking for help finding something. I was frozen there for a second, holding a cd in my hand and I looked down. Camo shirt and khakis, I was very confused. I looked back at them and just said “I’m twelve.” 

They both looked at me with blank expressions before they turned around and walked away. I just kinda stood there for a moment in confusion before I went back to browsing. 

As someone so anxious, I’ll be lost in a store for hours before asking for help, that still confounds me.I can't tell anyone I know but I can tell you, anonymous internet.  My husband did a DNA test about six years ago in hopes of finding his older half-brother who was placed for adoption.  He also filed with NY state's adoption registry.  Obviously after all this time, we kind of gave up hope. 

But, yes!  A couple of weeks ago, my husband received a letter that his brother had also filed with the registry, and it included a final notice to consent that he had notarized and returned.  He's excited but also ... well, there's a lot of emotions!

That he has an older brother has been a very hushed family secret.  Personally I don't think it's a shameful thing, but my mil is a very caring and sensitive person, and it was one of the hardest things she's done in her life.  I think she also regretted it.  I hope they all can find some closure.  

Thank you for letting me finally spill!. Hi!  I've been lurking here for a week or so, and learning so much!  My young adult daughter has recently been diagnosed with celiac, and I'm trying to learn what I can to help her adjust.  She's a very picky eater due to tastes as well as textures, and her main safe food is:  you guessed it, gluten!

She doesn't eat much in the way of veggies and eats very little meat.  She eats dairy and cashews for protein and pretty much carbs and snacks otherwise.  But picky eaters, please inform me of the foods that have helped you make the switch!  

We live in the midwest and do not have a Whole Foods or Trader Joe's anywhere near us, but between Walmart, Aldi, and online, I hope to help her find out what makes this easier.  I'm also hoping to go gluten free myself in solidarity, though she no longer lives with me.  Thank you!. I'm really enjoying this.  I manage a community garden and for whatever reason, we have several nd volunteers.  They are all amazing people!  It's so easy to understand each other, work styles and communication styles.  I feel I can manage well, and they seem to feel free enough to unmask and be their authentic selves.  Yay!

I recently started working on a big project with someone.  I told her after our first meeting that my intentions are quite positive, but that I'm also autistic, so if anything should come up that doesn't feel positive or is confusing, please let me know because it's not my intention to offend her.  She laughed and said she's adhd, her brother is autistic, and she was so glad to know I am autistic, because WE all work better when we work with each other.  It's been a wonderful experience for me!. I manage a community garden with 51 raised beds.  The beds are made of pine, as that is what we could afford at the time.  Our garden has been rather successful and we are receiving more donations, and are thinking about upgrading into something more long-term as our initial beds are coming to the end of their expected life span.

I'm looking at both cedar and metal.  For our location I can get cedar boards for about $100/4' x 8' bed, plus fasteners.  I have zero experience with metal beds, but just looking on amazon, some with good reviews are about $60 each.

My concern with metal is that it's pretty darn hot here in the summer (5b/6a midwest).  If you've gardened in metal beds, has this been an issue for you  Also, they look kind of flimsy, and I am skeptical that they do indeed last longer than cedar.  But again, no direct experience here.

I think I know what I'm getting into with cedar beds, but am looking for folks to share their experience with raised metal beds.  Thanks!. I manage a community garden and this is year 2 for our Concord grapes.  We have a few grape clusters and I decided to try one to see what it tasted like, even though it was green.  To my surprise, it was sweet and juicy--totally ripe. I've not grown grapes before to know if this is normal, or maybe the nursery sent us the wrong kind of grapes?  Please share your grape knowledge and opinions.  Thanks!. From capitolfax.com:

During a raucous press conference today,  the teenage girl’s father admitted  that **she was not kicked off the  team** and that he refused a meeting with the Y because he could not bring   others with them, including a leader of an anti-trans group.  And the girl told reporters today that she **never saw the person in a state of undress**, so we don’t really  even know if the person was born a biological male.  The father would  not allow her to answer questions about whether she felt threatened or  if the person was leering at her. The YMCA issued a statement about this.[https://youtube.com/shorts/YbULctwWgDk?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/YbULctwWgDk?feature=share)  Took a video of our second year prairie at our community garden this morning (technically still spring, I know).  We've had about a half inch of rain in the last five weeks.  The grass is brown, the beds are watered every other day.  But this has had no supplemental water and is thriving.

(despite the prevalence of nsfw posts on reddit, this one is, promise!  I also won't rick roll ya.....promise!). Starting bid is $45,000.  Word is squatters have lived there for quite some time and part of the deal is taking possession of the home.  


[https://newschannel20.com/news/local/decaturs-powers-mansion-back-on-auction-block-after-failed-301750-sale](https://newschannel20.com/news/local/decaturs-powers-mansion-back-on-auction-block-after-failed-301750-sale). I know a lot of folks here have a vision of what they expect of their children after finishing high school, and that is often college.  I'm all for reading your stories about how wonderful our kids do in college.  But I also wanted to bring up that not every kid is going to college, and we can still be proud of our kids and proud of their accomplishments.

My oldest was never much into STEM or history or sit-down school in general.  We unschooled and she leaned heavily toward the arts.  As an older teen she struggled a lot with mental health issues after the death of a close friend and a birth parent.  Her adult work experiences started off with two highly toxic workplaces which worsened her mental health struggles.

Finally she's gotten into a retail space she really enjoys, and after less than a year has been offered a promotion into management.  Y'all she's making more than I am! (I run a nonprofit.)  Not only is she doing well financially but she's also at peace.  She likes what she does and has great coworkers.  To me, that is success.

I'm just putting this out to say, not every kid is going to college, and that's fine.  I measure success in satisfaction with what we do in our days.  And even though I make less money than my kid, I also feel successful because I love what I do.  

May all of our kids be successful, however that looks for them!. I just saw that Illinois is opening up a program, HFA1, to provide $10k in down payment and closing cost assistance for low income home buyers.  

Sure, moving to the flyover states is not for everyone, but if you've been thinking of moving to a blue state with a low cost of living, Illinois is ideal.  (Talking downstate here, not Chicago for affordability.)

I know my neighborhood also provides up to $20k in downpayment assistance for first responders buying a house in our neighborhood, and we cannot be the only neighborhood who has incentive programs like this.  There are a slew of communities throughout downstate Illinois with decent housing and jobs, with several mid-sized cities slowly revitalizing in the wake of the post-industrial exit of manufacturing.

I'm offering this info for people who are tired of the rat race and may have the funds to move, and yes, I know it isn't a simple solution for all poor people.  But it's a solution for \*some\* poor people.  I live in a 2200 sf house with a backyard in a walkable neighborhood with two parks, a community garden, sculpture garden, community apple orchard, and am within walking distance to downtown and two business districts, for less than $500/month (insurance and taxes included).  

It breaks my heart reading stories of people working so hard just to survive due to high costs of living.  Maybe this is an option for you?. For those of you entering the garden season, how is it going?  I'd love to hear your stories!

We are in the midst of an emerging drought, and that has been a challenge as we've had to water a lot, taking time away from planting, weeding, and other projects.  But I'm thankful we have a spigot and helping hands to share the work.

We've had amazing success with redistributing donated seedlings this year.  I asked after a couple of fundraiser plant sales, as well as asking nurseries to donate their annual seedlings after June 1.  One donated a ton of native perennials as well.  We've had well over 500 seedlings available for gifting to our community.  We're in an inner city neighborhood, and we've had a lot of people turning to gardening with EBT funds being cut drastically recently.

We're getting a second shed built as our programming needs are outgrowing our current storage.  Children's programming starts next week and last week was the start of our weekly free farmers markets.  The free 300 sf strawberry U-pick has been thriving (with supplemental watering) and our raspberries are just starting to turn color.  I've been moving beyond my normal comfort zone in requesting corporate donations, and meeting with potential big funders.  

And I'm so tired y'all.  I've had two days completely off since May 1, and I'm still spinning plates while running this marathon.  But I'm enjoying the heck out of it!. Here's a video my kid made with his concept that he asked me to share with you.  He doesn't have a reddit account, but I've been sharing all the great stuff here!

[https://youtu.be/AHIzjYgB-XE](https://youtu.be/AHIzjYgB-XE). Hi!  I'm having an issue with my garden soil and drip irrigation.  I was unable to get any feedback on the drip side, so I'm hoping y'all soil nerds\* might be able to provide insight.

I run a community garden with a test run of drip irrigation.  The soil is in a raised bed and usually pretty decent quality.  We've had an unusual drought this spring, and we've used supplemental watering.  

I noticed yesterday the drip beds are in bad shape.  The soil is like concrete, except right next to the emitter, where it is mud.  First, I realize I was likely not watering long enough or often enough and the beds got way dried out.  Do you think the soil is hydrophobic and that is why it's acting like this?  

Before we had small bits of rain and we'd supplement a bit here and there and the soil would be fine, but we've been watering at the garden every other day for several weeks now.  I'm a long-time experienced gardener, and our other beds (not on drip) are dry by the second day and get rehydrated just fine with a watering wand, and the plants seem to be fine with that.

Sorry that's a lot of info.  Feedback appreciated.  Thanks!

\*nerd is a term of respect and reverence in my house lol. Hi!  I run a community garden with 30 raised beds, and we are doing a trial run for drip irrigation.  We have been fortunate the last few years that our rain has been steady enough that we might need to provide supplemental water for a few weeks, but otherwise, rain usually takes care of moisture needs.

We just got a drip irrigation system for 9 of our beds to test run.  While we are not yet in a drought according to the drought monitor, we likely will be soon.  We've seen no precipitation for two weeks, and were between 1-2" short of monthly averages for the last couple of months.  The grass is dying, berries that are not watered are shriveled, etc.

We have a 2-hour timer on the set-up, and I usually turn that on while I water other parts of the garden.  I water 3x/week.  I thought the drip system was working fairly well, but I checked again today, and it's really wonky.  The entire bed is bone dry, except it's very wet where it drips.  I realized this might be due to the soil being hydrophobic.  We watered the beds really well with a watering wand, and I'll see how it is tomorrow.

But, I thought I'd ask here if there is any wisdom to share?  Even if my timer is only 2 hours, maybe I should run it longer, or more often?  I appreciate your feedback in making our garden more successful.  Thanks!. Tl;dr:  my passion project is now someone else's ministry

I have been self-employed working gig jobs since 2014, and enjoying the variety of work.  Since 2019, I have been managing a community garden, and really loving it.  My special interests are community and gardening, and I have a budget and two supporting entities.  I put my creative energies into building something awesome, and fucking A, I did!  I started with a patch of worn out soil and a shed filled with literal shit and garbage.  We now have 51 raised beds, a budding orchard, a prairie, and lots of programming that serves our target community (of which I am a member).

While my project is going well, my relationship with one of our partners is not.  Over the winter, they assumed ownership of the project.  It's a religious org, and my distrust of religion is screaming at me that I should have listened to my gut before re-engaging in a relationship with the org.  There's like four paragraphs of history I just deleted because no one cares about all the details lol.

We had a meeting yesterday, and .... goddamit.  I don't think they exactly gaslit me on purpose, but my memory is impeccable and they were telling me a different story that makes no logical sense.  I started as an independent org and began a partnership again with the religious org, but they have said they actually hired me at the start.  First, I would never have said yes to that.  I'm not saying no atheist would lead a "ministry" but this atheist surely wouldn't.  Also, my tax records back up my memories as to who hired me and paid me.

I'm just so freaking frustrated!  I finally have something awesome, and I lost ownership of it.  I did tell them I need absolutely autonomy and the ability to make unilateral decisions, and that was granted.  But it's the power-over relationship, especially with a religious org, that gives me a horrible feeling.

I'm glad I have a therapy appointment today!  Thanks for reading this far if you did!

eta:  I think one of the things most normals don't get that greatly affects me is my autonomy.  I've had a multitude of jobs over the years, and anytime my autonomy is compromised, I'm out of there.  I apparently have a massive distrust of anyone who tries to control me.TL;dr: Principal partner claims project as its own

I'm in my fifth year of heading up what is essentially a non profit.  This project started about a decade ago as a partnership of a religious organization and a community org, but primarily run by the religious org.  It hit the skids and the religious org told the community org it was no longer going to be involved in the project.  The community org contacted me, and I took over on a shoestring budget ($200/month).

Near the end of the first year, the religious org got in touch after seeing I was growing the project, and offered to provide some things we did not have--including streamlined bookkeeping services, nonprofit affiliation (we apply for grants under their name), and the remaining funds of a grant that initially started the project.  I was really hesitant to work with a religious org because of my own personal trauma stemming from growing up in a very religious family, but the point person was awesome, and we have worked together well.

I've spent a lot of time, creative visioning, and generating community interest and support, and the project is doing great.  Swirling in my head are plans of expansion, bringing in more financial and community partners to add more programming, and establishing our own 501c3 presence.  

But last winter I was told by the religious org that "By the way, we consider the project ours now."  I'm not doing well with this.  While they have stepped up in a wonderful way over the years, funding our outreach so we could be effective, in no way did I expect to be sucked into this org by accepting their support.  There was no conversation and no consent on my part to give up the autonomy of our project.

It takes me so long to process the big emotions from kerfuffles like this, and I'm finally at the point where I am ready to take a stand.  I've respectfully asked the org to step back from their claims of ownership and return to being our principal partner, and for a meeting to talk about all this.  

I don't know what's going to happen if they say no deal.  I'm uniquely positioned for leading this org (I am the population I serve and live in the community I serve) and have unique skill sets that allow this project to flourish. I am not sure it will flourish under the leadership of an outsider as it did not before.

I'm not sure why I'm writing all this, except it helps me to further process.  Support is welcome, and if you've gone through something similar, please let me know how it went.I just want to share my happiness!  I manage a community garden and have been able to secure a donation of about 50 flats of seedlings that are leftovers from a spring fundraiser.  I'm giving them away at our community garden.  About half are veggies and herbs and the other half are flowers, mostly prairie pollinators (I'm in the midwest US).

The conversation about fucklawns has ratcheted up in my town in the last couple of years.  It surprises me because it's a fairly old fashioned conservative town but at the same time, attitudes are obviously changing.  And now, people who can't afford to fucklawn are able to fucklawn because there are so many free plants.  This makes me so happy!. My son created a 6 segment display and really likes it.  Is it possible to get a physical clock made like this?

If interested, he made a quick video here:  [https://youtu.be/NR9IsucYY6Y](https://youtu.be/NR9IsucYY6Y)

Thanks!. I'm so happy!  I manage a community garden, and soooo many of our volunteers are neurodivergent.  Of course I manage it in a way that makes it a safe place for myself, and I'm glad other NDs feel this way too.  

Hanging out with a crowd of neurodivergent folks, all being themselves and having a good time--this just makes me very happy!  And oh the infodumping!. California Kitchen on 9th by North Grand has amazing gyros.  It may look like a dive, but the service is great and the food is delicious.According to the live feed of Ryan Hall Y'all, a tornado went through Lewiston and is heading east.  Stay safe folks!. [https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0093.html](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0093.html)

For those unaware, we're under a tornado watch with a designation of a particularly dangerous situation.  It's probably not your first rodeo if you've lived here a while, but a heads up to put away your backyard missiles (lawn furniture, etc) and pay attention this afternoon.  Keep safe folks!. In some local races, all the people running are just kind of meh.  I want to know who you think is the lesser of two evils.Let's face it, a lot of candidates are not good people.  Who do you feel falls under this umbrella and why?. Is there a local candidate you feel is amazing?  Tell me who and why!  What policies and actions make them stand out?  

Please, if you have a candidate you hate or a lesser of two evils suggestion, there are other threads for that.TL;dr:  I was asked to join an autism advocacy board and within three months it dissolved.  

This is a follow-up to something I posted a few weeks ago.  Now for the steps!

Step 1:  Be the first autistic person on an autism advocacy board (made up of NTs) which has the expressed desire to transition to an autistic-only board.

Step 2:  Take on social media duties and post daily to amplify autistic voices.  Post funny memes, personal stories of struggle, and one blistering take down of autism groups that are not led by autistic people.  (Not my writing, but the blistering take down is [here](https://ausometraining.com/autism-awareness-or-bewareness/).)  Begin to attract and engage AUTISTIC ADULTS! OMG!

Step 3:  Get a flowery nearly indecipherable email from the board president on how we need to make sure our messaging is positive and inclusive as our group was always meant to be inclusive.  And besides, do we really need to be a self-advocacy group?  Self-advocacy...self....selfish.  Why does it matter WHO advocates for autistic people?

Step 4:  Calm the fuck down and try to communicate in a non-angry but informative tone about how groups like Autism Speaks gobble up $90 million in funding and pay their CEO $1 million, but do very little for actually autistic people.  Explain how the narratives of autistic people and those who claim to represent them can be very different, and how the voices of autistic people are often squashed when they say uncomfortable truths.

Step 5:  Attend an emergency meeting of the board in which the organization is dissolved.  See the only thing that has really changed was being stripped of posting privileges on social media.

And just like that, poof!  All gone!  I'm still processing all of this.My kid is really loving this physics-based space simulator after seeing a youtuber play it (Space Chip).  I offered to buy it out of our homeschooling budget, but he told me it was more for fun than school.  Ha!  A week later, he is explaining astronomy terms and physics to me.  I was surprised the simulator is affordable ($30).

Please note, I have no stake in this company, but I really love the educational aspects of this program.  What better way to get kids familiar with the subject than the ability to create hypotheticals and crash stuff together?. I'm both excited and terrified.  

I manage a community garden that had one foot in the grave when I started as a last ditch effort to get something going there again.  One year later, the pandemic hit.  Last year was my fourth year of managing and thanks to a monetary investment by a partner, I was able to focus on outreach in the off-season.  And wow, did we get a response.  We had over 1300 volunteer and visitor engagements last year, which for a garden and community our size is phenomenal.

I've kept up making connections and collaborating.  I'm so excited for 2023 as it has the potential to blow 2022 out of the water.  It's also terrifying lol.  I'm autistic, which has been great in many respects, such as community and gardening are a marriage of my special interests.  I'm also a systems thinker, which has helped a ton in managing the different layers of the garden--biological, political, social, financial, etc.

The hard part for me is the social.  I really do enjoy community so much.  I can go to the garden on a Saturday morning, interact directly with dozens of people, multitask like I actually do well with it, and then I go home and need to be alone for the rest of the day to recover.  I'm working on getting volunteers in place this year so rather than me personally interacting with gobs of people, I can shift this to volunteers who handle the social part better.

The plan after the 2023 season is to regroup and dream some big dreams, like ... helping community gardens set up all over town, an apprenticeship program for at-risk teens and residents of transitional shelters, an urban farming training program.  These are really big dreams that could potentially transform our city's core.  Moving into more of an administrative, systems-oriented position would be better for me, I think.

Not sure why I'm sharing all this.  I'm just excited!  And terrified! lol. I hope this is ok to post here!  If not, please remove.  Here's a creative residency that is offered where I live, and it's such a good opportunity for someone!  Maybe you?  

[https://terrainexhibitions.org/2023-terrain-residency](https://terrainexhibitions.org/2023-terrain-residency). Eta - Y'all, thank you so much for your support.  I really do appreciate it!  The different ways of framing have helped me process a lot.

I about lost my shit when someone suggested this.

I am the first ND member of the board of an autistic group who has the stated desire to transform into an autistic-led self-advocacy group.  Part of my role is outreach, trying to attract autistic adults to join the board.  Part of that outreach is social media.  I do a mix of what I post, and part of that mix is some really difficult subjects.  Apparently it's making some NTs uncomfortable.

I received an email today (couched in flowery language that took me three times to read to understand what they were getting at) talking about how we need to be inclusive and positive.  And while self-advocacy is the ideal, maybe we should look at how this is presented so we can be inclusive.  Because self-advocacy .... self .... selfish.

I get the point of using language to communicate.  If you're turning people off, you're not communicating.  At the same time, saying autistic people need to have their voices heard, whether you agree with it or not, is valid.  I have definitely noticed the posts that focus on the issues adult autistics face get less attention.  But at the same time, I am reaching actual autistic adults through this self-advocacy, including people who I'm talking with about joining the board.  WHICH IS THE POINT, RIGHT?!. eta - Thank you so much for being such an awesome community.  I appreciate your support so much!

TL;dr - my no contact parent is dying and I'm processing a lot of feelings - feedback appreciated.

My parents (not together) are older and after going no contact, I figured they would pass and I'd not know.  I was fine with that.  But last night my nephew got in touch with me to tell me my mom had had a stroke, wasn't found for a few days, and was in the ER.  I was immediately like, "ok, I can come in the morning."

After this social-filter-enabled response, I started processing.  It sounds selfish, but the biggest emotion I felt was uuuggghhhh at all the bullshit I would certainly encounter with seeing my family.  After hearing my body and mind scream at me for making this decision, I started processing how I would feel if I didn't go.  And all I felt was relief.

My relationship with my mom has been complicated.  She's narcissistic and before realizing what that meant I spent decades trying to have a good relationship and improve communication.  It never worked of course but there were times (since getting sober) where she was almost loving to me, and expressed care to her grandchlidren.  But at some point she got fervently caught up in the politics of hate and it was just too much and I cut off contact.  And this political hate machine stuff was just the cherry on top of a history of trauma and bad decisions that have taken a lot of therapy to unwind.

I texted my nephew and told him I couldn't make it to the hospital.  I felt a flood of relief.  It's like I've already grieved the loss of my mother, and not the body in the hospital, but that primal maternal being of unconditional love that people experience when they receive care from their mom.  I never got that from either of my parents, and that's what I grieve.

I feel that primal maternal love strongly when I think of my kids.  They are my number one priority in this life.  Not surprisingly I guess, my kids don't want to see her either.

I'm still processing but woke up today in good spirits, just shining with relief at listening to myself rather than social expectations and meeting my own needs.I've been no contact with my np for 5 years or something.  It was after decades of trying to improve communication and have a good relationship which obviously never happened.  I grew up with a lot of trauma directly related to my np's bad decisions.  

At some point I grieved the loss of a mom.  Not necessarily my mom but that feeling you have when you're with a loving parent.  I did not have that from either parent.  That loss makes me treasure my relationship with my kids (one of whom is an adult).  It's probably what I value most in this world.

My np had a stroke Saturday and was found today (Wed) afternoon.  She's paralyzed on one side of her body and is currently in the ER.  I don't know if she's going to get better or not.  My nephew let me he was on his way to see her.  

There was my immediate response of my proper social duty--to go see her.  But therapy is helpful as I checked in with my actual feelings about it and the answer was a unanimous nope.

I don't feel anything about her being sick and possibly near death.  I have already grieved that.  I honestly thought both of my parents would just die and I'd never know.  I'm pretty ok with that, but it is what it is.  The only thing that makes me cry is that primal memory of loss of the absence of a caring parent.  But then I can stretch into my present and love my kids.  

I am still processing.We're looking to invest in a 50ish pound scale for our community garden for weighing produce.  Has anyone purchased a scale they recommend?  

It looks like a lot of the less expensive ones might be so flimsy as to not be worth it.  I'd rather not pay an arm and a leg, but also, I want something that will last.  Looking for analog rather than digital or electrical.  Thanks!. I know with the EBT extra funding ending nationally at the end of February, many of us are looking at ways to stretch our EBT funds.  I wanted to lyk that EBT funds can be used to purchase food plants, from fruit trees to garden veggies and herbs, to seeds for same.  It has to be purchased at a place that already accepts EBT, so probably more like Walmart and less like your average plant nursery.  But yeah, plant an apple tree and a 6-pack of strawberry plants as an investment for future you.

Not everyone is physically able to garden, and not everyone has the space to garden.  Another barrier is cost, but a lot of us are used to scrounging and accessing what we need from the waste stream, and this is the key to gardening on the cheap.

If you don't have a yard or balcony to cover in food plants, look into community gardens in your community.  Ours has a low-cost rental fee that comes with everything you need to garden (tools, water, seeds for $10/year).  It also offers volunteers who work in the communal garden first pick of the produce.The 50-degree winter days are helping me.  My kid has been in mad genius mode lately.  I love to see it.  I'm starting my seasonal job with the thinking stuffs pouring out of me and planning.  My husband adopted a cleaning schedule, and the neglected parts of my house are becoming scarce with dust and pet fur.  Yk, it's been pretty ok, and I'm surprised because usually February is the month of pent up energy and grumpiness.  I hope you are well!. Just wondering if anyone else here manages a community garden, and if they know of an online group that discusses this topic?  I'd love to communicate with my cohorts on a variety of topics re the systems thinking that is community garden management.  I know this isn't quite permaculture for many of yall, but at the same time, it's totally permaculture in our gardens.  Thanks!

eta:  I found this [https://foodsystemsleadershipnetwork.org/](https://foodsystemsleadershipnetwork.org/). I was wondering if anyone was involved with an online group of community garden managers?  I would really love to share others' experiences of managing their community gardens.  And this page is not very busy.Have you ever just started walking and ended in random room in your house, school, workplace or elsewhere? 
Feeling like you spawned there not even knowing why you’re there, no recollection of the journey to said room. I have a strong imagination and I used to walk around while daydreaming. But I don’t have an imaginary friend, at least my dad and I don’t remember me having.For those who are hypo sensitive/ sensory seeking to visual stimuli, did you ever try to stare at the sun because I tried despite being warned and I still try.For those who are hypo sensitive/ sensory seeking to visual stimuli, did you ever try to stare at the sun because I tried despite being warned and I still try.I was diagnosed with autism but the psychologist said that he would provide a letter when I needed, is that normal?. I want mention my country right now but I want to know if anyone who’s in the community is African. 
Preferably teenagers.I'm so confused all the time. I feel like the world is just a bunch of inside jokes that I don't understand. I always say the wrong thing and I don't know why or how to fix it.

I thought I could fix it by asking questions to learn how to get better. But it backfired on me. 

She gets mad at me and I am scared and confused so I'm like "how was that rude?" Or "what did I do?" It's a genuine question because I want to understand and fix it and I don't want to apologize to her if I don't understand what I'm doing wrong? 

I did this today and she said I was gaslighting and guilt tripping her. Again, I am confused. And it's not like I could ask her what she meant or how I was those things because I'm not allowed to ask. I don't know what to do. I always have trouble with sayings but this one is really stumping me. 

I'm in a theatre production at my high school and we're performing a show about mental health and anxiety/depression. The cat burglar and arsonist thing is part of the show. I don't understand the significance of this line? What does it mean?

Sorry if this is kind of off topic but as an autistic person I always feel like I'm in the dark about things that everyone else understands. I was at my local "Scream Park" with my older brother and our awesome mutual friend. We were having a blast, laughing and joking and even getting genuinely scared sometimes despite it being a corny little place lol. It really was a silly and beautiful time.

I was on the creepy hayride (or whatever they called it) and me and a bunch of strangers were packed into the ride like sardines. But I was still sitting next to my friends.

Throughout the duration of the ride, I was giggling and making jokes about stuff to my friends, and they were laughing and reciprocating the jokes. I now realized I was being a bit loud, but its not like I was really distracting anyone from anything important. 

I was being particularly loud by yelling at a jumpscare (no, it really wasnt that scary, I was sort of making fun of the fact that it was a lame jumpscare lol) and I heard some grown woman yell at me to shut up. At first it kind of hurt but then I had this sort of revelation...It really isnt that serious. I am not going to let this stranger dull my light. (I'd like to point out I wasnt the only one being loud either...everyone was joking with their friends.)

My entire life I've had this fear of being a burden. I've always thought I was annoying and needed to shut up. I always thought I needed to mask my autism to not be seen as some kind of freak. But in this moment I realized its okay to be a little strange. People are allowed to think I'm weird. Because at the end of the day, all that mattered that me and my friends were having fun together. I am loved and I am allowed to be myself.

Maybe I am making a mountain out of a mole hill, this small comment shouldn't've affected me this much, but in a way I am grateful for it.

In the words of a very wise internet user:  


"please be a little crazy. be a little loud. walk the wrong way. look a little ugly. talk too much. say a bad thing. dont blend in. i need to see you, i need to find you in this whole world, i dont want to just walk by."

Hopefully this resonates with some of my fellow autistic people. :). I obviously shower often and use cologne, and I smell okay. But how do I smell AMAZING? 

When I look it up, its always "buy this magical product" or whatever. 

Is there a way I can utilize stuff I already have to smell better?? Any kind of secret hack? (For example, I recently learned lotion will smell better for longer if you apply it right after a shower.) Or even a cheap-ish product?. I'm genuinely confused what I did wrong here.

I was cleaning my room and was bringing my towel into the bathroom to put my towel into the laundry bin. But my mom was standing there blowdrying her hair. So i said "excuse me" and then she was like "Oh your stepdad said he wanted to take a shower" At first this seemed irrelevant to me and I was confused. (Now I realize she thought I wanted to take a shower because I had a towel in my hand.)

I simply replied "Ok" and then said excuse me again. She moved and I put it in the bin and I started to leave when she got really mad at me. She accused me of being an asshole so I asked her what I did wrong. She just sighed and said "I dont know"

But then when I went back to my room I heard her loudly complaining about what I did to my stepdad and now I'm confused. I dont know what I did so I feel sad. I didnt think saying 5 words was that rude. I posted something similar in the dating advice subreddit, but I think theres a big difference when it comes to hetero and lesbian dating soooo I wanted to get everyones opinion.

As a lesbian (Duh) I think all women are gorgeous. Like genuinely. I am not very picky about appearances at all and in fact, I think features like missing or yellow teeth are pretty cool and unique. 

But what do you guys think?. **NSFW Warning because I mention gross stuff** 

I never understood why people "lose their appetite" or anything, which is why growing up, I always would bring up gross things during dinner because I didnt understand why not.

Dont get me wrong: I AM disgusted by things like gore because of the completely inhumane and wrong things that happen in those videos/pics, and I do not like to see people suffering.

But I have no trouble looking at shit, vomit, blood (again, unless its gore) and stuff like that. The smell might be repulsive but looking at it I feel no different. 

But then if I touch sherpa I want to rip my skin off.

I dont know if this is an autism thing but I've had a handful of other autistic people agree with me on it so idk.I'm 15 years old. I had a really hollowed out and decayed upper premolar. The dentist said there was a less than 50 percent chance of fixing it and if it did work it would be highly compromised. I decided to just get it pulled now and see how we can replace it when i can afford it.

But wow. For anyone who has had really bad tooth decay, you can imagine the fear and pain around a bad tooth. I was insecure about it, I was scared of it getting infected, I was in agony whenever I ate something cold or hot.

When I was at school, I'd be thinking about my tooth. I was at a sleepover with my friends, fighting tears at night because of this tooth. I was at a waterpark thinking about this tooth. I was on a fucking ROLLERCOASTER at SIX FLAGS thinking about this tooth.

And now I dont have to worry anymore. 

Additionally, I kinda just like how it looks. I already have a kind of alternative style and, Idk, i just like it.

Yes, I'm aware of the aesthetics. I know my teeth could shift. I know I could have issues with my jaw bone. But I would much rather deal with that then battling tooth infections and constant paranoia. I feel a huge weight is off my shoulders. I can be a teenager again!. Theres just so much to consider!!

I really think dentures are the best option for me, but which kind? Snap in or all on fours? (are those even different? I dont even know.) Just top teeth or also bottom teeth? Partial or full?

Is there an option that saves as much bone as possible that is still reasonably affordable?

How did you guys finance for it? Insurance? Payment plan? I'm clueless how people can afford 30k dollar procedures.Repost from r/dentures 

Hello all!  
  
I am a 15 year old. YES- I know that's very young to get dentures. But please, hear me out.  
  
I was already predisposed to poor enamel. On top of that, I was neglected as a child. Nobody ever watched my oral hygiene habits or explained how to brush/floss. I was also never encouraged to drink water and had nothing but soft drinks...bad idea. And my mom would absolutely refuse to take me to the doctor or any kind of dentist.  
  
At about age 11 it was the worst. My dentist was mortified looking into my mouth. 13+ cavities and many needing a root canal. We filled what we could and extracted the ones needing a root canal, since we couldnt afford it.  
  
Now, a lot of my teeth that got filled before are already falling apart. I dread needing to get them replaced every few years. I have terrible paranoia about my mouth and spend so long inspecting each tooth and obsessively cleaning them everyday.  
  
Not to mention my teeth are just horribly yellow and I get bullied for it often. I think I'm pretty good looking, but then i open my ugly mouth and it completely ruins everything about my face.  
  
It seems like whenever one problem is fixed, another one arises. I have permanent enamel damage and extreme sensitivities on ALL my teeth. I cant enjoy super hot or cold foods/beverages anymore. I am paranoid and insecure all the time. And i want to cry and claw my eyes out everytime I imagine having to go to the dentist constantly for more work to be done for the rest of my life.  
  
I've heard people on here say it was the best decision of their lives....I feel like having false teeth would GENUINELY make my life better. And for every con about having dentures there seems to be 100 pros.  
  
I know they cant replace real teeth. And honestly, If i did get dentures, it wouldnt be for another 5 years or so. But I feel like weeping for joy everytime I imagine such a life where I dont have to have constant anxiety about my teeth!!!!!  
  
TL;DR- My teeth are REALLY bad and really sensitive and ugly. I'm thinking about my teeth all the time and, I know me and my family cant afford constant fixes. Should I just get dentures to stop the pain, worry, and insecurity?. Hello all!

TL;DR- My teeth are REALLY bad and really sensitive and ugly. I'm thinking about my teeth all the time and, I know me and my family cant afford constant fixes. Should I just get dentures to stop the pain, worry, and insecurity?. During my early childhood, she was the working parent so I rarely saw her. My dad died and she was still completely absent in my life. I only saw her at home after her long shifts and I would try to talk to her but she would be drunk and scream at me. And she used to send me to this horrible babysitter which led to me getting sexually harassed and hit almost daily by older kids because she didn't believe me.

Then she found my stepdad, and they would get drunk daily and be loud all night. My mom quit her job, so she was always at home, but she was always drunk. ALWAYS. I vividly remember her coming into my room and screaming at me for hours almost every night. 

She had also been neglecting me for my entire childhood. I ate nothing but junk everyday. My teeth were rotting because I was never taught any kind of hygiene. My clothes were always dirty because I was never taught how to. My room was dirty all the time because I was never taught how to clean and keep organized. I also have a large variety of mental problems and learning disabilities, of which she never cared to take me to a doctor for. She also never cared about my grades or what I did all day so my life was going downhill fast. I was becoming this socially awkward, ugly, dirty videogame addict and it was all her fault. And I was violently depressed and suicidal at the ripe age of like, 8 or 9.

Not to mention the just complete absence emotionally. She would ignore me for ages. She only said "I love you" if she was drunk. I was terrified of her. I dreaded seeing her.

Back on the neglect thing, I have this REALLY bad tooth and ive been begging to get it fixed for years now. I knew she wouldnt pay for the root canal so I told her if i got it pulled atleast i wouldnt deal with the excruciating pain. But she just wouldnt do it. She wouldnt make the appointment for ages. I was getting desperate. I kept asking until one day she snapped, screaming at me about how she has feelings too and shes been going through a lot. As if thats an excuse to neglect your barely adolescent child. 

I just resent her completely. She has done nothing but cause me pain and I havent heard a single apology for it my entire life.. I want to clarify this is NOT medical advice, I just want help on how to convince her to take me.

I'm 14 years old. I don't think she understands the severity of my cavity. I am very paranoid about it and it causes me pain almost daily. I know we have the money for atleast a filling, (or an extraction if it's too severe; we probably couldn't afford a root canal right now. I just need some sort of immediate action, and we can worry about replacing the tooth ASAP)

Anyway, no matter how many times I ask, no matter how many times I cry and beg and tell her how much it hurts, she refuses to make an appointment out of pure laziness.

Can I convince her? Should I call CPS or something??? I'm so lost. I am 14 years old. I have had 12 fillings in the past 2 years, because my mother neglected me when I was younger and never taught me proper dental hygiene or bought me foods and drinks that were loaded with nothing but sugar.

The worst cavity is my upper first premolar on the left side of my mouth. It's a deep cavity. It used to cause "normal" cavity pain, but a few months ago I got a terrifying shock-like pain that throbbed for hours. It went away for a while, then came back, then went away, then came back....but now it's becoming more frequent and severe.

I've heard horror stories about infected teeth, about root canals, about extractions, about dead teeth......I'm so stressed out. My mom won't take me to the dentist. I've asked so many times....I will cry and beg and tell her how bad it hurts and she says she will "look into it". She never does.

It feels like a ticking time bomb in my mouth. The pain will get worse. I am becoming so paranoid and stressed that I stopped eating as much and brush, floss, tongue scrape, and use multiple mouthwashes (antibacterial and xylitol) 5x per day at least. I'm so scared of it getting worse and I'm trying to buy myself time but it's getting worse everyday...it keeps me up at night not even because of the pain but because of the FEAR. It's causing me such mental and physical torment that I've contemplated calling CPS.

What will I do? How can I convince her? I can't go on like this I'm so scared and confused. I shouldn't even have to be worrying about this. It's my last summer to hang out with my middle school friends before high school starts. I want to go have fun and eat sugar and smile without being insecure but my mom is taking that from me. I KNOW we have the money. This is not a money issue, this is pure neglect, pure laziness. And now I'm staying in, crying, in agony and fear all the time and she doesn't understand.

Tl;dr, I have a bad cavity caused by poor dental hygiene. My mom won't listen to me or take me to the dentist. How can I convince her to help?. MY MOM WONT TAKE ME TO THE FUCKING DENTIST!!!!!!!!!!!! I know i messed up by not brushing as a kid. But she never told me to. I was fucking 6!!! How was I supposed to know how important it was if they never told me??? And now I have to deal with terrible cavities and missing teeth and theres nothing I can do about it because obviously I cant pay for it and she REFUSES TO. I am a kid. I shouldnt have to worry about this. But I do. I feel so hopeless. 

Not to mention my mental and other medical issues that are an absolute mystery because I havent been to any sort of doctor for years. I just want to give up. Im so miserable and sad everyday and I cant talk to anyone in my life about it. I have no other options.I'm a 14 year old. My mom is a fucking terrible mom. She is selfish and doesn't care about my mental health or physical health. Why have kids if you refuse to take care of them?

Went 7 years without seeing a dentist. Had 13 cavities at one point. My mom finally took me, but only after the department of child services came to our house. She got them all filled except for one. Now I get to live every day in fear because i DESPERATELY need a root canal and she refuses to take me.

 I have no fucking idea what happens during a yearly doctors visit. Never had one in my memory. Ive been to the doctor a solid like 4 times my entire life and one of those was when I was born, and the others were mandatory for me to go to school and stuff.

Not to mention she traumatized me and treated me like shit growing up. I have so many mystery mental issues that she doesnt even care about. 

Oh, and the icing on the cake is that we lost our FREE insurance. Why? My mom was too lazy to give paperwork and shit. Now I have no hope of helping my medical issues. But even when we had insurance, she refused to make appointments. Out of nothing but laziness Now i just have to hope and pray we can get it back, but its not like shes in a rush to fix it. She doesnt care. She never did. She never will.

Im living in hell everyday and theres nothing i can do about it. Department of child services wont help. None of my family members can help.

All there is to do is whine and complain and hope i fucking die soon so I dont have to deal with HER and my everyday pain and fear that comes along with all my mystery illnesses. She ruined every aspect of me and I have nothing to look forward too

What will I fucking do with my life. I'm 14 years old. When I was a younger kid, my parents didn't care about my diet or hygiene. After developing a soda addiction, eating nothing but junk, and rarely brushing my teeth, I ended up with 13 cavities. (3 of which needed a root canal.) After getting the 10 normal cavities fixed up, I got 2 of the root canal teeth pulled since they were in the back. 

But, I still have a tooth with a deep cavity near the front of my mouth. I don't want to just get it pulled. But it needs medical attention. It's becoming severe. 

Issue is, my parents refuse to take me to the dentist. A root canal is expensive, and we have to drive a long way to get one. It's inconvenient for my parents.

But I'm tired of living with so much pain!! It makes me anxious all the time. I feel like this is neglect. I am so unhealthy and scared all the time over this god forsaken tooth. I will do anything to get rid of it, even if I have to get it pulled and have a big gap there. I'll do anything.

Should I call CPS? Will it do anything? What other choice do I have?. I feel like this is a social skill I lack and I was wondering if any other autistic people could help me out with this. I'll see someone looking at me and asking a question or greeting and I assume they're talking to me, and they're actually talking to someone behind me?? And It's super confusing. How do I tell if they're talking to me or not?

Also, is this something you guys struggle with too?. As a Kenny lover, I loved both Kat and Sarita by association. It's sad we didn't get to know Sarita very well. But with Kat, we learned a lot about her over the time we know her in the game. I love her so much. She was so sweet and helpful to her family and I see noone talking about her.I love my friends so much.

Really I could talk about this for hours. But seriously. They mean the world to me.

This friend group I have right now? Absolutely amazing. They're so kind and funny and real. And even if it doesn't last, I am truly lucky to have the chance to know these people now.

They have put up with my bullshit since elementary school. They have dealt with my dramatic ass. They have taught me hard lessons. They accepted me for being LGBTQ. They are beyond brilliant.

I hope I make them as happy as they make me. Tomorrow we're gonna hang out and I'm just so giddy and excited knowing I'll be having a blast.I hate talking about sex. I'm a sex repulsed asexual person. I hate it so much. Sex jokes are funny. But some people are so fucking obsessed with sex and pornography it's honestly sad to witness. It makes me kinda sick too if I'm being honest. I'm happy to be a virgin for the rest of my life. I'm not losing that part of me to some sex obsessed creep. 

I consider myself sex positive. I think sex education should be taught in school. Sometimes it's important to talk about taboo stuff and be a bit uncomfortable for the greater good. I don't care if you're a porn star, or have an onlyfans— in fact, good for you. It's your body. I'm happy for you and support you.

But with all that being said, so many men in my life talk about sex constantly. And graphically. They're obsessed with porn, and masturbating, and losing their virginity. It's just sad. You cant focus on anything else? Can you not see how uncomfortable you make people feel? Can you not go 8 seconds without talking about hentai? Can you not wear a fucking hentai hoodie to a family event? I'm begging you.I've seen sooo much gruesome shit. And it makes me want to never leave the house. I never want to do anything. Don't want to go out anymore. I'm scared of everything and have to hide it. I constantly fear that one day I'll get stolen and get beheaded on video or something. Just to get posted on some sick website for people's entertainment. I don't even want to post this in fear I'll get tracked down or something. 

I'm gonna tag this as NSFL just to be safe but I don't know if it's needed or not.Since I was a kid, every time looked at a knife, or a pinhead, or even a sewing machine, I could feel this urge to close my eyes tight and turn away. Almost like a dull stabbing of my eye just by looking at it. And now, if I look at images or videos of sharp objects I get that sensation too.

I don't know what it is but does anyone else feel this way?. I feel like I'm going crazy. These marks on my skin look just like a bed bug bite and are also in a zigzag pattern where my body meets the mattres like people describe it. I spent AGES checking my mattress and can't find casings, feces, or bugs. Nothing! I have a foam mattress, can foam mattresses even get bed bugs?? What do I do?.She made a comment this morning “you look smart and look like you have more money than you actually have” I was taken back and said “fake it til make it I guess” I thought it was actually very rude of her. She has also told me her husband has accused her of gaslighting him.I wish there coffees were larger 😫😂. Read the comments on diddy’s Instagram, 50 came out and said last night at his concert that diddy got Tupac killed 😳Surviving diddy coming soon 👀. Any recommendations appreciated thank you. Well apart from the big 🍉 she has lol I mean that’s probably why he used to crop my chest in the photos 😂I love my small 🍉 ❤️. My narc ex is on my mind constantly 😳😩😩😩
I need to accept that he wasn’t that person I thought he was.So my narc was my first love, first everything if you catch my drift, 8 years ago he sent me a text stating that he had a new Girl and she wanted to talk to me and I shouldn’t say anything stupid lol I told her he never mentioned her and she didn’t believe me and they ended up starting a life together with two children, I myself also started a life with someone else and two children even though I moved on with someone else I was still hurt by what my narc did to me and I didn’t feel good enough. 

Fast forward to last year me & the father of my children spilt up due to arguments and him talking to another woman and sending explicit pictures to her so I ended it we argued all the time. my narc ex sent me a random message on fb saying he was so sorry for how it all ended and I didn’t deserve it etc so like the fool I was we began talking again and he absolutely slated the girl he left me for calling her a bad mother etc. We ended up meeting for dinner & drinks and slept together.

About a week later he stopped answering my messages and started to be cold basically discarding me which really hurt tbh. He then sent me a message saying he didn’t know what was going to happen between him & his mother of his children so I was basically used by him. I blocked him and he blocked me.

I feel so hurt and raged, I have to accept no matter how hard I try to forget him he’s still on my mind.
And like the foool that I am I checked his fb on my burner account and he has new supply not his ex, my self esteem is so low I just don’t feel good enough.She got back with rat tail boy and now the whole world knows about his past?? If they’re is a season two it will be interesting to see how her career plays out.. weird af she made up the lie about her mother hitting her with the hairbrush 🤣also in my opinion Abel played his role well Hollywood must be full of leaches like him 😂😂😂. In E4 she says she’s 17 however I believe she is younger than that very child like 13/14 it’s nothing new in Hollywood!!.I have autism. Level 2. No intellectual disability, but there are things I clearly don’t understand that I should understand. So sometimes I am a little “infantilized” but I didn’t mind it because it’s not like my friends treat me like a baby, they just understand I have a limit and I just can’t understand something. I can’t function independently alone, ever. Sometimes I have large nonspeaking episodes. But I’m still an entire adult in my head with goals thoughts feelings etc.


Someone said my partner (who has ADHD) is taking advantage of me because I can’t consent, because I can’t “understand consent”. They said bc I can’t understand some social complex stuff (like understand how race plays into things, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and really all the woke things where it’s very social construct heavy) then I’m clearly incapable of also understanding consent. 

But like… I’m 100% sure I understand consent. It’s very binary (binary as in only two options). Yes = touch. No = no touch. That’s it. We ask for consent every time, before and during. Anytime I say no, it’s immediate no and it’s over. Anytime she says no, it’s immediate no and over. I don’t feel like I’m that incapable of stuff right? I know I’m autistic and disabled and there’s stuff I don’t get but I’m still a fully conscious functioning adult who can consent right?. I’m a senior in college. It’s October. So far I’ve missed 8 lectures (4 whole weeks). Not back to back. I don’t show up one week, I have the energy to show up the next, but then after that I can’t go back for another week. 

A professor is threatening a C for my attendance. But I do all my work, I am a great teammate with my group project, I go above and beyond to catch up and give good presentations, I do the labs and homeworks. I just can’t show up that well. But I make so much effort to show up.

Any tips? Advice? Similar experiences just so I don’t feel like a failure? I feel so stupid because why is it so hard for me to just show up to class. It’s the easiest part. Why can’t I do it? My commute is literally like less than 10 minutes, and I have someone willing to drive me. I just can’t get past the mental roadblock of transitioning from my room and safe area and then being on campus.When I talk here, I am not afraid to be myself. I can just ask questions and share things that I want to share and I’m not worried or scared people will be mean or misunderstand me. And if people misunderstand then they’re usually really nice and willing to hear me out. And then we just learn from each other 

I don’t feel judged here and it’s really nice. Thanks for making this such a nice space for us. I’m glad there’s finally a space where I don’t have to beg to be understood. Making a “surprised and disgusted” video about “The Good Doctor” meltdown, saying that’s not what they look like and that it’s not good representation, is ableist to your own community.

A lot of these autistic representations that use stereotypes are,, still representation! I’m very happy that now there is more autism representation of different levels, esp level 1, (Quinni in Heartbreak High, Extraordinary Attorney Wooyoung, Jack from As We See It) and the level 1’s get to see themself on TV too. It’s a huge deal and we all deserve it. But you don’t get to put down other representations that tend to show level 2’s and higher just to explain how level 1 rep is more accurate. 

Tiktok and instagram content right now is so so SO focused on low support needs + level 1 late diagnosed autists, which is fine, except no one talks about higher levels. Instead, we get allistic (or even some autistic) people being mean to us because they think level 2’s and 3’s don’t “get an excuse” now since they know “ all about autism”. Or allistic people tend to “accommodate” to autistic peoples by following level 1 advice. It just sucks. I wish I could have a platform talking about Level 2, or just have an input for some of the people making videos without getting attacked . 

I’m really sad to see this favorite content creator be really mean about Shaun. He is still representation.I think I would be sad that it’s not a real human I’m connecting with. I think even if we managed to make conscious robots (which sounds like a horrible idea), I don’t think I would be able to forget that it’s a bunch of code & wires and stuff. 

I think what would make me depressed is that this robot would probably be really great at accommodating for my autism and provide a great friendship that fulfill natural desire for social interactions and human connection, but it wouldn’t be a real human. I would be sad that the robot would be a better friend than a real human.Hi. I'm 21 and I'm autistic. So I really struggle understanding how to act around people who are not people I run into in a daily basis. I am running into a lot of 30 + year olds now and I think they are super cool adults, but I don't think they'd think I'm adult enough to talk to/get to know. I think my brain needs to cook some more.   

I also really struggle understanding how to talk to 30 year olds. Do I talk to you like I talk to my 21 year old friends who party party party and college and all the crazy? Do I talk to you like a coworker where you don't share too much you just talk? Are you like an adult ™️ like wow you have a husband and kids wow. Like do I treat you like I would treat my friends parents? Like are we in a parent space now? Idk. I don't get it

So I figured it's best to ask them directly so I can try to understand how to act. so what's it like to be 30? What do you think about? What are you struggles and worries? Do you feel like life is better than it was when you were 21? Were your twenties scary?. Hi,

I already checked out all the other threads and Spotify links on this sub that have asked similar things - they're very great and useful, but I can't seem to find the vibe I'm looking for. I also checked out the Spotify Italian indie playlist but I can't seem to find similar songs to what I'm looking for.

I really like songs from Kali Uchis, Wallows, The Strokes, Her's, Mac Demarco, Frank Ocean. That vibe in general. I might've mislabeled the genre (sorry if I did I'm not familiar with the genres of music). Does anyone have a good starting point like an artist recommendation or specific songs? I can go on a rabbit hole after that but I just need a starting point that might be more similar to what I am going for.

Thanks in advanced for the help. (Disclaimer: Sorry if any tones in my post are incorrect or off, I am autistic.). My friend was super frustrated about his code and it was just not working after hours of it not working. I told him to take a nap on my bed. He gets into a deep sleep, suddenly shoots up after an hour and a half of his nap, tells me "the solution to the code is to create an N vector. tell me when I wake up" and then goes back to sleep. Dude is like knocked out (didn't respond to me saying what or anything). 

He wakes up after like 2 hours and says "oh dude I dreamt I finished my code and I'm so mad it was just a dream". I tell him what he told me in the middle of his nap. He laughs and tells me that's not possible. He tries out his code and indeed a vector with variable N fixes his code. (I know nothing about his code so idk what that means lol). 

tl;Dr my friend dreamt his code answer. tried it when he woke up and it worked.Have you ever just started walking and ended in random room in your house, school, workplace or elsewhere? 
Feeling like you spawned there not even knowing why you’re there, no recollection of the journey to said room. I have a strong imagination and I used to walk around while daydreaming. But I don’t have an imaginary friend, at least my dad and I don’t remember me having.For those who are hypo sensitive/ sensory seeking to visual stimuli, did you ever try to stare at the sun because I tried despite being warned and I still try.For those who are hypo sensitive/ sensory seeking to visual stimuli, did you ever try to stare at the sun because I tried despite being warned and I still try.I was diagnosed with autism but the psychologist said that he would provide a letter when I needed, is that normal?. I want mention my country right now but I want to know if anyone who’s in the community is African. 
Preferably teenagers.Im a guy but I never cared if anyone saw me as a guy or thought that something I did was girly or unmanly or whatever - I don’t identify as woman or man or non binary - it’s simply like I don’t have any interest in being any of those nor being considered any of those, for convenience sake I introduce myself as a guy but I couldn’t care less if I am

Do my words make any sense? I never wrote anything about this topic down so my thoughts on this are kinda unsorted atm


Edit: I love this subreddit and community. Every time I’m on here I’m flabbergasted by how understanding, open minded, caring, genuine, supportive and friendly this community is and I’m very grateful to be a part of it. :). I have 228 rds atm, should I summon or wait for the next big unit?. I'm definitely gonna jump straight into League mode and play some Dogstorm, I just got him upgraded recently and I’m having a blast with him. Pretty much the title, anyone know a good pick for an ENB that makes skyrim look like The Witcher 3? Heavy Burns used Eisvogel enb in his witcher overhaul video but that look only really fits the Toussaint dlc imo. does anyone know if there is any FPS difference between the two and if so, how big?

edit: Rudy ENB for CW + Zangdar Reshade. https://youtu.be/l26CWpGp1Es. Does anyone know if one has to be able to access the museum to really use the mod (get the artifacts and so on)? 
I’m asking because I always crash when I use this Weir Stone and weren’t able to find a solution yet. Also apparently no one plays this mod or has a similar problem.I can’t access the museum because my game crashes every single time when I try to teleport through activating this Weir Stone. (crash happens in the loading screen)

Anyone else experience this as well?. So I want to make a Dark Souls LO and I got everything set except the lighting i.e. the visuals. I’m not really sure what weather (lighting) mod + Display Enhancements setup could get me that authentic Dark Souls look, feel and atmosphere.
Do you have some ideas on that matter?. So I want to make a Dark Souls LO and I got everything set except the lighting i.e. the visuals. I’m not really sure what weather (lighting) mod + Display Enhancements setup could get me that authentic Dark Souls look, feel and atmosphere.

So I wanted to try out this, very much praised (by the comment section), quest mod. Problem is a person I trust just told be that it absolutely broke one of her characters so that she had to start a new one. She had problems before and after triggering the quest. 
Can anyone share their experience on this mod? Did you have a great experience or did you crash and ruin your character?. I for example gotta say I absolutely love the Artifacts series.Would someone be able to port this over to Skyrim SE?

For some reason the relic swords from the JRC’s Witcher Style Sword Pack can’t be tempered, like, they don’t even show up when using a grindstone. I don’t have a single clue what’s happening here since in all of its comments sections no one had such a problem.

Im currently building a Witcher load order and Im currently thinking about which weather mod I should use, as there are no ENBs I need the weather mod to make my visuals/lighting look like they appear in the Witcher 3. 
What is the best weather mod (+eventual preset) to achieve that in your opinion?. Can anyone share their experiences with this mods regarding incompatibilities and stuff?. So I really want my beloved sword Umbra in skyrim just like my younger edgy version did in Oblivion but Im not too sure whether I should buy the one from the creation club or download this mod: https://bethesda.net/de/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4032531
Now the thing is, I don’t have a problem with buying that mod for money but I would like to know which version comes with a better overall quality.Why is there like no content for this game 😭. I simply noticed that the mom had Andrews eyes and the dad had Ashleys eyes, and was wondering if they were somehow connected. I personally have to go with cry, by krono.So I just found out that taking long showers is a popular cover up for masturbation. I have autism, and I take extremely long showers as the sensory effect of a hot bath is stress melting for me. My mom probably thinks I'm in here furiously jerking off for three hours and I'm very embarrassed. What does I do😭. I've been feeling awful recently and feel like I need to get this off of my chest. For context, I am m14 and I have ASD. Basically, I have these huge confidence issues that came from me being called smart. For some background, I'm pretty much that one kid at school that never really gave two fucks and still got all a's on everything. Eventually, I got curious how far I could take the whole "smartest in x group" and next thing you know, I'm outsmartingother kids from surrounding states in civics bees with papers on biofuel, and I'm not even that good at civics. This mixed with the fact that nobody really wanted to be my friend, and being bullied daily made this strange "I'm smarter than these assholes and I'm too good for them" attitude. I eventually realized I was a jackass to anybody I met because I knew that if I even said one word to them, they would immediately write me off as a person of interest. When I realized this, my confidence tanked, and now I genuinely feel like a dumbass because subconsciously I think that if I let my intellect out I'll get condemned for it. Just a little mini rant for y'all, and I accept any tips on getting my personal image fixed. I feel like whenever I enter a conversation, everyone kinda stops, looks at me, and keeps saying what they where talking about. It doesn't matter who I'm talking to, whether it's my youth pastor, teachers, or other people my age (teenagers). My mom is the only person who is semi-imune to this and she repeatedly tells me she experienced it too. I'm often told I talk way too fast even when I'm intentionally slowing my speech down, which is very hard because I feel my mind is going too fast for my mouth. This causes me to stutter more than often, worsening the effect. I'm just genuinely curious if I'm alone in this endeavor of intentionally dumbing down my sentences for everyone I talk to.
P.s. sorry for the god awful rant I'm just rather upset over this shit. So, I'm extremely new to the craft of blacksmithing and I'm still trying to get my forge together. I'm going to be using coke as a fuel and I was just wondering how thick my fire pit needs to be to be able to withstand the temperature of coke. I'm looking at 3/8 inch, but I could use some advice. I'm a brand spanking new baby smith and I don't know where to get steel. I've gotten lucky once and got a handful of quality scraps but that's it and was curious where to get metal. I'm not looking for brand new steel, and I prefer scrap. Are there any ways to transfer a .rat file to .apk. I have a 3rd party application that's only available in .rar and I need it on my android tablet I carry for work. Any ideas?. So I got my oculus quest 2 about a year ago and my controller stopped working. It doesn't connect to my app or headset and I've changed the batteries a thousand times but nothing worked. The only thing of note is that the controller is blinking s.o.s in Morse code and that I hadn't hit it on anything before it broke. It just, well, stopped. I had absolutely help with oculus support and my warranty is expired. If this has happened to anyone and you have a solution I would really like to hear it. Thanks.i recently got in an argument on a different subreddit. this guy was stating that the pronouns thing was ridiculous and his trans friend is focused on being accepted, not people using the right pronouns. but like… how else are people to show they accept someone’s gender identity… if they never use the person’s preferred pronouns??? how is a trans woman supposed to feel accepted if people are calling her bro and using he/him, and how is a trans man supposed to feel accepted if people are calling him girl and using she/her? i guess i’m confused because this guy is adamant that he does respect and accept his friend, but is simultaneously complaining about how stupid preferred pronouns are.my sister does this the most, but i have friends that do this as well. they’ll look at my face and tone instead of listening to the words i’m saying. they should be aware that my facial expressions and tone of voice are often inaccurate to how i’m actually feeling, because i’ve told them before. and they know i’m autistic.  
but it’s so frustrating, especially with my sister, because she’ll think i’m mad at her and in turn, get mad at me often, which is upsetting.i would love to see some of my favorites as squishville so i can have mini versions of them as well. i’d love a 2” junie, as well as some mythical creature squishville, like theotto and romano!. i’m so fucking mad right now. i feel like everything around me that once brought me joy is falling apart around me. my friend that i text everyday? doesn’t want to text me if i forget to text him and i should probably just give up on trying since he doesn’t care either way. my friend that i just reunited with? nothing goes right when i hang out with her and i should probably stop trying. my sister? i’ve had to convince her NOT to drink and drive for the last 3 nights in a row. i’m going to either restrict her from drinking or stop going over to my friends house with her.they are paid for. i am waiting on a pre-ordered theotto the cthulhu, and i just ordered from squishmallows.com: winston with a fanny pack, and elton 3 pack. getting those two got me free shipping too so it cost me $35.98 for 12” winston w/ fanny pack, 8” elton, 5” elton, and 3.5” elton clip. i’m gifting the 5” elton to my sister as an additional late birthday present (i didn’t forget it, i bought her something else way before and gave it to her on the day of. this is extra. i already told her about it- because i wasn’t sure if she’d want it since she was clearing out her own squishmallows- but she’s excited. she thinks he’s cute).i’m about to start looking for another job. i cannot stand the heat inside of my store. i may have a heat intolerance, but i know i’m not the only one who thinks it’s hot. a ton of us have fans that we wear around our necks as an effort to try and keep us cool. 

are all krogers like this? i like my job and would work at another kroger if it would be a cooler environment, but if i have to leave the company i will. i get nauseous and have thrown up before due to how hot it is. I’M AN APPAREL ASSOCIATE, i should not be a red, sweaty mess.Just unsubbed from a subreddit where people post tik toks (no particular theme just any kinds of tik toks) because almost every other post I see on there is a tik tok of an ND person (often ppl with ADHD) discussing their experiences with their disorders that just get posted so that people can complain about how “these are normal things that everyone experiences!!,” “they’re making their disorders their whole personality!!” or “they wanna be so quirky!!” Often times it’s so obvious that the person posting them to complain about them knows nothing about the disorder being discussed. 

Why are neurotypicals so fucking obsessed with this? It’d be one thing if these were nuanced criticisms BY people with mental disorders IN spaces dedicated to discussing mental disorders. But it just makes me so uncomfortable that it’s so popular in non disability specific spaces to just shit on any person who dares mention anything about their experiences being mentally disabled. It seems like NTs only wanna hear about us when we’re being put on display like sad little pets by other NTs. Has “sexually identifying” as something ever been an actual thing in the trans community? I think I’ve seen the phrase “I sexually identify as-“ over a hundred times practically, always as a unimaginative joke to mock trans people. I’ve never seen this phrase ever used unironically by a trans person. Where tf did cis ppl even get that phrase from?. The comments:. I decided to try using the “savings” feature on cashapp and I’m wondering what the difference is between keeping money there vs just keeping it normally. Is it just a way to separate your account balance, like different pockets in a wallet so to speak? Or does is have unique functions such as preventing that money from being transferred from my account? 

Asking cuz it seems like someone had access to my account and tried to spend my money but was only unable to because the payments got canceled due to insufficient funds. Now that I’ve been getting some money paid to my cashapp I’m hoping keeping my balance low will protect my money until I can figure out a better way to secure it. I’ve been out for a while and I’ve started rethinking my name choice more and more. I already know I like these pronouns so if replies could focus more on the name that would be nice, also if any Spanish speakers see this I’d really appreciate some responses in Spanish. To be clear, Ive been researching autism and been pretty sure I have it for years. However online tests have never really been that useful for me in that process, the questions have always been kinda confusing or misleading and so the tests never felt accurate. From what I’ve been hearing, the questions on those quizzes (even ones supposedly made for adults to self-test) are worded in very (for lack of better terms) allistic way that a lot of autistic people struggle understand.

So I’m wondering if anyone knows of any quizzes out there that are actually made with autistic thought patterns in mind?. Im a pre-T trans guy and I get misgendered every single time I go to the dentist despite having corrected them before and my masculine name being in the system. It’s really uncomfortable and I’m usually physically unable to correct them even if I did feel safe/comfortable doing that. 

When I check in there’s a section that asks your sex but not gender, so I feel like I have to put in female but I hate having to do it. And I know I don’t usually pass either way because of the whole pre-T situation but I feel like having my sex marked as female in the system just immediately kills any chance of not being misgendered that I might have. I often have a different dentist each time btw 

So I’ve had moments where I think to myself “what if I just marked my sex as male?” It seems like a stupid idea to lie about my sex in a medical context (but also it’s just teeth so idk), plus I feel like there’s also a risk my “sex” not aligning with the gender people perceive me as. But idk the thought keeps lingering in my mind and I’m curious about what would realistically happen. I saw this meme about how a marginalized group that im related to is often made into caricatures that badly misrepresent them. This is true but imagery it used didnt sit right with me.

The image to represent the caricature was like a photoshopped collage of someone with a lace front I think (like with edges), what im pretty sure was a black person’s pursed lips, and a huge wide nose.

The image it was being to compared to was a drawing of a girl with wavy blonde hair, thin lips, and like an anime nose. Next to the drawing is text that says “normal person” and arrow point to the drawing 

I want to call out racism in my community, esp since black women are such an important part of it, but I’m also scared of overstepping as a non-black person. One person commenting positively has an avatar that suggests theyre black so that’s also making me hesitate. Hi, I’m a trans man hoping to get in touch with my feminine side. I’ve tried binding while wearing a dress, but many of them make it look like I have boobs anyway just because of how they’re built. As well as making my waist look small.

I was wondering if anyone knows of any niche line of clothes that are feminine but still allow ones body to look masculine?

(UPDATE: A button-up with a vest and a long skirt does the trick pretty well!!!). The whole “transvestigation” thing is fucked  up through and through, and the way they talk about trans ppl as well as the “signs” that ppl are trans is honestly disgusting. But in an ironic way I’m kinda flattered at being compared to (for example) Will Smith, Robert Pattinson, Chris Hemsworth, and many more.

Massive warning to anyone curious about this, “transvesitgators” use extremely transphobic language and the shit they say about “secretly trans” ppl can really trigger ones dysphoria. I just read a whole thread of trans ppl (mostly non-binary ppl an even other trans men) outright bashing trans men and talking about how terrible we all are, now Im kinda mentally spiraling. Im very stoned and was already in a sortve vulnerable mental state to begin with so I can’t rlly process it like I normally would. And idk ive kinda started hating myself for being a man lately and wishing I could imagine myself as anything else. 

So yeah those comments are just really messing me up rn and I guess I need some community if that makes sense. (DISCLAIMER: I’m not diagnosed professionally with OCD and I’ve been unable to really explore my symptoms with a professional. My symptoms really seem to fit the criteria of OCD but it’s always possible they could be because of something else)

Typically I feel like a have two thought processes going on at once, one rational and the other irrational. And they’re like fighting for control to some extent at all times. Sometimes it feels like the irrational thought process almost completely takes over and the intrusive thought feels so real that it’s like I’m straight up experiencing a delusion.

Example - One time I kept having intrusive thoughts about this monstrous creature being in the house I was staying at. It was at night and I could not close my eyes, I HAD to watch the entrances of the room at all times. I remember crying and telling my partner I loved them because I just couldn’t reason away the feeling that I was going to die. 

This is probably a stupid question but does anyone’s intrusive thoughts/obsessions get to that point? Where you feel completely disconnected from reality? 

(And like, when I’m not like this I’m still affected by my intrusive thoughts but it’s more like my thought processes wrestling each other back and forth and the uncertainty of it stressing me out). Hi so Ive been trying to figure out how to use trans tape to at least reduce the size of my chest a little but it’s been really difficult. I found one tutorial aimed at larger chested ppl but I don’t think it’s very helpful as I have a totally different body type (on the skinny side, pre-T) than the person in it and I think my chest might actually be larger.

My problem isn’t getting it to be flat, it’s that my breasts tissue is like really saggy/low hanging and so working around that is really difficult. I’ve had one successful attempt before where I laid down on my back and my boyfriend applied it for me. But even that only worked once, the other times we’ve tried that it didn’t come out right.

An additional problem I have is that my tissue sometimes get all bunched up under my armpits and it’s so uncomfortable (and weird looking) that it makes me want to cry.Ok so um I don’t know if I experience echolalia or not and I need some help. I’m self-diagnosed and just trying to figure myself out.

So what happens to me is I get certain audio stuck in my head, like it can be practically anything, usually something I find satisfying. Like music, dialogue, etc. And then I feel like the urge to imitate it vocally as best as I can. I can control it but it doesnt feel very good to suppress it and if im not paying attention it just slips out.

Sometimes I end up saying stuff or singing things that I wouldnt. Like Snowman by Sia. I hate Sia and I especially don’t wanna show any support for a song of hers that was used as a trend to cover up her ableism. But then I just start singing that damn song and ppl who’ve heard me rant about Sia tease me for it. And this is just an example that I’m comfortable sharing.

As I’m describing this its sounding more and more like echolalia lol, but at the same time it’s different than how I see most ppl describe it.

But yeah I’m not sure if it’s echolalia or just vocal stimming. I’m a 16-year-old trans guy, pre everything. My parents are reluctantly allowing me to go on T but they won’t offer me any kind of support, so I have to figure out the whole process myself. In a couple of days I have a chance to go to a gender clinic so I’m planning on calling them to make an appointment but the truth is I have no idea what I’m doing.

I’ve been doing research online like crazy but for some reason I can’t find any information that was clear or helpful to me. I’ve been hoping to go on T for years but I’m still somehow totally lost on what the actual process is. 

So can someone give me a walk-through of the process? Preferably for minors in California but anything helps. Ok so this might be a really weird thing to ask for but I’m just looking for something that really embodies the emotional frustration that can come with dysphoria and transphobia. Preferably songs that include screaming and are some variation of punk, rock, metal, etc. Any kind of recommendation will do though.Hi, so recently I’ve had spiders land on me or try to crawl on me unusually frequently. Today it’s happened three times (two spiders, and one of them came back after I got it off of me). Yesterday the same type of spider also landed on me. It was under the same tree so there might be a lot of them living in it, but so far I haven’t seen it happen to anyone else. I also had a spider in my family’s truck land on me recently.

I mentioned this to my partner who’s been doing witchcraft for a while and is pretty devoted to it, he said that Hecate sometimes comes to one in the form of a spider. Now I feel really guilty bc I’ve freaked every time a spider is on me and made it get away from me. I’ve never tried to kill any recently, but I did flick one off of me. I discovered they’re red back jumping spiders, which can hurt a lot to be bit by but arent deadly usually.

But I just feel so guilty now, like I’m possibly rejecting Hecate. Is that what might be happening? Is it disrespectful of me to not want anything to do with something that might be connected to Hecate? 

Btw I do have a symbol of Hecate on my alter, and while I’ve told myself that I’m not ready to work with a deity I have thought about working with Hecate.(Please use he/him pronouns for me, but for context I presented as a cis girl during this)

(Edit - TW: SA involving a minor) (Also pls let me know if the NSFW tag isn’t a good idea)

So this was years ago but I remember pretty vividly. As a kid there was this guy who I had had a crush on for years. I suspected he liked me back but neither of us made a move and we didn’t see each other that often because we were two grades apart (keep in mind I was held back). 

Anyway in 6th grade (age 12-13) I dropped out of the regular elementary school that I was going to and started attending this small charter school glass that he also happened to transfer too a little while later. By now I didn’t really have feelings for him. 

But one day he came over to my house with his grandpa bc him and my parents were meeting. My mom encouraged me to take him to this spot up on a hill behind our house that I liked to hang out a lot. Like I said I didn’t have much feelings for him anymore but I still wanted to hang out with him. When we got to the top he suddenly confessed that he had liked me for years. I didn’t know what to say. How could I tell them that after years of liking him (and showing it) as a kid that I didn’t anymore?

(Warning: this next bit I’d gonna go into detail)

But yeah he prompted me to hug him and I don’t remember the order of events super well but he kissed me. He pulled away and asked why I wasn’t kissing him back so I started kissing him back. I kind of hated it tho, his mouth tasted gross and just yeah it was unpleasant. He put his hand under my shirt and idk why out I just put up with it. After we were done (or at some point at least, like I said I remember it vividly but order of events is fuzzy) he said like REALLY sexual things. He asked if I have ever seen a dick and then asked if I wanted to see his, I quickly said no. He also started asking if I ever fantasize about things and “play with myself.” At another point he kept trying to get me to sit on his lap and I kept shaking my head. He also stated licking my neck and rubbing his nose against my face at which point I was dissociating heavily and I could barely talk. The nose against the face thing actually became kind of a trigger too. One time my friend accidentally touched her nose to the side of my face when she went into the hug me and something just came over me and I pushed her away and said “that was weird” in shock. The order of events is even foggier now but we were standing up and he reached out and tried to touch my breasts and even said “you have amazing boobs” but i stepped away from him. By the end of this all he kept trying to convince me to date him. I kept telling him that I wasn’t ready to date but he kept trying to flatter me. It didn’t work but he didn’t make it easy. Eventually we were standing up and he had his arms around me and he asked if I trusted him and I said no. I also said I preferred to date a girl. That’s when he finally gave me space. 

(Details over)

He told me I had “led him on” because I kept looking at him in class. I don’t remember really looking at him a lot. Then he told me that we should keep this to ourselves and I agreed. I told my mom though and she just laughed about how badly that “poor boy” had messed up. I felt so gross tho. That night I laid awake in bed just feeling gross and violated. 

It wasn’t until a year later with a counselor that I realized that I might’ve been sexually assaulted. I didn’t know what to say. The realization was really sudden. But I’ve tried to talk to other ppl about it and not many people besides my partner and one of my friends had taken it seriously. And like when I look back on it I feel like “sexual assault” is an exaggeration and I’m making “false accusations” to ruin his reputation or something....I need to clarify something first, age regression is NOT a kink, or related to kink, in anyway (in fact I’d like for the questions to be kept SFW). It’s a coping mechanism to deal with trauma, stress, anxiety, etc. While I’m in that headspace I generally avoid things that aren’t considered child-appropriate so anything sexual is out of the question.So I’ve been regressing for a while, mostly involuntarily. I told my partner about it and he’s accepting but they aren’t comfortable being my caregiver. I totally understand but I don’t think anyone else can be. I’d feel too weird and he’s expressed it would make him uncomfortable. Plus I don’t think I could be in contact with anyone else enough for them to take care of me when I regress.

So I’ve decided I’ll mostly be my own caregiver. Ive already taken care of myself most of the time I’ve been regressing but it is really hard to fully get into that headspace alone (even if I kinda do it involuntarily, it’s like I’m there but it’s not totally right). So does anyone have any advice on being your own caregiver?. Hi, I’m a pre-T trans man and I present pretty masculine aside from having long hair, and I’ve recently been started getting misgendered almost constantly. I’m really hesitant to cut my hair, but getting misgendered all the time REALLY sucks. I’m desperate so I was kind of considering trying out pronoun pins. But I know that it’s just gonna out me and idk if it will even really work. I live in a small town thats somewhat accepting (it’s a mixed bag honestly). But yeah I’m desperate and I wanna know people’s experiences. What I mean is I often have to purposefully add tone to my voice and act out the emotion that I’m trying to convey. And I’m not always that good at it so it comes off like I don’t really mean what I’m saying. But I do mean it, I just have to exaggerate my outward portrayal of it. And it’s just so frustrating.

This varies from scenarios where my partner wants me to assure them that I love him. Or someone giving me something and expecting me to be super excited and grateful. That last one has actually made it so that receiving gifts and stuff can actually be really stressful because I feel like I have to fake a reaction and keep up a smile the whole time. It’s especially hard when I’m really tired and struggling to mask. 

Like last Christmas I was staying with my boyfriends family and they were EXTREMELY generous in their gift giving. I got more gifts that I’d ever gotten for Christmas. Unfortunately I also had gotten absolutely no sleep that night because I was sick, and trying to mask drained my energy even more. I’m so scared that my reactions came off as unenthusiastic.

Another time my dad surprised me with tickets to see Hamilton (not the original cast but still amazing). Hamilton had been my hyperfixation/SI for a really long time. My DREAM was to see it. I was excited, yet my outward reaction gave my parents the impression that I didn’t care. I didn’t even know how to act out the reaction that they wanted. Thankfully after we actually watched I did have a pretty naturally enthusiastic reaction so I think that cleared things up. But I still wish I could’ve given them a more reassuring reaction when they showed me the tickets.

TL;DR: I struggle with showing my emotions in a way that other people find reassuring, even though I feel them internally. This makes it especially hard to receive gifts or surprises.Today I feel like I keep going back and forth with being extremely hyperactive to nearly falling asleep. And like I really mean *back and forth*. I’ve gone through this cycle multiple times this afternoon. Like 30 minutes ago I was multitasking, being loud, and jumping with energy. Now I can barely talk and my body (especially my head) feels like lead. 

I should note that I had to do a lot of tasks today that normally tire me out and take a lot of effort, so that very likely contributed to my current fatigue. The weird part is how hyperactive I was and how suddenly I switched to this (and that it happened twice).Todd is definitely my favorite character and I related to him a lot from the start. Like him, I have trouble being productive and standing up to people. I don’t really feel super ambitious and I kinda feel like I’ve let people down. So it’s really inspiring to see Todd become more independent and stand up for himself more. When he starts setting boundaries, especially in regards to BoJack who would often talk down to him and keep him from progressing. 

Especially the episode where he had to steal a kidney for his mom and he says something along the lines of “Isn’t it enough that I’m happy” and “Why do you have to be proud of me on your own terms.” 

Those moments spoke to me so much. And I’m so proud of Todd and I think maybe I could be proud of myself. And the best part is Todd is still Todd, he didn’t change his personality or his interests for character development. He simply started having more confidence in himself.Hi, so I recently spent some time with my boyfriends family and I kinda suspect that the youngest child could maybe be autistic. Like, I’m not super certain but I do think an evaluation could be worth it.

She’s about 7 and definitely known for being a handful in the family. And I’ll admit while I was there she did trigger me (in the psychological sense) a few times from her yelling (and occasionally hitting of her sister). She does “throw tantrums” and quickly becomes frustrated when something is bothering her. I heavily suspect I may be autistic too, and I also used to throw a lot of “tantrums” as a kid when I didn’t get my way, at least more than most kids or my sister according to my parents.

Now, these things don’t mean autism inherently, but I’ve noticed her family doesn’t really offer much help in managing her emotions or frustration. They mostly just think her outbursts are really annoying and that she’s just being bratty. Though they’ll usually do anything to make her content. And I mean, she herself takes pride in being “evil.” My boyfriend said she’s like that bc she’s used to getting her way by being like that.

And so I’m not certain that she’s autistic at all, but I’d hate to take the chance of her actually being autistic or neurodivergent in some way and being misunderstood and not given the help she needs.I’ve seen a lot of jokes where white (or generally non-black) people talk about a specifically black woman who’s motherly and comforting to them. They’re meant to be wholesome but how do black people feel about them?. The answer might be obvious, but I’m pre-T and I frequently get misgendered, both by strangers and by ppl I’ve grown up with. And I’m wondering how green the grass is on the other side (/m). I have heard of trans ppl on T getting misgendered and I’m worried that maybe it won’t really make the change (socially) that I’m hoping for. I’d still love to take T either way, like just for my own comfort, but I don’t wanna get my hopes up for my social dysphoria being alleviated.

Additionally, have ppl in your life who used to misgender you stopped, or done it less, after you went on T?.I feel like I may have been mocked or something when I was excited when I was younger or something because when I get really excited I feel it bubbling it up but I have a hard time letting it show on the outside and I just feel myself pushing it down. Does anyone else struggle with this? And if not do you have any advice on how I could get myself to show it better and let myself express it better?. Today I’ve been really struggling to find something to eat. What are the safe foods you guys go to when you deal with a struggle like this?. I love echolalia and am thinking of possibly making a song out of it in the future so I wanted to know what everyone’s favorite words or phrases are if possible :p just for fun and curiosity tbh. I saw some old footage of me as a kid and I could see that when people would get me gifts for my birthday I would give them kisses on the cheek and hugs and if I REALLY liked the gift I would give them an even bigger hug and or kiss. To be fair though it might also have just been cause I was taught to do so by my family but I definitely feel that when I really really like something I want to give that person a hug and or a kiss (depending on who it is obviously). I guess I’m just wandering how others were when they were younger with their families.I get teased about this from my gf and her friend but I just have a hard time dealing with their energy sometimes. They can be kinda loud and super happy and like wanting me to dance and take a lot of pictures. Idk I don’t understand why but with them I have a harder time being myself? It’s like maybe they would tease me often when I would like things that were meant for someone younger or something? Idk I have no clue but all I know is that the way I am with my friends is completely different than the way I am with my family. I don’t mean to react that way but I just get more annoyed at them and I feel like I’m being rude and I don’t mean to. Is this normal?. I had my second assessment today and I found it weird how they were asking me to put these W/M shapes into this paper with the same outline of the shapes on it. They also told me I could ask to get more pieces if I wanted to so I did, since there were pink and blue ones so I decided to make the bottom part blues, the middle pinks and the top blues again. Then they asked me to try to say what was happening in this story without words and I tried my best but all I could do is describe what I was looking at without knowing what the hell was happening. And then it was just a bunch of questions and then they showed me some drawing of these cartoony looking people on vacation and to try to describe what I was looking at and what was happening. They also asked me to describe in steps how to brush your teeth and use soap to wash your hands as if I was trying to teach her how to do it. It was weird. I also kinda felt like they were treating me a bit like a child and I don’t know if that was just me seeing things that way or what but did anyone else feel like they were kind of being treated younger when doing their assessment? Or is this just how it is for adults too?. So I grew up befriending a lot of people probably due to the ADHD part of my brain but I always had an imaginary friend named Suzy, whom I had a whole backstory for and everything and honestly I still talk to her now so I guess I was wondering if that was just a me thing or does anyone else share that experience?   P.S. I feel like I must’ve been internally lonely to have an imaginary friend that literally grew with me no? Like I was trying to fill a void by talking to many people but it was never truly filled? 🤷‍♀️ I don’t get me but yeah.

Like I was trying to fill a void by talking to many people but it was never truly filled? 🤷‍♀️ I don’t get me but yeah. So I found some stuff that my family wrote for me for a little art decoration and a birthday card from when I was younger and in it they had one thing in common. They both described me as “obedient” I just wanted to know if anyone else was described as obedient when they were younger or is that just me? I just find it odd like why is that what my family chose to use to describe me out of all the adjectives lol. Okay so my appointment for the evaluation is going to be on September 11. Now I need to hurry up and get everything ready for the appointment and I’ll accept any advice or anything anyone has to give me. Please and thank you! I’m excited! But I also don’t wanna get my hopes up too much because I might not get the results I want and might have to get a second opinion so I’m just trying to prepare just in case. Honestly I just prefer for someone else to do the cooking as it’s such a long and tedious task for me and if I could hire a chef I would. I hate meal planning since I never really write it down or anything but maybe it would help me to have more structure or something. Idk it’s just super boring anyway and when I’m hungry the last thing I wanna do is cook. Plus we don’t have a set time to eat so it makes it even more complicated. Ughhhhgg. Honestly I would love to meet more musicians and especially neurodivergent ones and even more so to collaborate

Update: I ended up making a meal of pork chops, green beans, salad and green beans with the help of some auditory and visual stimuli thanks to YouTube.I remember vividly using one of those blood pressure machines growing up and they would scare the crap out of me and make me freak out, my heart raise and cry. What about you guys? What’s an example like that for you?. I’m thinking of working on writing a script/story that is a musical about neurodivergent characters having to survive in a failing society. Sort of like the movie RENT. I would love to have some assistance though to get ideas and work on the music and lyrics and stuff! 🤷‍♀️ let me know if you’d be interested as it’s something I just thought of but I think it would be a lot of fun!.

EDIT: I meant to put stims not drums -_- stupid autocorrect.

How does one decide on their stims?

Okay so this may sound like a dumb and common sense kinda question as I understand that most stims we just do subconsciously and don’t really get much of a say in them. HOWEVER, the reason I’m asking is because recently I’ve begun to do some possible unmasking? I’m not sure if I am unmasking or not tbh but I just feel like maybe I don’t do certain stims as much as I used to? Like skipping for instance. I feel like I probably discovered stims that were a bit more socially acceptable and thus ended up stuck with those stims. Stims such as: singing, whistling, humming, and rhythmically tapping my fingers or feet? I do have a pasión for music and thus this would explain these either way BUT I also feel like as I’ve been obsessing more about autism and learning more through research and memes and neurodivergent creators I have started learning some other types of stims I enjoy such as: making an L with my fingers and then making an okay symbol and switching back and forth between them, as well as sometimes curling up all my fingers almost like making a claw. 

Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because I also learned that a lot of autistic people/on the spectrum  have certain stims like the T. rex arms for example and part of me gets why as it’s something that does feel kind of comfortable. However nowadays I feel weird trying different stims because I feel like I’m going to be judged by the people around me or I’m going to be treated differently or laughed at or something and that’s what scares me. I’m not sure how to get more in tune with not caring what people might think or say or do and just do whatever I want whenever I want to. My other fear comes from not being sure if it would be okay for me to try a stim that I have never had before (to my knowledge). Would it be considered something like cultural appropriation in this case? Or would I be able to try different stims and thus get recommendations to discover new ones I might like or 🤷‍♀️. 

But anyway I’d really appreciate any tips or advice or even suggestions as I’m always open to learning and I never want to come off as ignorant or rude or anything. I just love to learn and discover as I’m on a path of self discovery. 

Thank you for your time! 💕. I started reading “unmasking autism” and one of the chapters starts asking questions about your childhood experiences and I honestly can’t remember why I would start masking in the first place because I don’t remember much due to the ADHD part of my brain. I just wish I could go back in time to see my experiences once again from afar or something cause I hate how bad my memory is sometimes. How so once again, how would I unmask if I can’t even remember how I started in the first place?. Okay so this may sound like a dumb and common sense kinda question as I understand that most stims we just do subconsciously and don’t really get much of a say in them. HOWEVER, the reason I’m asking is because recently I’ve begun to do some possible unmasking? I’m not sure if I am unmasking or not tbh but I just feel like maybe I don’t do certain stims as much as I used to? Like skipping for instance. I feel like I probably discovered stims that were a bit more socially acceptable and thus ended up stuck with those stims. Stims such as: singing, whistling, humming, and rhythmically tapping my fingers or feet? I do have a pasión for music and thus this would explain these either way BUT I also feel like as I’ve been obsessing more about autism and learning more through research and memes and neurodivergent creators I have started learning some other types of stims I enjoy such as: making an L with my fingers and then making an okay symbol and switching back and forth between them, as well as sometimes curling up all my fingers almost like making a claw.

Thank you for your time! 💕. So for context I work as a tutor at a learning center. I usually get such little hours like maybe 4-6 a week. Recently they started to give me more hours like maybe 8 hours a week or more. Usually it would be like two or three days, two hours each. Now it’s been like 2 days with 4 hours each. This upcoming week however  I’m going to have to work a total of 16 hours. The weirdest part about this week is that Monday they’re making me work 10-2 and then come back to work 4-6. Then on Tuesday and Wednesday 10-2 and Friday 5-7.

Once I discovered this however it kinda started affecting me mentally. I couldn’t stop thinking about how many hours I suddenly had to work this week. Especially on Monday and how I was going to have about an hour gap between schedules and what I was going to do. I suddenly started repeating the numbers in my head 10-2 and 4-6 over and over and over. It was very energy depleting and I just felt like I suddenly couldn’t shower myself. My gf had to help me. I was just stuck on a loop and suddenly my whole mood changed and I was just playing with the water droplets in the tub and trying to draw the numbers I was replaying in my head using the water or a piece of hair. It was pretty hard for me to get out of it. 

I was wondering if this is something I’m alone on or if anyone else has experienced something similar? These moments are still fairly new to me and kinda scary and I guess that’s why I wanted to see if anyone else had dealt with something similar and how they dealt with it as well as if there’s a term for this? Anyway I wish you all a good week and I’m just gonna be mentally preparing for tomorrow.I’ve been doing some research on PDA in autism and I’ve come to realize that maybe that’s why I feel a certain type of dread when it comes to doing certain demands. I don’t know if it’s due to my autism or being burnt out or both but now whenever I think of going to any job (even the one atm that’s just two-four hours a week) I just feel exhausted and a certain feeling of dread and gloom. I feel like everything is hopeless and I’m never going to be happy in any job. Idk if maybe I need something more freeing or more interesting/exciting to me? Idk I guess I just wanted to know if anyone else felt this way or had any advice or anything. Lately I just hate everything and my depression just makes it hard for me to have to do anything demanding like that.So I’m planning on making a book that’s just a mixture of poems I’ve written and pictures I’ve saved on my phone of things I’ve found cute or interesting or I wanted to buy but couldn’t. Does this seem like a dumb idea or would any of you be interested in reading something like that? Please give me any advice if you have. Thank you!. I feel like learning about stuff so please feel free to just info dump about whatever you want! :3. So I recently came to the conclusion that it’s harder for me to show as much emotion around my family as opposed to with my gf or maybe my friends. Could this be a result of some sort of masking or…? Idk I’m just even more confused now because I still don’t understand how that makes sense or why it is the way it is. Anyway, any advice or comment would be helpful ty :3. I would love to make more neurodivergent friends to hang with every now and then, especially local ones. Lmk if you’re interested but I also get if you’re not :p. I’ve heard about like special talents and stuff like that and I don’t really know much about that, how rare it is or how common it can be but I was wondering if maybe my ability to figure out the notes of the song by ear and being able to learn an instrument kind of easily would be a part of that? (Sorry if I sound tone deaf I’m still learning tbh) (hehe tone deaf.. music hehe). Lately I’ve been coming to terms that my mom has teased me recently and even in the past about how I don’t sound too excited and she wants me to react a certain way so I pretend to sound super excited for her and then she’s like yes exactly! And then I realized that working at a call center can also be draining for me since I had to sound all happy and stuff and in my current job I’m a tutor so I have to be all happy with the kids and maybe that’s also why I kinda dread going. I’m questioning if I should even consider the job I applied for as a teacher anymore because that would mean I have to be act all happy and stuff too. I don’t even know if this is due to my autism or my depression. How can you tell? And any advice?. I’ve spoken with her several times about my experiences and my research and how I came to that conclusion with the help of my friends and stuff. And joining this Reddit too. She seemed to have believed it and had a nice little heart to heart with her but now that I showed her a little joke about autism or something she was like “you can’t just say you have autism! You haven’t even gotten an official diagnosis yet”. I even asked her how many adults on the spectrum she knows and she said 0 because she only knows about two nonverbal kids and from afar. I feel like she needs an official diagnosis to believe me but it’s tough and I’m trying to educate her about the spectrum and how it’s different on everyone. Idk it’s just annoying because then I start to doubt myself again.Hi just wanna talk to some new neurodivergent people if you’re interested :p. Okay so I feel very confused at times when kissing my gf because most of the time I just kinda freeze up when she uses her tongue or spit and I’m not even sure if that’s because it feels so good or because it can be a weird sensation. I guess it depends on my mood but I was wondering if other people have a similar experience with kissing? I tend to go from feeling kinda grossed out by saliva to not being grossed out by saliva and enjoying it. Or even enjoying it but also being grossed out at the same time lol idk it’s hard to explain and so I wanted to see how others feel when kissing.Are there things that cause you to become nonverbal? I’ve learned that when something triggers my anxiety or I become super upset or just filled with emotions I become nonverbal and it’s hard for me to come out of it. Especially when it comes to hearing yelling or hitting or things like that. Does that happen to anyone else? Or how is it for you guys?. So I started realizing that I can handle light pretty well. (There are days where it’s way more soothing to have them off though) As for sound there are specific instances where it really bothers me but not enough personally for me to need to wear earplugs to the supermarket for instance (though I do hate when something falls very loudly and startles the shit out of me but luckily that doesn’t happen too often.) HOWEVER, I did also start to think that maybe I could also be sensitive in other areas such as my stomach or how my anxiety manifests itself. At times it’s really hard to control my anxiety. It’s also like my stomach and taste buds are randomly picky about things that they weren’t as picky to before. Suddenly when something is too greasy it makes me queasy, like fried chicken and stuff. Chocolate milk has always more or less affected my tummy and idk it’s just things like that. Is that a possibility? Because again it ranges like everything else from day to day. Can anyone else relate or that’s just me?. So I’ve been learning a bit about masking with autism and idk if I do that or not but today I realized that at times I want to smile but because I see the people around me aren’t I can’t get myself to smile or I feel weird. Could that be part of masking without me thinking about copying the other person or could it just be me trying to blend in to not get in trouble or something? 

Also, are there other ways to mask?. So question, has this ever happened to you? I have moments where I can for instance just let my body drive somewhere and I’m barely aware on what’s happening but as soon as I come to realize I’ve already driven a bunch and I didn’t even need my gps or anything :o

Besides that though it also happens with other things like at work but I can’t think of other examples right now lol is this like hyper focusing btw?. My partner has a sister that has 7 year old twins and a baby. They struggle to focus being kids but me and my partner are pretty sure he has ADHD. However his mom kinda mistreats him by threatening him with a belt and sometimes hitting him with it, or hitting him or his sister with a sandal, you know basic Hispanic parent abuse stuff. 

Not to mention she yells at them a lot and him especially since he struggles to stay still. I just feel so bad for them and being AuDHD I just get anxious whenever I hear all this occurring and it stresses me out. It even makes me think about how I would have been raised had I been raised this way. I know a lot of people are and that’s what scares me. He might grow up with a lot of resentment and hatred towards his mom. And he definitely will stop stimming as much. I’m just so sad whenever I see all this mistreatment and hear all this yelling. Just needed to vent cause I really wish there was more love around.Honestly I’m so tired of being told 

“you don’t know where this is??” 
“How do you now know this??”
“Do I have to do everything for you guys?”
“I’ve told you how to do this before”
“It’s right there!!”

And many MANY more…

It’s like they don’t realize that people with disabilities exist and struggle to gather and remember all these details. To this day I still don’t remember peoples names and struggle matching names with faces. I also don’t know where everything is because some of these places Ive only seen once. (When they literally did the tour for us on the first week). 
And even though I write most things down I STILL struggle to know what to do and how to do it!!

Today I was judged for transferring a client to someone we are apparently not supposed to and I was literally by my whole department how we shouldn’t do that and blah blah and like guys.. I didn’t know..ugh I’m just so tired of all this bs. I wanna quit so badly at this point. Between the bullying, the overwhelm of all the work that we have to do, all while handling calls and trying to understand what people on the phone are saying and what to do with that information without zoning out or having to ask them to repeat themselves so much. And then the customer service voice all day. It’s just so much.So I work at a call center and my job involves helping people check their balance and transferring to the right department.

This lady called and I was very confused at what she was asking because of my brains ability to take everything literal and this is basically how the conversation went.

Person calling: “hi can you tell me how to reach  the front desk?”
Me: “I don’t know because I’m not physically there”
Person calling: “oh okay so you don’t have a number for the front desk?”
Me: “oh yeah! I do, here’s the number…” 

Lol. How would you describe your burnouts? I would like to know because I am a self diagnosed AuDHD and just wanna learn as much as I can about it.So my gf brought up a concern yesterday to me about how I had never shown I was sensitive to light or sound before my immense amount of research and has a similar fear to me, in which I am making myself believe I have these symptoms because of all the research I’ve been doing. I really doubt this is true because I know I don’t have it as bad as some others and I feel like my ADHD is more prominent but idk how to convince my partner and myself (more so my partner) that it’s just because I’ve been starting to unmask for the first time in years. Or am I wrong? Am I just a good actress?.Frank Ocean's new album being sold exclusively as a USB stick pendant from his brand Homer could be a strategic and innovative move:

Artistic Expression: Frank Ocean is known for pushing boundaries and thinking outside the box when it comes to his music and creative projects. Releasing his album exclusively as a USB stick pendant demonstrates his desire to explore new formats and challenge traditional distribution methods. It allows him to merge the realms of fashion, technology, and music in a unique and artistic way.

Limited Edition and Exclusivity: Releasing the album as a USB stick pendant adds an element of exclusivity and scarcity to the product. By limiting the availability of the album to a specific physical object, Frank Ocean creates a sense of rarity and collectibility. This approach can generate significant buzz and anticipation among his fan base, making it a highly sought-after item.

Enhanced Fan Experience: The USB stick pendant can offer a more immersive and interactive fan experience. Fans can wear the pendant around their necks as a piece of jewelry, showcasing their support for Frank Ocean and his music. The USB stick itself could contain additional content such as exclusive artwork, behind-the-scenes footage, or even interactive elements that complement the album. This approach elevates the album release beyond just the music, providing fans with a tangible and memorable keepsake.

Sustainability and Environmental Consciousness: In an era where digital streaming dominates the music industry, physical formats like CDs and vinyl records are becoming less common. By releasing the album on a USB stick pendant, Frank Ocean takes a step toward sustainability. USB sticks are reusable and have less impact on the environment compared to traditional physical formats. This move aligns with his brand's ethos and appeals to fans who value eco-friendly options.

Brand Synergy: Frank Ocean's brand Homer centers around a fusion of fashion, technology, and art. Releasing the album exclusively through Homer's USB stick pendants strengthens the brand identity and creates a cohesive experience for fans. It showcases the brand's commitment to innovation and provides an opportunity for cross-promotion and cross-selling between Frank Ocean's music and Homer's fashion line.

Frank Ocean's new album being sold exclusively as a USB stick pendant from his brand Homer brings together elements of art, exclusivity, fan experience, sustainability, and brand synergy. It allows Frank Ocean to experiment with unconventional distribution methods while delivering a unique and immersive experience to his fans.

What are the metrics required to have a 'fans also like' section appear on my artist profile?. I’m the one who uploaded TLOP to P*rnHub

The year was 2016, I was a sophomore in High School. I grew up listening to Ye but I wasn’t that big of a Ye fan, around this time I had seen lots of news circulating about the album release, I remember hearing that it would only be available on Tidal, which was the case when it originally came out. Tidal was expensive and no one really seemed to want it at the time lol

The day The Life of Pablo came out, I was honestly desperate to hear it, because it seemed so exclusive and scarce. so as anyone would I went to Google, looked up “The life of Pablo torrent” and luckily enough, the first page of Google led me to a legit download. 

I used to make Youtube videos, so I had a copy of Sony Vegas Pro 13 installed on my computer, I made a quick album video for TLOP and originally posted it on Youtube, and in the matter of minutes it was taken down. I remember PH used to have just random meme videos, this was back before you had to be verified to post. 

I thought it would be funny to post the Album video to PH, I thought nothing of it, maybe it would get taken down; maybe it gets views, I didn’t care. 

A few days go by, and I notice that Complex made a video about what I did, and that tons of other news articles wrote about what I did, New York Times, GQ, Esquire, Vulture, The Verge, Vice, The Sun, Metro, The Independent… the list goes on, I remember having that holy shit moment, I had told a few people at school about what I did (no one believed me). 

What had happened was some guy on Reddit made a post about how he found TLOP on PH, that post went semi-viral and caused it to ‘blow up’. 

Anyway idk how to end this story lol thank u for listening. The year was 2016, I was a sophomore in High School.

Anyway idk how to end this story lol thank u for listening. Before this gain, i’ve only had around 700 streams from Discover Weekly over the past few years. Thought it was pretty cool c:. I miss nature. 1. I will go wash the dishes immediately after I sell
2. Go on a bike ride everyday
3. Learn how to play the guitar (epic)
4. Adopt a cat
5. GO ON A EPIC SHOPPING SPREE (For some groceries)
6. Go to GameStop (To donate the games I don't play anymore)
7. Buy a nice toothbrush
8. Start my own garden (infinite money glitch if you sell the food you grow)
9. Pick up knitting? 
10. Fall into massive amounts of debt. Really hoping it goes down 10,000% tomorrow 😉. Once the squeeze is over and we've all made our money, we are going to see articles, posts and headlines with titles similar to these;

*"GameStop's over, Reddit is betting on … now"*

*"Reddit group TRIPLES GameStop earning with … "*

*"Jump on this stock to 5X your tendies"*

*"The next short squeeze? Reddit betting on … after GameStop"*

*"5 Stocks to double your GameStop earnings"*

I recommend that you stay away from stuff like this, you are likely going to lose a lot of money. its very easy to fall prey and bet all your money in a quick attempt to double it, without knowing what you're doing. we already see what happens when people try to chase a quick high by placing bets on stocks like $r..k..t just because a couple reddit accounts made money off it (a majority of people lost money)

be smart with your tendies, invest in boomer stocks, you'll be much better off simply by making 5% annual returns then trying to turn your millions into billions

don't chase the next GameStop, don't try to 5x your tendies, avoid reddit (for a few months) and avoid mainstream media

personally; I wont be doing any stocks for about 6 months after this is all over. because I know my simple ape brain will want to quickly turn my money into more money. just to end up having to go back to my 9-5 in a few years lol

Anyways, GME to the moon  🚀.Hello friends, so I’ve always had quite exaggerated reactions to insect bites and am allergic to bee stings… a flea bit me on my arm a few nights ago and no matter what I do I just cannot get the itching under control - I’ve tried oral antihistamines (Allergex), ice, steroid creams (Advantan) & calamine lotion and have been getting no relief at all… does anyone have any golden remedies that work for them that I could try? I am desperate 😭. My favourites are Spinosaurus & Ankylosaurus 😩. Just to be clear, I know ASD is a very very broad spectrum and that every person with autism is unique, but I’m mostly referring to commonly stereotyped/generalised autistic traits like not liking loud noises, having difficulty making friends, not liking physical affection etc. 

In my case, people often seem surprised when they learn I’m on the spectrum because I make friends easily, love physical affection & am quite an expressive person! 

What about you guys? 🤓. So all the confusion around terminology and the challenge with describing “visualisation” has me wondering whether or not I actually have aphantasia… so I figured I’m just going to describe my experiences here and hopefully someone can tell me what they think.

I’ve always struggled with reading because it takes me ages to get through the story because I keep forgetting details about how the characters or environments are described to look and then feel the need to go back and re-read their descriptions over and over in an attempt to “hold their appearance” in my mind but it’s almost like the second my eyes reach the end of a word that detail disappears. I feel like I can only “see” those details in my mind when I go back to the descriptive words and really focus on them to try to conjure up some kind of imagery but I find myself only being able to like “mentally revise” what I know a blonde bowl-cut (for example) looks like based on what I’ve seen in real life - it’s almost like I end up describing what I know about these features to myself via my internal monologue as a means of trying to envision them but I honestly can’t say I’m necessarily picturing anything, that is, seeing a “picture” of that item/detail floating around in the black void that I “see” when I close my eyes and “look inwards”. 

If someone were to ask me to close my eyes and picture a cat, I feel like I’m just thinking to myself “a cat has pointy triangular ears and whiskers with little paws and a fluffy tail” and then if I was asked to describe back to them specific details of the cat I’m visualising in my head (like if I was asked the colour of the cats eyes) I end up just like “randomly picking” a colour that I know cats eyes can be because I hadn’t considered that detail before now and then try to someone insert that detail into the extremely vague “veiled silhouette” I’m barely holding in my mind but then it all like somehow fades away and now I’m just like thinking about what green eyes look like and nothing else.

And it’s confusing because I’ve always been a pretty creative/artistic person but I don’t think I’ve ever used mental imagery as the reference for my drawings but rather find myself thinking of a cool topic to draw and then seeing where things go as I draw it. 

Please help 🫠 does it sound like aphantasia to you guys? Can anyone relate?. Hey everyone, I’m relatively new to ARK (started playing a few weeks ago) and am really enjoying it so far. Sadly, none of my friends are into gaming so I don’t know of anyone to play with :( I feel like the game would be so much better with others so I’m wondering if anyone has/know a server/group willing to let me join them?

I’m playing on Xbox One.Here's how I summarize Isekais :  
  
OP Protagonist that does everything flawlessly that barely struggles.  
  
Harem of teenage girls often involved. Sometimes here to indulge in a specific and illegal fetish.  
  
That one cocky character being put in its place.  
  
that one powerful girl character put in her place by Main Character and somehow is blushing about him.  
  
That one super evil doer that almost destroyed the world cannot stand a chance against the hero.  
  
Sometimes repetitive slice of life to show how the MC understands and exploit the world's mechanic.  
  
A demon or God befriending the MC as a "you have something you can and must provide me... that one food I like".  
  
"I'm truly weak but I have that one OP ability which somehow makes me the strongest in the world and so many women are somehow in love with me but I must go back to my world" (and that's just the title of the Isekai anime)

Can't forget that the MC is some recluse with zero social skills who dropped out of middle school or high school. Suddenly shows up in this world and he's a ladies man.  
  
Most of his big brain moves are always from "I read about this in a book once at school". He's always sent to the world completely based around the game he grinded nonstop, but his actual skill expression is next to nothing. His OP cheat ability, use of inventory that no one else has, menu, and the other "game-like" abilities make him completely busted.  
  
He isn't exploiting a world that he knows like the back of his hand. He just has a literal god tier blessing he's relying on with surface level knowledge of fantasy settings.Looking for a guild doing krate dragon and geo tb

This script deals with disability. The listener is mentioned as having surgical scars, though the reason for the surgeries isn't stated. I originally based him off myself and gave him the same heart condition I have, but I decided to do away with that to make him more relatable.

This is a work-in-progress. I like the general idea, but I'm not sure where to go with it, what to add or take away. I'm considering getting rid of  the male student, because he's mostly there for comic relief, and I worry that he wouldn't be received well.

It also doesn't feel like any of the roles (except the teacher) have enough lines or 'screentime.' I'd love to expand them,  but don't know how. 

I've been wondering  if there was a way where any interested VAs would work with me to flesh out their characters more, and significantly expand their roles. I understand if you're not interested, though.

&#x200B;. Just to clarify, I'm talking about a character's actual voice, not their personality.

The character in question is a teenaged boy, but he also plays the role of a leader. Is there a  way for a high-pitched voice to sound intimidating? How would that happen?

I don't really know what he sounds like. It wouldn't be that high for his age, but high in general.. I've always wondered about this. Why do people share posts? Who do they share them with and how? It's confusing.After dealing with a bully for several years, he disappears. However, someone else replaces him.

A lot happens in this script, but the ideas just kept coming to me (no pun intended). Eventually, I decided that I couldn't do everything I wanted in one script, so I might do more if people like this one.

(Keep in mind that the number of performers is negotiable. At least two girls and a guy is needed for this to work. However, there's also the crowd at the auction and however many frat boys that round the guys up at the beginning. If you feel lie bringing in more people and they're okay with doing bit parts, that's fine, but it's optional.)

1: characters, so like name personality traits medical conditions and their life history
2: where it’s set, it’s self explanatory
3:any randomness you wanna give that makes sense
4: people’s goals and why they want to accomplish them
5: their job/s or dream job/s
6:nationality/ where they’re from and cultural background
7: just anything you think will make the story more fun
Please have fun with this and honestly just enjoy the mush that comes out of it. Hi, I’m J, or that’s what I’m going by for the sake of privacy, I’m currently in the process of setting up a set (which will also act as my bedroom, ik making use of space it’s a miracle) for a talk show I’m starting, and as I am autistic myself, I want to make my show as friendly towards my fellow autistic peeps as possible, I’m thinking maybe some copyright free chill music in the background, maybe some of the mc music discs if they aren’t copyrighted, ill look that up, to kinda give it a more calming/comforting atmosphere, so be it it is a home bar set and the show is about bartending all over the world and travel all over the world but I want to keep it chill, as I’m a lonely idiot and don’t like loud noise, I’m thinking maybe have like a thing at the end where I spend a min or two teaching a relaxation technique from the country I’m covering? Btw is to a younger audience as I’m under 18 and it’s all mocktails, no booze involved, so don’t call the feds, and it’s gunna be hosted on yt so I’m planning on using that feature they’re adding that makes it so your soeaking diff languages, it’s like captions but with voice not text, idk what it’s called, and I will t try not to use my mess of a accent of a Anglo Irish kid who sounds like a aussie/kiwi, idk people say I sound like I’m kiwi or Aussie but leave suggestions in comments and have a good one. I just felt like seeing who’s friends are the biggest prick, I watched family guy today but that’s unrelated. I’ve been looking in studio 2.0 and can’t find them for the life of me where are they?. Idk how to pin something that I need to pin please tell me how. This post is to tell you to please join the sub and read the rules in the welcome message before commenting or posting, please upvote something if you think that the story is interesting, so that we can have a fun debate, also make sure you follow all rules and add a flair to every post, even though it is optional. The title explains it, I’ve got extreme social anxiety and haven’t been able to find a hobby for ages, although I have found one it’s one that involves a lot of socialising so I’ll do it on a good day, but the new hobby drumroll please (moment for you to be happy doin drumyrollboni) designing Lego sets using brick link studio! Yay! (Moment for you to go happy clap clap) my first set I’m designing is a diner on a roadside with a zebra crossing infront of it with the lil yellow lights, and you can open the diner to show the inside! And it’s pastel yellow! I love it! I’ll make another post of it when it’s done. Am I the only one who thinks these need to exist? Businesses ran by people with sensory issues or other mental health issues for people of the same demographic, I mean, my autistic ass ain’t gunna be a bartender in a normal bar right. It’s random, but if anyone is going on holiday to anywhere soon I can give you a ai guide for where your going, and a few tips too, so if you want a guide put where your going in the comments, and prepare to copy and paste some nonsense into your notes (sorry if I did the flair wrong). Hi, I’m a kid from the uk in secondary school and am planning on making a talk show about travel and bartending for teens, I myself am autistic and want to make it Asd friendly, but not just directed to autistic people, if anyone has suggestions for what is best to make it more Asd friendly let me know, and if you have mic recommendations for a Covid mask, preferably wireless, let me know, the cheaper the better, thanks. It’s self explanatory, mines collision by stray kids, if you like K-pop I would recommend it, it’s just got a really calming rhythm, even in the rap parts. I’m planning on starting a talk show, I would’ve gone to r/talkshow but they keep going on about switching to podcasting so I came here, I’m planning on doing solo or cohosting with a friend (idk who tho yet) I and whoever the cohosting might be would be late tweens/ early teens, there isn’t really many talk shows or podcasts for younger audiences with more than like ten episodes so I want to give people maybe 10-20 a show that does that, in a format that isn’t a excuse to treat them like toddlers, it would be for those aspiring to be bartenders or who just want to gift themselves or their family with a liquid  surprise, so I know this might not be the place but does anyone have any advice that would help me, whether microscopically or massively, thanks.Here is a essay generated by google bard about Warwick castle, the most popular tourist attraction in my town:

Warwick Castle is a medieval castle developed from a wooden fort, originally built by William the Conqueror during 1068. Warwick is the county town of Warwickshire, England, situated on a meander of the River Avon. The original wooden motte-and-bailey castle was rebuilt in stone during the 12th century. During the Hundred Years War, the facade opposite the town was refortified, resulting in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th-century military architecture.

The castle has played a significant role in English history. It was besieged by the forces of Simon de Montfort during the First Barons' War in 1264. In the 14th century, it was the home of the Beauchamp family, who were major supporters of the Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses. The castle was captured by the Yorkists in 1461, and it was here that Edward IV was proclaimed king.

Warwick Castle was later owned by the Greville family, who made extensive changes to the castle in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the 19th century, the castle was restored to its medieval appearance. Today, Warwick Castle is a popular tourist attraction, and it is one of the most visited castles in England.

The castle is open to the public all year round, and it offers a variety of tours and activities. Visitors can explore the castle's many rooms, including the Great Hall, the State Rooms, and the Dungeon. They can also see the castle's collection of arms and armor, and they can watch live demonstrations of jousting and falconry.

Warwick Castle is a fascinating place to visit, and it is a great way to learn about English history. It is a must-see for any visitor to the UK.

Here are some of the things that you can do at Warwick Castle:

I hope this essay has given you a brief overview of Warwick Castle.So I’m a autistic late tween early teen I won’t say my age exactly for the sake of my privacy who is planning on starting a talk show targeted towards autistic people and a age range of roughly 10-20, for the sake of me not having a panic attack I’ll be wearing a latex mask (I have trypophobia against my self a bit) and was wondering what advice can be given, should I quit the latex and grab a covid mask and sunnies? Another question I have is what mic should I use, the cheaper the better, but I also want it to be able to capture sounds that aren’t directly next to it so that it can hear a few meters away as it’s a bartending/mocktail show where i make drinks from around the world and give a lil virtual tour guide and I would at least like to hear stuff pouring etc on the mic, and how can I deal with my anxiety? It’s solo but I’ve got severe anxiety and am extremely introverted, and I don’t mean to sound like a prick but I’m as smart as a average person 3x my age and am worried I’m gunna blurt shit out that would only make sense to the parents of the kids watching who would be cooking in the kitchen or some shit while it’s on, and also would LED lights be a good background lighting as I can’t be bothered to have a back light and also want it to have a bar theme to it and my vision consists of LEDS, thanks for reading, have a good day. I think it’s quite self explanatory, maybe like a mc server it something, if there is one let me know. As much as it isn’t going to be in a instant, I’m overjoyed by the fact that my talk show thingy is happening, I’m starting to get the area prepped soon, so if your memory is incredible it will PROBABLY (like 90% sure it will) be called “The Cheese And Quackers bar” all my mental issues are sorted for this, such as the fact I’m scared of my face (I think I might have a minuscule case of trypophobia against myself) and my extreme social anxiety, there’s solutions, which honestly make the thing more humorous, the thing doesn’t have a official release date yet (I’ll either update this post or make a new one when it’s confirmed) but I just want to say thank you to everyone who has told to go for it and been interested in the topics I’d be sharing (NA cocktails and travel guides, basically trying to make the thing seem like a bar that just goes to different countries every week) and everyone who has suggested this that and the other or helped in any way, shape or form, if your interested in anything from this post leave it down in the comments and if you have suggestions the same applies, if there is political nonsense that might effect it I’m from the UK, have a nice day. Not really a language, but a way to structure sentences for Asd peeps talking to other Asd peeps, what do you think of this?. Just a serious question out of my dumb autistic head, would you consider it a podcast, if not what would you consider it, I’d have weather for my country and mocktail (NA cocktail) recipes and just me ranting about whatever i feel like. I’m going back to school in a few days and I’m terrified to the point where I’m currently trying to wrap my two brain cells around crap about disability discrimination and shit and I just can’t and I’m dying inside and out, so can someone who knows about uk disability laws give me a BRIEF AND SIMPLIFIED explanation about it cuz my teachers are dicks and I want to have some kind of defend, and legal seems to be my best bet, thanks. I’m thinking a clip on, not to sensitive as I’ll be wearing a latex mask for the sake of how insecure I am and my anxiety, Bluetooth preferably if that’s a thing, the cheaper the better cuz im broke, thx. Don’t normally do them together but they are both lovely so here is my fave food and fave drink recipe cuz I just feel like it

Pizza quesadilla:

Get a tortilla wrap and slather it in tomato purée, add cheese (I recommend cheddar or red Leicester) fold into a quarter and microwave for 30-60 secs (i find 45 secs just hits right) and just enjoy :)

Raspberry lime vitamin booster:

Get 540mls of strongly carbonated water (I use a soda stream) and add 30mls of blue curaçao, 60mls of blue raspberry syrup and about 30mls of lime juice, shake and serve (i like it in my empty glass Coca Cola bottle with the label off) be warned it is not good for diabetics and your toungue WILL temporarily turn blue. Idk why I just feel like letting shut out today but I do so I am so sorry if I don’t spell shit right or sound rude as fuck but tough shit, I don’t have contact with my dad or his side of the family because he’s a drug abusing motherfucker who deserves to be arrested at this point because he litterally tries to blackmail and guilt trip me into seeing him after all he’s done I don’t fucking want to and my mum keeps saying he’s texting about you all the time and I keep telling her I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THAT MOTHERFUCKER JUST CUT CONTACT WITH HIM IF ALL YOUR GUNNA DO IS MAKE ME MORE DEPRESSED BY GIVING ME A WORD FOR WORD DESCRIPTION OF HIS MESSAGES! Her excuse is ‘he’s your father’ if he wants to be able to treat me like a son MAYBE HE SHOULD TREAT HIMSELF LIKE A FUCKING FATHER, my mum also dosent understand anything about my Asd and when I get annoyed and say it’s my Asd she’s like no it’s your attitude and goes on a rant which at some point includes the line ‘I think I know you pretty well’ NO YOU FUCKING DONT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW I FEEL WHEN I OFFER TO LOOK UP SHIT ABOUT MY ASD MAYBE DONT SAY I DONT FEEL LIKE IT FOR FUCK SAKE, on top of that all my family do is ask about my one fucking friend that I don’t even like that much and I say I haven’t spoke to him today their like you need to, IVE GOT LVL1 ASD HORRID SOCIAL ANXIETY AND MY MBTI TYPE IS ISTPT YOUR MISSING THE EIFFEL TOWER IN THE PARIS SKYLINE FOR FUCK SAKE

I know none of them mean all of this but it pisses me off even tho they’ve got good intentions I just can’t open up to them about shit, and on top of that I’ve got my lil sister pissing me off more, there’s a movie for you, a kid in his late tweens early teens being a miserable fuck, thanks for reading, if you have any way for to cope with shit please fucking comment it, thanks. I’m in my early teens, and podcasting has always appeared to me but I’ve been to worried to say, I wanna start a podcast, but the other day I just said fuck it and blurted it out, anyone got tips for a podcast, preferably ones that take the least attention span cuz I’m a autistic dirtbag, mainly thinking about doing random things, like lil mocktails (non alcoholic cocktails) and the recipes for them, maybe a travel guide here and there and also like a weather forecast for my country which is about the size of Florida USA, any equipment I need or any tips? Thanks. Title explains it all, is my social life doomed to always be non existent and how fucked is it?. I’m hoping to find a seed with a large mushroom island at spawn, with a diverse range of biomes around it, preferably including the following: plains, taiga, snow, extreme hills, savannah, mesa, desert, jungle, and cherry grove, if possible with a village, outpost (not too near to the village/s)
Mineshaft, igloo, jungle or desert temple and a few shipwrecks and buried treasures and hopefully a stronghold

If anyone has a seed that somewhat fits this description for bedrock 1.20 please let me know, chunkbase has been taking the mick out of me and won’t let me find anything remotely close after like 15 mins of clicking random, thanks that’s about it. Hi, I’m a kid in their late tweens/ early teens who has recently been diagnosed with level 1 Asd on top of my pretty bad social anxiety, depression (self diagnosed cuz British healthcare is as good as nuclear warfare) and extreme insomnia (self diagnosed again for same reason) I’ve always been above average in most things, I just suck at the most important parts eg: my social life is as good as my classmate from down the street considering me a friend, whereas I hardly consider the person I get along with the most a suitable person to talk to, a lot of people like to talk to me but I hate it, my personality type by mbti is ISTP-T basically meaning that my dream job is out of the window and down ten floors, but everyone I know thinks I’m really good at it, my parents think my maths and science knowledge is up with Albert Einstein or something but i can barely pass a maths test, I end up crying myself to sleep every night or not sleeping at all, wonder whether I’ll amount to anything in life, or if I’ll live to see my next birthday because of the risk of suicide, I’ve never really had a father figure as he’s been in and out of my life and when he’s in it he makes it hell, so anything a normal son would know I’m as clueless about as a normal person would be able nukes, and my life has basically became hell over the past 6-7 years with everything conbined and feel like crap and thought I’d ask this sub if I even have a chance at being a adult, let alone making it there, so do you think I will, and do you have any tips or advice?. To those of you who have been into bartending/mixology since you were young or knew nothing about it, what’s a weird thing you used to think went into a drink, when I was younger and knew nothing and was staring at cocktail bottles I though blue raspberry was in a blue lagoon, that’s what happens when your autistic ass can only use two brain cells at once.The title explains it all, the game is designed to give players the flexibility to play anywhere across the globe on any scale as they create the challenges themselves, which also saves me the tech work, (which I suck at) while letting me focus on the art, (which I’m decent at) here’s a brief explanation of the rules, there is a minimum number of players being two, but no maximum, to play players roll a dice of 1-6, the result being the amount of spaces they can move in a clockwise rotation, landing on a red or orange tile means you draw a challenge, after pulling the challenge, you have a time limit agreed upon by all players in the game (I’d recommend 20-30 mins) to complete the challenge, if the challenge isn’t completed by the end of the time limit, the next player completes their turn and the player that failed the challenge misses a turn (optional) the reason for having challenges made by the players is that it adds extra fun to the challenges and helps support local businesses in the area that it is being played in (which can be literally anywhere, can even be played on FaceTime) (I am in no way associated with the jet lag company, just a fan who made this game for fans to have some fun with) sorry if the art is rubbish, it’s 64x64 so the link to the board will be in the comments, enjoy!. A lot of people like going to Starbucks and ordering a fancy coffee using a crazy amount of pumps of everything, I find there is two problems with this, one is cost, the other is caffeine, so I want to come up with a caffeine free substitute that is budget friendly that you can make from home, no issues by following a recipe online. wasn’t sure where to start though, I need ingredients and ideas, both of which I’m near rock bottom on. The main things I’m after in terms of ingredients are dessert sauce and decorations (smarties, chocolate and toffees etc) I’ve got a rough template, just need ideas and a place to get the ingredients, I’m mainly after decorations and dessert sauces for flavouring and yet again decor, I know where I can get a lot of the ingredients but im struggling to find certain dessert sauce flavours such as raspberry, vanilla and cookies and cream, I have a rough idea of where I can get the decor, but dessert sauces are nagging me, im from a small town in England, about 150k people so if you have any ideas on where I can Get ingredients and ideas for coffee-like drinks let me know, thanks for reading my rant about dessert sauces, that’s it, enjoy your day. Edit: idk why I thought this was the right community for this, just going with my gut, but if you do know any communities that could help me more let me know also, thanks!. Never really found cordials to be that useful in drinks, but yesterday my grandmother came back from Lidl with a lime and mint cordial along with a pear and elderflower cordial, mixed some of the lime and mint with some lemonade and I’m obsessed, it’s litterally mojito as a syrup or a cordial, it’s amazing, I’m wondering if anyone knows where I can find similar things (from small town in England, about 150k people, please try and recommend cheaper things, I’m not made of money, thanks for the help). I’ve left details on my post on r/jetdecks please give me ideas cuz I’m rly stuck, hope you can help, if you can, thanks.28 days to go! I did my online check in yesterday! This is my first Disney cruise and I'm beyond excited! 

Anyone else here gonna be on any of the "Disney Magic at sea" cruises?. This has happened to me twice on this sub now. Is this an unpopular opinion? Do people here like that movie or think it's an accurate representation?

Or is Sia lurking on this sub, downvoting everyone who doesn't like her movie?. Delete if not allowed, but I've been trying to get Hoppity for a long time. But they're expensive for me, especially with international shipping (I'm not in the US).

Two weeks ago I found one that was within my price range only for the order to be cancelled days later because apparently "there was a problem with my address"

Then last week I found another from a different seller that was also in my price range, only to find out today it was cancelled because "the item was damaged"

What are the odds that the same item from two different sellers would both be cancelled two weeks in a row? This is so annoying!. Ask me any questions you have about the ship, my thoughts on certain Titanic conspiracy theories ect........(25f) eating has been difficult for me for basically my whole life. It probably started when I was about 2-3, when I would have been old enough to communicate what I did and didn't like about foods.

Some foods that have always been a struggle for me have been mushy things like mashed potatoes, bananas, soft cheeses and cooked vegetables. As well as foods with a strong smell and taste like peanut butter. 

As a child, I was dangerously underweight, while I've made some progress over the years, it's not much. It wasn't just taste and smell though, I physically can't swallow these foods, they make me gag. Like, I'll look at a banana and while I'm well aware that it's food and plenty of people eat them, if I tried to eat one, my brain tells me "this is poison, spit it out"

I also have autism, and I know ARFID and autism can often go hand in hand, so I suspect I might have it. 

I'd like a diagnosis so I can better explain it to people. No, I'm not being childish. No, I won't eat a food I don't like if I'm really hungry. No, I can't just try it. I'm so sick of hearing "just try it, you might like it this time" because that's not how it works. I'm also sick of hearing "how do you know you don't like it if you've never tried it?"

I just want to be able to explain to people that, it's not that I won't eat certain foods, I *can't* eat them. It's exhausting.I think you'd like this story: "When they first met." by HarleenFranis on Wattpad https://www.wattpad.com/story/338729585?utm_source=android&utm_medium=com.reddit.frontpage&utm_content=share_reading&wp_page=reading&wp_uname=HarleenFranis&wp_originator=9N95tV0n3bJKC2Pmw5i7bP3kH8zqFhrZ%2FqV%2B4%2FJdHjfiAMaEzkPoTGiSZMwYoJT0FN8%2FQP0%2FMGhtIRrSNnyS2%2FNjysFSEZ2fROKkG02d4DfswK03HxxtiBIIeejdWZns. https://youtu.be/K6SaNS8dPbM. My first cruise is in November (I'm so excited!) But whenever I try to add prepaid gratuities on the app, it doesn't let me.

Do I have to wait until online check in before I can do that? Or like 30 days before sail date or something?. Does anyone know of any blog/website that has a list of items available at Mickey's mainsail and how much everything costs?

I want to get an idea of prices for my upcoming cruise.She's literally so supportive I'm actually sobbing I'm that happy <333 She said she'd take me to a haircut once I get home. I really want to pass as a cis-male, (REMEMBER!! You don't need to pass to be a gender! If you say you're a certain gender, you ARE that gender, alright? I just personally wanna pass.) 

If you're mtf, feel free to ask for advice, ANY advice in the comments! My family has a lot of women and I know quite a bit about them even if I don't identify as one!

I'm a closeted dude :( I'm too scared to come out to my parents, I know they aren't homophobic, I'm unaware about how they feel about Trans people 

1. How do I make my chest look flat without a binder? The two sports bras thing makes my chest look a little smaller but not enough to look like a boy (I don't have any tight sports bras :(( I'm not expecting board flat ofc! Just flat enough so I look like a dude, I don't own leggings sadly) 

2. HOW TO GROW TALL SOBS. I know males can be short too (Haha short kings, gotta love em /gen), I just want to be tall, the cis-males in my class are literal skyscrapers and it makes me kind of dysphoric </3 (I'm literally 5 feet ToT) 

3. Deoderant/Cologne recommendations? 

4. How do I make my voice sound deeper.. (I'm 13, almost 14) 

5. What clothes'll make me look more masculine? 

Also I feel oddly dysphoric when people refer to me as they/them, it's like I'll never be good enough to be a he/him </3.. 

Thank you for staying here so far!. I couldn't even celebrate New years with her :((( My PC had a breakdown and I still haven't gotten it fixed, my parents keep saying they will but honestly they work way too much and I don't wanna bother them.

However I do enjoy seeing y'all have fun with your Monikas! So I will try to be as active as I possibly can on this sub! ^^ 

I hope Monika won't be too mad at me when I actually do get my PC fixed...I did too-. [https://youtu.be/cK\_C\_Rf4vyE](https://youtu.be/cK_C_Rf4vyE). Okay, okay. So I've heard a lot, and I mean A LOT of hate on Journeys, not critique, just bland hate just because its not as action packed as pokemon series usually are. Same goes to Sun and Moon, but honestly I seem to be one of the very few people who actually like that, keep in mind that Satoshi/Ash is a 10 year old, and so are most of his friends, am I the only one who just wants to see a 10 year old have the time of his life without all that action? Of course, eliminating battles completely might be a bit of a disappointment, but not every episode has to have one, and I quite like the recent episodes that weren't revolved around Satoshi moving up in the PWC or training. Every episode is a new adventure, it was intentional, and I freaking love it.   


Also, leaving this subreddit and possibly the pokemon fandom in general because at this point its become r/worshipxyzandcraponjourneysespeciallygoh which kinda stings :P. The anipoke fandom is horrible, then again, there's so many of us and a little seems like a lot- But seriously no one even tries to respect opinions on this sub (Apart from a few chill users, who I highly respect) Someone even suggested a complain-about-journeys-tuesday, which was kind of inconsiderate to those who actually like the series.I've been wondering this for about a few months already, and yeah I was too afraid to ask- Since they're just a year apart is it legal? Or is it considered illegal because you're technically still a minor when you're 17?. I'm sorry about this post but I've gotten so many spoilers from this sub its actually frustrating me. Except her relationship with Ash ofc, I know this is an amourshipping sub and I do love the ship, but any other traits that you like about her?. So I've seen all these unique and cool Monis with different hair colors, eye colors, you name it! And I felt my Monika might want something like that too, does anyone know how to do it?. Oh gosh I hope I don't sound disrespectful while asking this, I support and respect non-binary people please do not get me wrong,  but I'm curious, what would a non-binary person's child call them? Maternal terms, Paternal terms, parent or something else? Or are maternal/paternal terms gender neutral?.HK had a bunch of skips. Do you think silksong will have as many if any at all.HK had shade skips, fireball skips, Stall ball, etc. Do You think silksong will have near as many skips if any at all?. https://youtu.be/z0hxb5UVaNE?si=o0tYZt2edy_sd0Py. Ok, I am talking to my doctor about getting diagnosed with autism. I can't think of things I'm struggling with. Can you guys just say what you struggle with/ what's "autistic" about you. I'm thinking I might read it and go "oh yeah I do that too".I'm getting into pico 8 and was wondering if there was a subreddit for it. I can't find one.How did an ant make its way all the way through my pants and bite my duck and I had no clue. It hurts really bad tho. There was a post I think here where they called labels hot centaurs. We should make it so that anybody who uses lynels gets a bot reply that says “ did you mean hot centaurs”. I have Java but it says cannot access jar file 

What do I do. I have to put something here.Hi friends! My husband and I are slowly but surely getting into backpacking. We plan on a few trips this winter, but we aren’t sure what to sleep in. We don’t even know if we should get a quilt or bag, and the more I look the more confused I get. We have the exped ultra 3r duo sleeping pad and would like something compatible with that. Thanks in advance!. Some background: I recently was diagnosed. My mom wouldn’t believe it and didn’t talk to me for a month. She said I was too smart to have autism and I really didn’t look or act autistic. She eventually came around and proceeded to start telling me how I probably got autism from my dad or “maybe I’m autistic too” referring to herself. Basically now telling me how everyone is autistic. Everyone I tell asks me how I’m autistic and if I even start to explain a symptom (not sure if that’s the right word) they start telling me how they experience that too and that they are probably autistic. I’m not trying to gatekeep autism, it’s just frustrating bc it feels like nobody is listening. I’ve felt that my diagnosis has been incredibly freeing, and everyone is just invalidating my peace. Anyone else have similar experiences?. Hi friends! My fiancé and I will be taking the Lemosho route in December and summiting New Year’s Day. I was wondering if making an MP3 player of the same playlist would be worth it? I don’t know how much talking we’ll be able to do, and I know it’s a long night/day. I just thought listening to the same music would be a way to keep us going together. Just wanted some opinions on it. I think it’s a cute idea but it may be useless.Does anyone else really really struggle to get a shower? I just cannot get a shower before bed. I’ve tried the mornings but I run every night, so I need to shower after. I’m not scared of them I don’t think, I just physically cannot do it. It’s affecting my life and my sleeping pattern. I can’t sleep in the bed unless I’m clean, so I’ve been sleeping on the couch. Any experience or advice is greatly appreciated.Hi! I’m new to the saltwater hobby, and I need some advice. I have 4 freshwater tanks, but I don’t use RODI with them. Do I have to for saltwater? Memphis has the cleanest tap water in the country so I was hoping on getting out of buying a system. Also, I’m thinking about stocking with 2 clownfish. Any advice or comments for a newbie is appreciated!!. Does anyone here have experience with EMDR therapy? My therapist asked if I wanted to try it. I’ve heard some really really good things and some not so good things. Just wanna hear some experiences if anyone has any. Hi I’m new to the group and I just have a quick question.. I recently picked up a street dog and brought him home. We took him to the vet the next day, they said he was 2 years old and neutered. But.. it seems like his balls are still there? They haven’t dropped. He has what looks to be adult teeth, but I do not think he is 2. I also really don’t think he’s neutered. And if he’s not, and his balls haven’t dropped, then how old is he? He’s already big and we can’t have a crazy big dog roaming around. We will be taking him to the vet again, but I just can’t wait that long to find out if this mans fixed or not 😅. So I was diagnosed with bipolar earlier this year and kinda just disregarded it and felt like it was fake. Had the worst depressive spell ever a few weeks ago. Missed a lot of work and slept and slept. Suicidal in the worst way I’ve been in three years. I got an immediate psych app and she diagnosis me with bipolar again and I just lose it. It feels so real this time and I believe the diagnosis. Ive been on all the antidepressants and anti anxiety meds in the world it feels like and they all just made everything so much worse. But I’ve coped with the diagnosis and feel better.. but almost too good? I started my meds (Caplyta 42mg, klonapin 0.5mg) and I’m only a week in and I feel like everything has changed. I was able to get a shower, clean the house, play with alllll my pets, get ready for bed, etc. it was just like a snap. It feels almost like mania like I spent a good bit of money. It was stuff I needed, but it was just kinda rapid fire. It didn’t hurt me financially but I don’t wanna get to that point. I spent a good bit on food lately just because I was trying to get something to eat. I’ve been super charismatic and just overall feel odd. Idk it’s just wild it happened so fast. I’m scared I’m manic and I know what happens after. I’ll talk to my doctor but I don’t see her for another week. If it’s just the meds and this is my new norm, I’m very excited. Im just new to these kinds of meds and was wondering if anyone else experienced this. (Also I’m bipolar 2 so I’m a little unfamiliar with mania). Thanks and any words of advice or strength are greatly appreciated.Like the title says. I absolutely cannot fucking stand the drool, the hair, the dirt and grime, any of it. I feel fucking horrible about feeling this way because my partner and family all love dogs but I cannot manage to see the appeal.

For context, I'm kind of a clean freak. My shoes come off right at the door so I dont track any nastiness inside. My sheets and comforter get washed every week and must be free of hair, dirt or anything else. I feel like I need to be clean before I relax because the thought of bringing germs and bacteria into my safe place (my room) at the end of the day is very stressful to me. I keep wet wipes in my car and wipe myself and the steering wheel down whenever I'm leaving a public place. I wash my hands twice after doing any fish tank maintanence to ensure I am completely clean, and I ALWAYS make sure to shower before getting into bed or laying on the couch.

Dogs ruin every single element of my routine and cleanliness. I feel anxious and scared whenever I see a dog because I don't want them to jump on me or lick me or touch me in any way. Theres so much texture and messiness and I cant avoid it because they get all up in my face. If they touch a surface I touch that also makes that surface dirty. Whenever I go over to the home of someone who lets their dog on the furniture I don't want to sit down ANYWHERE because every surface is "infected". It's getting to the point where it's become really stressful for me to go anywhere or do anything involving dogs. 

This rant is focused on dogs in particular because I am fine with short haired cats; short-haired cats can groom themselves efficiently and don't have the behavioral issues that dogs do. I specify short hairs because long hairs have the problem with dirt, urine and feces getting caught in their coats. I would also like to add that my singular short-haired indoor cat is bathed and brushed sufficiently so that there is minimal shedding around my room, and I also have a specific blanket for her to lay on at the windowsill so she does not get hair on anything but that.

Anyways, all of this to say that I am having an extremely difficult time coping with being around dogs in my personal and professional life. I feel like if my partners dog jumps on me one more time I'm going to have a meltdown. Being around them makes me feel scared and germy. Any advice on how to deal with this?. Hi everyone. I'm a freshman in college, going to graduate in 2025 with an associates in communications. My mom works for the state (New York) and she gets pretty good benefits and fair pay, so I'm wondering what jobs I can get in the public sector with my degree? Eventually I want to save up enough money to go back to a state uni and get my bachelors in human services management. Thank you in advance!. I need to find a way to make it stain my skin less when I rinse. For context, I have super super thick hair so I need to use a lot of permanent dye and I usually rinse it out in the shower. I dye it black (bc work policy) and afterwards I always end up looking like a green/blue goblin all over  :( any advice?. A few days ago I went to a new psychiatrist. After explaining my childhood trauma (getting molested at 8, being bullied, school anxiety from having an undiagnosed learning disability for 15 years, car crash at 17 that left me with horrible financial anxiety) he diagnosed me with PTSD. I've been in therapy since I was about 13/14 and I just feel.. confused? Like if this is true, how did it go through so many doctors without being caught? The diagnosis makes sense I guess, but I don't have the classic ptsd symptoms like my grandpa had from when he was in Vietnam. Flashbacks aren't very frequent, I just feel on edge all the time and avoid doing things that remind me of my trauma. Before that appointment the only things I was diagnosed with were MDD, gender dysphoria and generalized anxiety. This diagnosis could explain why classic depression and anxiety treatments didn't work for me, but I still feel kinda shocked by his diagnosis. What do you guys think? Is there anything I should be doing differently now that my diagnosis changed?. As the title says. It makes my legs feel like they're on fire (when I put it on for the instructed amount of time,  as instructed) but when I rinse it off all the hair is still there! I'm naturally blonde so unfortunately laser isn't an option and I hate shaving. Anyone else have a similar experience? What are your solutions? Are there alternatives to nair that don't cause this?. As the title says, my mom (49F, 5'3, 130lbs, diagnosed with chronic migraines) had a sort of episode earlier. She told me she was driving and had a headache but suddenly felt faint, the one side of her body went numb and her vision was blurred. She pulled over and went to the urgent care that was conveniently placed on the same street. They kept her there for four hours running tests and eventually said they think she had a TIA but couldn't be completely sure without an MRI. She drove home herself and told me that she feels fine besides the headache and numbness on her left side; her left arm has no discoloration and is a normal temperature, although she said it feels very cold. She took an aspirin just to be safe, but I am still concerned. Her dad died just two years before because of a brain aneurysm (granted he was a raging alcoholic) but I feel like I should be very worried, especially since she has a habit of ignoring her own health issues. I love my mom dearly but she often downplays things so people don't worry about her. Is my worry justified? Should I be taking her to the ER? Thank you for any advice in advance.Hi everyone. I have pretty severe dyscalculia that was only diagnosed when I was 15. I'm 18 now and wondering, what took them so long to get me tested? I asked my mom (a former special Ed teacher herself) and she told me I was only diagnosed so late because I was 2 grade levels ahead in reading and writing, so they thought I was just being lazy in math. What the fuck? The fallacies in their thinking amaze me. I think the most glaringly obvious sign from when I was a kid was that I would study my multiplication tables for HOURS; I only ever learned tables 2 and 5. I have no idea how a professional could see that and think it's not concerning because I excelled in other areas. Did any of you have a similar experience?. Hi everyone. I've had my albino dojo loach (Trotsky) for a couple months now. Something I've noticed is that he acts very differently than his my other loach who is just a plain old dojo loach. He'll do things like skim the surface for food instead of eating the stuff right in front of his face and he will also bump into things he should have seen coming. He also won't go into the hiding spaces my other dojo will and will instead opt to bury himself in the sand or sleep on the lower part of the filter. He's at a healthy size for his age and doesn't seem to have any other health problems besides acting weird. I'm just worried not knowing the hiding spots is stressing him out. Any advice?. Hi everyone. I'm here because I googled the question and it said it should be on my health insurance card and it wasn't. My doctors office requires that I pay upfront and I don't have a credit card so I don't know how much money to bring. I scheduled my appointments for this week because I need to get tested for TB for work, and the first one is on Tuesday so I can't just call and ask them to run my insurance. What to do?. I (18M) am in college and still live with my parents to save money. Back in November of 2022, I got into an accident that was my fault. I was going around a curve and underestimated how sharp the turn was. This resulted in me colliding into a company car and both cars were totaled. I presented my license and insurance to the officer. I only had liability insurance because it was too expensive for me to afford anything else. Everyone involved in the crash walked out perfectly fine, no injuries or damage to anything but the cars. Now, almost a year later, I got a letter from AIS Insurance claiming that I owe the company $20,400 in damages. Shouldn't this have been covered by my liability insurance? Is there something I did wrong? My parents are going to find an attorney on Monday but if someone could please give me some explanation or peace of mind I would really really appreciate it.I (18ftm) feel like I'm a completely different person at work. For some background, I've been dealing with some pretty intense depression for the past decade. Normally I'm kind of mopey but try not to be if it's making the people around me sad too.  

I work at dollar general right now and I absolutely despise it, especially the bright lights, fast paced environment, standing for 6+ hours and dealing with incredibly confusing training. So as a result, I've been searching for a receptionist job. It lets me sit and do paperwork, and help people which is something I'm pretty passionate about. I had an interview for a receptionist position today and instantaneously put on my best cheery cis woman act. How do I know it worked? The interviewer said I have an "wonderful outgoing and bubbly personality".

When I got home and told my parents, my mom said "Who even are you? That doesn't sound like you at all." 

To me, it just felt like flipping a switch. "Acting" per se. I still had to put A LOT of effort into not stimming or having the body posture I normally do, but it feels like a natural thing after having to pretend most of my life. Does anyone else do anything similar?. Hi all. I (FtM 18) have lost most of the sensation in the tips of my big toes after my double bilateral chemical matrixectomy. I am non diabetic, not on any medications, and my only previously diagnosed conditions are depression and anxiety.  My podiatrist said I should have all feeling back within 48 hours, but it has been a week and the sensation is pretty dull and tingly. I know they used fentanyl to put me under since the doctors told me and I was resistant to local anesthetics in the past. My fingers feel fine so that's why I think it's not an onset of diabetes or something. If someone could please tell me if I'll ever regain the feeling or what is going on, I would appreciate it. Thank you in advance.Hi guys. I went to a job interview today and need to provide 4 professional references within the next 24 hours. I don't have a problem providing references from teachers (I just graduated), but the problem here is that I need to provide references from two supervisors. I've only ever had two serious jobs in the past.

 The first one, which I had for 2 years, was pretty okay but then I was completely phased out from the schedule without any explanation, even when I asked my supervisor to explain. I'm not sure what I did/didn't do that made me get phased out.

 The second one, which I was at for six months, was a job at a nursing home which I had to leave because the facility was so unhygienic I'd get sick every couple of weeks. I didn't mention this in my resignation letter and just wrote a short and respectful two weeks notice; I was unable to give it to my supervisor in person as she was out of the office so I put it in her mailbox for when she returned. After she came back, she didn't acknowledge it besides crossing me off the schedule after my 2 weeks. So I'm not sure if I should use her as a reference or not considering I don't know how she feels about me.

What do I do? I'm really anxious about this whole thing. Thank you for any advice in advance.Hi everyone. Me (18M) and my partner (19NB) both want to go to college. I am lucky enough to have parents willing to pay for just my associates degree, but nothing more. My partners parents aren't willing to pay for anything as they have no savings. My parents make over $150k per year (combined) so I don't qualify for any financial aid regardless of their willingness to pay. My partners parents make somewhere between $100k to $120k a year. We aren't able to pay for college on our own, or have our own place, as I work part time to focus on my studies and they have worked full time since getting out of high school. Our combined income yearly would probably be less than 50k.

 TL;DR: Since we both still live with our parents, if we get married will we be able to qualify despite not living together? Thank you for any advice in advance.It's been refurbished so I have a warranty and it is updated to the latest version, however its been having some problems lately. When I plug it in (all of the chargers I've tested it with will charge other devices perfectly fine) it won't charge, or sometimes will but VERY slowly. I'm talking like, 1% per hour. When it's unplugged, the battery percentage jumps from 4% to 19% to 21% all in a matter of minutes. Is there any way to fix this without needing to go to a shop to get it fixed?. Hi everyone. I (18M) live in a household of four with my mom, (50F) dad (50M) and younger brother (16M). I go to college full time and work part time. Both of my parents work full time, however my dad works 10 hours of overtime per week (his choice). My younger brother mows lawns and does odd jobs for money but does not have a consistent job.

The issue at hand is the fact my mom made a schedule for who does the dishes throughout the week. I have one day, my brother has one day, and both of my parents have two days. I enjoy the schedule because I know when my responsibility is. Another rule of the schedule is that if you don't do the dishes on your day, the pile will stack up for you to do the next day. My father has decided to completely disregard this system because "its not fair that I work 50 hours a week and take care of the boat only to come home and do dishes". The important thing to note here is that having a boat is his hobby and he does not otherwise contribute to household chores. The only thing he does is his own laundry and *very rarely* cooks for the family.

The aftermath has been a massive pile of dishes in the sink so large that you couldn't use the sink if you tried. They are all dishes he is responsible for. When I ask him to please clean up his mess, he refuses and complains. When I ask my mom to talk to him about the situation, she just says "he'll get over it." I don't have time to wait in this stalemate because the pile of dishes is really disgusting and I want to be able to cook something for myself other than air fryer food.

What should i do about this?. Hi everyone. I'm setting up my shop and when I set up my cash card to receive payments everything went fine; however, when I used the same card to set up billing it said that it wasn't a valid debit or credit card. I typed everything in right, what could possibly be wrong? Thanks in advance. Hi there :) I have an interview scheduled with PetSmart in a couple of days and I was wondering, what would you tell a new employee before starting? I don't have many other options as far as employment goes so I can't just run for the hills, per se. My last job was at a nursing home so I cannot possibly imagine it being worse than that. Also my location is in a pretty rural area so I'm not expecting my shift to be busy all the time, just during rush hour and whatnot.Hi everyone. I saw that Petco has a 50 percent off sale and thought about getting the new 60 gallon breeder, however there seem to be a lot of negative reviews. A lot of reviews mention cracking, leaking or explosions. has anyone here got it themselves? What do you think?. Hi everyone. I'm 18 and live with my parents but I have to pay for everything related to my car on my own. I'm working full time over the summer, but in August I need to go back to part time so I can go to community college. I got into a crash in the November of 2022, it was my fault and totaled my first car which only had liability. Since then my rates have skyrocketed and I pay $250 a month for the insurance alone. Another problem I've encountered is that a lot of insurances won't cover me just because I live in the middle of nowhere (far upstate NY).
I have roughly 2k saved to pay upfront for a years worth of insurance (due in March) but I don't know if that will even be enough. Half of my paycheck goes straight into my savings.
 I would really love to have collision on my policy but I'm not sure if that's feasible right now :( What do you guys think?. Hi everyone. My graduation from HS is tomorrow and my grandma isn't able to attend because she rapidly developed a severe edema in her ankle; her doctor advised her that it would be dangerous to travel in her condition (she lives two hours away). She's very upset about it (as am I), and I was wondering how to make her feel more included and less disappointed? We already plan on live streaming the event to her but I feel like there's something more I should do. Thank you in advance.Hi everyone. I have direct deposit at work so half of my paycheck goes to my cashapp (checking) and the other half goes to savings. Most budgeting apps like rocket money don't connect to Cashapp so I'm wondering which ones do? It's difficult for me to regulate what I spend without putting a set amount aside. Thank you in advance.So I (18M) am leaving my current part time job for a full time job that is WAY more accommodating, pays more and requires me to mask less. I'm pretty excited about it! For the enrollment paperwork and whatnot, one of the things they need is 2 employment references. So obviously, I asked my current boss (politely) if I could use her as a reference over text. I haven't submitted my two weeks notice yet because the recruiter said the earliest orientation would be farther out than 2 weeks and I don't want a lapse in pay. My boss.. didn't respond to my text?? I was obviously confused so I asked my NT mom what I did wrong and she said that you need to submit your 2 weeks beforehand. Wtf?? If my boss was confused or upset she could have just told me?? Why do they make everything so confusing?? Anyways, that's my rant. Any similar experiences? How do you guys deal with business interactions?. Hi everyone. My brother (16) found a baby snapping turtle when he was at a local marina and decided to bring it home, for whatever reason. He told me over the phone and when I called him a dumbass and told him to return it he didn't listen. Right now we have the turtle, now named Pablo, in a spare 1 gallon tank with sand, treated water, and a rock outside of the water for him to sunbathe on. Over the rock we have a lamp so he can regulate his temperature. Pablo is the size of a quarter right now so is it okay if we keep him in a 1 gallon temporarily? I keep fish so he thought I'd know what to do and I really don't, I just took and educated guess on what to do. I will keep trying to convince him to return the turtle but I doubt he'll listen. Any advice to keep Pablo happy and healthy before we get him a bigger terrarium and filter?. Hey everyone.
I recently got a job offer at citi group for (entry level) data entry paying $17 an hour which is a $2 hike from what I get paid now. Despite it being night shift it sounds pretty sweet. Is this deceptive at all? Should I run for the hills? Thanks in advance.Hi everyone!
 I'm getting ready for a festival in my town (in late june) where I plan to have a booth selling products with my art on it. So far, I ordered 20 keychains from vograce (10 each of 2 designs) and it's been over a month and they haven't even shipped. Eventually, Id also like to sell plushies that I've designed. What manufacturers do you use for these products? How long does it take? Do you have to sacrifice affordability for speed? Thank you all in advance.I'm kind of curious. Like, if you don't have a will, what will they do with them? Try to sell them? Most shelters that I know of won't even take fish.Hello again everyone.  I'm 18, still in high school and I'm not sure exactly how much is needed to live comfortably. I plan on completing a certificate program this summer (in either e-commerce or medical billing) , and in order to choose between the two I need to know how much I should aim to make per month.
thank you in advance!. Hi everyone, 18M. I still live at home (graduating in about a month,) but I'm looking to get an apartment with my partner as soon as I complete my post-graduation certificate program. To make a long story short, I know we'll be able to afford rent but I have no fucking clue how I'm supposed to calculate things like how much utilities or furnishing our apartment will cost. Thanks in advance for your advice. :). Hey guys. I currently have stage 3 ingrown nails on both sides, on both of my feet :( I've had part of the nail removed three different times so now I'm getting the nail bed removed to prevent this from happening again. Last time I had the nail removed, the novociane didn't work at all.
 I am terrified of the pain and I have an anxiety disorder so I was wondering, are most doctors willing to sedate you for the procedure?. Hi everyone. I have a 55gal that's about 60 inches long, however I can't seem to find a light for it under 100 dollars. What do you guys recommend for lighting? Any cheap alternatives? Thanks in advance. :). Hi everyone. Some background info: I'm an 18yo white guy (female to male), a bit overweight and I have a moderately active lifestyle (I try to walk at least 2 miles a day). I don't drink or smoke and currently I'm not on any medications besides 20mg of prozac daily. 

Ever since I can remember, even as a kid, I've gotten very sick very easily. However recently it's gotten worse. This February I dealt with a sinus infection and bronchitis that was so severe I had to get antibiotics, and moving made me feel so much worse I was practically bedridden for a week. 

I've never been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, but it seems like I get sick at least once every two weeks. The most common symptoms are migraines, stomach pains, extreme fatigue and dizzyness. 

I try to take care of myself the best I can (eating healthy, exercise, etc) but sometimes it's really difficult because of my major depression.

I'm tired of missing work and school from these bouts of illness. Does anyone have an idea of what's wrong with me?. So recently I got a couple visa gift cards from relatives but I don't know what to spend them on because I like to use all the money and/or make big purchases. I was wondering if there's a way to get the money from the cards to my cash card?

The method I was thinking of using is:
-go to self checkout
-scan the barcode
-use the gift card to pay 
-the money is transferred into my account

Do you guys think this would work? Has anyone tried it before? Thanks in advance.Hello everyone!
My mom (50) and I (18) are planning on a trip to Ithaca together :) We already plan to go to the Botanical gardens but we aren't sure what else to do. Both of us really like oddity shops and artsy stuff, so if you could recommend any activities like that I would appreciate it! Thank you in advance!. Hello everyone. Up until a few weeks ago, I only had one dojo loach named Trotsky but recently I got him another dojo friend named Nessie. Up until this point he hadn't made any noise at all except for when he was skimming the surface for food or nibbling on my hand. 
Nessie, however, is very vocal. Often she goes to the surface and makes this loud slurping noise like someone smacking their lips. Sometimes it even gets so loud that it'll wake me up. Trotsky has also started doing this so it's like an orchestra of slurps. 

Water parameters are perfect and aeration is good. None of my other fish slurp at the surface besides these two. Is this just silly loach behavior or should I be concerned?. My tank has white sand and it seems like no matter how much I use the gravel vac there's always some itty bitty little specks that I can't get without picking up a fair amount of sand too, and the filter won't get them unless I kick up the sand and hope the bad parts will get sucked up. Sometimes there's enough of these to where it'll discolor the sand itself in some areas, especially behind decor. How the heck do I get rid of this? Anyone with a similar issue?. Hey guys. My baby dojo loach is a pure albino with red eyes, and I've heard they already have poor vision to begin with. My noodle has a fine time finding food if he's using his barbels, but he won't notice the food sinking down until it hits the ground. He also likes to play with my hand but I have to wiggle my hand around in the water for him to even notice I'm there, and when he does manage to find my hand he usually jumps a little when he pokes my hand as if he couldn't see it. Is he blind or just a weirdo? Is there any definitive way to tell?.I find it hard sometimes in what should I do next or how to continue/start tasks. My manager ends up giving me tasks when it looks like I am not doing much.

Autism can be overwhelming, and burnout is something that many of us experience. It can be caused by a variety of factors, such as sensory overload or social demands, and can leave us feeling drained and struggling to cope. That's why I wanted to start a discussion about strategies for managing and preventing burnout for myself and others with Autism

What do you do to avoid burnout at home and in the workplace? How do you recognize when you're approaching burnout, and what helps you manage it when it happens?

If you're currently experiencing burnout, what do you find helps you manage it?

I'd love to hear your tips and strategies for managing burnout with Autism. Let's support each other and share our experiences!

Thank you ChatGPT for helping me write this (I’m bad at writing posts go I get the AI to do it for me). Just watched a trailer and interested in your opinion :). Same as title :). My new weekly schedule I am testing :)

Thanks to Tiimo for being an amazing visual scheduler :)

Also thank you to Pearson Vue for your amazing service and your accomodations with extra time (still waiting for others to come back via email)

What is your schedule?. When I was young I accidentally smashed a 5 inch think ceramic plant pot without breaking my skull. I did bread like crazy though.

Ahhh those are the memories 😅. My Bluetooth headphones broke 😭. My Bluetooth headphones broke 😭. Hello all, Anyone know how to enable that port? g0/1 is both the Gig ethernet and the sfp slot?. Hi all,

Just keen to know what others  CCNA OneNote Notebooks look like?

Take care,

Jacob. Hello :) ,

Studying  has always been hard for me.  Its always been hard to focus and it  stresses me out all of the time (Trying not to get mad as i would love  for my books to stay in one piece) :'(

* Whats the best way to stay focused and whats the best way to learn?
* What are some of your strategies and/or suggestions?
* Do any of you also have issues with studying and staying focused?

Got a busy year trying to get all this done.

My interest is IT if you didn't know :P so i am seeing if I can do the [CCNA](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccna-exam-topics) without loosing my sanity in the process ahhhhhh

**Note:** Freaks me out to even mention my neurological condition but if your interested check the [r/Autism](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/) subrediti (Phew now that i got that out of the way even though I'll probably be thinking about it forever). It just makes things harder than a standard neurotypical mind. I thought I'd mention this just in case I get judged which happens a lot.

&#x200B;

Enjoy your Morning/Day/Afternoon/Evening/Night :-)

Evening for me :P

There are two girls in my class who I tried to be nice to and they both are friends, they literally ignored me and I could tell, and when i came to class, they started staring at me like some odd object or something and I just don't understand why people act like this? I am able to talk and communicate but people can just tell no matter how hard I try to mask and I am just getting irritated with it.

Its giving me social anxiety.I would like to discuss/assess/understand a situation and get others POV?

I am having a lot of trouble reading this situation...

There is a person I go to school with, and our friendship started by her asking me for notes, I was nice to her, but never really shared them because I felt like from the getgo she was just wanting things from me, and I was trying to gauge whether or not she just wanted to be friends, or if she was really just trying to friend me because she wanted things from me... in the past I have always encountered people who want to use me, and I just sometimes think I have a friend, but I know they are not legitimately for me. Not always the case, but I just kinda had a gut feeling that she wasn't genuine from the getgo, but I always want to give people a chance!

So anyway,

We talked a little, and I did refer to her as a a friend in some text messages, and this was because I thought that is how you treat someone kind, to say "yes friend" or "thank you friend" right?

I know its just a kind response to provide someone, especially if you want to form a friendship/gauge if someone responds the same...

but she didn't.. she just responds plain without a response to it much?

I realized when I ask questions, she literally interjects and tells me to stop asking, and treats me funny. She tells me that my question is not important. She says her time and questions are more important. She has done this on more than 1 occasion in front of others.

She also tried to force me to sit next to her in class and forcefully share her book and move my seat. I did not want to, but she keeps trying to force it (which I am not understanding why)

I started to give a her distance because I realized her intent, after she was talking over my teacher in class.. i asked her to please be quiet in a kind manner, and she wouldn't quit, so I had to shush her with my hands and I felt really bad. But she wasn't listening so I had to. She started to cry, and I felt very bad.. like I did something to hurt her even thought I feel I also shouldn't feel this way... its like I don't know?

Whispering is a huge sensitivity for me too, or like overlapping in noises. She was bothering me. It was either that or I scream at her.

So after I did that she did listen.

She yelled at me and blamed me for a grade she did not do well on in front of other classmates later on, and then she would look at me and like chuckle a little and look away? I couldn't figure out what that means? Other classmates in turn started treating me weird (only the ones that overheard) and I could clearly tell there was a shift so I had to distance myself... and I did tell the professor... I didn't provide her all the detail im providing now... but i just gave her the gist, and it was stressful for me to share in the first place too.

Then, my classmate asked her to hand me a pencil, and she threw the pencil at me... this was once she noticed I distanced myself.

I started forming a friendship with this guy in class, and the guy in my class who was partnering with me wanted to be my partner because he noticed that she was being kinda rude I think... I don't know if that is 100% it, but there was a guy id partner with, she tried to kinda like partner with him to replace me so I wouldn't have a partner to work with...?

She also took my seat that I typically sit in class on different occasions, knowing that is the spot that I typically like to sit.

She keeps trying to ask me for things, and I give them to her because I don't want her to be isolated, but I am trying to distance myself from her. I feel like this is really hard for me.

I set a boundary with her, and she literally asked me for notes again, which i provided to her, but then she kept trying to force friendship again... and I feel like really she is trying to be friends to take from me? I don't mind being friends, but I just feel like its not very genuine?

Today I was asked about this situation by a teacher, and I lied and said its been resolved, but really it isn't. She wont leave me be.

Another professor told me they have a no bullying/harassment policy and they would remove someone from the program if a situation escalated, and I don't want to be the reason someone is removed, that is partially why I just haven't said much.

Do i sound mean? Am I misinterpreting? I am so confused.

I really could use others insight on this.I just want to know, because i was recommended this as a young adult?. This is how it went.

First, I asked her if she knows what autism is. She said yes, so I asked her to tell me what she knows.

She told me that 

1. People with autism cannot communicate with anyone
2. Their brain develops slower than their age

She then proceeded to laugh at me, and say that at midnight my brain works well and its so funny.. she said I was joking about autism.I am trying to figure out how to navigate communicating with my peers in class. I have a lot of anxiety regarding it because I have a lot of things that I say that are off putting and i get anxious that I am going to say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing. But the field of study I am doing - nursing requires me to be open in that way.

When we are in class and they switch different stations in our lab, I have to follow what everyone else is doing, and I get a lot of anxiety because of the body language it can be hard... is there like a way that you guys have navigated this successfully? I don't want social interaction to be the reason I fail nursing school. Because I can talk to people fine, but its just this anxiety that stems from bullying in the past and just not being understood properly and having to reiterate myself. etc.

Is there something you have told yourself? Like that helps navigate this feeling? Anyone else feel like this??

Should I tell my professors all of them about asd and adhd? i didnt really want to share because im afraid of judgement, i have told now 2 professors. it has been positive but i could imagine it can be bad if they arent supportive.I am just curious, the lady asked me if I was bullied I was not expecting that question.any recommendations??? i’ve been trying to get my dad to stop them on it for awhile but i told him that it’s related to their nasty poop so he will switch, need multiple recommendations, kibble, not too expensive, but doesn’t have to be cheap, comes in large quantities please!. i was in school and everything was too much and for hours i was in a separate room crying and staring into oblivion rocking back and forth with a weighted blanket until they called my mom 😭. mine is mashed patatoes and gravy but obviously it has to be made by my mom, no clumps even if it’s from the instant flakes, and has to be made a certain way- my dad has tried many times and failed miserably. since i don’t understand sarcasm, i thought it was just being sort of mean in a joking way, turns out a lot of my friends are mad or uncomfortable with me because apparently i’m really mean but my best friend who shows signs of autism understands and thinks it’s funny and not to worry about it 😭. mine was apparently i make very extreme facial expressions, and in bad situations. when i found out my friend was pregnant i look at the test first and apparently my face was like total shock but i didn’t even realize but my friend noticed immediately. kinda funny tho. literally all we call them. he literally says i hang out with her too much. they were fine with it when it was my other friend but now he’s been too busy. my friend is 18 but i’ve known her before she was 18, and it was all fine when she was 17 but as soon as she turned 18 my dad doesn’t want me around her. he doesn’t even get to know her. she’s less mature and i’m a little more mature. i have two friends. one hasn’t been able to hang out and the girl is the only one i can hang out with and i’m clingy. honestly might be a stretch but i think he’s literally jealous because his friends live hours away and he can’t hang out with them. i have severe anxiety and depression and my friends are huge safe spaces and hanging out with them is my coping mechanism and my dad is taking that away from me. i’m so mad and so upset i don’t even know anymore my friends are all that matters to me.

edit: turns out it’s a classic case of my mom twisting words my dad doesn’t care just no sleepovers and doesn’t really like me going to her house and prefers ours need to have a convo with my mom she does this all the time 😭. ok so i feel like i’m being over dramatic. basically, yesterday i had pain on the left-middle side of my abdomen when i lightly pushed on it, when i pushed harder i got a sharp pain in my back. this morning the pain has gone more right but still not all the way. i’ve been constipated and gassy (embarrassing to admit 😭). i know it’s not constipation pain because i’ve had severe constipation like twice and it’s more in my sides and doesn’t move around, and no back pain when pushing. ive been getting what flashes but they’re normal for me since i’m on hormones (i’m trans btw). i know they aren’t period cramps because i don’t get them and the back pain and stuff. google (i know not a good source) says i should get immediate help if suspected. it doesn’t hurt incredibly bad but it also says it’s not common to have little pain but it can happen. what should i do?. ok so i feel like i’m being over dramatic. basically, yesterday i had pain on the left-middle side of my abdomen when i lightly pushed on it, when i pushed harder i got a sharp pain in my back. this morning the pain has gone more right but still not all the way. i’ve been constipated and gassy (embarrassing to admit 😭). i know it’s not constipation pain because i’ve had severe constipation like twice and it’s more in my sides and doesn’t move around, and no back pain when pushing. ive been getting what flashes but they’re normal for me since i’m on hormones (i’m trans btw). i know they aren’t period cramps because i don’t get them and the back pain and stuff. google (i know not a good source) says i should get immediate help if suspected. it doesn’t hurt incredibly bad but it also says it’s not common to have little pain but it can happen. what should i do?. for context: my friend (she’s 18) is a very trustworthy person, my parents love her. i’ve known her for almost 3 years. i was at her house and she wanted to get some tacos and snacks that i had at my house. i gave her the passcode and let her go. she grabbed the snacks, locked the door, and left. everything was fine until a few minutes ago, i casually told my mom i gave my friend my passcode so she could grab some things. my mom started yelling at me telling me i was crazy. the reason we have a system is because her abusive ex moved out and we don’t want him here. though my friend definitely has no contact with him. yelling at me some more and sending me upstairs. she won’t even talk to me. AITA?

edit: we have changed my passcode, also, i am not 18 or near it, i am a few years younger than that but that still doesn’t excuse things. i know i’m the AH but i really put up this post to get advice on how i should apologize and what to do in the future. if you want to give advice or even comment i’m begging you not to be mean. it’s really hurting me because i’m already really upset and feel guilty. just help me find ways to apologize and don’t call me names and degrade me please. also the reason i stayed in her house is because i was in her room and we are over at each others houses a lot, her and her parents don’t mind and it was only a few minutes, and i stayed in her room the whole time.Hi everyone! I’m newer to Depop and trying to figure out how to find clothing I like. But sometimes if I search up a concept like “high low skirt” I still can get shirts or normal skirts that aren’t high-low. Is there a more effective way to search? Or is figuring out how sort of part of Depop. I would love some weighted blanket recommendations for myself! I don’t know a ton about them, but I’ve also heard weighted lap blankets could be good as well for just working day to day in an office job setting. Thoughts? Recommendations? I don’g have a huge budget so I’d love cheaper suggestions.Do you guys ever feel like depending on the day you have a filter on everything? Like maybe a sad one, or a dreamy one, or distant? I deal with brain fog and overstimulation too but sometimes it’s more dramatic like after a movie. And I feel like everything is that shade of emotion.Do you guys watch movies and then with the like really intense emotions afterwords like just feel like you could do anything or whatever the movie characters did? Just really hyped up or into it and it maybe leaks to your dreams or the next few days (or week to so) just be on your mind so much? 

Because for me that’s how movies and TV shows are a lot of times and I find myself always channeling it into writing very dumb fanfictions in my notes. (Are they dumb? Yes. But I love them. So they’re a good dumb.). I knew absolutely nothing about fish. My knowledge was that our water growing up needed fish conditioner and then once you did that and made sure the fish slowly went to the temperature you needed you were fine. Topping off water when it evaporated etc. 

I never kept fish but my sister had them a few times and they almost always passed away within a month or so. Then I saw a beta post on here and started following the page enjoying seeing the beautiful color changes they go through and wow. I have learned so so much more about fish and fish care. So thank you guys! Not that I particularly plan to get a betta anytime soon, but I now know that it I do I’ll need a lot more than a bowl full of fake plants.Hey guys! I love the clothing in Bee and puppycat and would really love to find some clothing in Bee’s styles. Does anyone have any tips on what keywords to research?. Just overstimulated by the fact I have skin.anyone else just like sit down with a book and read 322 pages straight or is it just me and my hyper focus lol. Hey everybody! I was wondering if you had recommendations for stim toys or sim toy sets on Amazon or such. I want to get some for me and also for the other ND’s on my campus.I never asked about how to make showering easier, but I did read you guys talk about how being cold right after having a shower made showering harder. I haven’t even realized how hard/tiring showering was for me and now that I’ve started to put my clothing near my dehumidifier (which gets pretty warm) I’ve been able to shower so much easier. Because it’s just warm, and it’s not as horrible to walk out of the shower. 😭. Why are they so absolutely fantastic? Just. Wow. The cronch of the outside and the smooth of the inside. Fantastic. I want 200 and just to eat them for my whole life.When I was 13 I started writing fan fictions for like Percy Jackson and Aphmah (Minecraft YouTuber) and I wrote like freaking huge novels but never edited them or anything. Except for one that I started to rewrite, a Percy Jackson and the avengers own. Only I couldn’t remember how it ended recently and so I redownloaded wattpad and have realized with horror that I never completed it. And my last chapter? I apologized for leaving it for a year without updates and that I would tell them if I left again because I always worried about if authors died. Except. I NEVER SAID I WAS LEAVING. I undownloaded it so I would stop getting hyper focused reading and could do my homework. And (I also have adhd) out of sight out of mind 😭. 

Anyway I wrote three more chapters because I need to finish it. Also it apparently still gets lots of views. Like over 100k. Still people commenting on how I couldn’t spell Khloine right (jokes on them, I pronounced Poseidon as Poise-eh-don for YEARS. I can’t SPELL even with spell check sometimes.) anyway mini rant over. It will be so funny if my old readers log back in to see I updated after 2 years.A caprisun straw. I just chew on them for hours until my jaw hurts tbh. They are amazing and if I drink a caprisun there’s an 83% chance I’m chewing on it for a good while later unless it falls dramatically out of my mouth onto the floor. 

What’s something you didn’t expect to be a stim toy that is now one of your go-to’s?.Nothing annoys me more than a gassy stomach, itch that doesnt go away, stuffed nose etc. 😬😬. I no longer want to endure daily emotional and verbal abuse (with implicit threat of physical abuse) and plan to get the fuck out by the end of the year.

Currently Im about to finish my highschool education and have no job. I know dealing with those is a starting step, but what else has to be done in order for me to gain my independence?

Edit: I am autistic and have ADHD, so please be considerate of that. My mother broke down today. She became upset after I told her one day before the end of the semester that I failed one class. She said she doesnt feel like we (me and my sister) tell her anything. Like she feels alone even with us in the room.

In my defence, she used to physically/emotionally abuse us if we fucked up. That doesnt exactly creates enviroment needed for vulnerability and trust of any kind. It just lead to us silently obeying her.

It feels really shitty to see her like this, but at the same time I dont feel like I can change our relationship dynamic in any way. Any advice on how to proceed?. I have recently gotten on zoloft and into therapy, and for the first time in my life I left the constant state of hypervigilance for good. I started to actually breaking free of my toxic shame and guilt.

However, right after seeing mild improvement both my body and my mind have burned out. I wake up every day with the bare minimum of executive function, which is a problem, because right now there's lots of school related stuff I have to do and I simply dont have the energy to do it. All I am able to do every day after school is just sleeping the afternoon away and then scrolling whole evening on tiktok. Most of the time I dont even have the energy to pursue my hobbies.

Does anyone know what to do about this? The way Im slowly failing all my classes kinda makes me spiral.I had only a few "traditional" CPTSD nightmares during the last year or so, but I had tons of dreams where I get sexually/verbally/physically abused. It never wakes me up tho and the "what the fuck was that" moment always comes in the morning when I wake up on my own.

Does anyone else experiences these "abuse dreams" too?. I (M 19) have just started to take an anti-anxiety meds (sertraline) to counter the overwhelming anxiety stemming from my trauma. 

This is my first time taking psychiatric meds and I'd like to receive some outside perspective from you people.This week was really awful for me. I've started it with some effort to improve relationship with myself and to be happiness-wise less dependent on other people. I tried my best to do things for myself and to not hang onto other people. Which has lead to me having an anxiety so terrible that I went through one night almost completely sleepless. To add more shit on top of my mental health I've gotten my throat infected and have injured my back. And now a friend who I thought I'd see this weekend has texted me saying he's not sure he'll be able to meet up and my estranged father is demanding I break my no contact.

This week it really feels like the universe wants me to suffer.How do healthy people just live for themselves? How are they happy when they arent actively entertaining/cheering up another person? How are they happy when they are alone and theres noone to keep entertained/happy? I dont understand.I just feel like power and control are inherently bad, but apparently you need them to live a healthy life, to enforce boundaries, etc. And Im kinda afraid that I'll only ever be good as a victim for someone else to abuse.I was molested as a child for a relatively long period of time. Literally one of the earliest memories I have is play-pretending Im being r*ped.
On top of that I got groomed too in my mid teens on the internet.

Now Im almost 20 and there are many things I find very unhealthy about my sexuality.
For example I desperately crave sexual contact, but I am mortified by the thought of actually engaging in sexual activity with another human being. Thought of pleasuring someone else is an absolute  turn on, but picturing the situation in which I let my guard down and let someone else do the same to me is very uncomfortable.

I suppose I dont really want sex, I just wanna be "useful" and earn myself some external validation.
Idk, maybe Im overthinking it.

Well anyways, can anyone else relate?. What can I do to manage anxiety attacks that seemingly come out of nowhere and which can last for hours. I am suffering from quite a bad case of impostor syndrome. I used to get punished for making mistakes as a child, which has resulted in me being afraid to make any mistakes whatsoever. 

In addition to that I developed crippling performance anxiety, I feel deeply afraid whenever I need to communicate with people to get something out of them. (like when I need to set up an appointment for example)

Can anyone please give me some kind of advice on how to deal with these problems?. I hate it.

I hate the intrusive thoughts bursting into my conciousness against my will.

I hate my subconcious programming telling me to let someone abuse me again.

I hate the way I subconciously oversexualise myself and others.

I hate that this was all done to me by a relative of mine I trusted, who then had the nerve to guilt-trip into lying for her when the truth resurfaced.

I feel tainted, like a seagull with feathers covered in oil thats unable the take off into the air again. Im so tired of living with this burden. Im so tired of living in shame.I (M19) cannot do this anymore, I cannot silently stand by while everyone pretends the abuse in our family never happened. I've recently gotten rid of my dissociation and now Im flooded with feelings of hurt and anxiety. However, unlike the child me, I have the power and resources to do something about it. So I've assembled a plan for myself, which is supposed to create an enviroment I need to fully heal.

Step one

I need to share at least some my of trauma the next time I visit my psychiatrist. I also need to share my constant struggle with anxiety and stress, which will hopefully result in me getting some anti-anxiety medication, thus helping me to function better.

Step two

I will get myself a job, I need to make some money in order to pay for a private therapist. Plus some financial independece would be nice.

Step three

Imma confront my parents about my shitty childhood. I just cant pretend that shit was okay anymore. Imma cut the contact with my father and try my best to get my mother aknowledge her role as an enabler. Imma also explain our history of family trauma to my younger sister and do my best to comfort her.

Step four

Confront my 5 years older sister (the trauma boss) about her molesting me when I was toddler. I dont want to take a legal action, (Im a male in a rather conservative country lol) I just want her to recognise how badly it messed me up and to go low/no contact with her.

Step five

Loads of therapy. Like an absolute units of therapy.He was just supposed to tell me what kind of job would be good for me. Instead he told me that im oversensitive, i will make a good mom, i will make a good wife and i dont have adhd nor aspergers. He doesnt have the authority to undiagnose me or anything and he only saw me for about 30 minutes, but my imposter syndrome is going crazy. Somebody, please, help me.He was just supposed to tell me what kind of job would be good for me.

Somebody, please, help me.Often I ask people if they would like to be analysed based on something very random - for example what kind of bowtie or mushroom they like the most. Usually quite irrelevant what question i use but anyhow -- It usually takes me about 15 minutes to analyse it and then i tell them - to be fair, it is also based on how they respond to the question and how they seem - and people are always surprised at how accurate it is. They could be lying as to not be rude but i don't think they are. 
 
 
I've been wondering if this has anything to do with AS or if its just a thing I do. If anyone has any opinion on this please let me know!. I'm high functioning and i know that that is valid but... I don't know, I feel like i pretended having aspergers, somehow? Like, I dont know, like i fooled everyone including me into thinking I'm weird and unsociable and just are weird in social interactions. Maybe it is just because of seeing all the self diagnosing people everywhere, that just dont seem valid, that i feel this way. Either way I could use talking to someone because it's kind of eating me inside. I'm not quite sure what to do to stop thinking this way. I'd like to just stop thinking about it altogether but I'm not sure how to.   
 



Also got diagnosed with ADHD... figured I should mention it.
 
 
EDIT: people are not quite understanding what i meant to express here so edit is as to make it more clear - and to be even more clear I have got a diagnosis and others even tell me they suspected it for a very long time but i still feel like a fraud. It is not a matter of others it is me myself feeling like im lying, like i am faking.So i go to this thing called the fireflies. We do scout stuff like camping, games and stuff. Theres a community of people who go here of all ages. From 6-50+ years old. But I am a teen and there isn't much people my age here except about five. I've known them for about 4 years now.. and this past year we've been very close! We hanged out, we did some fun stuff... but lately they stopped. They started leaving me out, ignoring me in conversations almost completely, underestimating me when we play games... And I'm starting to notice they actually invite each other to hang out. To go to a concert, hang out... But never me.
 
When I'm alone with one of them they love me. They vent to me, we have very lengthy and meaningful conversations, we do fun stuff... but as soon as someone different, i guess better, is around, they go back to barely saying a word to me. I don't know what happened, what changed. I tried to ignore it but one time i was two minutes late to hang out after a fireflies thing (we usually all hang out afterwards, just us 6), only to see them walking away. Together. Not even seeing that I'm there.
 
And I'm really upset because those are one of my closest friends... But now I'm afraid I'M not one of their close friends... maybe not even friends. But then why are they so eager to talk to me when we're alone? I feel like they all love me, but they don't like me.It's all just me, myself and my thoughts. You do you. 
I saw some posts here like 'How to study when I don't want to??' and i think that's stupid

I mean, i don't know a lot of people who actually look forward to studying. There's not a shortcut to studying, not really, since it's a longterm. You can make it more fun, and you can enjoy some subjects and you can start blogs and schedules but in the end you still have to work hard. 
 
 It's hard, man. 
If it wasn't everyone would do it. Yes, for some people it's easier and for some people it's harder and it can be incredibly unfair and upset you but you just gotta move forward.

I know that's kinda harsh to say but imo it's the way it is. Now again you do you, you make any posts you want but i wanted to get this out there. TW suicide, etc. 
   
Now i know what you're thinking, but i don't mean journals. I mean like, fucking math or history books from 2021 .
It was... Wow. I was really fucked up. It was like from august or septekber to january. And now I'm here looking at it like wow. September 2021, that's when i tried to kill myself. I got to a mental hopsital after that, but i already started this notebook ny then.
And honestly, this whole time was terrible for me. After i got out of the hospital, i found out my friend group fell apart because one of the people was jist having fun manipulating others. And when they left, they told mebi was the only one they actually cared for. And i know its just a manipulator tactic and they didn't mean it, but i had all this guilt on me, because if i hadn't gone to the hospital maybe if i was there with my friends the person wouldn't have done anything.. Not yet. And i felt like it was all my fault.

And you know at the hospital, i found my alcoholic family which was always yelling, drinking or sleeping crying as they came to the hospital st midnight. I have never seen my family as much as show an emotion and this... This hurt. The family i dreaded so much which i was sure dreaded me was there crying.
But at the hospital

They told me how inconsiderate i was
How terrible it was of me to do this to my family anr close ones. How this would've traumatised them for life. So when i git out i felt guilty because of the hospital and my parents. I tell you it wasn't hard to be guilty because of my friend group.

So moving on, we tried to bring the friend group back, didn't work, that's fine, because my boyfriend from years ago who moved away came back. And we didn't officially start dating or anything but it felt like it. And we talked everyday, and if he didn't have time to talk i would text him everything about my day and told him he doesn't have to read it but i just want him to know it and he read it all
And we hung out and it was all so perfect.
I even felt okay for a while. But then he started going distant. And i read a  message he left me. And he told me he knew he wqs selfish but he just couldn't keep going and that he really loved me and.. How he's sorry.
This was at 4:55am on 8th December so I didn't read it.. And i will always be so fucking upset that i didn't. He jumped off a bridge godknows where. And when they finally found him it was too late. And i will never forget that guilt, no matter how happy and stable i get.

So here we are, back at the notebooks. The notebooks with only occasional outbursts and breakdowns written in them, that portray the lowest point of my life, when i had nothing. Nothing at all.

It was just... Bad thoughts, paragraphs about my to be boyfriend, bunch of torn pages, scribbles, dead bodies drawn. And you know, it's funny. Looking at all this, evne after that j didn't get help.

I stopped being able to do anything and i would cry myself to sleep, but i still went to school without any therapy or anything. It wasn't until like May that my family tried to get me therapy.

Why may? Well i shaved my head in a breakdown. Thats that. It wasn't the suicide attempt, it wasn't when i cried to my parents that i need help, it wss when i did something with my looks. Really makes ya think.

So now, I've been getting psycho therapy and it's all going good but I'm looking at this notebook and thinking.. Why couldn't i have gotten help sooner? I mean i was still shitty after i git out of the hospital, and i only got out because my father forced me to lie that I'm feeling good so i can get out.

 And i know these what-ifs dont do anything but I'm still here wondering why the fuck i couldn't have gotten any help at all months after i got out of tje hospital, and hell, even before that when i emailed the fucking school therapist back in 2020?

I mean i know it's stupid and i can't change the past and there's some things i can't control and the fate wanted it this way, but i still have tp carry the consequences. I still have shaved hair, i still havent finished grieving, i dont have a friend group, the only thing keeping me going is focusing on nothing but studying. And i don't want any of that. I never wanted any of this.

Edit: just incase, i am stable. I am not suicidal. I'm...
 Not okay but i will survive. I just really need someome to tell me something, anything, right now. I need someome to look ay this objectivelky amd tell me what the fuck i should do now. I think it's just the whole setup of it that reminds me of it, but gosh i love it. I might be completely stupid but i do think so. I do not want to go back there. It was definitely the lowest point of my life. But gosh, I think I might be becoming a little bitter now. Im getting better and more focused on my goals, but I fear that it's causing some bitterness inside me. And I don't know how to stop it. Help please?. I swear I go crazy once there's a pirate suit. It can be the most useless and ugly suit ever but if its a pirate my brain goes GASP. I HAVE GOT TO HAVE THIS.So I'm very sick so i can barely talk and im pretty tired, but i have finals coming up, essays and a seminar work i need to start working on now.
  
I know they always say put your health first but I'm gonna be real with you even if all of you tell me that i won't do it anyway.
  
Any advice?. And I'm one of them. I'm a very chaotic person that still has a schedule and a certain order of doing things.

So here, enjoy my genius but absolutely terrible for everyone else schedule
   
i def fail to follow the schedule sometimes, but i dont care. i just have to start following it right away, and on weekends i sleep for like 13 hours haha.

sometimes i study more than i have on schedule and sometimes less than i plan to, but that makes my schedule very flexible and open to change of plans or something happening unexpectedly

believe it or not, despite having a schedule im very chaotic. and thats okay.

believe it or not, despite having a schedule im very chaotic. and thats okay.Don't give up. It will all be worth it in the end. Waking up early, studying when others are partying, skipping that show.. It will all pay off. Because, gosh, you won't find a better pleasure than success. Spending days, months and hours working towards that A. Getting that degree. Getting to that school. There will be times when you don't feel good and don't know where to go. So just go forward. You don't have to be the best. Just be better than you were yesterday.
 
To be something you never were, you have to do something you never did.
Well... honestly, I'm the one that needed to hear this.I don't think I've read anything that made me feel quite the way i did when i read, say, the black cat. So i thought i might turn here! Any recommendations?. Basically, my father was an alcoholic. Hes done bad things when he was drunk. He sold our house to buy drinks, he kicked us out on the street (only for a while) and he has let me down again and again.
         
 Finally, after years we moved away from him since my mom finally decided she can't and won't fix him. She tried to apply for alimony but it took about four years til it actually got sorted out. 
        
 On the second year of this process, I tried to commit s**cide and got sent to a psychward for a month. Thats when he decided he wants to be in our lives again so he stopped drinking and started taking us out to cinema etc. I was okay with this.
     
 However recently he broke up with his girlfriend and now lives with us for two months. He pays rent and ... we're really struggling financially which is why im trying to be nice to him, but it's so hard. 
        
 He just doesn't realize he hurt me. He told me that him being an alcoholic didn't hurt me in anyway cause he never beat me or anything. I didn't say anything because i knew he would argue with me more.
  
 
 Lately he just acts like i love him so much. Like I need him so much. He told me countless times that I'm dependent on him... But i lived so many years without him, I'm not only not dependent on him, I also don't even want him...
       
  
I don't know what to do. I feel just genuinely uncomfortable around him and i tell him but he ignores it and tells me im lying. And hes trying to help me feel better mentally, but he honestly only makes it worse. Like I'm doing good and he comes to my room without knocking, burst the door open and sits on my bed. Then he asks me some question. I answer but he interrupts and starts telling me his experiences, not listening to what I'm saying at all.....
    
    
I just genuinely feel so bad around him. I have a great day and i feel good and then we talk and I'm just upset and mad. He even threatens to never talk to me again or cut me out off his will if he thinks im being rude...
 
 
But I don't care about all the shit hes done.
What I do care about is how he acts now. So I really need advice on how to be nice to him when he acts like such a jerk. Please, anyone?

 
Also I can't move out for personal reasons

TL DR; How to be nice to my dad?
 
   
Edit: Thank you everyone for replying so kindly! I was honestly crying just writing this but reading the answers made me feel better!
  
Edit 2: I did try to talk to my mom but since my father lives here so when i was trying to tell her he kept coming in saying 'If you have something to say, Say it to my face! Grow a spine!'. I mean i get it, when i watched arcane i liked silco because daddy issues but like.. is this the same thing or like? 
I'm just very curious.

**Also please don't throw ANY spoilers without warnings nor harass anyone who likes him.** Thank you!. Well im currently using school planner since its kinda working for me and its the only thing i could find someone recommending and i also liked the layout of that wasnt for apple ipads but i was wondering if someone has any other recommendations?. Basically, i wanna start studying in my journal but i cant figure out how. I'm not sure if i should get seperate ones for subjects since thatd be kinda expensive. So I'm currently using one but I'm not sure whether i should make different sections or just each page each study session, no matter the subjects.

Thanks.It’s so frustrating to see people go on Reddit asking for advice to try and pass and they all get told stupid arbitrary things like no piercing or dyed hair. I have piercings and dyed hair and I was passing a year before getting on t. Now that I’m a year and a half on t, have more piercings and my hair color changes frequently. Since my voice has dropped, I have never once’s been questioned about being trans man. I have been questioned about being a trans woman early into transitioning. But seriously it’s so bizarre to me that everyone in my life can’t see me as anything other than a feminine man. I think this whole passing culture can be so toxic and we forget what men can be. Men can have piercings, dyed hair, dress however they please and guess what, they are still men. Also passing does not define you, sure it might be nice but it does not define you. I’d love to hear your opinions on this in the comments.Ok not to sound too heavy but how did you find out/react to learning about death? For me, I was in preschool and I realized I was going to get old like my grandma so I got mad at her and ruined grandparents day. I think the concept of death was easier to process for me than the fact I was going to get old.My partner (trans femme) bought a fantasy flesh light for herself. I don’t care. But then looks at me and says you better not use it mister. I just gave her a confused look and pointed down there and says how do you think I would use it. Her eyes widened and said something also the lines of I totally forgot. Just for context I’m on t but pre op. I love that my partner just sees me as a guy and never questioned me for one second. I love her so much.My partner (trans femme) bought a fantasy flesh light for herself. I don’t care. But then looks at me and says you better not use it mister.

Im sure many of us would agree that going through puberty was uncomfortable or even traumatic. Also being forced to live a false life is also super stressful/traumatic/dysphoria inducing. In trying to “protect” children from temporary and reversible changes they force their kids through years of trauma and probably therapy after that. Personally the year I found out I was trans then came out only to find my parents already knew and actively were against it since I was a child was really awful. I just think your kid being trans is car far from the end of the world, who here agrees?. Hi my name is Sam (ftm20) but when I was in preschool I went by Mouse. I’m not sure why I just hated my deadname. Anyone else have a funny name they called themselves?. I’m between cows and frogs.So I recently accepted a position as a nutrition aide at a preschool. I have always wanted to work and teach kids in some capacity and now I’m doing that. I never thought I would get this far and also get to live authentically. The kids call me Mr Sam and it makes me so happy. To all of the aspiring teachers and educators out there, being trans and a teacher is possible! Hope you can be yourself and be happy ❤️.I thought my co worker was just being rude because I’m gay but actually she’s just awkward and shy and I’m the spectrum lol. We get along really well now that I know she doesn’t hate me.I can’t stop profusely sweating from my scalp every time I do any kind of physical activity or I’m out in the heat. Does anyone else have this problem from t?  Or is it something like hyperhydrosis?. I’ll start, for me it was my Medusa, I’d rather do my triple helixes again.So I recently got a job as a nutrition aide at a preschool. I start next week. Im really excited for this job and it’ll be a good bit of extra income. I have a tattoo apprenticeship and a job as a retail worker on weekends. I know how to be appropriate and I know how to dress for the occasion. But my mom think I’m too inappropriate to be around young impressionable kids and it really hurts. She keeps making comments and it just sucks that she’s not on board with my new job. I’ve worked as a teachers aid before and at a church in child care so I know how to work with children. But I’m a trans dude so of course now I’m going to in indoctrinate children. This preschool doesn’t care I’m trans or queer, that I have piercing and tattoos, etc. They literally have my mentor from the tattoo shop teach the kids about art every year. But what my mom says worries me that because of who I am I’ll get fired from being “inappropriate”. Anyone here who also works with kids and is trans? How has your experience with that been? Any advice/reassurance is greatly appreciated.I’m a trans dude and I have a ton of bottom dysphoria but I’ve never really had chest dysphoria. I was originally going to do top surgery out of peer pressure but decided against it. I’m not completely a binary trans man but still identify strongly with being a man. I see this sub is full of very masculine trans men and I was wondering if anyone on here is a bit like me. I’m kinda feminine, I’m on t so I pass as a man but I like feminine things. I have decided I’m am going to keep my chest because I don’t have dysphoria over them and honestly I’m tired of being ashamed for having a chest. Did anyone on here just decide to save money on a surgery they didn’t want and then go for phalloplasty? I’ve been 1000% sure I want a dick since I was a pre teen. I know things will most likely improve with this surgery. But I feel so alone knowing I’m not exactly who this surgery is intended for. So please if anyone else at all is not the stereotypical man please reach out.I really hate wearing binders and it’s a lot of sensory overload for me. I don’t really think anyone really wants to wear them. I don’t have a ton of chest dysphoria but I want them gone just because I hate binders. But I need to wear a binder in order to pass, I’m a dd cup. But the thing is I really like my chest in a sexual way. I like it being played with and sucked. But I hate it the rest of the time. I’m really torn on wether or not I’ll get top surgery. I’ve thought about a reduction but I don’t want to lose sensations. So it either all or nothing. I just really like the pleasure I get my chest. Anyone else in a similar situation?. That’s it, that’s the post.So my voice dropped pretty slowly, noticeable around 8 months on t. But now my voice is cracking all of a sudden. My throat is just a tiny bit sore and it’s hard to project my words. I think I’m either sick, which is possible because my entire family is sick, or my voice is dropping yet again. But I don’t have any symptoms they have so I’m leaning more towards the voice dropping. Anyone else experienced this? Btw I’m about 15 months on t.Hi so my partner is a non-binary trans femme. She has lost numerous friends because of being who she is and people are no longer comfortable with her. She is 20 almost 21, she plays video games, plays guitar and works as a cook in a nursing home. She likes fallout, terraria, stardew valley and strangely enough so EA golf games. She is really trying to be her true self and it’s hard when she has been rejected so much. I want her to have friends so she doesn’t feel so alone. Dm me first then I can give you her username. Please be nice.Hi so my partner is a non-binary trans femme. She has lost numerous friends because of being who she is and people are no longer comfortable with her.

I get a ton of anxiety when I lose something. Whether is one of my pair of earrings or a paint brush in my set. I can’t relax until I find it. It does help I also have adhd and I’m losing stuff all the time. Does this happen to anyone else?. So I’m one year on t and I’m ready to get top surgery, I want a radical breast reduction and not a completely flat chest. I’m also trying to pay for other things like rent and a new car. My partner has a pretty decently paying job and I have a job that pays bills too. I talked to my mother in law, I live with her, to see if it was a good idea. I can’t talk about it with my own parents because they are very against me transitioning. I explained to her I have a 40dd and not only is my chest uncomfortable but also makes me terribly dysphoric and all that. She think it’s more of a want than a need and I need to learn how to deal with my dysphoria and bad thoughts and feelings. I explained that gender affirming care is life saving but she thinks I need to get my priorities in order first. I don’t want my state to ban health care for transgender people before I get this surgery. Anyways she has been super supportive of me and just wants the best. She is also always very honest and straight to the point with me. So who do you think is right?. I was wondering if anyone had a breast reduction instead of full on top and if so could share expiences, pictures, etc.. I am a double d and I want to go down to an a cup. If I’m unhappy with it, I’ll probably do full top in the future. I identify as a non binary trans man and a reduction feels more aligned with my gender. I was told about the anchor method that doesn’t involve cutting the nerve stem to the nipple. This is a little nsfw but I really enjoy the sensation in get from it during sexy time but I don’t really like having to wear a binder. My dysphoria is minimal there, mostly dysphoric about my lower area. This surgery would really be so I didn’t have to wear a binder due to my sensory issues with said binder. This is especially the case in the summer time when it get hot and sweaty. So this might be a specific ask but did anyone get a reduction with the anchor method? Sorry if this isn’t allowed here but someone referred me from the transmasc subreddit.So I’m a little over one year on t and considering top surgery. Not really sure if a full double mastectomy in technically terms is the way to go for me. I’m sick of wearing a binder but I don’t fully want to get rid of my chest seeing as I am not a binary trans man tho identify as a man none the less. I have about a c cup I believe and I feel as though I’d be much more comfortable with a small a cup. I’m a little bigger and curvier than some so I think an a cup could just pass as a little bit of fat in my chest. Is there anyone out there who is like me and opted for a chest reduction surgery? I know I’d probably still have some scars so is it worth it? Or should I pursue the full top surgery. Any advice is welcome, but please don’t tell me just get top surgery because that’s not what I’m looking for. 

Edit: I think I underestimated my chest size just a bit but again don’t know a ton about this. And mostly the reason I want a reduction is to no have to wear binders or even sports bras. I have sensory issue and binding, especially in the summer, just triggers me so much.So I’m a little over one year on t and considering top surgery.

Edit: I should probably mention I don’t have a ton of dysphoria around my chest, mostly just bind for social reasons. The biggest reason I want a reduction is for my sensory issues around my binder. It’s too tight and it get sweaty and it feels really uncomfortable so I rarely wear it around the house.Anyone interested in a positive, serotonin boosting subreddit dedicated to share little trans joys and victories. It’s called r/transartspsce. Yes I know it’s misspelled, I’m dyslexic but there was already a place called transartspace. If you want to check it out I would be absolutely thrilled. It is a safe space for all ages and it’s not for nsfw stuff. You can also promote your small business on there if you want to. Dm me too if you’d like to be a moderator.Anyone interested in a positive, serotonin boosting subreddit dedicated to share little trans joys and victories. It’s called r/transartspsce.

I want this space to be for sharing trans joys and what not. I want young trans people to see these post and see they can have meaningful lives with love and joy. Being trans sucks but you can find happiness and love despite your difficulties. I have an amazing non binary partner and I never thought I’d find love and acceptance but here I am. Feel free to spread my message of hope and spread the word that this is a safe space for trans artists.So I recently got diagnosed as autistic and adhd. I have a few other mental disorders that I won’t mention here. I struggle at lot with any kind of criticism because I was always told I was doing the wrong thing as a child and I need to strive for perfection. Now I’m an adult and a nervous wreck. I got told by some customers I was the rudest person they have ever encountered and asked for my boss. I was trying to be friendly even though they were being complete jerks. I don’t understand what I did wrong. After the interaction, I cried for like ten minutes straight in the bathroom pathetically.  I also am an artist who frequently post on different art subs. After receiving some negative comments I cried again for a little longer. 

I’ve come to the realization that any kind of criticism or rejection is a huge trigger for me. It sends me down a spiral of childhood trauma and self loathing tendencies. I think this might be rejection sensitive dysphoria, idk I’m not a professional. I was wondering if any of you had tips or tricks on how to deal with this type of thing. 

Please if you’re going to be mean, just don’t. I am almost at a breaking point for my mental health and negative comments. And if you are still mean, you will be talked about in my next therapy session because I’ve found healthier coping methods.Is it hard for any of you who have cis brothers and specifically an unsupportive family. My family is not at all supportive of me being trans, they hate me going on hormones and dressing masculine and basically everything else that comes with being trans. I have been on t for a year, I plan on having surgeries when I can afford it, probably not any time soon. 

But that’s besides the point, I’m becoming the man I’ve always wanted to be. And my brother is kinda supportive kinda not, can’t really tell where he stands as far as lgbtq people are concerned. My brother is five years younger than me and started puberty around the time I started t. We’ve had very similar changes start happening and it’s kinda weird honestly. On one hand I can know what to expect as far as my transition is concerned so that’s nice. But on the other hand my parents. 

They were excited for his voice drop, they taught him how to shave, teased him about body hair, and were happy in general with him becoming a man. But as for me they were super mad at me having body hair, especially around my legs because it’s improper for a lady to have leg hair. I hate these gender stereotypes my parents believe in. I have to shave when I’m around them so my mom doesn’t see my facial hair and cry. They were extremely rude about my voice and constantly complain how I ruined it. And they of course say things like you’ll never be a real man. I had to learn how to shave from my partner because I have no male role models to support me. 

I don’t understand how they can see my brother and be so happy for me but shunned me for the exact same things. It hurts me to see my brother become exactly what my parents want and for me to be a disappointment. I was just wondering if anyone else could relate to this?. So I know we all love wholesome grandmas here. She is not my grandma but a co worker of mine who has about 17 grandchildren. Her name is Bea and she is literally so kind and a little sassy and very loving. She calls me Sam or Sammuel, no one has every called me Sammuel because being trans and stuff but that is my full name. She is just a nice person, found out I was trans by accident one day and immediately was supportive, always calling me he and my name despite knowing I am trans. She will give me hugs at the beginning and end of the day. She knows I’m gay and have a partner. She always asks how they are doing and always is happy to hear updates about our life. I’m thinking about inviting her to my wedding if I have the chance to.

I was having some health problems, some of them could be related to pregnancy. I’m not but she was curious and thought I might be because she knows about me and my partner. Most people might find someone asking about that to be kinda invasive but I didn’t mind because she has always been super supportive of me. She was asking because she said she would love to be a godmother. I told her I was not in fact pregnant. She was sad until I told her that I will be adopting kids possibly one day and her eyes lit up. 

I have a grandma who isn’t the best to me and is always putting me down and invalidating me. So to have this women in my life means so much to me even if we are just co workers. I hope if you don’t have supportive family you can find someone like Bea who is just such a wonderful person and makes my whole day better every time I see her.I’ve been trying to grow out my hair a bit for maybe a mullet type hair style. Every time I get remotely close my impulsive ass decides to cut it all off. I am so sick of having my buzzed with a little on top hair cut. I thought extensions were the way to go but I probably bought ones that weren’t really compatible with my short hair. So now I’m sad and thinking I might just buy a wig but I don’t want to get mistaken for a girl. Anyone know of any hair extensions that might work or have an wig recommendations. How do y’all grow out your hair???. That’s all, I’m so happy.I am an American considering moving to the UK if Trump wins in 2024 and I am a lover of my guinea pigs.

I was doubting they could be able to make it because I read that the UK law only allows importation of cats, dogs, and ferrets.

I also did read about something stating that guinea pig would have to face a four month quarantine, which would be worth that time for me.

Thanks in advance for any advice.And how it would symbolize an autistic nation.And why it symbolizes an autistic nation .Hey fellow autistic peeps, this is a just for fun question about what would be against the law in an autistic nation?

I would definitely say loud retail music in stores because it would fire my sensory issues.

Also, discrimination against LGBTQIA+, given autistic people are more likely to sport sexual and gender minorities.Hey fellow autistic peeps, this is a just for fun question about what would be against the law in an autistic nation?

Reindeer are a tameable and passive mob for the snowy tundra biome. They will serve as the cow of the tundra biome, outnumbering cows and sheep in said biome.

A lichen fungus will be added that will serve as a block and an item for breeding reindeer.

Antlers on a reindeer can be sheared, much like a sheep's wool. They can also be used as a decoration item or hat crafted with the pelt it drops.

When dead, a reindeer will drop raw beef and/or reindeer pelts.

In the event the iceologer, otherwise known as a chillager, gets added, reindeer pelt armor can be useful in providing warmth against the chilling spells cast by chillager. A full suit of reindeer pelt is optimal for keeping heart loss at a minimum when attacked by a chillager.**Zebra** 

It's beyond me why the 1.6 Horse Update didn't include these stripy quadrupedal icons of the savanna biome, so they'd make a great African addition to the savanna with the armadillo being a South American creature.

The zebra is a neutral mob and will less likely accept riders as per the wild nature of the zebra in real life. When bucked, a heart may be taken out given the zebra's injurious nature.

It is, however, possible to tame zebras, but will be unrideable. Zebras will be slightly smaller than horses, hence their reluctance to accept riders.

When bucked, a zebra also has a chance of dropping a zebra hair, which can be used to brew a potion called "Potion of Great Force" that when punching a skeleton, will have such a knockback that there is between a 25% and 75% chance of the skeleton losing and possibly dropping the bow where it is never able to use it ever again.

Zebras would bark in lieu of the more familiar horse-like whinnying, much like the real world common zebra.**Kangaroo**

The kangaroo is a neutral mob that is unique to the eroded badland, which resembles the Australian outback these magnificent marsupials call home.

Only spooky and scary night monsters spaws in eroded (or otherwise) badlands, so kangaroos would add a charismatic touch to the eroded badlands.

When provoked, a kangaroo will chase at one and trap one still and unable to move, stand on its tail and punch the enemy with their hind legs until death.

One can tame a kangaroo using a standard cactus and breed them using prickly pear cacti (if they ever get added).

A kangaroo will have a storage chest that is only able to hold weaponry. 

When tamed, a kangaroo will seek out monsters and trap and kick them until dead. When gripped by a kangaroo, skeletons cannot use bows, creepers cannot explode, nor do witches throw potions.Teddy Bear. Saber-tooth Tiger. Ron DeSantis. 1x Pearl gourami
