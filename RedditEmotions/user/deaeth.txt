I think it would be nice if the hero abilities were shown like the steam/web based version. Meaning if there is another upgrade available, it shows up without having to click each heroes name to see if there's more. I know I should have them all memorized but I don't and I'm sure others don't as well.I'm a newer addict, I mean player but got hooked and love this game. I'm looking for other newer players who are hooked as well and will stick around for a bit. Please no use of auto-clickers or scripts or cheating. I used an auto-clicker and then did a hard reset because it just didn't feel right. 

If you are looking for fun, hit me up and we can learn more together. 

EDIT: I play on Steam!.
