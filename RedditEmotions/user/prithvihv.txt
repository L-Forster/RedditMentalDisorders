There's isnt really one stable app which does real time location tracking .i have been working on this for a while now .

[https://github.com/10kmmr/Conerive](https://github.com/10kmmr/Conerive)

The current set of feature would include things like :

* Realtime location view
* Secure group travelling :- when one person goes too far away the app triggers a notification to the rest of the group
* Photos taken by anyone is immediately updated to google drive and can be viewed my everyone in the group

Any thoughts on the idea? or any additional features also an extra hand in design would be great

Thank you. There's isnt really one stable app which does real time location tracking .i have been working on this for a while now .
