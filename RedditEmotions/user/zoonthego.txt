I've noticed on Reddit among the mental health subreddits, most people are younger than 25. I even notice a lot of teenagers and tweens on here. I'm almost 30 and my mental health issues have only gotten worse. I was better when I was younger and off medication. Is it too late for me? Is it normal to get worse with age?. The “Brian” is so randomly modern and ordinary and it’s hilarious. I’ve been drinking coffee which probably doesn’t help and was able to put down a small lunch after a long walk in the heat this afternoon. Is there nothing to do but wait for the symptoms to subside?. This is an Easter egg for her next release “The Melting of the Sun”. My mother met a man the same age as me and she really wanted me to meet him. I lurked his social media profile thinking my mom is trying to set me up with someone to find out he is openly homophobic. His entire Facebook profile expressed how he once used to be gay but then found God and other conservative political bullshit. She knew exactly what she was doing.Blood in the Cut by K. Fay
