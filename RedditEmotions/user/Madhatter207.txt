Just got 2 gig fiber optic internet yesterday but after connecting it to my ASUS ax82u router I’m only getting speeds of 900 mbps any idea on what I’m doing wrong?. Packaged nicely quick shipping on his part and a free little gift was nice as well! Definitely look for this seller.Can’t recommend enough! USPS said the package was delivered but It wasn’t and pandagirl did everything to help me out until it finally came! Absolutely the best seller on here. Always the best prices and excellent packaging couldn’t recommend him more!. Great packaging with a little extra treat! Definitely look for this seller!. Isn’t it weird California and Sydney are trying to ban gas/diesel vehicles so soon. This all comes down to money, As Australia sits on the most lithium being mined and in reserves right now. And California is sitting on one of the largest deposits in the world.
