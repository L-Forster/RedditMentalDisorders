On one of my previous posts I shared about how I bought my gf flowers. I did so not knowing it was the first time someone had ever bought her flowers and she ended up crying.

After I posted that, I was inspired by one of the comments on that post to get my gf LEGO flowers. 

A couple of months ago my gf mentioned to me that she loved to build LEGO when she was a kid. When she mentioned that, I remember years ago when I was in an Oregon LEGO store, I saw a LEGO set that was basically a bouquet of flowers and thought, ‚Äúthat would be a sweet gift to give someone‚Äù.

Fast forward years later on my GF‚Äôs bday‚Ä¶

Before I dropped her back off to her place after we hung out, I told her something like, ‚ÄúI got you another gift. Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs flowers again. But before I give you these flowers, I wanted to let you know that I will love you until the last flower dies‚Äù.

Then I pulled out a big yellow LEGO bag and she started crying again üòÇ

I pulled out the bouquet of LEGO flowers that I saw years ago in that LEGO store in Oregon and she realized what I meant when I said that I‚Äôd love her till the last flower dies.

We hung out again this past week and she mentioned that she told her mom and dad what I did and her mom said, ‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs a keeper!‚Äù

Honestly, that made me so happy. 

Whenever my GF tells me about the positive feedback she gets from sharing stories of us with her friends, it always makes my day.

But when she mentioned that her parents liked what I did, it felt really good. 

Idk.Basically the title. I was at the store yesterday picking up some groceries before I was headed to pick my gf up to hang out.

I went past the flower aisle and thought, ‚Äúah, what the hell‚Äù and bought some flowers. The cashier who rung me up was like, ‚Äúflowers and poke bowls, ay?‚Äù and smiled.

I went to pick up my girl and right when she got into my car I said, ‚Äúguess what?‚Äù 

Her: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúChicken butt‚Äù *pulls out flower bouquet üíê *

She ended up crying and I was laughing asking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù And that‚Äôs when she said that she never got flowers before in her life.

Then it kinda made me sad for a bit tbh. I thought about this new generation and how fast-paced and cold we can be sometimes. I feel like every girl should get flowers from the ones they love. Especially ones they‚Äôre dating.

We went home and hung out for the rest of the day. I didn‚Äôt own a vase so I just put it in a water jug. 

Fellas, buy flowers for ya girl. Ladies, buy‚Ä¶ whatever guys want for ya man (idk i‚Äôm bad at this .-.)

Edit: Thank you all so much for all the love in the comments! I went to sleep last night right after I made this post and I woke up this morning with all these sweet stories and messages of your guy‚Äôs own. I absolutely love reading the comments and will read more when I get home.

(Apologies to the mods, I initially had it as ‚Äújust chatting‚Äù in the flair but I realize yes, ‚Äúlife stories‚Äù is a much better flair. Thank you for changing it!). "Truly from the bottom of my heart... it's been an honor being a fan of this show along with you all. For some reason, this show managed to cultivate a fanbase that has been some of  the most beautiful and open-minded group of people that I've seen.  


From all the theories, through all the thought-provoking discourse, to the shared laughter and raw emotions we've had through the beautiful moments we got to experience throughout the show, you've all been nothing but great company to enjoy this show with.  


No matter how near or far we were from each other, each episode made me feel like I was watching it with  ªohana (family) and it's been one of the most coolest feelings I've had in long while.  


It's truly been a blessing loving this show along with you all. I wish you all the most beautiful experience with this last episode and hope the love and inspiration you gain from this series uplifts you throughout the rest of your life.  


Me ke aloha pumehana,  
Golden Kaleo". It is currently 2:49 PM as I write this. Around 6 hours before Atlanta's series finale drops.   


Here is a (growing) list of theories that I've seen in the past that I wanted to document before we head into the last episode:  


1. "**Atlanta is a simulation**" - This one I feel the most strongest for. From the Deja Vu thing that Darius experienced in the first ever Atlanta episode to the fact that this last episode is going to be a Darius centered episode confirms this theory even more. There's an interview with Zazie Beetz where she even talks about how Donald Glover spoke to her about this theory that we are all in a simulation (I'll try to find the link of that interview and post it here later) so the fact that Donald is even aware of simulation theory gives this Atlanta simulation theory more of a forefront thought than ever before.  

2. "**Paper Boi dies**" - don't know why people are saying this tbh. but I've seen countless of theories that PB will die this last episode. Don't know if it'll happen or not, but it's there. So.  

3. "**Van and Earn move to LA with Lottie**" - this one I hope happens. that S4E7 story was so amazing. To have that only be anything else will break my heart. Which actually leads me to...  

4. "**Van and Earn split**" - Don't want this to happen but there's been theories going around that Van and Earn will have an amicable break up after realizing that the love they share for Lottie is not enough to keep them together :(  


What are your last minute finale theories? Feel free to add yours in before the episode airs.Mines is: ‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt ‚Äòkidnap‚Äô your own dad. I don‚Äôt have time to explain it to you right now, but the word *kid* is in it. So mathematically, it‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù. My previous romantic relationship was basically scored with music from Sade.

Unfortunately our relationship didn‚Äôt end in the best way, but this episode made me remember all of those beautiful moments I got to experience with her.

Through all the episodes of Atlanta, I couldn‚Äôt figure out which one was my favorite.

This one will not only be my favorite episode of Atlanta, but my favorite episode of television forever. It was like it was made just for me.

Thank you, Atlanta. You truly are a beautiful show. Thank you so much for letting me remember what it was like to truly love someone with all my heart.

Me ke aloha
~ Golden Kaleo. That way if they don‚Äôt want it or they are unable to receive it, you can at least enjoy it for yourself üëç. Might be big fish, let me check.Is it really all that it‚Äôs cracked up to be?. Alright folks, I need all hands on deck for this one.

There‚Äôs this guy whom I met at one of my gigs. Fellow musician and videographer. Super sweet dude.

He explained to me that he‚Äôs houseless at the moment but would like to help me out in recording, videotaping, and documenting my music shows for me.

Told him I was down to have him at my shows, but I want to help him out as well.

My current plan is to get a gym membership for him to at least give him access to shower and stuff.

I don‚Äôt make much as a musician, but I make enough to be able to buy him food when he comes down to my gig, and also give him some money from the tips I make.

The main problem I‚Äôm struggling with is that I have no place to have him sleep since the place I‚Äôm staying at doesn‚Äôt allow overnight guests, but if you guys have any good ideas on that part, please lmk. He‚Äôs currently bouncing around airBnB‚Äôs and doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôll be once that is over.

Any bit of advice would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask questions in the comments if you need more info about the situation.
