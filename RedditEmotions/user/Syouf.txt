I feel like there’s nothing going on inside me.  I know that because I used to have some sort of flame that got extinguished over the years and I haven’t felt anything apart from sadness for years.  The best way to describe it is imagining a lifeless barren planet or an empty cold lifeless desert. 

Everyday I just go to work, go home, waste time on my phone, listen to music and play video games, then go to sleep. Rinse and repeat.  On the weekends, it’s wake up, stay in bed staring at the ceiling, waste time on my phone, listen to music and play video games, then go to sleep.

I fake a smile when I’m at work or in the rare occasion that I go out, but in reality all I’d be thinking of is I can’t wait to go home and do absolutely nothing.

I’m absolutely dead inside.. a walking talking zombie.. nothing more.I feel like there’s nothing going on inside me.

A girl that you poured your heart and soul into so you can make her happy.  One that you felt like you can’t live without so you tried your absolute hardest to keep, but she broke your heart and you can’t recover, so you just live with the pain?
And now you’re a shell of who you were and can’t find the energy to try again?
If so, how long has it been?. I’m just chilling exploring the universe.  If anyone wants to join hmu
I play on PS but the game is crossplay so I think we can join a session.Every now and then I’d post on here looking to have a nice conversation with someone.  I never ask if you’re male or female coz quite frankly I don’t care.  I got no one to talk to, and I’ve always been the person that likes to make friends.  I’ve met some really cool people on here, but most of the time I’d get a guy that would ask if I’m a girl and as soon as he finds out that I’m a guy he makes me feel weird about me being a guy that posts on here.. like TF?!, and if it’s a girl that I’m talking to and we start talking for a while and hit it off, and if we exchange pics eventually, she’d just disappear.. like I know I’m not the best looking guy out there, but like you would only talk to me if I was a hot stud?! Like TF?!!

My point is, do people on here just text in the hopes of having an actual relationship or something along those lines with someone?!  Also, does it matter what the other person looks like if you’re having good conversations?!  I truly only want someone to become friends with.. either to share stories, talk about random shit, game together, share music and talk about shows or literally whatever.

Does anybody else experience this?. Hey fellas.. feeling a bit extra lonely tonight.. just chilling listening to music and exploring my thoughts.. anyone up for a chat?

I’m also open to any topic of conversation :). I just finished a movie called Passengers.  I watch it every now and then, coz I like the idea of it.  Get on a spaceship, go to a distant planet and lead a new life.

I’m always interested in space and stuff, and weirdly enough it bothers me that I’ll never set foot on another planet even though there’s billions of other floating rocks out there.  Whenever I’m outside at night, I’d stare at the moon and just think about that.  
Which is one of the reasons I love a video game called No Man’s Sky, coz it’s the only closest thing I have to experience something slightly similar.

I would definitely do it if I could, since I don’t see a meaning for my life on this planet.  

I wonder what everybody else thinks.Before I begin this I’ll give you some context, I’m currently 31 and I moved away from my country a little over a year ago, and I went back for a visit recently, and that’s what prompted me to write this.

On my way back to the visit I was excited to see my home and whoever was left of my friends over back home.  I actually had some texts and calls when I got back from some of them so I was excited to catch up with everyone.  A couple of days passed, so I managed to fix the jet lag and I was all set to meet up with some of them, and I did.. I saw a couple of them for a quick cup of coffee, but that was it.. winded up spending the rest of the time with family, but didn’t see any of my friends.

I took a drive around my city, went to my high school, my university and some of our old hang out spots and I started reminiscing on my own about the good times that I used to have with my friends.. I started thinking how life is just flying by and how for quite some time, years actually, I’ve been all alone.. all of my friends have either left the country too and/or are married, engaged or are in a long term relationship.. and I’m.. alone..  I don’t have anybody to spend my time with and make new memories with.. the friends I saw started talking about their partners or their kids.. and I had nothing similar to share.

Im going back to the country I moved to soon.. where I’ll be even lonelier, coz I actually don’t have anyone over there.  No family, no friends, no girlfriend.. nobody.  And when you’re 31, in a foreign country, it’s impossible to make friends..

I got nobody to talk to about literally anything, so I wind up just listening to music and living in the past and thinking about stuff on my own.

A part of me wishes I didn’t visit, coz it made me realize that out of all the people that I knew, I’m the only one that’s alone.. and I’m tired of it, but I lost hope of finding a girl to spend the rest of my life with.. I always dreamed of it when I was younger.  I never was into hookups and all that, but most of my friends were, and they tried to convince me to do that, but all I’ve ever wanted was to find a girl to fall in love with and just spend the rest of my life with…. I never thought that out of all of our old social group of friends, I’d be the ONLY one that’s truly alone…

I go to the movies alone, I go to concerts alone, I go shopping alone, I go to restaurants alone, I go for walks and drives alone, I game alone…

I live alone.Haven’t gone out in around two months coz I got a big exam coming up.. as if I need another reason to stay cooped up in the house with no one to talk to :/

If there’s anyone that’s bored or whatever and that feels like talking, hit me up.. would definitely be open to talk and perhaps trade music recommendations since that’s the only thing keeping me company.. I’m mostly into metal, but I’m open to everything really..  I also like video games and shows if you want to chat about that or just life and stuff.So I’m thinking of getting a new laptop, and since I’m a gamer I thought I might as well get a gaming laptop, but I honestly don’t know about the technical details and I don’t want to spend a lot of money.  

So I’m thinking of getting the ASUS Zephyrus G14, and I saw these two are on sale, but I don’t know which one is better for the price (one is $1200 and one is $800), I would appreciate any help on this:

There genuinely isn’t anything that I want.  I don’t want friends anymore, nor do I want a girlfriend, I don’t want to go out, I don’t want to work, I don’t want money, I don’t want to drink, I don’t want to game, I don’t want to watch movies, shows, or YouTube, I don’t want social media,  I don’t want to talk to anyone or do anything.  

Life has hit me so hard lately that I lost all motivation to do anything. 

I just want to sit and do absolutely nothing until my time is up.. I want everyone to leave me the fuck alone and stop expecting me to do something.. I just want to be alone without anyone bothering me.. is that too much to ask for?. Is it weird that I don’t want anything in life?

I’m chilling all alone listening to music and staring out the window onto the city lights, after a long stressful day.. and I’m thinking about stranger things.. I know it’s random, but I love that show and I’m rewatching it at the moment, and I keep thinking of this one unexplained thing towards the end of season 3 and beginning of season 4 but I don’t want to spoil it for anyone.Hi everyone!

Avenged Sevenfold are playing close by on Friday, along with Falling in Reverse (never heard them).  I don’t have anyone to go with, and I’m not that familiar with A7X’s last three albums, but I love their older stuff, and I’ll probably be getting one of the cheapest tickets which is around $120.

Do you think it’s worth going alone?  If anyone has done that before, please share your experience.

Edit:  also, since I haven’t been to many concerts in my life, are the far upper seats worth $120?. Hi everyone!

I know this is a VERY tough question, but let’s assume that the song you choose was not originally in the set list.
I would personally choose Siege Engine.

Edit: I’m so glad I made this post, coz I’m discovering some fantastic songs.. then again I am yet to hear a Buckethead song that I don’t get addicted to.I don’t have people to share my thoughts with, so I might as well start doing it here.
Im currently chilling on the couch listening to music while I’m finishing the last final I have.  I took a break and I’m scrolling through socials and I ran across a video of a concert with people singing along.  I don’t know the song and I just heard them sing one verse which said “I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight”.  Which of course added to my depression and loneliness, because I just realized that I have never received a drunk text from anyone.  Never.  Damn that hurts.  Knowing that you never cross peoples minds when they’re sober or when they’re drunk. 
I’ve never gotten a drunk text from any girl.. and I’m not just talking about exes.. has no one ever had a crush on me or liked me or something they felt like telling me and fucked up by doing it when they’re drunk?!
I know it sounds stupid, but it makes sense to me..Today I was grocery shopping at a Ralph’s and I had my AirPods on.  When the song I was listening to finished, I heard a familiar song that wasn’t coming from my phone.  I took my AirPods out and to my surprise I heard Ohms playing on the store’s speakers, which made me really happy.  I know it might sound stupid, but whenever I hear any song from the bands that I like being played at a bar/restaurant/store, it always puts a smile on my face.
