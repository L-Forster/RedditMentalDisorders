My sister says she hears voices and sometimes screams because of them. My dad doesn't take it seriously, when she tries to tell him he just smiles and says things like "I hear voices in my head too!"... he thinks it's another one of the random things she says all the time (she also has ADHD and full blown autism). He also thinks the outbursts are just "autistic outbursts" because he's read online that people with autism sometimes have meltdowns. 

I know she's actually hearing voices because I've asked her about them before, and the way she responds is indicative of honesty. I just don't know how to help her, because my dad is responsible for her medically and she can't get the help she needs as long as he sees her voices this way. Also, when I talked to her about this, I offered to talk to our dad about it to help him understand and she was very against it, presumably because she doesn't trust him to respond well anymore.

Is there anything I can do?. A book? A form of therapy? A certain exercise? I'm curious what you all have to say!. I have multiple clairs (clairsentience, clairaudience, clairvoyance) but my abilities have atrophied. I'd like to learn how to start receiving information again through those clairs. I know how to ground/center/shield but I'm not sure what to do past that other than setting an intention and refraining from trying too hard to receive information, and just letting it all come to me. How can I practice picking up on things psychically?.
