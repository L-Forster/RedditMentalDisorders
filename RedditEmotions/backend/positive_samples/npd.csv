Having taken some time on the healing journey (with several slips here and there) I've come to realize that intentions matter when choosing to change. If your motive for changing out of narcissism is inherently selfish, it won't work.For instance, I have had a good experience healing overall along with some other people I know because we want to change for the sake of becoming functional human beings again. We wish not to glorify our trauma but live our life in spite of it. We want to prove that we're more than the labels society placed on us. So we've been able to do well.On the contrary, knew a guy with the condition who wanted to "change" for the sake of simply extracting more supply and he still loved to bask in and glorify his trauma. He isn't doing so well.I believe most people here are well-intentioned, but just make sure you're not part of the latter portion and you'll be fine :). I wholeheartedly love myself. I'm proud of being labeled "narcissist" and proud of myself for "abusing" people who just invite drama no matter where they go. I'm proud to show some control and dominance over them, and hearing their pleas for me to stop. I wish I could give myself a warm hug and a soft kiss. I deserve it.On the flip side, I feel guilt for everything I've done and want to off myself for it. Totally different story though. EDIT: As I mentioned in a comment in another post, I should say that I'm actually working on healing, but of course, my old inner narcissistic self comes out now and then. You heard from that side of me, not the side of me that's working on fixing things XD. About half a year ago, I used to be best friends with a guy who I actively disliked, but stayed with him for lack of anyone better. He was most certainly selfish and used his "past trauma" for attention. Anyway, he was such a hassle, he argued with others a lot, including me, to the point where his roommate literally cut his agreement and moved out because he was that unbearable.We ended our friendship in a huge argument, where I confronted him on his behavior and he just kept blaming me and denied any wrongdoing. The thing that really pissed me off, though, is how CHILL he was when arguing. He wasn't passionate or desperate in his voice. He LEGITIMATELY thought he was doing nothing wrong and having a conversation.If any of you guys have seen Chris Hansen's predator shows, he reminds me of Jeff Sokol. He's the guy who spoke about assaulting a minor with not even the slightest bit of remorse in his voice, as though what he did was completely normal. Of course, this guy wasn't THAT bad, but his style of talking in a tense moment reminds me of that.I'm not joking when I say that behavior creeped me out. I ran away from the guy and never looked back. He tried to act "caring" during our arguments but once he realized I was serious about leaving him, he hurled insults at me. I was his last major friend, and I admit I fell for his "trauma dumping" because I try to see the best in everyone, but even I was done at that point. I saw him a couple of times later, he ended up completely alone. It was sad to see, but it wasn't undeserved.I was reading a post one day that said "If you date a narcissist boy, he will make you his mother." As in, if he had a dysfunctional relationship with his mother, he'll take all his anger he got from her onto you.Very interestingly, I always found my own mother difficult to trust with my life problems, since she was very judgmental. More like a "if you have a problem, get over it" type person.It made me realize that almost every close friendship I've had with a girl, I've trauma dumped or at least dragged her into a serious conversation that I should've had with my parents but didn't. And I would often get clingy and too dependent, which would blur the line between whether I saw them romantically or not (I'm a guy). I never truly had interest in them romantically, but I would be so dependent it would seem like I was.In essence, every girl I've been close friends with has become a stand-in for my own needs. Narcissism XD. I've lately begun masking by keeping all my thoughts to myself. Even when I spoke to myself out loud or meditated, I've just kept them in my head. To be honest, it's a lot calmer and more peaceful. I've had much better interactions with others because I either think carefully of what to say or I remain silent. But I feel like a piece of me is missing, like I died in a sense.For background, I was a chronic yapper. But now, while I've created space for myself and others, that space feels empty inside.I am truly convinced that my NPD is uncurable. My hope is to heal enough that I can be a functioning member of society and have friends, but NPD is the core of who I am. I don't feel like I can change unless I become a completely different person.Around 5-6 years ago, I had a friend group and in it was a someone who was friends with me, but we weren't close. She was insanely positive-oriented and lifted everyone up, including me, giving everyone attention and being well-liked by everyone. I thought that behavior attracted me to be friends with her, but I realize now that it was me picking my target for attention. Because she gave attention like free money, I sought to suck as much of it out of her as possible.Because of this, I started talking to her a lot more. Eventually, I began flooding her with sob stories. Of course, she said she'd support me, but after a while, she started to notice how frequently I did it. She also told me I'm better off telling a therapist, but I refused. I never truly understood why I refused one until now, when I realized I didn't want to fix my problem; I wanted to suck her attention away.Naturally, as most normal people would, she started distancing herself from me. Because of that, I started badmouthing her privately to her friends, saying she was fake and that her kindness was an act. I kept telling them how they would be next and that she doesn't mean anything that she says. People sided with her anyway, and I saw myself lose most of my friends.I kept complaining that I was the victim and I was being robbed, and that I was the only one that really knew her well because she ignored me while showering positivity to everyone else. She began ignoring me in person, on texts, everything. I kept texting regardless, giving a worse and worse sob story each time, and I also relentlessly apologized for my actions for even a squeeze of sympathy. Eventually, the friend group drifted, and I no longer saw her, so I stopped texting her.For years, I kept believing I was a victim and that she was evil, but I mourned our friendship because we used to get along well, and we had small pocket moments that I still cherish. But it was my narcissism and my need for attention that ended up destroying all of it.I just recently realized how abusive I was towards her and how she actually did nothing wrong. It turns out, I was entirely the problem. Had I spoken to her politely, respected her boundaries, and even listened to her advice of seeking therapy, I wouldn't have dug my hole that deep. The good thing, I guess, is that now that I'm aware of this, I can make sure things like this don't happen again.I recently graduated from undergrad college. Unfortunately, one of my last remaining college friend groups outed me and, for the first time I've ever heard, they called me out directly on being a narcissist. The worst thing was that I was never aware I was acting out of the ordinary but when they reframed things for me and told me how they felt, I was genuinely shocked. I've had a few people actually call me out before, but I coped it by saying they're delusional. Usually, people just avoid me altogether.Anyway, it wasn't so much this that bothers me, it's what it ended up snowballing into. I ended up realizing that the reason why I was so introverted in college and "enjoyed being alone" was actually just a cope I had and claimed that I was working while others partied and so I felt superior in that way. I was in a few friend groups, but ended up getting kicked out of pretty much all of them. I still have some friends from college, and even one friend group, but they're dispersed and a lot of them don't live in my area, so it's pretty much goodbye on that front as well. I actually moved states mid-college, so pre-college friends are out the window too.I had been considering getting therapy again for some time, but this situation was the last straw and I'm actively going to look for one. I need someone to properly tell me how to socialize.The thing is, people kind of go their own way after college. I was wondering how I could actually go about making friends in a healthy way. What the confrontation taught me was that I was too attention seeking and never gave people space and often rambled a lot (as I'm doing here). I think fixing that would go a long way. But I'm not sure how we as adults are supposed to find friends, and was looking for input.So I'm grateful that I am a young, healthy man and I consider myself quite ambitious and looking forward to the future. But I won't lie, I went through something 4 years ago and it destroyed me mentally (no need to share the details, it's not relevant) but after working on myself for a while I'm very very grateful and happy to share that I've recovered and healed from it entirely and I've been living happily and looking forward to the future!The only thing that feels wrong is that sometimes it feels strange to be positive and not have "mental health struggles" like the people around me. I am very very cautious about my diet and work out regularly and make sure to sleep well, so I have that going for me that's different than my peers. The thing is, of course I experience some negative thoughts and moments time to time, but at this point I just excuse myself and get myself privately and just let my thoughts roll and I'm usually back to my typical, confident self. Like, I'm not even joking, I don't even bother telling anyone if I'm feeling down because if I give it enough time, the negative thoughts fade. So it feels very out of place to just be positive and look forward to everything.Don't get me wrong, I love being this way and I would much, much rather be like this than be like my old depressed self. But it does feel kind of like a "too good to be true" sometimes. I hope all is going well for you all though!!. Just fyi I didn't crank one on the 31st either, so I'm theoretically on my fifth day (that's no excuse tho). But it means I'm a tad bit crazier. Doesn't help that I gym consistently so I feel like a rampaging T. rex LOL. Was just curious. I've been living under a rock and hadn't seen any flyers as of late. Was thinking of drafting up a stand-up comedy routine for the funsies.As title suggests, I am a man myself, but have recently been a little bit interested in a relationship with a guy after catching feelings for someone recently. As you'd imagine, most guys are straight, so I want to know if there's any particular place or event or whatever where guys interested in homosexual relationships may be on campus, so the typical guys finding girls or girls finding guys advice isn't really the same here. I appreciate any help!! I've been here long enough to know homophobes exist on this campus, so I'll personally ignore any comments ridiculing this question without merit.\^I'm obviously joking guys. I've been working a lot on being more positive by cutting out bad habits and focusing on my hobbies, passions, and schoolwork. Was wondering if there are any groups on campus that are largely the supportive-type people. Example could maybe be a gym class where everyone uplifts each other. I appreciate any suggestions!. I've had my youtube channel where I tutor computer science coding interviews for about a year, but to be honest, I did it for my own sake and never sought to grow the channel. I've gotten interested in actually making engaging content, so I've been working on reforming my teaching ability.After looking at my analytics, I think the best way for me to go is to refine my teaching methods so that it's more engaging to an audience, but I want to know if there's anything major that I'm missing. I'm sitting at 13 subscribers, and wanted to know if there was anything else that would raise the count that you all have done when you were at this point. Once again, I'm aware of improving the teaching ability, but maybe if there was better aesthetic, thumbnail, algorithm, hashtags, etc? I appreciate any help everyone!. So basically, I'm a guy (fyi), but I've had a history of enjoying dancing recreationally. I stopped dancing years ago because I became a little bit more socially awkward, but I've been wanting to break out of my social comfort zone as of late and maybe take up dancing once again, so I was wondering if anyone knows any on or off campus dancing classes I could maybe join?? Bear in mind, I'm doing this casually and for fun/for a good time, but I'd appreciate any help anyone can provide!. Title says it all. I know Hitt Hall has a Chick Fil A but I'm wondering if it replaced the one at Owens. I'm just too lazy to go check it myself, since I'm often busy and Owens is out of my way.I apologize if this is the wrong server to post this in, but knowing the content in here, I felt it would be appropriate. If not, I would appreciate if I'm provided a better place to post.Truth be told, I was formerly pretty negative and went through trauma, but over the past few months, I had healed from it and became more confident. I now regularly keep up with my work ethic and also hit the gym consistently, and life has been at a very high point for me. The thing is, though, while I have been growing in activity, my friend group hasn't.Just the other day, my friend tried to bring me down and projected his own problems onto me by claiming I had "anxiety" and "fear" over something I didn't, and claimed I wasted my time when in fact he wasted his time on gaming, drugs, alcohol, etc. My other friends defended him, so this made me realize that I've outgrown my friend group because I'm absolutely tired of the cynicism.So, I was wondering how you all surrounded yourself with more positive friends, or if you wanted to also just chat with me. I'm open to all suggestions!. Hello! I was wondering if anyone used HelloTalk to talk to Arabic speakers for Fusha (MSA/Classical/formal, etc.) Arabic. For my purposes, I only need to know formal Arabic (I understand it's only written and not "spoken" by anyone) and don't need to learn a dialect. Do people on HelloTalk still help you with this or do you need to have a particular dialect in mind? Thank you all very much!. Hello! I'm a senior about to graduate, and plan to apply to Bloomberg and IBM for a full time position (haven't done an internship at either, but I've had 4 internships). My question is, what kind of Leetcode questions should I expect for a FULL TIME position. And I'm aware of the System Design interview, I'll be preparing for that. Any tips on what to study would help too (beyond Grind 75 and Neetcode 150, yada yada). Preferably the more recent advice, the better, since the job market has changed recently. I appreciate any help!. I'm not particularly gifted in the realm of combinatorics and probability questions, so I've managed to fail exams in both these classes quite miserably (everyone says in STAT4705 that the exams are easy, but virtually everyone this semester was crying it was super hard, and I attest). I was thinking, what were people's experiences with taking either STAT4705 (prob for engineers) and MATH3134 (applied combo) over the summer? Was it doable? Cause I promise, this probability stuff is gonna be the reason I'm struggling to graduate XD everything else is very much under my control except this subject. But to graduate on time, I'm forced to take these in the summer. I'm waiting out on dropping 4705 (taking it this semester) although the first exam left my grade in very bad shape. So I'm just talking about 4705 in the sense of *perhaps* I may want to take it in the summer. MATH3134, though, as long as it's doable, I plan on taking.. I've been songwriting hip hop for about a year now, but I've done it nearly every day and love what I do. I actually enjoy writing really personal and detailed stuff (like serious music). The problem is, I'm not sure how "relatable" I can actually make my music in regards to rap culture. A lot of my raps are fictional stories, some personal ones (when I really feel something) and otherwise mostly braggadocios or mental health rants.The thing about me is, I do come from a middle class family, and I'm currently an engineering student in college, hoping to get a job soon. The best thing I really do about this is write about the job market, but that doesn't come off as something I'd really want people to think about me. A lot of my favorites are old school hip hop, but I'm not going to pretend like my life is like theirs; I didn't grow up in street life, and I'm not going to write about that stuff.Essentially, I want to make content unique to me, while also being different, and avoiding typical cliche topics (I write them, but even I get bored of them after a while). I'd appreciate any help!EDIT: I think the reason why I had to mention I don't write about street stuff is because I heard a purists' opinion that if you don't come from the streets you can't make music with hard emotion. I think I kind of took it in because I kind of felt like that sort of life is something "adventurous" or "story-like". But thank you, everyone in the comments, you really reassured me! I know it's odd, but I felt kind of down over this. Your comments actually made me feel hopeful again! Thanks to each and every one of you!. Basically, what I mean to say is, how do you determine whether a rapper's lyrics or a song of theirs is corny or not? I see the word corny used a lot on songs that other people call "bars", and the reverse, etc. So I'm starting to believe the term "corny" is becoming subjective. So, let me know what YOU think makes an artist or song corny XD. Most people take unsolicited advice badly and personally, and I can personally attest to why I feel the same way.There's a quote by an old pastor, I don't remember his name, but it's one I definitely think about a lot -- "While most people think it's intelligent of them to point out other people's flaws, there is nothing more unintelligent in doing so" or along those lines.One example I genuinely dread is that I used to pray religiously a few years ago (I no longer pray but consider myself more on the spiritual side), and my mother, who prays nonstop, once got mad at me about a few months ago, berating me and my current situation, on the fact that I stopped praying. She would say "Maybe if you pray more, your life will be as good as when it was when you did." It's frustrating because:* She has NO idea of what my opinion of my life is; hell, I may have hated it back then, and liked it now. How would she know?* I MOVED STATES AND SWITCHED SCHOOLS to a school that has far more prestige than my previous; and this of course means more work* I'm working on finding a job but the job market is much worse than it was before, back then in my life I wasn't worried about finding a job* Schoolwork is tougher now in my later years, but they were easy back thenI could go on. Point is, it's downright insulting to give that "advice" and singlehandedly ignore all of the effort I've been putting into myself and my work and my situation just on "prayer." There's way more factors to the situation.Now here's the interesting thing; my mother gives this advice because it's biased on HER side. It starts to make sense when you think about it this way. She has never applied for a job, went beyond high school, etc. (always was a housewife). But she has sat down and does her prayer and makes sure the whole damn world knows about how devoted she is (seriously, she'll brag about it with friends). So she sees my life from HER perspective only, without even thinking for a second about mine.This same principle applies to giving unsolicited advice; you think you're "helping" the person but you're just being ignorant of them, and maybe even arrogant over their lives, well being, and progress. It's downright insulting to tell someone who just lost their loved one "It happens all the time, I'd suggest you just get over it and move on with your life." That's an extreme example, but the point stands.Unless I ASK for advice, or I'm in a learning situation such as school or counseling or I'm actively seeking help for something, random people such as friends, family, etc. giving me advice is annoying and should be ignored. Very sure others feel the same XD. After having to spend my lifetime dealing with religious people and the Christian right, I've noticed something beyond the Christian and Islamic heavy religionist spectrum. So let me explain what I mean.My personal belief is that such people in actuality have a rational mind, but have been taught to shut it up and have lost contact with it. The truth is, these religionists at some point in their life experienced one or more of the many fears that lead to devoutly practicing an organized religion, such as fear of death for themselves or loved ones, fear of living an unfulfilled life, reparations for poverty of either themselves or others, fear of being disliked or abandoned by their community, etc.See, the interesting thing about both deeply religious Christians and Islamists is that neither of the "deeply religious" people actually read their scripture in their leisure time. Christians usually go to the church and read select verses, whereas Muslims do the same with mosques and also recite their scripture in a foreign tongue. I, having read the Quran and some of the Bible, actually occasionally astonish deeply religious people by content in their own book! Based on my observations, and how they actually speak, I actually believe they refuse to read their book in fear of atheism.The fact of the matter is, it's very easy to find contradictory Bible verses, or Islamic literature that condones unethical practices, but the reason why they don't refer to these often is because they'd like to shield their mind against the violent aspects of religion.Let me give an example; there are several hadiths in Islamic literature, that regardless of "context" or time-based reasoning, argue for amazingly unethical practices that, whether you'd like to admit it or not, actually could serve as a perfect rationale for terrorist attacks. Yes, I know not all Muslims agree with terrorists, or believe in such things. But the fact of the matter is, there's inevitably language in there that can 100 percent be justified through the violence Islamic terrorists show, and anyone of sound mind would agree. The problem is, much of the mainstream Islamic community hasn't read that far into their own literature, and even the scholars that have have avoided the topic for so long, that to say "Islam isn't like that" or "they don't represent what Islam really is" is a false statement. When they think of "Islam", they think of their prayers, the dinners they have, weddings, etc., not the ideological aspect. Such practices are 100 percent found in Islamic literature that mainstream Islam calls authentic; to distance themselves from this, they'd have to reject literature that they wholeheartedly claim to agree with.Anyway, so back to my point, my belief is that extremist (or devout) religionists actually truly fear atheism because they're afraid of their life going to waste or no Hereafter or to fit in or whatever, that they allow themselves to be manipulated by the church or the mosque to believe that such things exist. They're told not to question their religion, only to submit, and tithe as much as they can so the scholars can make big bread (LOL). They're usually taught atheism is a great evil, hence why I've seen literally *every* religious person, both Christian and Muslim, get unnecessarily panicked when I bring up the topic. Even other religions don't scare them as much as atheism does. Atheism gives them that special panic because they remember the fear that atheism could be true is possible.This is why several of them vote for politicians that persecute or denounce atheists, or never read their religious book and only insist it should be read a certain way. Frankly, the age old saying that religion is based on fear is very much true and alive, and why logical reasoning simply can't take place, as fear is reason's greatest enemy.\*\*\*Sorry for the long read, I always plan these things to be short but can't help letting it all out, also it's 2:45am which probably means something XD. To clarify my beliefs, I don't consider myself religious necessarily but still kind of spiritual in a sense, so basically agnostic, but nonetheless, I'm kind of in the "other" category when it comes to the topic.So I used to be a devout Sunni Muslim, but of course I was always told to be open minded and think about everything I'm being taught, so eventually I found it problematic and mustered the courage to drop it altogether. I will say, however, that the two or so years I was VERY devout of it, I feel like I threw my life away.Not even kidding when I say I took it like a part time job. Did five prayers, fasted, all that stuff. I used to remember how ambitious I was in wanting to leave my small town, make music (my hobby) and travel the world and make the most of my life. All that changed when I became more "devout" and I just felt like acting like a slave to a system I wasn't even completely sure even worked, because "I'll get the next life". What didn't help was that I had so many relatives (even to this day) who do all this stuff and validate other people for that and tried their best to keep me in that mindset.Anyway, I "broke free" yadda yadda, nothing really to glorify here, I kinda just left the same way you guys have, and after a while I started picking up hobbies again that I had ditched earlier. I started noticing I became a lot more ambitious and fulfilled in my life, something that Sunni Islam's "God" somehow was oblivious to. I now enjoy my time and look forward to my life, and I feel as though everything's becoming normal.So the reason why I write this is simply because I feel like those two years were truly a waste of my time and my capabilities. I really just feel like I threw my life away, and yet, I still consider myself fortunate from the more religious people in my family, who've been doing this their whole life. What's even more depressing is that I feel like deep down they all know well that they've thrown their life away, but they've shut that voice up and think that to just keep doing what they're doing is the only way out. The religious people in my family are ironically far more miserable than the non-religious ones.So I write my own hip hop lyrics (before anybody reports me lol, I'm not trying to promote it or anything, it just fits within this story) and suddenly I got to the point where the subject matter was Tom MacDonald and spontaneously I came with the line "Raps about wokeness, cause it puts me to sleep." Again, whack or not, idk it perfectly summarizes my opinion of him.Don't like the guy at all just because he over-exerts on politics. I get there are "political" rappers, but they tend to have a story or some kind of personal connection to the matter, bro's from Canada and spits this lmao. Not only that, his execution is just horrible and it feels like he's just jumping around for points and clicks. It's kinda like how people say Disney is doing the same thing with their "diversity" measures, but it's the other way around.Idk, but once again, I'm not promoting my work or anything like that, but I feel like my bar perfectly resonates with my (and a lot of other people's) opinion on him.Title says it all. I'm considering pulling a W on a class but it will take me from 12 credits to 9, which I believe makes me a part time student. Am I allowed to do this, and if so, what are the consequences?. So many years ago I had a traumatic event happen to me, and even though it was very long ago I still have massive flashbacks and nightmares of it, which is why I started avoiding any triggering places, people, etc. but still suffer it on a daily basis. I am curious but also concerned I may be suffering from some sort of PTSD, so I was wondering where on or off campus I could meet with a professional and see if it's an issue. I appreciate any help you can provide! Also to clarify with all due respect, I'm not a veteran, cadet, or involved in the military whatsoever, so any military-specific treatment doesn't apply to me.. So I actually study computer science in college but I do music on the side, and I can easily say I prefer music over CS. That being said, I took a small sequence of music production classes on the side. However, this semester's been so overwhelming with classes, getting a job, etc. always on my mind (not to mention I'm also an artist and write as well) so I haven't been able to give production its fair time (I *really* want to, but I finish work at like 1am and have to sleep before morning class) and so that already worried and stressed me out, but now my audio tech class had started piling up on me that I had no choice but to drop it because it demanded so much while playing no role in my progression towards my degree. I dropped it but I feel like I've been burying my production career and dropping this class is the last nail in the coffin.I don't want to quit producing and I hope to do it enough to quit my job (crazy dream, not "realistic", I get it) but the thing is, I worry about not being able to meet people in music for connections or collab, or that the lack of structure will throw me off. I'm just in a state of denial right now. Sorry if this was a long read.I was wondering if anyone had taken CS2506 with Xun Jian, and if so, how were his midterms? Mine is this Thursday. Some of it doesn't make sense maybe, I just kind of go off my head, but I'd appreciate your thoughts on this! I actually took like 6-8 lines off of this because it literally didn't make any sense XD:I got a harsh and full arsenal of rhymes that are at times unparseable,Cause I embark on goals alone unknown to the old farts at home,Telling me they're selling free nice advice more than twice in my life,I fully need no bullet to bite, or take hikes spiced with added turnpikes,I stay a straight line so when victory became mine I could claim time,Wasn't wasted facing imaginary places that came nigh,Of my rabid expectations relatin' to what I'm makin',A sculpture of my culture, shouldered a vulture, I'm waitin',For the jealous zealous haters to tell us we're Satan,When I come in the grind, wasn't blind, wasn't fakin',Right every time, I fight many guys to prove my point,Cause they regret, I feel set, my life isn't disjoint!. Sorry to say it, but yeah, it's true. I'm speaking about American Christians. I'm of course a bit biased against this because I knew someone who was Christian and complained that someone "said something bad of Christianity" and "that's not how our beautiful religion is and we can't take attacks like this." Saying stuff like "we're in the crazy times" and "no one cares anymore." Then she started talking about idolatry saying people should stop "telling them to take others as my savior when my savior is in the sky." AS IF that's even happening! No one gives a shit about your religion these days where I'm from, except the actual religious people (that being, the religious people that won't shut up, not the moderate/liberal/non-practicing ones).It's also annoying in my opinion to hear all the BS about how "woke and gay people" are indoctrinating children (a fact debunked by numerous studies) and that they're actually literally grooming kids into their sky daddy religion. Then they claim they're very pro free-speech and Constitution but get riled and upset when someone says they don't like Christianity.I'm just saying, but like it's literally SO easy to be a Christian in this country. Nearly every celebrity is a Christian, nearly every president and senator identifies as Christian, there is literally ZERO oppression against Christianity beyond people shoving stuff down non-Christian's throats. It gets infuriating because there are real people oppressed in this country, like black people, Muslims (you may not like their beliefs, but they don't deserve to be treated badly so long as they mind their own business), Hindus, etc.The fact that these people aren't experiencing anything then claiming to be oppressed is the most effective proof of their privilege.So a relative of mine was pretty irreligious throughout his life, in which case he was perfectly fine. I mean, he was spoiled when we were younger, but after a while he had matured quite a bit. Now the thing is, he loves his friends and his local community, and they all started becoming more religious (Islam). They do their five daily prayers, and so he jumped on the bandwagon. Let me tell you, this guy had NO religion in his life and the fact that he became so adamant about praying with friends made me realize, using my limited human intuition, that he had a huge FOMO moment and didn't want to act like the odd one out of his friend group.Fast forward to now, he always prays and makes it his bragging right, as if that's his greatest accomplishment. Literally all the religious adults I know in my family do the same shit, thinking that just because they can follow a robotic movement devoid of any meaning and recite words in Arabic they don't even understand that they're somehow above everyone else. Such is the delusion their religion and community feeds them.These days he looks down on anyone who doesn't pray, and gives me a HUGE silent treatment compared to earlier when he was much more laid back. He starts saying stuff like "I wish I knew Arabic", and used to have a lot of hobbies but now either sits on his phone or pretends to occupy himself with "religion" and is increasingly isolated from the rest of us secular folk.The worst part is, unless he has some grand moment (which I doubt because he can be fixed minded on things), he's unlikely to change. He gets huge validation and cheers from the crazy religious folk in my family, and is always used as an "example" of a good person. That so called "good person" was nice to me then became an absolute asshole to me later."Religion is good for you" my ass. He regressed significantly once this "religion" took over.&#x200B;\*\*\*EDIT: I can't change the title, but please just ignore the word "soul" in the title. I was typing last minute and didn't think my way through the title, I understand there are better ways to convey the point. Don't be like religious people who skim through a body of text just to find the one thing they can use as an excuse to spread hatred over.I promised I wasn't gonna make it too long but I have had a crazy night and am too lazy to get any work done.I live in the US, and moved out of my old state but I still keep contact with some of my friends there. I had a friend who I used to discuss religion with but always with an open mind, and she was Christian. After some contact, she later told me she had a crush on a guy we both knew (mutual friends) and after I had left they started seeing each other and going out together. The problem was, they were both religious and discussed marriage but she was refusing to cooperate because he is a Muslim and she didn't want to marry a non-Christian.So she called me out of the blue one day when I was enjoying my life asking me for my advice on the topic. I told her politely that I didn't have a say in the matter and that this was their issue to resolve. But deep down, I really wanted to scream into the phone that refusing to marry someone just over their religious affiliation and nothing else was complete bullcrap.We had a followup discussion after I took time to digest the information and she clarified further that she tried to literally follow the Bible when it warned against marrying non-Christians, and implied but attempted to cover up the fact that she viewed non-Christians as morally inferior. She stated she wanted to marry a Christian to ensure her marriage would work because marriage/divorce rates have gotten much worse recently.So I straight up told her that she should either be more open-minded or cut this guy off. But I was seriously just annoyed at the stupidity I was hearing. Everything went well with them until RELIGION got in the picture.Mind you, I have seen too many interfaith marriages that worked amazingly and too many marriages of the same faith that were catastrophic. I'm sure that should an all-knowing God exist, God would be well aware to not make up such a bogus rule.EDIT: I would also like to clarify that I trusted this person with kindness and good deeds and all. That whole conversation and her clarifying her beliefs ruined all of it. I have kept limited, if no, contact with her since.EDIT 2 (because a comment on this post reminded me of this but didn't fit into the response): She used to tell me a lot that she wants to "discover the real truth." She reiterated on that view even during our last discussion. However, she did demonstrate hostility towards Hinduism and atheism, atheism being on several occasions. She really told me "I wanna discover the real truth", which in the English language, translates to "If it's not Jesus, then fuck it.". I'm actually not an atheist (I reject all religion but I do still feel like some kind of "god" exists -- maybe I'm agnostic?) but I'd like to acknowledge as someone who grew up in an Islamic environment, mainstream Islam claims to be the only religion that only worships one God but actually idolizes many. God is just an empty name they say in prayer. Virtually every other faucet of Islam glorifies Muhummad. To be a Muslim, you must say a sentence in Arabic that puts God's name next to Muhummad. The Adhan call mentions only the names of God and Muhummad. The Kaaba in Saudi Arabia has the name God and Muhummad next to each other on the same level. Several mosques do this as well. Mosques are supposed to be "houses of God alone" but are designed green because it was Muhummad's favorite color. Muslims take a majority of their beliefs from Hadith and only use the Quran to recite because the Hadith tells them to. Otherwise they never use the Quran other than preach why it's so important. They don't mind you calling God by only Allah but gasp in horror if you don't follow Muhummad with "peace be upon him" or "Prophet Muhummad" or the other 6 billion ways to praise him that they would never do with God. This is quite ironic coming from the religion that asserts its authority on monotheism yet is so hellbent on praising Muhummad that I often see the most quoted Quran verses involve Muhummad despite the fact he's nearly never mentioned by name in it. Muslims even liked it when a Muslim rapper made a song called "Muhummad Walks" in response to "Jesus Walks" by Kanye West which shows how they compare Muhummad to Jesus in the Bible. The icing on the cake to all of this is, I've read the Quran and studied Islam and the Quran itself says all prophets, Muhummad included, are equal. I've mentioned this to several Muslims and they get furious and tell me I'm disrespecting their Holy Prophet. I remind them that God wrote the Quran, not me, so if they take issue with it, they argue with God, not me. But being as thin faced as they are, they blame me anyway. A religion that focuses so hard on the idea of worshipping one God but left this huge hole in its ideology is living proof it's false and can't stand to reason. This was mainly intended towards Sunni Islam, which is the vast majority of Muslims. I do understand different sects and ideologies do things differently.So I've been at VT for a year, but I actually never took the SmartWay bus to Roanoke before. Do they stop only at airports/trains for people to go to faraway places? Or do they also come around the downtown area so we can explore it as we please? Thanks for your time!. Title says for itself. Citizens wifi is going to be my internet provider and was wondering if anyone else in blacksburg has used it. Reviews on Google are hit or miss so I honestly have no idea what to expect. Any advice or opinions on this?. The question is in the title. Have some annoying people telling me I need a high GPA to get jobs. A lot of my friends have GPAs at my level but get amazing jobs. So I just want to put that GPA in perspective. How does a 3.2 (out of 4) look to employers?. Hi, I was wondering what people's experience with the Virginia Tech Electric Service was.Also, my apartment management told me I had to use VT Electric Service when I asked if I could switch to another provider. I read somewhere that I have a right to my own electricity provider. Can someone verify this statement?Thanks for your time!. I'm a CS major and kind of new to the college, and wanted to know how to make some friends in CS. Preferably, some people who'd like to work on a project together and/or prep for technical interviews. I know Torg is a good hangout spot for these people, but was just curious. I have CS people in my class but these are usually lecture halls where there isn't much of an ability to socialize.Hi everyone! I have an expired passport (I'm a natural-born US citizen) and I wanted to know if I can update my passport here. I heard somewhere that Squires lets you update your passport. Anyone else know if this is true? If not, is there another way I can renew my passport? I appreciate any help you can provide!. Hi everyone,I was just feeling like giving back and was wondering if there were any volunteer/community service-type places around campus. Events are great but preferably like places where I can regularly attend to. I appreciate any help you can provide!.
    my amazing father, whom i have unfortunately inherited this cluster B shitshow from, has yet again proven how much of a piece of shit he is! didnt wish me happy birthday for 2 years in a row. i went off on him last year and this year. i said some vile shit and he deserved to hear every single word of it. he keeps saying hes right and he doesnt have to apologise, and i keep saying im right and he has to apologise because who the fuck doesnt wish their daughter happy birthday for 2 years in a row? are you good? anyways, it was a cycle of that, so i ended up blocking him.i told my psychiatrist what happened in the session we had today because im still too fucking pissed about it despite it happening 5 days ago. she asked me to tell her about those instances where i was so 'furious' that i hated 'someones existence' so much to the point i was very mean to them. i told her about a few that i can recall the details of.she said in all those situations i was making myself out to be right. i said thats because i was. like i know npd is supposed to distort my reality or whatever the fuck but morally speaking i was in fact in the right when i cut off my ex best friend for fucking my brother. anyways. she said it sounds like i was angry because i was trying to protect my ego but at the same time not all the reactions were 'npd typa destructive' and some of them sounded more like borderline splitting. i was dumbfounded so i kept looking at the woman with the most confused expression ever. she said shes suspecting it in me and that its very common for cluster Bs to have comorbid personality disorders or traits of other cluster B personality disorders. i already know this, but never in a thousand years would i have ever thought that i have borderline traits or bpd? i guess we will just talk more about it in the next session. oh well.idk man. the more i try to heal from whatever caused me to be this way, the more shit it ends up bringing into my life. or the more shit it makes me aware of. more shit that disturbs me. im tired of feeling uncomfortable, i just wanna go back to my pre-therapy self. atleast i was comfortable. ffs.tw// mentions of sa TLDR: my ex made false r accusations against meso my friend texts my ex boyfriends new girl like 2-3 days ago to let her know how much of a crazy bastard he is because he sent me really graphic and violent death threats back in july and my friend thought she should know to be safe, just incase.i didnt report his death threats to the police because he threatened me saying he would sue me for emotional abuse and "the police have proof" of this apparently. for context: the incident hes talking about is when we were arguing really badly on call this one time and i was having a mental breakdown. i dropped something and it hit my pinky toe so i kinda screamed and didnt say anything for a while cus i was trying to calm down. he thought i self deleted so he called the police and the police deadass got to mine right after i fell asleep at 6am after an exhausting ass night of arguing with a manchild. he told them i was threatening i was gonna self delete (not true, but im just someone who says im gonna key em ess out if frustration and as a joke, not because i mean it or im actually gonna do it). the police come and ask me a fuck load of questions saying this was a domestic case n whatnot so i just tell them it was a joke that i was pulling and it got too out of hand. now i said all this because i didnt wanna get this dumbass in trouble for anything. he was literally crying to me on call earleir talking bout some 'the police are coming for me theyre gonna arrest me' LIKE BRO YOU CALLED THEM ON ME N NOW THEYRE COMING TO YOU TO CHECK IF YOURE OK ?? THEYRE NOT GONNA ARREST YOU ?? even if they were.. df u want me to do ??😭 anyways so in their records, the police have "this mans girlfriend pulled a prank on him about self deletion". i assume thats what he means by "proof of emotional abuse". this is why he threatened to sue me if i reported the death threats. he also said he was going through a psychotic break/mental breakdown at the time of sending me the death threats, so apparently that cancels them out. anyways, onto the topic at hand now.my friend that emailed my exs new girl didnt do this to shit on his name or anything. i wasnt onboard with it at first because i didnt want any issues with my ex since he knows where i live and everything but then i realised that i am also genuinely concerned for the girls safety as well as mine. she says to my friend that she wants to talk to me directly so i can explain better. she texts me saying that he did in fact call me crazy multiple times (what a fucking shock.. predictable piece of shit),hes quite possessive when it comes to being out with her in public spaces and always invades her personal space, and hear this, they are not even dating even tho he refers to her as 'my girl'. this clearly creeps her out because she made sure to say "i have made it clear to him that we arent dating" to me. she said he also makes some crazy sexually violent statements when people piss him off. he did all this when he was with me as well, and it was quite disturbing.our relationship didnt last very long. 3 months at best. he wasnt the best person to be around. all my friends thought he was weird to be around, which i agreed with. he was really invasive with my personal space, as well. im not someone whos a fan of public displays of affection n stuff and whenever we were out together he would try to make out with me in public and/or crowded spaces knowing it made me uncomfortable. there were a couple times where he would initiate sex knowing im too high/drunk to consent. now the sex part is important. because do you know what this motherfucker told this girl? he made false rape accusations against me saying that it happened when we were drunk and he had bruises on his penis because apparently i forced myself on top of him. before i begin with the reasons why this is not and cannot be true: i am a decent fucking human being who only enjoys consensual love. anything that isnt consensual is fucking disgusting and the people who are into that shit are weird as fuck.first, when i drink, i DRINK. when im drunk, i am in no way, shape or form to get up from where i am. i drink vodka straight from the bottle and i get SHITFACED each and every single time i drink. hence, i only drink indoors, because i know damn well my ass is about to pass out any second and i do not want to pass out outside. i also know damn well i will be unable to get up if i do in fact pass out while outside. so while being inside and having the blossful opportunity of passing out in peace while watching cartoons, there is simply no way that me of all people, had the fucking energy or the will to get up and do all that.second, i am a proud pillow princess and theres nothing i hate more than being on top.third, because of the medication im on, my libido is non existent, and this does not change at times of being under the influence.fourth, he never brought this up with me, ever. weve had countless arguments with this guy both before and after our breakup and he is the type to call you out for anything and everything. he hasnt brought it up once. fifth, sexual health clinic? bruises? im not saying this cannot happen to men. anybody can get raped. but for fucks sake.. i did not and would not touch anybody without consent.i did not do anything to this man or any other person because im simply not a shitty person. my best friend (lets call him james) exposed him around 2 weeks ago to a very large group chat that contained the people from my city that go to the same events we go to. my ex was a part of this large group. james ended up exposing him for his death threats against me, and he kinda got cancelled? i think? and 3 days ago my friend (not james, another friend) emails his new girl telling her about all the death threats and i find out from his girl that hes spreading this shit about me?? he has a deep need for admiration and a crazy victim complex that even i noticed and i am diagnosed with npd. the more i see this shit in people, the more im thankful to myself for carrying on with therapy. theres another event coming up soon and he will definitely be there. theyre artists that i really love listening to, so i will definitely go. both my best friends are coming with me and theyre both stronger and in way better physical condition than he is. my friends have made it clear that i have nothing to worry about and that if he even tries to talk to me he is 100% getting jumped.but yeah. what the fuck do i even do at this point? i could expose him to at least half of the people in my city that hang where he hangs even more than how much james exposed him. i could report him to the police. i could.. man i dont fucking know.what am i even supposed to do in this situation?what the fuck?. i am so in love with myselfliterally i just realised, that after my ex lied to me and made me miserable for 3 days straight, i put him through living hell for the next month or so.not that i'm proud of it, because i didn't specifically plan it or "plot" it, which he accused me of, repeatedly, might i add. my mind working a certain way isn't my fault. i mean shit just happens? i guess? i still got revenge without realising it. i do understand that this is a problem in itself but i hate that motherfucker so much that i do not care how badly this effects my recovery progress. i fucking hate him.he kept telling me 'oh you're doing this on purpose' 'oh you're just tryna hurt me' 'oh this' 'oh that'.. i mean not to say or imply that i wouldn't have done what i did if i was aware of what i'm doing but that doesn't mean i did it on purpose. it's not like i sat down on my ass and got a pen and paper saying "mm let's ruin this mofo😈😈 *insert overly cringe tiktok edgelord music*". it just.. happened?? ugh the way our minds work as pwNPD is fascinating imo.. today i was lashing out at everyone really badly. this included my elder grandmother who raised me ever since i was a baby. she is very authoritative but actually very sweet.in therapy we concluded that she was a big part of my npd developing and recently we found out i possess bpd traits too. my psychiatrist insisted that the approval of her was the one thing that i tried to get and failed miserably every time.i love her. i would kill for her. i would die for her. the thought of her passing away is enough to make me depressed for weeks. i was lashing out real bad at everyone today. no fucking clue why. i shouted at her for something so small. so small. so fucking small a grain of sand is a hundred times bigger than it.she then asked 'why are you always shouting at me?'. at this moment i realised what the fuck i had just done. the way she said it. the way i realised. the way this is keeping me up till 3am in the morning.i dont know why this is fucking me up so badly. i hate people at times, the people that i would kill for, but i fucking hate myself more for hurting them. i dont wanna hurt my loved ones. i just wanna be normal.i wanna be so normal that all the pain ive caused to my loved ones magically vanishes. why in the fucks name am i not healthy and a well balanced individual? i have been going to therapy FOR YEARS. im more sick of my bullshit than i am of this planet's. there are times where i am in completely and utterly in love with myself. then there are times where i have reality checks just realising how terrible i am as a person. i dont want to be like tjis anymore. living like this is so exhausting.He doesn't know about my diagnosis and I don't think I should tell him because he has already tried manipulating me and we aren't even dating. He got so mad when I pointed it out too lol.I'm almost 100% certain he'd use it against me if he knew. Do you guys think he should know?. Hi.I don't know if this flair is fit for this question but it was the closest.I don't know much about schizophrenia. The reason why I'm posting on here is to ask for some insight from those who have it. If my question is offensive I'm genuinely sorry, as I said, I don't know much about schizophrenia. I don't have schizophrenia nor have I ever had anyone in my life who has had it until a week ago.I met this friend through social media and we are planning to meet up and smoke some grass in a few days. I don't know whether if he's on medication or not. He has told me that he has been sectioned before and that's one of the things we bonded over. I just wanted to ask, how do you guys get when you smoke grass?. og post: https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/s/jfepmJEJWuso some background first, i was going to quit therapy but we were going thru a rough patch so i decided to heal for him. and our relationship. he said he would be there with me every step of the way and he acknowledged that itd be really hard for the both of us but he did say he would support me no matter what.onto the thing that led me to making the og post.what happened was that i told a white lie to him, it went like:him: what are you doing? me: im on instahim: okayhalf an hour later i told him i was in fact texting my auntie because i felt like if im trying to get better it would need to include 100% transparency and even if its a small thing i didnt want it to affect my progress.and dude, believe me when i tell you this man lost his shit. i acknowledged what i did was wrong, and i did apologise for it. but he wasnt having it.what i expect is that when he made that promise of always being there for me etc, i expect him to comfort me or at least be able to appreciate me for even apologising considering i could not say the word 'sorry' out loud for the life of me before therapy. before the therapy which i stayed in. for him. i dont know how to say this without sounding like a self centered asshole but he made promises and holy shit he needs to fucking stick to them.instead of comforting me or accepting my apology & moving tf on, he kept throwing around rude stuff like 'you wont ever change', 'youve always been like this anyways', 'youll always be self absorbed', 'your only goal is to be right at every situation'.how am i trying to be right when im literally apologising to you? is this you being supportive?i just dont get the people who make empty promises, man. if youre not gonna do it, dont say or promise anything about doing it.'o promoso om gonno sopport yoo' ffs. but anyways all of that aside, my therapist suggested we do a couple's session tomorrow so im looking forward to that. wish me luck, ill need it to remain patient.edit 4/12: thank you all for your comments and calling me out on my bad behaviour here. it has all been a real eye opener and i will make sure to bring all this up in my appointment.. IT LITERALLY FEELS LIKE IM WALKING ON FUCKING EGGSHELLS ALL THE FUCKING TIME AROUND HIM AND I FUCKING HATE HOW HE ACTS LIKE HE KNOWS EVERY SINGLE THING THAT GOES THRU MY HEAD I HATE HOW HE UNDERESTIMATES ME I HATE HOW HE DOESNT FUCKING WORSHIP ME I HATE HOW I DONT GET GIVEN THE BARE FUCKING MINIMUM WHEN IM TRYING TO BE A BETTER FUCKING PERSON FOR HIM AND HIM ONLY AND I FUCKING HATE HOW HE DOESNT VALIDATE ME I HATE HIS EMPTY PROMISES THAT HE MADE ABOUT HELPING ME AND BEING THERE FOR ME AND HOLDING MY HAND TO WALK ON THIS FUCKING "PATH OF LIGHT" WITH ME IM SO DONE I FUCKING HATE THIS FUCK THERAPY AND FUCK HIM AND FUCK THIS LIFE I CANT BE FUCKING ASKED ANYMORE.edit: i updated if anyone wants to read https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/s/WbxXmvZc2U. tldr: my partner isn't showering me with attention and i have a blow out every single time i bring it up.okay im gonna try my best to keep this as short as possible. all i need to know is whether if i should be worried about my behaviour or not.i have been in therapy for almost 2 years now. i have been made aware of multiple behavioural patterns of mine by my therapist in order to help me overcome them. i try my best to build empathy and im on the road to recovery, knowing its quite hard and long. i have been my partner for a couple months. he has helped me a lot in terms of having a stable sense of self. one thing he hates is communication, though thats not the issue for this post but id still like to put it here just so that whoever is reading this post gets an idea.i bring up an issue, he will try to gaslight or manipulate me. i tell him its obvious what hes trying to do, he tries to gaslight me further and further.hes doing the good old push-pull on me as if i havent mastered it myself without even being aware of it. now i know i will get the 'why don't you break up with him', which is a completely valid question. the answer is that i dont wanna jump from relatonship to relationship and waste time. i cant focus on myself either because i need a source. and i know wanting a source is wrong when youre in recovery but thats my honest reason right there, call me hypocritical if you will.now the issue at hand is that when i bring up something he did wrong, along with the poor gaslighting and manipulation attempts (which i utterly pity), there are moments where he attacks my ego and i immediately go into a fight mode where i will get a rise out of him until he accepts whatever he said/did was wrong. if he doesnt, i dont shut up. this leads to him attacking my ego even further but when he attacks it further i tend not to care. i care about the initial attack more than the ones that follow. i care about the initial one because thats what triggers me. not those other ones where i know hes saying just to hurt me. after these, i expect him to come back and apologise and try to make me feel better. not because i feel bad, because he attacked my ego and he should be sorry for it. call me entitled, im okay with that. thats what im in therapy for. but in these moments it becomes really hard for me to actually control my impulses and not manipulate him. when i cant control it, i end up making him feel shitty for not showering me with attention after an argument. as you can already guess, this doesnt really help with recovery, my relationship nor make it healthy.thank you if you have read it this far. any advice with honest and constructive criticism is welcome.WIBTA if I asked my boyfriend not to come to a party he invited himself to?A little context.My boyfriend, (25M), loves inviting himself to my outings with friends. We don't spend a lot of time together. Our universities are on other ends of the city we live in, we still see each other at least twice a week. I make time for him.I hate having my personal space invaded. My boyfriend knows this.Example, I was out high with my friends a few weeks ago. I told him about that, only for him to invite himself to it. When we were quite literally GONE, he would try to snuggle up to me and invade my personal space. I'd gently redirect him, but he kept doing it.When I made it obvious (he was SOBER at the time) he wouldn't stop. I had to push him off me. He took an edible as well, and we stayed there a bit longer.After he felt it, when we started to walk towards the town centre. While walking he kept trying to hold my hand, and I said out loud, "I don't want to hold hands". My body felt heavy, I could barely move my feet due to how high I was, I really couldn't bear to have the weight of a hand touching mine. If you've been this high, you know what I'm talking about. Your own clothes are too heavy to carry.Even my friends told me that he was being a bit too touchy with someone who's high while he's sober.I want to have time with my friends without someone clinging onto me, without invading my personal space. He does this when we're hanging out together, too. He's too clingy, excuses it with his love language being 'physical touch'.Context about today.I, (23F) have been invited to a party at uni. I was told about this party by my best friend (22F), Emma. We were chatting about it then we ran into that friend.The friend (22M), Jason, heard we were talking about it and asked me to come. I said okay. I'm not a party person, but Jason seems a little creepy from all I've seen from his texts to Emma, so I'd like to go is to make sure she's safe.Onto the issue at hand now.Since my boyfriend invited himself to that edible day, I didn't wanna mention the party to him today. But I did. I hate lying.He gets so insecure whenever I go out with friends.For example, for the party, he said things like 'what if someone hits on you?', 'how are you going to protect yourself without me there?' and 'if that Jason guy doesn't want me there it probably means he's going to try something on you'. These make me feel belittled as he has this tone is his voice that makes these sentences come out like: 'Oh, how are you going to protect yourself? You're a girl'He has gone to uni parties before, he had girls hitting on him there. When I brought that up, he said 'but I invited you'. Invited me knowing I wouldn't want to come. They were open parties too. This one is a house party. It's not my house. I know Jason uninvited some people to invite others.He said that either Jason lets him come with me or he won't "allow" me to go.So, WIBTA?EDIT: I WILL NOT take drugs at this party.Is it just me or does anyone else look at their ex partner's character development after they shed their hearts into pieces to see how they held up? And if they've become a better version of themselves, do you take credit for it? Having the 'I made you.' mindset?. Basically, I'm in a new relationship at the moment and I've also been in therapy for the past 6 months, it has done loads for me.While I'm aware I might get a shit ton of hate for this, please give me some advice along with the hate so I can at least figure out what I should do.My partner and I have been having some issues lately. Too many arguments, and not your typical stuff. Each and every single one of these arguments have been so intense.We both have severe trust issues but he makes his trust issues more obvious than I make mine and it has been such a turn off. I know he can't control it because his one might be more severe than mine. While I do understand that, I can't help but feel resentment. Don't take resentment as 'hate', it's not hate. It's loss of attraction in my context.I really wanted to try with this one, I want to keep this one as stable as I possibly can. But being in so many arguments doesn't really help, I guess.I want to break up with him but I'm not sure if he's going to take it lightly. We have made so many promises so early on in the relationship and I didn't set the boundaries I should've set. I know that's my fault.I could've gone on askreddit but I feel like people with the same personality disorder as me might be more helpful than random people on the internet as most of us go through the same shit.Now there's this other guy and we're friends, or so I thought. He has made his attraction towards me very obvious and wants to meet up next weekend for drinks. I told him no as I'm in a relationship that I definitely don't want to mess up but I really am losing feelings and I don't wanna go back to my old ways.I know I will get a lot of people asking why I don't just break up if I'm losing feelings and that's a valid question. The answer is, I really want to keep trying. But at the same time, I do believe I'll go back to my old ways and cheat if I don't sort this out with my partner. The thing is, he isn't exactly making it easy for us to sort out as he's also manipulative and tries to manipulate me often. He knows he can't though. Anyways, sorry for getting off track. But yeah, this is pretty much it.So, what do I do? Do I break up or keep trying?UPDATE: I have blocked the guy who I thought was my friend and told him to fuck off because I really want to keep trying with my partner. I will speak to him about this tomorrow at dinner because if we're in public he can't throw the usual tantrums he throws whenever I express myself. I will update as soon as I'm able to. Thank you for your advices.I literally get pure feelings of disgust and rage when someone tries telling me what to do. It makes me wanna chop them into fucking pieces. I just need to know I'm not alone. If you're gonna be a dick just scroll past please. Thanks.
    [I've read](https://www.canstar.com.au/home-loans/interest-rate-forecast-australia/) that banks are forcasting rate reductions of 1 - 1.5 % over the next 12-18 months. But what if inflation picks back up again when they reduce the rates?For the first time in my life I'm in a position to buy a 1 bed unit, and I will need a new place soon. A 350K loan at 6% would put the cost at \~9K a year above renting. But if rates fell by 1.5% I'd be paying only \~4K above the cost of renting which seems worth it to me. With interest rates so high it will be a bit of a stretch, which I'm comfortable to stomach for the next year or so. But long-term I'd need lower interest rates to make it worth my while.I'm keen to hear anyones thoughts on how reliable a prediction these are and how likely it is that we will see long term lower interest rates than currently. Thanks in advance.Is this like a match made in hell or something?We have deployed 8 of these at a variety of sites and all but one are having big problems.The Nuc keeps rendering the TAP menu on the TV and rendering a black screen on the TAP. We are using the display + table hubs with our solution.We've tried firmware updates, BIOS updates, software updates, we've tried replacing the hardware and we are fresh out of ideas.Has anybody else seen this problem before?.
    A few years ago I (M19) cheated on my now ex-boyfriend with an older man on Grindr while visiting another town. I literally just did it because I was horny, I felt no resentment or devaluing of him. My justification was that he would never know, so it would never negatively effect him. I had no romantic feelings for the hookup (he was actually pretty unattractive, which is another narcissistic pattern I have of gaining supply by giving unattractive people amazing sex because I know how valuable it is/I am to them). I would never even see the hookup again, and it was completely no strings attached. And it didn't decrease my love for my boyfriend, which I believe was the closest I've ever gotten to real healthy love. Obviously, I know it's not the most loyal thing to do, but if it had no effect on me or my boyfriend, was it really that bad? EDIT: Thank you for the replies everybody. I've felt very guilty for what I did in the past, but am having a lapse of grandiosity. My apologies :). This is so exhausting. Up until a week ago, I knew I definitely had BPD, and had considered NPD, but did not feel a connection to it. Then, I came to some realization about myself and my past and I collapsed and was sure I at least had NPD traits. In the height of my collapse I was filled with self loathing and genuine remorse for how I've acted. You know how it feels. Then I felt almost manic that I was having all these realizations, which I assumed was because I was feeling so much more empathy than usual. I almost felt like I was tripping on acid, alternating between a really good and a really bad trip. My mind was filled with intrusive thoughts of things I had done and how guilty I was. I continued for days with that self-awareness, and only became more and more sure that I had NPD as I did more research and thought more about my life. This morning, I even started to think that I had just NPD and not BPD.Then, in the past few hours, suddenly everything seems different. I no longer feel as much of a connection to NPD, and feel like I might only have BPD. During my collapse I had made a list of events in my life that were proof I had at least NPD traits, but reading them back I think they can all be explained by BPD, and also don't have as much remorse. I can identify the behavior as harmful, but I no longer feel so guilty. I feel so insane. Is this just my false self coming back? Is it forgiving myself? I feel like I had such a distinctly narcissistic collapse in terms of how I felt, so why do I feel such a disconnect from NPD now? Nothing even triggered it. I just played games online, got high and dissociated for 3 hours and afterward I feel completely different. I am so fucking suggestible I hate it so much. You could convince me anything about myself and I would believe it.I barely even remember what my realization that started the collapse was, but from what I remember I felt as though I became aware of a voice in the back of my head that I knew was always there, and was secretly the one dictating my actions, and that my fake self "patched up" my motivations with more socially acceptable ones. I now find this to be a stretch. I feel like I just act genuinely, albeit unstable and impulsively. I am so annoyed at myself for being so unsure about myself, I'm angry at myself if it is the case that I am just revert back to a false self, and I feel like the terms BPD and NPD have lost their meaning.So I don't know, lol. Does this seem like typical NPD stuff, or could it be that I deluded myself into thinking the NPD traits that I do have were much more significant/dangerous than they are?EDIT (3 hours later): I'm definitely a narcissist lol. Pretty sure I'm just trying to make justifications again, and it's working. Either way, it's behavior, not pathology, I should be focusing on, and all of this is useless. Let this post be an example of the lengths we'll go to justify things.Sometimes I (M19) have often had the ridiculous thought that I "shamed myself out of being straight/attracted to women" after I faced female rejection when I was still very confidently attracted to women. I fully believed I like women, and fully convinced myself that I did. Since coming out (as bisexual first and then gay), I've come to see that it's just really hard for me to be attracted to women. After coming out, I experimented with my female friends when we were drunk, and I wanted so badly to be able to be attracted to them, but it didn't work. Still, I often find myself thinking that if I really wanted to, I could be attracted to women.I think that really it's much more likely that I never was attracted to women, and that I shamed myself out of being gay (obviously) but also that I am continually shaming myself for not being able to be attracted to women by coming up explanations like "shaming myself out of being straight." To ensure continuity between my false selves, whose perceived sexuality changed so extremely, I *need* to convince myself that at some point, I *was* straight, and that if I really wanted to, I *could* be straight again. It doesn't even feel like internalized homophobia, though I'm sure it's intertwined. It feels more like I'm trying to patch up the logical inconsistency in how I viewed myself before coming out and after. I have always viewed my queerness as failure, my inability to like women as inadequacy. As you can imagine, this is a big trigger for NPD, so I guess it's no wonder my self perception of my sexuality is so obfuscated.The fact that I can be this unsure about something that should have such an obvious answer, and that both of my explanations for this uncertainty are motivated by shame, is so sad. I feel so messed up sexually for so many reasons. Wondering if any other queer pwNPD have a similar complex regarding their sexuality.I recently became self aware and collapsed. I'm through the worst of it now, but I feel like I'll never have the same sense of (relative) security in who I am since I stopped masking. I have been trying to keep my brain occupied and stay in an emotionally vulnerable state. I find myself actively avoiding engaging with the world socially or forming any strong opinions, because I'm afraid I'll be horrible again. I'm doubting every thought I have, and doubting those doubts. Is reaching out to friends (who probably don't want to deal with me anyway) the solution here, or is this something I need to work through on my own? I feel so helpless.Up to my first trip, I had gone all my life stuck in this cycle of treating people horribly, getting cut off, self reflecting, finding no fault in my actions, painting myself as the victim, and moving on to the next person. Despite my reassurance of myself that I was innocent, I have always had a muffled narcissistic voice in the back on my head that knows the reasons I do the things I do, that is drowned out by a heavily masked self working double time to justify my actions.When I first did acid, I felt the relationship between these voices so strongly. It was as if my thoughts were cyclical conversations between these two selves, one reacting instantly to the world around me, and the other investigating the true reason and logic behind these reactions. It was as if a veil was lifted on my fragmented self, and it was the most euphoric experience in my life to finally be able to analyze my thoughts and my self in such a compassionate, non-clouded way. Unfortunately, subsequent trips, I became increasingly disturbed by the state of my self and life, which made me not want to engage with it, but also get a further sense that something is deeply wrong. It took the traumatic experience of being suddenly dropped by all my friends to identify these problems as narcissism, but if not for acid (and to a smaller extent weed), I would have absolutely no idea about any of this. It really saved my life.
    Said the person diagnosed with NPD that is in a subreddit for NPD people and doesn’t respect those who self diagnose themselves. So tell me how a diagnosis is not that important, and you have one yourself and is in this subreddit thanks to it? “You don’t want to be labeled with this stigmatized disorder” Since I was diagnosed I could UNDERSTAND myself and my background and why I’m the way I’m, instead of walking in the dark forever “treating symptoms/traits” and giving all the control and power to therapists/psychologists (who are in their majority dvmb as fvck)Now tell me how people who are looking for a diagnosis are wasting their time? If they stay without a diagnosis, they are bashed and discredited for people with a diagnosis! Haha. In the DSM 5 it says that 50% to 75% of narcissists are males. But everything I see on the internet (YouTube, forums, Reddit etc) is about “narcissistic mothers” waaaay more than fathers. The only area where I see a male predominance when it’s about NPD, is in the date coach bs sphere, where they think that every exploitative asshole is a narcissist when in fact they are probably aspd or subclinical psychopaths, bc dvmb people think = egocentric and ruthless always equals NPD. That being said, in my family, the person responsible for passing me this lovely way of functioning and later making me develop full blown NPD was my father, not my mother. My father was a law enforcement officer, who chose this path as the last try to have some type of authority and power over people after a life of being castrated by his own mother (which doesn’t have NPD btw). He chose to marry my mother. An extremely humble and modest religious woman, who would never outshine him, who accepted all his cheating and gaslight for years. Everything in our house was about fulfilling his needs and making him comfortable. The saddest part of the day was when he would comeback home after work, and since I was a child I prayed he could be shot in the streets and never comeback. He was addicted to pornography, verbally abusive and never complimented me in anything. Everything he did to us he made sure we saw it was so sacrificial to him, it was a HUGE favor he was doing and we should appreciate it. I’ve seen many men talk about feeling castrated by their controlling mothers, but as a woman with NPD that’s exactly how I felt towards my father. He castrated me. He made me his doormat in order to survive him. He taught me how to have a double life and wear masks in public to pretend we were a good family. He silenced me, bc my needs made him uncomfortable. And he’s never gonna be aware of his ways. But I’m. And that’s a huge step out of the pattern he forced me into. Anybody else with a narcissistic father?. She said that in our last session, I asked for her to explain why she saw that I SAW myself as evil and she said when I talk like “I hate everybody. I want to hurt them, I want to destroy them, etc” i sound like i see myself as evil. And I was like no??? I hate when psychologists grasps you wrongly, because it just gets in the way of healing if they don’t know what they are treating or seen me truthfully. How the hell she made this association? I don’t see myself as evil. I see myself as neutral until someone messes with me, pisses me off. So I react. It’s not unprovoked. It’s justified. I don’t lie in bed at night and think “oh I’m evil 😈” 😂 And it also seemed like she’s saying I’m the only one who sees myself “evil” when I’m not for the rest of the world, as if I have a disturbed view of my own self negatively.Have you ever dealt with something like this?. I don’t know if this is something strictly related to NPD. But lately since starting therapy, I was asked to keep an eye on things that trigger me, and I realized I have this insane urge to punish people when I feel wronged/disrespected. When I sense people want to take advantage of me or control me or put me in a position of “humiliation” (which doesn’t require much), I just start to be consumed with fantasies of violence to the point of feeling physical headaches, my heart starts racing and I breakdown emotionally because of the frustration I feel for not releasing it the way I want. I just want them GONE, dead, the fact they are alive is a disrespect to me. I want them unemployed, miserable, sick, I want them to lose everything. It doesn’t matter if it’s someone close, or a stranger, they need to pay. They need to suffer. And I feel that I will die of my own poison if I don’t make them suffer. I need to destroy, but the only person I’m destroying is myself and my only wish is to be able one day to cause a mayhem in the lives of many people. To punish the world for making me wear this fvcking mask. I cannot break free.. I used to have a psychologist who said I always talked about myself in a self deprecating way. Now I have another one who said I see myself as a monster based on the way I talk to myself, but that’s the whole point of how I get my supply as a covert. If I always present myself as flawed, self aware of my shortcomings, spirituality evolved and “humble”, people tend to think I’m harmless and I gain their sympathy and trust so quickly. And it’s so satisfying when I talk “badly” about myself just so I can hear people give me supply on how amazing I’m. It’s also a test to see what people think about me and who I can rely to get supply from. When a classic narcissist would just say “I’m this and this and this and SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE” always putting themselves in the pedestal creating animosity and jealousy right away among peers, I do the opposite and I gain their sympathy and care. And I believe I developed that due to my parents dynamic, when they never fully complimented me, always humbling me when I got too excited with my grades in school for example. I remember asking my mother if I was a beautiful girl, and she said “yes, you’re not the miss universe, but still.” That was the same as calling me ugly, it was invalidating and heartbreaking for me as a child. “Humiliating” myself first to gain supply is still safer than being humiliated by being humbled by people I see as inferior. But I do want to change it. I just want to have this equilibrium of being myself, bc this is not myself, it’s a defense mechanism, it’s a mask.. Imagine you feeling inherently better than everyone around you, only to have your ego crushed due of the most silly things ever (not enough praise or recognition or perceiving someone as slighter better at something than you) from the same vermin you said you hate. I still try to understand this dichotomy about my personality. How pathetic it is to require “supply” from people you just see as a cartoonish version of human beings, because you are not able to do it yourself. The passive aggressive approach, the mask of niceness around people, the “humble” facade we try to sell so much while rotting inside to the point of becoming violent and explosive. If I could be truly honest in therapy I’d just say that I wish I could evolve to a full blown psychopath, bc there’s no dichotomy in a psychopath, there’s no need to be recognized, to be praised and to have their whole identity and worth depend on others who don’t matter to begin with. They do not duel on how they are “bad” and “toxic” or feel pity of themselves bc they “can’t connect” with people. They just take and leave. And all of this dialogue started when my therapist asked me if I was willing to change and if I wanted to… And I do want to change, I do want to erase all my vulnerabilities and stop being a whiny b*tch. Whenever I read the traits of aspd or npd (pds that people acuse of being “evil”), I just think with myself “literally, everybody is like that, some more, some less”. Then I ask myself if the invention of those personality disorder classification is mostly just to help the people suffering themselves and use them as an example of “what not to be” in society, more than any other thing. I swear throughout my life I’ve encountered so many fucked up people, who are very far away of even having a PD, they are just humans and inherently evil and selfish. Sometimes I think aspd people just have less fear and are more impulsive than the average citizen when it’s about committing a crime, but the antisocial and selfish intention is still there inside every person, bc people suck. Literally everybody uses a mask, everybody lies to get ahead in life, are selfish and self serving, self centered and abusive and alcoholics and a-holes and manipulative and hostile and two faced and exploitative and think they have empathy (but it’s only work for their benefit). Those who aren’t this way are here just to suffer lol, that’s it. So why there is even a PD called aspd or npd?. I started therapy this month, and since the beginning I knew it would be online. But then, since the first session, my therapist never asked me how I’d prefer the sessions, if in video call or just a phone call. She chose to just call me (audio only) and it has been like this for the past three sessions, but this always bothered me, bc why would a psychologist not want to see their patient? This is kinda dehumanizing. There are so many non verbal clues that she’s missing, there’s no eye to eye contact, facial expressions, idk. Besides that she can be doing anything while pretending she’s listening to me, bc I can’t see her… Anyways, today I talked to her about it, and she said we could do video. But this doesn’t change the fact she didn’t ask me first and now I feel idiotic of having to ask for a therapist to have the decency of seeing her patient while in session. Anyways, gonna fire her.. “I gave up on golf a while ago, because I knew I would never be the best at it.” Meaning he would just practice a sport if he knows he will be exceptional at it.
    Everyone always makes mistakes, so many stupid mistakes. I don’t even know how they manage to go wrong in so many ways. How do you not know how to behave? How to talk? Why do I feel like I’m the only one who knows how to act and what to say? Why do they get to make mistakes and move on and I don’t? I’m so fvcking mad, I was doing so well but obviously people had to ruin everything. I dont know if you get what I’m saying, I don’t know if it’s NPD or I’m just unlucky with people. Please tell me how you deal with stupid disrespectful people. I try to ignore them but anger eats me alive.I have very strong opinions, I’m a communist that fights for the rights of everyone, starting from the most oppressed, but I feel like there’s another voice in my head that’s messing me up. For example: while I actively oppose the patriarchy I can’t help but think that men deserve their privileges because they’re stronger and less emotional. Even if I know that’s objectively false. It’s like I have this voice in my head telling me that power is all that matters. Weak people are inferior, I must become stronger and overcome them. My ideals are good but superiority is better. Being perfect means being a strong, powerful and intelligent man and if I’m not perfect then I’m nothing. I’m against any kind of supremacy but it’s what I crave. Sometimes I don’t want to fight for the poor, ugly, marginalized people. I want to demonstrate I’m not part of them.This sh1t is annoying. I read Lenin and Marx and I absolutely agree with them but then I see glorious dictators and wish I was one. Almost like a primal instinct. Am I alone in this? I think it can be the NPD instincts fighting with my “sane” ideals but I never heard such thing.. I just wanted to say that we’re great people in so many ways, even if we tend to forget that. We’re incredibly intelligent, perceptive, funny, passionate, creative, curious and so much more. We perceive the world in a different way than neurotypical people and that can be scary, but it also means we have so much more to offer to this world, to everyone around us. Our brain created this system to survive, because we do deserve to live, and I think that’s beautiful. We’re all so beautiful.. Every time I hang out with someone I get the worst headache, especially if I particularly dislike that person. I don’t suffer from anything that could explain this, I never get headaches, only when I have to interact with people. It drains all my energy and the only thing that helps is being alone for a while and sleep well. Could this be a thing? Does it happen to any of you?. I wonder if you also get this feeling of being an alien rather than a human.Sometimes it means being a creature with superior intelligence and abilities, most of the times it means being a monster, an ugly beast lurking in the shadows, full of envy and resentment.I feel so small, insignificant. But I also feel too great to be understood, even by myself.When I'm with people I feel like I must hold myself back, that I can only be free when I’m alone, but when I’m alone I constantly think of other people, and I loose myself thinking about them.I don’t even know if what I wrote is true or I made it up, I think I forgot how to be me, if I ever existed. Even my memories don’t make sense, they all feel blurry and distorted.I want to stop thinking, I want my old life back, when I was 16 and everyone admired me, I was the greatest and they all knew it. I can’t understand if they don’t see me or I don’t see myself anymore. I can’t understand where I end and they begin. Where am I from their judgement to my emptiness? Was I myself? Why can’t I feel myself anymore?Why do I feel so different from everyone else and my old self? Do you have any advice? Do you feel something similar? Am I forever doomed? Any thought is appreciated.IM NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS OR VALIDATION. I’m just looking for people to talk to, to know if there’s someone here who relates and how you deal with this. Pls mods have mercy.I really don’t know what causes my obsessive thoughts and how to stop them. They’re all about others perception of me, how I could’ve looked more intimidating, powerful, beautiful in a determined situation. For example: I might be calmly doing literally nothing and suddenly think about that one time my intonation sounded too weak and that’s why I got wrongly disrespected by my friends. Because every single joke feels like a failure on my end, I must do better and not let anyone think they have the right to joke about me.I also obsess over my aspect: cutting my hair, changing my style, always adjusting my clothes, feeling hyper vigilant if I feel something out of place, constantly making sure everything looks perfect. When I walk I always look at my shadow or look for mirrors to see if my hair is in place, like, the whole time.And I do this thing where I basically search the spelling of every word of both English and my first language every time I have to write it, even the most basic words that I obviously know like “house” or “bed”. I do it almost unconsciously to avoid any type of criticism or judgement. I don’t do it if I know nobody is gonna read it. When I get disrespected or wronged I obsess over it and cope by imagining revenge or trying to convince myself I did nothing wrong, repeating to myself how it’s people stupidity’s fault and not mine.I feel drained, like there’s a continuous war going on inside my head, two voices fighting each other. One tells me how great I am and that everyone else sucks. The other tells me I’m the one who sucks and should be ashamed of being alive. Im very tired. Any thoughts you share will be greatly appreciated.. It’s ruining everything. I can’t see someone without feeling envy for everything about them. I envy their privileged life, they have everything without deserving it, they didn’t even suffer, life has only been kind to them. They have the privilege to not care about anything yet everyone cares about them. And I hate myself for caring about them too. I shouldn’t give a fuck about what they have that I don’t but it’s just so frustrating seeing inferior people have what I should’ve had. I don’t care if considering them inferior is wrong, it’s a fact, they are. They’re objectively stupid and so superficial and I’m not. I wasn’t like this before, I had people around me that I could genuinely laugh with without caring about anything. But life also took that from me. I’m surrounded by people I hate and there’s literally no hope to find other ones. I live in a shitty city full of ignorant idiots. This envy is eating me alive, I can’t think of anything else, my brain just can’t let go of the hate and resentment. I’m only 18 and I should enjoy life and be stupid, why am I so different from others? Why do I feel like I’m the only one who understands? I should have what they have.. I love and hate of messy this place is. Every single post has some crazy ass saying “You’re not a narcissist!!” “Narcissistic abuse!!!!!” “Narcissists aren’t self aware!”Can we stop the bullshit please 😭😭 is this how it’s supposed to be? Like wth is wrong with you people? Calm tf down and get out if you’re so frustrated. I had a “psychologist” here saying I wasn’t a narcissist but then he got mad and called me one as an insult. WTH???? I love you all crazy people but please try to think before saying shit. I know I’m great, I’m perfect and flawless but others can’t see that because of my body. It’s objectively ugly and honestly I don’t think it’s mine at all. It’s not me, I have a solid image of what I look like and it doesn’t align with this body. I hate that others can be stupid and lack in everything just because they look good, they’re popular and loved because of their looks but it’s so evident they’re nothing. They’re empty.I try to be myself, the real me, but I can’t because people don’t see it. They see this weird guy acting as if he’s something he’s not. But I am, it’s just that they’re too stupid to see it because people only see your exterior, they’re too stupid to comprehend my inner beauty. It’s so frustrating and I have the constant feeling of wanting to get out, I want to rip my body open and come out as myself.It’s the reason I sh, I hate this thing that traps me and hides my perfection.I know I’m great, I’m perfect and flawless but others can’t see that because of my body.

I had many hamsters and often got the urge to hurt them out of morbid curiosity and desire to control, I used to throw them, squeeze them, lock them inside little toys and so on, until I suffocated one to death. Sorry for the graphic description. I remember crying but not for the hamster, I think I scared myself because I liked it more than I thought I would, it was almost arousing and I felt kind of disgusted by myself. I was 7 or 8.After that I calmed down a bit, until I got a bunny at 10yo and then a dog at 11. With both pets I had very strong urges but I forced myself not to hurt them, I did some stuff, nothing too bad, like holding them a bit more tightly or scaring them. With time these urges almost disappeared until now.I’m 18 and I still have the dog, I like her, it’s a very cute chihuahua but sometimes I have to physically get away from her, especially when she’s annoying, like barking or idk being a dog.I don’t want to sound edgy, I know this is very bad but I’m fascinated by pain, blood and violence. To satisfy this fascination I sometimes SH, it helps me regulate my emotions too but it’s not enough, I feel the need to redirect it to someone else. Sometimes when I feel disrespected I get very vivid thoughts of using violence towards the person and I have to pinch myself or focus on breathing to calm down. This fortunately happens rarely, only when I feel very very disrespected or heavily mocked.I’ve looked into ASPD because of this but other than these urges I was a great child, I followed every rule better than anyone else, I knew perfectly what to do and not do, I never got myself in trouble. Only two times I got in fights with other kids.I was always praised for my good behavior.So, wth is this?I don’t feel bad about it but it’s pretty stressful and I honestly feel crazy. I don’t think there’s the risk to actually do something to a person, the consequences would be irreversible. As for my childhood trauma: I’ve been physically and emotionally neglected for years by my mother while I was constantly shamed and mocked by my father that was sometimes violent when things didn’t go his way. What can I do to calm these urges? Do any of you got them? Can this be linked to NPD or am I just a jerk with a grandiose complex and a hypersensitivity to disrespect?

Any help is appreciated.NPI: 28OCD: 4Codependency: 5. How do I stop making shit up? I mean, after every interaction I have I can’t help but think obsessively about it and unconsciously convince myself that something really bad happened. Sorry this is hard to explain. For example: I hang out with a friend and everything’s fine, I come back home and start reviewing every detail of the hang out until I unconsciously start putting negative details like a side eye, an annoyed tone and so on… I could go on until I convince myself I literally fought that person even if it’s not true at all. It’s like my brain can’t comprehend a normal interaction and must make it bad, I need to find things I don’t like about someone just to hate them even if they didn’t do anything. I’ve been doing this for years and just recently realized, it’s tiring. It’s a constant battle with someone in my mind.Sometimes I think: “What if they said something negative about me? How would’ve I defended myself?” And then go on imagining it until I spiral and then realize it never happened.Is this part of NPD?. That’s basically it. How do I deal with rage when I get triggered? Disrespect is surely what sets me off the most, what can I do to calm down? Both in short term and long term would be helpful.I think I have NPD or at least NPD traits and I was reading posts on here and r/NPD and people all seem to hate or be uncomfortable with their disorder. Thats a bit weird to me.I basically am or “identify” in my inner self, the glorious one, I believe I’m fundamentally above other people, im much more intelligent and capable, I basically have it all and im my best friend. I love myself and myself is the inner one, of course. What I usually see is people “identifying” in their outer self, the “shell”, they believe they’re empty and that their inner self is just a fantasy.I can understand how this disorder can make you think that, I too have moments where I’m scared of being just an empty shell but I know that’s not the truth, and I know it because when I’m alone I always come out, when I’m with others I feel my inner self, I hide it but I know it’s there and it’s real, I hear it and see it and even tho these are not my best days he shines so bright and betters my life, Im talking as if he’s a third person but it’s not, I can “categorize” him but it’s me, the truer one.I almost feel like I have some kind of “reverse” NPD.NPI: 25Codependency: 4OCD: 5. 18M, not diagnosed.I recently began to notice a pattern in my thoughts, like a system that’s slowly growing with me and I think it might be NPD. I already suspect I have autism and I’m very self-aware, that’s why I’m not rlly sure. I have a lot of childhood trauma like emotional and physical neglect/abuse, being heavily criticized and shamed but also praised both at home and school, being bullied, and a major accident at 16 that changed my life. Now the thing is: I do believe that I’m superior to most people, I feel like everyone owes me, I do not engage with whom I deem inferior, I do lack empathy, I manipulate for my own gain, I’m capable of being friend with everyone but I end up hating them all, I’m emotionally unstable, really sensitive to criticism and often feel shamed, I have abnormal levels of rage and I can’t tolerate disrespect. What’s different from narcissists I’ve seen is the fact that I hide all of this, I do have grandiosity but I never show it, in fact, I act much less than I am, I prefer to act stupid sometimes, because at the end of the day I’m the only one who truly knows my real self and my real worth. I hate being perceived, both positively and negatively so I tend to hide or tone down my self esteem, that’s also because I know im ugly, my self esteem is only "internal" so I don’t even bother showing it to others, and they’re not worth it anyway. I live in order to protect my inner true self, I see it kinda like a diamond, it’s so special it can be ruined just by the eyes of unworthy people. This thing is slowly ruining my life and all my relationships, I can’t go to therapy or afford to be diagnosed so I don’t know what to do. I think I started to be like this at 14/15 and the accident at 16 worsened the situation.Atp I just wanna know if I’m the only one.NPI: 25Codependency: 4OCD: 5. I still don’t know if I’m schizoid or not but I always faked my feelings and reactions with other people, even close friends. When people are happy I act happy, when people are sad I act sad and so on. I know how I should behave and I do that but inside I’m thinking “when the hell can I go home”. And sometimes I like to hangout with a friend but just to talk about politics or sociology stuff bc I like that, when they start putting their feelings in the conversation I immediately feel annoyed but I hide it. Let me know your experiences!!. I’m kinda new to SPD, I’m 17 and it’s been a few years I thought about being autistic but a lot of my symptoms -emotional detachment -isolation -apathy -lack of romantic/sexual attraction Ecc. They overlap with SPD and I really don’t know anymore. I’m having doubts because I don’t think i have meltdowns or other autistic traits but idk. Help! Is someone else in my situation?! How can I differentiate the two without going to therapy? And I really don’t want therapy. I enjoy the way I am right now.
    Second post in a row but I’m confuuuused. My memory has turned to shit and I can’t focus on anything. My problem solving is 0 and I have to turn to others to tell me what to do. I’m clumsy and slam doors accidentally and knock things over. I’m just embarrassing myself everywhere. I was never like this and could solve things very easily before. Would you mind sharing your journey/experience with that?. I’m not sure what to do. I still have relationships with my family and my best friend and now I realize that the person they know is a fabrication. Now in conversations I just have nothing to say or contribute. I think of jokes or things to say and realize they’re so superficial and just basic things to say so I don’t. Because I don’t want to be fake. But then it’s just awkward and nobody knows what to do and I just make some excuse to leave or for them to leave. I look around my room at my decorations and realize I can’t identify with them anymore. And I used to be so proud of what they represented on behalf of me. I thought I was so cool and down to earth and relatable. I have a job I need to keep a front for. I’m losing my ability to actually focus on the job because this is all I can think about. I work directly with the public and coworkers and need to be able to at least communicate with them but I’m losing my vocabulary and everything. Forming sentences is like impossible I’m so fucking lost. How do you navigate this?. I know I need therapy. A lot of it. But I’m craving comfort and I know that should not be the reason for going. I feel too fragile to face anything right now and I’m afraid a therapist would (in my best interest) break me a little so I can start my recovery process. So I’m trying to motivate myself to just do it ✔️ lolWhat does therapy look like for you guys and how is it beneficial to you?. So I just moved back in with my dad. I’m 24F. My mom died in an accident when I was 5. I was raised by my dad and a network of his friends on top of some babysitters. So I’m aware he can’t have the full picture of how exactly I was brought up, but I’ve been asking him questions and trying to clarify some things so I can understand why I am the way I am. I keep getting answers of “you were so loved” and such. But I don’t know. I remember being a kid and having nightmares about my dad yelling and throwing things. I was terrified of him in that way. I haven’t brought this up to him because he’s being kind and supportive and I’m scared of what might happen if I confront him with these memories. My childhood friend has a memory of him holding a pillow over my face for a while… but he’s so hippie and chill now. Only smokes weed and plays guitar. Super Buddhist. I experienced some SA from a certain babysitter. Extreme emotional neglect from one I had right after my mother passed. Others were teenagers who gave me beer and took my sister and I to the cemetery to scare us. I have asked him about earlier stages in my life (first 1000 days) and he swears everything was normal. But then why do I have such a hard time connecting to people? Or maybe it’s just attachment trauma from my mom passing? But I developed grandiose thinking and pushed myself away from both my dad and sister claiming to be the “black sheep” that nobody understood. I was moody and snarky and antisocial. I was put in spec ed in elementary school for a speech impediment. Apparently when I was even younger nobody could understand me when I tried to talk. I’m wondering if maybe that points to autism? My grades were poor until my dad expressed disappointment and then I became an overachieving straight A student until graduation. This is such a ramble and I’m sorry. My brain is in huge denial of everything and I feel disconnected from myself and my past. I’m dissociating so hard that I’m losing frontal lobe functioning and forgetting words and grammar :/ so sorry if this all doesn’t fit together or make sense. Do you all have any advice? I want to sit down with my dad and get an honest recap of my childhood since I can’t remember much. But I’m afraid he will distort information in order to come off as a better parent. He wouldn’t let me invite friends over several times in the past if the house was messy and he never attended school functions because he was scared the other parents would judge him. Also criticized my outfit choices and how they would reflect on him as a parent. He’s pushing to get me in therapy while I’m still on his insurance. Maybe it’s my black and white thinking but I’m just so confused on how to approach anything with him… is he partly to blame or was it just major misfortune and bad luck that led to this?. It feels like you all have personalities. Souls. Selves. When I read your posts and comments, I can see your humor and intelligence and that you all have different opinions on things. Enjoy different things. Experience different things. I see a soul in pretty much all of you. I know we all feel robotic, and at the moment I feel more robotic than ever. (I tend to be pretty witty and funny when I text but that’s all disappearing for me apparently)But I know it’s there in me. And I see it in all of you, too. There is potential in all of us. There are genuine things behind us. I’m not sure if it’s just masking but *some* part of you guys come up with these things, and that’s something. I just wanted to say that. I could write an essay on my complex feelings about death reaching back into my childhood and I did, lol, and deleted it. As much as I’d love to write a autobiography for supply, I’ll resistI guess I’m just wondering how everyone deals with the possibility of punishment after dying?. Do you feel any kind of happiness, gratefulness, appreciation, anything like that? Connection to people?. And if it’s mirroring and manipulation and cleverness that gets me there, what’s the problem? I feel good and they feel good. I’m not malignant. I don’t enjoy making anyone feel bad. If I even get a whiff that I may have said something insensitive I immediately backtrack and try to fix the situation. I don’t know, man. I’m definitely deluded right now and I guess hoping for someone to bring me back to earth. Or validate if this is okay. If I could just go back to being the funny and kind girl I was, would there be something wrong with that? Fake me is me and everyone around me at their happiest. Even if I’m a bit self centered and doing it for my own life satisfaction. Fuuuck. I’m curious what yalls dreams are like. Mine, since childhood, have always had almost nothing to do with my real life or the people in it. They’re usually something out of a fiction novel. I used to have repetitive dreams as a kid about being an undercover spy. I almost thought it was true. Or I had several about being a fairy or a mermaid. I’m not sure if that’s normal or not. Mine now are always based around relationships or friendships. Mainly just people liking me and wanting to be around me. I always banter with these people and just feel wanted and needed, and like we’re all having a good time. How about yours?. And it was amazing. I wish I could go back. I was singing in the shower and feeling pretty and now I’m back to wait who am I? Fuck. If I can be grandiose and follow moral rules I’d be set. But now that I collapsed I can’t stay there, even though I have (maybe fake) confidence I could do it without hurting others. I remember when I was very young I cried at a scene in a movie because they were separating an orphaned brother and sister. I hope this means that I have empathy in there somewhere, I just need to access it again. Every time I try, though, I feel obligated to solve everyone’s problems. Especially with all the fucked up shit going on in the world, I’m not sure I can take on empathy at the moment. I wish I could start small but even just my partner having a rough day at work triggers me and I almost get defensive for the OTHER people who made his day awful. I just had a call with my sister who met this amazing guy who is super into her and I was just envious and mad that I’ll never be able to have that. Some part of me doesn’t even understand empathy. Like, how am I supposed to feel your feelings without inheriting them as my own? Idk I also don’t CARE. Like I just want everything to be playful banter and fun ): I can’t take these emotions idk what to do with them besides say sorry. Or be jealous if it’s positive emotion. I get resentful. Ugh. wtf even is this life?. I know the facts of my life but I don’t have memories attached to them necessarily. I used to I think. Idk now when I think of my memories I get super uncomfortable and my mind puts a shit ton of space between them and me I can’t go deeper than like a picture of the memory. I can’t think straight right now, my mind goes blank literally every two seconds, I feel on the verge of a panic attack but I keep dissociating constantly to stay out of it cause I have a shit ton of stress that’s very time sensitive and I cannot lose function. It feels like losing my train of thought every two seconds. I’m so scared I won’t be able to ever connect with ANYTHING. My dear cat who I’ve had since I was 6 has been missing, presumed dead, for seven months and I can’t bring myself to think about her. Or remember her. And when I do I don’t get that emotional. What’s wrong with me? Is this ASPD not NPD? Ik you guys can’t answer thatOkay I have to go cause my brain in not cooperating. Edit- this became more of a relationship post lol. So if any of you have partners I would greatly appreciate a read and advice if you have anyI’m still collapsing further and further, and I’m not very eloquent at the moment so I’m sorry if any of this doesn’t make much senseBut if we don’t have a self, wtf can we do? Just live as nothingness? I have a partner who I am losing soon because I think he’ll be better off without me. Honestly. Even though he’s cared for me like no one in this world. (Rambling oops, anyways) But the last month or so since learning about NPD it feels like I’ve noticed that everything I did and said was tailored to his tastes. Like I noticed I adopted his personality. And so I caught myself doing this and now stop myself. And we have literally ONLY had small talk. And hours and hours of not talking, just on our phones or something. I can’t think of anything to talk about and when we watch shows I can’t pay attention or form any kinds of opinions on what’s happening. I can’t relate it to anywhere and therefore have no “ground” to stand on. If I’m really nothing, I have nothing to offer. I used to entertain and have so much fun with my partner. I guess what I’m trying to say instead of going on side quests, is can’t I just stay who I was for him? Is there harm in that? If I can stay away from the manipulation part of things, is it okay? And what if all of this masking is actually just manipulation to get him to love me? God I hate this so much. It’s fucking torture. lol I’m convinced I was a narc since birth. As a kid I went to school with a princess crown and dress every day. I refused to wear anything else. I cheated at every board game. I would get so mad if I lost at anything and would go days without talking to the person who beat me. I loved going to get shots because I wouldn’t cry and it made me feel superior. I gave up on skills if I wasn’t immediately good at it and would hate anyone who could do it. I stole quite a bit from people at school and also grocery storesI’m curious if anyone remembers what they were like as kids?. I’m considering getting another kitty after mine went missing 6 months ago ): I had her since I was 6 and she was my world, and my NPD is getting in the way of grieving. It’s like she was never there. But she helped me so much. I don’t want to betray her by getting another cat, but I need some support. Have animals helped you while going through a tough collapse?. This song from Arcane reminds me so much of my NPD 🥺😭 Wasn’t sure how to flair this but I wanted to share it if yall haven’t heard it yet and see if anyone relates. It takes me like 3x longer than usual to do something. I have to think every tiny motion and action through. Things that should be so automatic. I forgot my grammar and speech and everything. I feel mentally disabled. I can’t function at ALL. Is this normal?. Even if I had friends I wouldn’t ever be able to connect with them. I can’t connect with my family. How does ANYONE accept this?. I just went to dinner with my best friend from elementary school and she mentioned something about being so scared of my dad every time she came over. I was like ? Because I have memories of him yelling and I remember having nightmares of just him screaming at me. But I asked her what she remembered bc I’ve always had that feeling but my dad is so chilled out now and very distant but caring? And she told me one memory she had of me and her playing with my sister. We always wanted to hang out w eachother and my sister always annoyed us w wanting our attention. (She’s my little sister. And I feel a bit bad about this now, but remember she also tended to overreact) and my friend put a pillow over her face. My sister stormed off crying to my dad and he apparently came running towards me and pinned me down and put a pillow over my face thinking I’d done it. She remembers me yelling and telling him it wasn’t me ): idk how to process this and how much deeper it could possibly go. So, my birthday is 06/06/2000. I remember my dad joking about me being the devil secretly. And I loved that shit. I was like “hell yea 666, rebel!” My friends at school even started calling me Satan, not in a mean way I don’t think. It was more of a joke. Well, my first ever two tax returns were BOTH EXACTLY 666$ back. Now that I’m coming to awareness I realize I see it everywhere. Idk if this sounds super woo woo or not but I swear it’s just uncanny. And the angel number 666 literally means “you gotta stop and evaluate your life. You’re focusing too much on the superficial and materialistic things.” Idk it’s just odd to me and I was wondering if you guys notice that number?. I’m right on the cusp of falling into one, I’m in it like 10% and fighting my ass off to not let it keep going. I’m on probation because I got a DUI ): can’t even drink to help. I’m so scared. I’m not strong enough to tolerate that much pain and I’m also living with my partner, we’re separating at the end of our lease, though. I don’t want to go through it with him here because I’ll probably coerce him into comforting me. He fell in love with my false self.It’s absolutely unbearable. I feel like I’m dying. Hi all! Im recently suspecting NPD, I’m pretty convinced. I know yall can’t diagnose me. I’m feeling intense fear for going through the process of collapse. I’m trying to ignore it so much before I go actually insane. I’m scared that if I give into the fear and shame and guilt, my mind literally won’t be able to handle it. I can’t take that much pain at once. I can’t believe we’re all going through this. After you collapse, everything else collapses. I want to badly to be held by a mother while it goes down. How is anyone supposed to heal from this, especially this late?. As soon as I got out of high school, I got horrible anxiety and dread seemingly out of nowhere. My whole identity and personality collapsed. I couldn’t hang out with friends or family because I would be so nervous the entire time. When I went to therapy my main complaint was that I wasn’t who I used to be. I used to be confident and funny, people liked being around me. Started meds and felt immensely better. I’m still trying to find out if I have NPD. It scared me a lot. I do seek validation and attention from people, but everyone in my life believes me to be a good person. I’m overthinking everything though and would just like to know if that was a collapse without self awareness.. I started Zoloft 100mg (directly after trying Effexor) four days ago and oh my for the anxiety is unbearable. I’ve also come to strongly suspect myself of NPD, or maybe I’m just a huge piece of shit. I don’t remember much of my childhood. I know my mother passed when I was 5 and her and my dad were off and on when she was alive. I know I experienced some CSA but on me to another child by manipulation from a babysitter. I know I started writing stories about characters getting madly bullied in 1st grade and imagined they were me. It gave me pleasure. I fantasized about being bullied. I know I had frequent nightmares/ sleep paralysis/ straight fear of dying or someone else dying. It would keep me up. My dad worked nights, though and I usually tried finding comfort in a babysitter who was actually just a guy my dad knew who smoked cigarettes in the house and never really interacted that much with us. I remember I’d go to the living room and he’d be watching tv and would tell me “just go to sleep” and I would stay and watch tv trying to calm myself down until forcing myself back into mine and my sisters room. It eventually developed where I’d have to sleep in my sisters bed with her because I genuinely was so scared. She ended up telling my friends it was super embarrassing. Anyways, this is definitely not the sub for this I can’t believe I just ranted about all that. I’ve just been freaking out more than usual and would like some comfort in knowing it’s partly due to the meds and not my realization that I’ve been emotionally detached from everyone and everything forever and hurt people in the process (:. Or I’m at the very least a narcissist. Or have certainly behaved and thought like one to a pretty high extent. When it all dawned on me and I became self aware of it, I felt scared. Terrified. I always thought I was a good person, but I was acting selfishly. I feel like I need to isolate myself from the entire world. I’m selfish and self absorbed. I don’t actually care about people. I don’t want to be lonely. I do love having friends and being around people. I know I could probably change with work, I do have empathy I just choose not to feel it and try to give help in a way that’s less painful for me. I don’t know. I don’t know what to do. Therapy is on the list. I feel tempted to just going back to my old ways because I felt happy and comfortable. Nervous af. Give me some success stories!. I just started meditating again after a few years off because I’ve become sort of numb. I can’t even transcribe my thoughts anymore it’s just gibberish at this point. Now that I’m meditating again (breath focused mindfulness) it’s like I can focus on my breath and be “thinking” at the same time. I’m not sure how to approach this since I remember last time I was consumed in thoughts and had to return back to my breath. It was great and took some effort like building a muscle in my brain. I’m not getting that this time… I’m focused on my breath and the gibberish in my head is playing 24/7 anyways. I can’t make it stop, it’s as though I’ve become so good at running on autopilot the past few years I can get things done but my main priority is still my head. Any tips please?Edit: I think labeling might come in handy for this? I’m trying to start over on my HeadSpace app and it said to make sure I feel confident and comfortable with this basics before moving on. If you’re gonna judge me or say negative things, just leave. I’m asking for advice. Please. I’m fully ready to face my consequences just looking for people with experience as this is my first offense. So, Friday-Saturday I drank pretty heavily. Probably 15 drinks total. No drinking Sunday. Monday morning had 10 ish drinks learning I didn’t need to test. I bought those larger shooters assuming they were about a shot and a half each (I KNOW IM STUPID) later found out they’re pretty much three each. Had to test Tuesday. I waited as long as I could and had about 43 hrs since my last drink. It’s always sent to a lab. I’ve spoken to my PO and she has witnessed how much trouble I have peeing in front of someone. I’ve joked several times about how I’d need to drink an absurd amount of water next time. Well… figured my best chance was diluting the fuck out of it and using it as an excuse and being extra cautious/ stop drinking at all in the future. Figure she might let me off for that. Soooo after learning I had to test at 2am Tuesday I drank sooooo much water. At least like 150ml. I probably had 50-60ml within an hour of the test. What are the chances I diluted enough to “pass” this shit? Thanks in advance for all the supportive people and fuck off for the judgement (: Edit: this would be my first violation ever if she decides to push it. What can I expect from that? I’m prepared to restart my sentence and face jail time. She seems chill and never even knows my UA scores till I get there. She has to pull them up and check them. She scheduled our next check in three months out because I’m “so compliant”. Edit: I needed to add that I took like 10 500nl etg test strips leading up to the test while hydrating and they all came out negative. Not a super faint line either, like pretty visible and obvious. I know these aren’t super accurate and labs have a bunch of specialized equipment for that stuff. But i would much rather have a dilute I could explain and excuse than a fail. I don’t want to unnecessarily snitch on myself, ya know?Edit: lab cutoff is 500nlEdit: I’m 24, 132 lbs, 5’8, female. If you’re gonna judge me or say negative things, just leave.

There was this guy with a few YouTube videos about TM and meditation in general. He mainly touched on anxiety. I remember a specific video of him on the grass with water and a city in the background doing an interview with his co workers about meditating. He’s the reason I got into TM. He also had lots of videos of him on stage with large pieces of paper explaining the ins and outs of anxiety. His name was Ken or something. I’ve been searching forever and can’t find a single trace of him. I know he’s a business man of some kind. Does anyone else know this dude?. I was on Zoloft like five years ago and it wass absolutely amazing. After stupidly going cold turkey I got back on maybe a year later and it didn’t do shit even at a higher dose than I previously had. But I can’t stop thinking about how well it worked for me that one time and considering trying it out again. I’m currently on Lexapro and it’s not helping. Has anyone experienced this? Is it possible it will work again if it’s been so long?(Also I was on Zoloft that second time that it didn’t work for like seven months with still no effect). So… I feel horrible, hopeless. I used to be so fun. I used to have friends and I loved them more than anything, just making them laugh was all I needed. It made me so happy to make people happy. And I’ve abandoned everyone. Everyone. I’m not me anymore. I can’t bear it. I’m only 23 and I’ve been going through this since I was 18 after graduating. It started off as being so fucking fearful always. I wasn’t thinking MY thoughts anymore. I don’t even have opinions anymore. I don’t even care. And it makes me so SAD like not even sad I mean like sobbing into my pillow wishing I was never even born because wtf happened to me. What’s wrong with me?? I was so hopeful and happy. I wanted to dance on the beach and bathe in waterfalls and laugh and laugh and laugh with all my friends and meet new people and discover all the beautiful things about them. And just love. I just wanted to love, it’s the moser beautiful thing that exists. And I can’t even feel it anymore. I can’t think. I’m having 1000000 thoughts at the same time it’s like I’m not even thinking. I can barely read or pay attention to anything I have to watch memes 10 times before I can even react in any way. I miss finding things funny. I miss making jokes and being witty and loving and a reliable friend. I’ve lost the life I worked hard for. I loved so hard. I did everything for everyone because I just loved that. Now I’m mad all the fucking time at everyone for stupid fucking reasons. I can barely form coherent sentences unless I’m typing which also takes forever, cause I’m so overwhelmed with thoughts that I can’t even make out cause there’s too many. I feel so dumb. Nobody wants to be my friend and when they do I’m too scared of how I am. I don’t even know what I’m scared of. That’s I’m not enough? I’ll eventually selfishly abandon them because of my stupid fucking self and feelings that I don’t even know what they are? I don’t want to die but I can’t deal with the grief of that life I could have had. I was so free spirited and spontaneous and adventurous. It would have been so amazing. I’ll stop ranting I’m sorry, I have my family to talk to but they’re so god damn positive and “well you can be happy with this life too and just find something you enjoy” but NO no no no no no I can’t. I can’t stand knowing what could have been and just accept this. Anyways I’m on 10mg of Lexapro from my regular doctor at the clinic I think y’all call them GPs. And it’s been about five and a half weeks and nothing has changed. I was on Zoloft a couple years ago and it was amazing but I stupidly went off cause I never wanted to believe that I’m broken. And then I tried again for five months and it stopped working. I also drink now, it started like a year ago, I drink almost all day every day. I’ve only gone three days without it. Sometimes it allows me to socialize and kind of be me again but never 100%. I got myself addicted. I know lex doesn’t work as week with it but I just can’t without it. I think I might kill myself without that crutch. I’m so damn lonely. I have nobody. I wish I was happy and my family didn’t have to be disappointed or trying to help me in their own way. I wish my dad didn’t have to worry about me. I love him so much. He doesn’t deserve a daughter that’s always sad and scared. My mom died when I was young and he gave up EVERYTHING for me and my sister. I just want to be me again. God so bad. Idk some encouragement would be nice. I’ve been on this sub since my day one trying to be hopeful. Idk you guys all love each other but I never felt a a part of the community but I’m posting this anyways. You don’t have to help me and there’s no reason you should but I had to let this out Thank you SO MUCH to anyone that bothered to read. I truly don’t feel worth it. But if you made it to the end of this post you must be pretty amazing and I hope the best of the everything for you cause you deserve it ❤️.
    My first collapse and coming to self-awareness about my narcissism was caused when a couple's counselor told my partner that I was abusive and she should leave the relationship. I was never physically violent, but the emotional abuse was so bad that the counselor offered to help my partner make a safety plan.I collapsed and almost didnt survive that (su*c*de hotline was my speed dial). But I've been in intensive therapy ever since to get better and stop being abusive toward my partner. I thought it was going well. I have not screamed at my partner or engaged in gaslighting since. However, since my defenses and grandiosity collapsed, I have been experiencing terrifying mood swings and emotional dysregulation in which I'll cycle from weeping, to angry, to hyper, to rage, to weeping again in a matter of hours every day. I am doing the best I can to control how I am around my partner with therapy, meds, yoga, meditation, etc. There is a lot I keep inside, but obviously I'm not easy to be around every day.Well, my therapist called me out and said that my emotional volatility is creating a coercive environment for my partner. That around my extreme emotional display, she is not safe to express her own emotions and needs.I was so shocked to hear this. My shame transformed into rage instantly, and I hung up on my therapist. I went into rage, then a toxic shame spiral once I realized that she was right. I'm still spiraling.I thought I was on the right track in therapy and becoming a healthy partner. But here I am once again: being coercive and perpetuating a cycle or abuse. The worst part is that it was outside of my awareness that my actions are still coercive. It is still very difficult for me to understand that I am manipulating my partner when it is not my intention to do so. That I still have such a stunning lack of self-awareness after all the work I've done.Now i'm collapsing again. I have more authentic self now so it is not as severe. But I am uhhhh not doing well. I feel like I'm totally worthless and irredeemable. I'll never recover and everyone would be better off if I just ceased to exist.Could use some encouragement and support.. I'm realizing that I probably contributed to the same stigmatization that stopped me from getting treatment for so long. I used to visit r/raisedbynarcissists quite frequently at one point because I was enraged by my GF's mother's narcissistic treatment of her. Pretty ironic, given that her narcissistic early care environment is probably what attracted me to her (and vice versa).I did recognize some narcissistic traits described in those forums in myself. But it was also there that I encountered the idiotic notion that "if you think you're a narcissist, you aren't one." I was pretty eager to believe that lol so I didn't take my early recognition of myself seriously again until I collapsed like 5 years later. This is one of the reasons why stigma against pwNPD is such a problem: our shame and lack of self-awareness ALREADY makes us treatment-resistant. When encountering shaming content online, our unconscious will use every denial available to disavow the recognition that it describes us.Anyone else have a similar experience with learning about narcissism online?. I'd love some advice and support from folks who are further along in their healing journey. I had my first serious collapse in November and became aware that I am a narcissist. I've been taking my recovery very seriously and have completed more than 20 sessions of therapy since. I was initially very inspired and grounded by the healing process, just so grateful to finally understand myself and looking forward to a life where I can experience actual human connection and have emotional empathy.But as it turns out, the healing process is so difficult, painful, and all-consuming that I can now barely cope with ordinary life demands. How am I supposed to heal the literal screaming abandoned infant inside of me while holding down a corporate job, genuinely connecting with friends for the first time, and healing a marriage in which I was abusive without even knowing it?!Now I am just an ordinary, average person who is an anxious and depressed mess. I miss the grandiosity so much, feeling like I was always right, and the smartest, best, most beautiful person in any room I entered. I know all of that wasn't real and I inflicted so much harm in that state, but life has become so difficult to manage now. My friends support me and witness me, but being seen in this vulnerable state is excruciating. I am terrified that they will abandon me once they get sick of the new, pathetic me instead of their cool, larger-than-life friend from before.I still project and split and entitlement rage, but now I just have to be aware of it and sit with impossibly big feelings. Self-awareness means I still have all the pain, without any of the benefits of grandiosity.Is this all worth it? Please remind me that it is. I feel like I actually need to admit myself to hospital because I just don't know if I can do this and stay alive.
    Idk hi girlies and friends but ya I’ve been taking a break from the sub. I kinda felt this was necessary since last year, when that feeling began to creep in of “I gotta leave this sub”. Just giving an update for anyone who cares 😳 I am in fact still alive and not doing too great.Tbh I don’t notice I’m missing the sub that much, idk maybe it’s cuz I’m on my phone all day anyway but I feel like I kinda need to get my life in order and come back on here when I’m more regulated again. Idk. I also feel like the advice I get here isn’t so useful to me anymore (I feel bad to say this and maybe I’m ashamed, I don’t wanna devalue y’all cuz everyone here is just human and on their own journey), so I’m normally on r/CPTSD_NSCommunity (I rlly recommend that sub and also r/CPTSDNextSteps, for people who are on the healing line). I do have some nostalgia come up writing this post rn tho, and actually I do kind of miss it 🥹I mean I dunno. Maybe I’ll start posting again tomorrow or something and this has all been a hoax, who knows 🤣I feel tho that I’ve kinda gotten into the role of “healing educator” on here or something or maybe I don’t, idk, and I feel resentment about this role and I don’t wanna be in it anymore. Maybe I just wanna get dysregulated and vent in peace and get validation or something sometimes, I have no clue. Anyway I kind of don’t know which direction my life will go into rn, I gotta find a job and make some money or something and see what I want in life and hopefully not die. Oh also my fucking therapist forced me into a one year therapy break, tho I won’t go into details rn, so yeah that’s great 😑 I feel dissociated a lot most days rn and while the space here can be healing, it can also be very daunting and exhausting and triggering cuz we all have the potential to trigger each other in the biggest ways given the nature of this sub, but yeah, idk. I feel shame right now. I don’t want to be so ashamed anymore.Anyway girls boys and lads, I wish y’all peace and love, genuinely. Title, I’ve made rice noodles with some vegetables, spices and beef, and I made a sauce that consisted of soy sauce, oyster sauce and white wine vinegar (surprisingly good combination), and I put in too much soy sauce cuz I forgot that oyster sauce also contains salt.And yeah idk I’m making some more plain rice noodles rn that Imma add in and hope this will fix the issue. I don’t wanna throw away the food I paid money for this 🥹😅Is there anything else I can do? I also wanna add some more chili oil in the end and hope the beef (I cooked that separately with a similar sauce) isn’t too salted either but it tastes fine plain Edit: alright it’s over I already did it guys and it was good, you can stop commenting now and thx for the tips 🫣. So uh Idk if I’ve really been addicted cuz I dislike calling myself an addict. But over the past two months since January, I’ve used kratom or ODSMT on and off, once every couple of days. I ran out of ODSMT now and I’m gonna try and stay clean from that for a bit, also cuz I’m kind of broke now :/ So today is day 4 and yesterday and today I’m craving shit badly. I also detox from other things now, like an “addiction” of going to a restaurant/cafe every day or using my phone so much to escape from my feelings or whatever And yeah it’s tough. Idk why I can’t just stay on opis without getting physically addicted I hate this lol I feel sluggish and have no energy. My brain feels like it’s a dry fucking field of earth that is dehydrated and where nothing can bloom on. Idk how much of this comes from the other stuff I’m detoxing from, and how much comes from the (lack of) drugs. Is this gonna last forever? Cuz honestly rn addiction seems like it isn’t that bad and not using feels pointless 😑 when does it get better? When do I get to be more present with myself and my feelings and more in my body again 🥲 does anybody have any spare hope to give? Lol Also I have CPTSD and other stuff and I’m not in therapy rn cuz I have to take a mandatory therapy break, embarrassing. Idk. I’m tryna wing this all on my own but on the other hand I also want help?. Also seeing anything that has positive mental health sht in it lately makes me annoyed at best and mad and raging at worst idfk man I want to punch in a mirror or smth. I hate being sober, it sucks, detoxing from several things at once like drugs, restaurant addiction/buying food, and going on these e roller things. This sucksss lol how is this supposed to improve my life it’s day 4 today and I cheated yesterday ahhh. I hate being sober I want to fucking Kms except nah I don’t. I just wanna vent cuz fuck being sober, I hate it I hate it I hate it lol it sucks i don’t wanna be sober ugghhh why can’t I just fucking use opiates and not get physically addicted lmao fml. And yeah idk. I’m in a shit situation rn, I have no money, no job and might have to move at the end of the month. I’m a Uni student and recently had to pay a lot of money for things. I have a habit of spending so my money situation is bad rn. I asked my mom to send me additional money and she just said no and “you’ll have to see on your own how you can finance and sustain yourself”. I feel frozen right now. I have an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach and my arms. I feel like if I sit down with my feelings I can’t cuz then everything would come out and that’s too much. Idk how to save money cuz I didn’t fucking learn it. I feel not able to get a job. I don’t know if I wanna keep being in Uni or quit. I told all this to a friend of mine yesterday and I said I just wanna run away and hide and dissociate and not deal with any of this. He asked me “Well but do you have anywhere to run to? Where do you want to hide?” and I said “No, I guess I don’t have anywhere…” and it reminded me that it’s MY LIFE and I literally can’t hide from my own life. I guess it also scared me. I feel scared.My dissociative barriers seem so high at the moment, idk. I don’t know what to do. The situation requires grave awareness but yeah. I don’t know. I feel fear I think Also im not in therapy rn, I was forced into a therapy break for one year a few weeks ago. I’m having a terrible experience rn I was in the tram and nodding off for the first time and I was just annoyed by it, being unable to keep my eyes open. Idek why I’m nodding off, I took my standard dose and I’ve never nodded from that before (50 mg ODSMT pellet). Me: Why is my head itching? \*scratches head\*Also me: *took an opiate like half an hour ago* Idk lol this just happened today. I forgot I took smth then wondered abt the itching… Also is that what you call a “functional junkie”? Someone who somehow manages life and their feelings better when I’m on them. I take ODSMT and Kratom (not together) every couple of days since January and why the hell does it feel like I can be more present with myself and my feelings when I’m on them I’m ashamed of my use tho, idk I have a ton of mental health issues and my life is kinda falling apart rn and I had to leave therapy and yeah I’m not coping well. I wanted to make a meme with this post but everything is just kinda depressing rn Sry if this sounds weird I’m high rn and also I think I’m having an emotional flashback (CPTSD related). Ok maybe this is weird but idk. I once read (on here?) that Covid can “activate” cancer cells or something like that (or stimulate their growth)? I had Covid in November last year and was mostly bed bound for 2 months. I “recovered” (not so much) in early January and ever since, try to do real life again.But since this infection, I still have these symptoms:- chronic dry cough - cough hurts in the chest sometimes, stabbing or “tightening” pain - sometimes coughing fits - tickly/ sore throat - I feel like I’m getting sick every single day - fatigue - headaches - my nose feeling like it’s stuffed and I’m about to have a cold- swollen, sometimes painful lymph nodes in the neck/throat (sometimes one side is larger than the other)- I start to sweat a lot when I rest (that worries me *a lot*)- yellow mucus/phlegm coming out of lungs/mouth - hoarse voice but not always I am terrified that this could be cancer in any way. I’m not sure why, I’m just scared and worry abt it every day. I have an appointment for a radiologist to scan my thorax, like tomorrow. The sweats and cough and fatigue make me feel very weird and I’m sick of being constantly sick-ish. I dunno, my GP said it’s psychosomatic 😑 This made me really pissed cuz I changed to her last year and initially I liked her, I have a plethora of mental health issues (CPTSD, …) and she recognized this and my illness anxiety and did a good job debunking the fears I had. But I feel betrayed since this last appointment I had with her, and upset. She diagnosed me with Long Covid and sent me to a “long Covid clinic” we have here, but they just treat psychosomatic symptoms. I haven’t gone there yet. I have mild asthma and my pulmonologist send me to get x-rays done. I dunno man I want to have some insight I guess. This sh*t is stressing me out and yeah Edit: I don’t have a therapist atm, I had until recently. I just have my doctor(s) for now. Idk. I don’t live in the US so LDN here isn’t an option. I learned to rest when I was bedbound, didn’t know how to do it before but I told myself I’d rest more than ever if I get back into real life which I’m not really doing, cuz there’s a lot up my plate rn. Idk also if I have PEM or ME/CFS, I had PEM symptoms while bedbound but it wasn’t confirmed by a doctor or anything. I am not ok I don’t know what to do I just feel fucking helpless everything is terrible I’m scared of dying and having cancer I’m scared I will fucking get cancer diagnosed cuz I’m wreaking havoc on my health cuz I’m not sitting down with my feelings enough idfk where tf I have this “I am being punished” mindset from but it is here I have literally no clue what the fuck I’m supposed to do i feel like my fucking life is over and I’m gonna end up on the streets and die. I am scared. I am just fucking scared. I had to pay so much fucki money and now I don’t even have any goddamn money. I don’t know what to do I’m Going to fail this stupid exam and I can’t study for it and I don’t know what is supposed to happen or going on I am scared. Yes everyone hey it’s me your local Narc healing connoisseur. Lmao. You know what? FUCK HEALING. I’m done with it. This shit is fucking crap and it sucks. I’m sick of this role and I’m sick of everything 💀I’m putting too much pressure on myself and I am DONE. It’s over and I’m out. I don’t want to anymore. I want attention rn and I’m demanding it and I’ll be your local borderline evil narc asshole. I don’t care. Ahhhhh attention seeking typa post Fuck this shit and I’m giving a big fat 🖕🏻 to healing I don’t know man. It’s nice to take the pressure off and just be like “yeah I’m allowing myself everything now, no forcing myself to sit down with my dumb feelings, no forcing myself to stop dissociating”. Just let me fucking be for fucks sake Ironically tho I feel more compassionate for myself now cuz FUCK YES, the shit I’m going through right now does suck. Yeah idk title I guess. Atm I have two states, I’m either numb and dissociated and frustrated that I’m not living my life in the way I want, but *terrified* to sit down and feel myself and stop dissociating. Or I actually put in the hard work to sit down with myself, put on a timer, and just feel. (A timer to contain my emotions, but it’s not strict.) It feels so good and I don’t always know what I feel, but to get some of it out just makes me feel better.How do I get out of the slouch? Like rn where I should be studying but I know I have to feel myself first. Instead I can’t get away from my phone or YT videos. I’m a Uni student and I’m struggling. I have a lot of trauma and the dissociation makes sense. But I’m looking for a self-compassionate way to get myself back into feeling when I’m in states like these.Also, no I’m not in therapy rn, I was until recently tho. I’ve made decent progress with trauma work in the last year and for the first time, really began to feel myself. I’ve come up with some compassion or mindfulness exercises that worked good for a while but rn I’m at a loss again. When I am this way, an important thing for me seems to slow down. Which I can just do by forcing myself usually (which is what I have learned to do, to force myself - I haven’t learned many other ways yet, but I’m getting there slowly). But I want to offer myself more compassion. Hey all, Ive been a lurker for a bit now 😀 I got my septum done a month ago and it’s also my first (kinda) piercing. I’m happy with it! But I began to follow the piercing sub and then this sub in the meanwhile and fell in love with the sight of stretched septums. (In an ideal future, I’d like to go up to 4g at some point 🫣 had my septum done at 14g!)So, I have the questions: 1. Do I Start out myself as a beginner? I feel intimidated by stretching tbh. Or do I go to a studio?2. I got my jewelry switched out today from a keeper to a barbell. I asked the piercer a bit Abt stretching and she told me she does it in .5mm sizes and she also said she would wait 2-3 months between stretches?? (Vs i saw on the internet to wait Minimum 6 months. What is correct? 3. Is stretching yourself easy or hard to do? How does one go abt it?4. I still have to let my septum heal fully first for stretching, right? The piercer said if I wanted to, she could stretch today already but I’m just a month in and I thought this sounds a bit sketchy…. I’m typing this while I cry. I can’t rlly believe this all happened to me. I had a flashback to how I felt when I was small - I was convinced I’m going to be kicked out of the house, abandoned or other stuff I don’t remember. I felt like I’m dying regularly as a kid. I don’t know. I feel sad. I’m grieving right now. I really can’t much believe my parents made me feel like this but it happened. Man, this sucks. I feel like I’m gonna die as an adult now too. I think maybe I keep recreating these situations in my life so I end up feeling this way - cuz this feeling wants out of my subconsciousness I also feel like I’m sick. I don’t know why yet. Being sick and feeling like I’m dying somehow connect and I have hypocondria too and this stuff is connected but idk I’d beat myself up about this but I just want to cry. I can’t comprehend how horrific all this shi was. Man. I feel like my heart is sinking to my stomach and further beyond this.. Yeah uh kind of title. Idk. I didn’t consider myself an addict or a junkie before but now I think I’ve become mentally addicted. I was Sick a while ago and began to use kratom regularly for some days. Then a few days off. Then one day on again. Few days off. Etc I also began to use this RC opioid ODSMT. I guess this sealed my addiction 💀Idk. Dunno where I’d wanna go with this post and I feel self-conscious about it. I don’t use every day (I don’t wanna get physically addicted and go through WD’s tho I guess we all know this might fly out the window at some point?) but I use every 3-5 business days. I’m running out of ODSMT after 1 tablet and I asked myself “if I could order unlimited opiates for the rest of my life, would I be happy or want this?” and the answer, to my surprise, is “No”, cuz I’m filling a hole with them and I actually want love and connection, and not opiates.Idk. I don’t wanna go to a 12 step group tho cuz I’d have to make being an addict my personality trait? Which I like, don’t want? I have the impression that I’d have to do this (I heard it/read abt it). I like, know that the opiates are just a placeholder for something so idk. I have lots of trauma and recently was forced into a therapy break and I’m unsure what I want to do with my life at the moment so yeah. Idk this is a ramble I guess Edit: i Kind of want to cry now and I also regret using again just now ah man 😢 why’s shit so tough. Thanks for the Kind words as of now everyone I feel grateful ❤️‍🩹 We can do this. Does anybody else tear up and bawl their eyes out on Opiates? Idk, in my day to day life I’m often dissociated at the moment but when I use, I can feel my feelings again and I feel like I’m more equipped to deal with my shit and idk 😭Also, I only started this “active use” in like January. I’m not even using for long and I already feel sick of it 🥴. Is where I’m at rn I am also having an emotional flashback which is nice. Yeah just realized this. When I was little, my mom would take me to restaurants or to go eat out. This was still “special” in our family, but it was way more often than my dad would do this (my dad would complain about us/her spending too much money and wasting this money instead of “buying useful things” like stuff we’d need for repair around the house etc… I’ve got a feeling my dad also lied to us abt how much money we actually had (I grew up thinking we’re poor but we weren’t actually really poor…)).My mom would take me to go grocery shopping in a big store and as a kid, this was part of my highlight of the day/week…?? How common is this? I’ve never really reflected on this before 🫣I’m at some burger place rn feeling sad/kinda grieving, kinda hiding my feelings cuz there are people sitting behind me. I really want to cry tho. It makes sense, it explains why I do this so much (I go to restaurants/cafes almost daily though I want to not spend so much money atm and want to save, but didn’t learn how to do this either ☹️). I buy smth new as soon as I don’t have something I already own not on me, example I have 5 umbrellas. I panic and when I panic, I buy stuff sometimes (all the time. Mostly food. Tbh Im crying rn because what is this 😢 I don’t wanna wreak havoc on my health :( ) when I’m out and about.I feel ashamed to say this stuff. My mom escaped from home through shopping and restaurants and stuff I think…? (Cuz my dad was a raging narcissist or maybe even sociopath, idk. Little does he know both of his kids turned out this way too* 🤣😅) I’m doing the same - I escape from my safe flat daily to go to a restaurant or cafe, or if I’m not doing this, to go grocery shopping… tho I am safe(ish) at home (live in a shared flat with 6 other people atm, which triggers me quite often, but yeah. Nobody harms me there). Idk why I’m sharing this. Realized new stuff I guess. I also wanna learn how to save money and maybe work through this accompanying trauma… Im maybe triggered/not emotionally sober rn. And that’s ok. I always tried to beat myself up abt spending so much “unnecessary money” and tried to make myself stop through force but I guess it makes sense that it’s not working if I didn’t know about the accompanying trauma yet. …*before someone asks, yes I’m diagnosed 🥴🫣Edit:I’m tearing up for some reason now when I try to read my post again Also Edit#2 general info before someone asks: I’ve been in therapy for years but recently (a week ago) got forced into a year of therapy break in my current one. So basically I’m out of therapy rn. I’m also not overweight (yet) and I don’t wanna diet cuz I’m a recovering anorexic but yeah, this’ll wreak my health if I keep going like this. I have the urge to physically hurt myself when I made a mistake. I have a part that starts to threaten “me” and wants to bash my f*cking head in cuz I “need/deserve this” or “i won’t get it otherwise” when I do something wrong.Im preparing for an exam (I study maths) and this feels very prevalent. I can’t even look at the solution for the exercises I did, cuz I’ll immediately have this “blind rage” against myself when I see how “easy” the solution could have been and I “should’ve known that” but “no, I fcked it all up cuz I am so, so fucking stupid”. I’m scared of this part of me. Dissociation starts when I this type of anger comes up. I’m dissociated right now. I want to get back to doing this exercise but I’m unsure how I can help this very angry part of me.I don’t want to shame them/myself for this. I think they are confused and stuck at some age (where maybe I’ve been physically hurt for making a mistake). They could be helpful, if I could help them. I want to tell them/myself I don’t wanna hurt myself. Edit: it is *not* overstimulation 😭 it’s a part of me that thinks they’re not part of my body, and I think they have experienced this violence from my parents maybe. I’m realizing just now how fucking hurtful this was. Not just angering, but hurtful. I’ve been told plenty of times that I’ll never “grow up”, “oh man, what is supposed to become of you?!”, indicating that I’m a hopeless and lost case. I’ve been told I will never be able to care for myself when I grew up. Like, what the fuck. I feel angry about this. And I feel hurt. And scared, cuz part of me believes this. I have this feeling in my stomach that feels like my heart is sinking to the ground and further. I feel this is so UNFAIR!! 😡 I wanted to prove my dad and my parents wrong for a long time. My dad is dead now. But his words are as alive as always in me, and this belief that I can’t ever take care of myself and that, if I’m left on my own, I will just die.I feel shocked. I shouldn’t have been told this stuff, it’s fucked up. I want to grieve this too cuz this is just screwed up😢I’ve got the feeling this is very important and it could add to explaining why I feel the way I do lately. So is everyone else too. Sitting with pain hurts like a bitch but it’s worth it. I’m sorry for everyone who went thru this sh*t that I went thru too. I’m sorry for all the people that deep down, also feel like they aren’t enough. We deserve lots of love.. I feel like im going fucking nuts again omfg djdjsjejdjd fuck this stupid fucking shit wtf man I feel like its been my fucking destiny to fail. Like wtf. Due to how ive been fucking raised. Like i was raised believing i am stupid ajd that i cant fucking do SHIT on my own and that i am helpless as fuck and i fucking HATE IT. I am angry abput this crap. I keep recreating this shit in my fucking life. This shit keeps coming tf out omfg. Can someone lend me some fucking compassion cuz im fucking lacking it rn. And then i was being punished for being fucking helpless and needy so i learned: you cant fucking trust anyone. You are on your own. You HAVE TO teach everything yourself and should not ask for fucking help more than once or make the same mistake more than once ornotherwise you ARE a fucking failure and it proves your stupidity. I HATE IT I FUCKING hate it that i have been made so fucking helpless and then punished for it. I hate it so fucking much dude ughh I learned i will never be successful at ANYTHING. I learned that i am a fucking mistake and a failure and that, if i do ANYTHING WRONG, I SHOULD LEAVE IT TO THE FUCKING ADULTS WHICH IS LIKE WTF??? WHAT DO U fucking want from me man dont fucking tell ke i have to do it on my owm and then when i cant fucking do it im helpless???. “I deserve to be punished. I’m a monster. I’m not worth to be listened to. Nobody gets me. Nobody understand that I suffer. My suffering is not worth the note. I am never allowed to display feelings around strangers. I don’t want to be liked. I don’t need other people cuz I’m just unlikable. I can only ever make a mistake once and after that I’m horribly stupid cuz why the heck did I not learn from this?!?!”I just felt this stuff in my body, like, just this feeling of being wrong. This is shame and I’m so sorry for myself that I got to go through this sht and other stuff, I didn’t deserve that. I really didn’t and it is SO fucking unfair!! It’s just seriously not fucking fair man. I am angry about this. I feel hurt underneath it all. This really hurts.Feeling this and integrating it is tough af. I just lay in my bed and I wanted to dissociate or distract myself with food or gaming SO fucking badly but I felt it and I cried and then I was sad for myself and had this sinking feeling in my stomach cuz wtf?!?! Why have I experienced these things. I am scared of those feelings and on the other hand I’m taking myself and the feelings more seriously again finally and I’m not so dead inside anymore like the past weeks. I was so mothereffing dead inside the pet few weeks but today I’ve finally FELT MY FEELINGS AGAIN and put away my gddamn phone and I am ahhh idk my quality of life has improved by like 70% I love it fuuuuck it’s so much better than to just dissociate away all day although scary af too. Hi everyone I got my septum pierced almost 3 weeks ago, and it’s soon time to change it to actual jewelry. (I have a weird white plastic (?) thingy in rn that was put there by the piercer and they told me I can get it changed to jewelry after 4 weeks.) Idk yet whether to get a \*actually looks up septum jewelry names\* clicker or a barbell or a circular bead ring. I really like the looks of these spiked thingies (pinchers?) but dunno if they’d fit my face. I’m also looking in the direction of stretching it maybe later on when it’s been healed 🫣 but dunno if that’d fit me either So yeah uh. Do i just do trial & error basically, or ask my piercer what’d look good on me or just… go for it and hope it’s okay? 😂 or something else… lol idk 🤷 I mean I don’t think there’s an app or something that would show you with different jewelry or is there? Or I just remembered there’s fake piercings one could try ig. Sorry this is kinda chaotic lol I might put a TLDR at the end________________________So basically what title says. I’ve been in a trauma group therapy for like almost 2 years now and had to take a therapy break of some months about half a year in. After this I continued on tho and there’s been nice relational healing. This group has been a small treasure to me, I’m just realizing it now that it’s gone which is annoying and frustrating and ughhh 🙄🙄🙄😤😢 The group is led by 2 therapists, one of which I worked with solo too for a while, but I recently had to switch to the other one. I messed up and a part of me was dissatisfied with the therapy lately and really wanted to get kicked out. I came late or missed sessions lately (being late is a lifelong problem :/ but missing sessions or ghosting them was kind of new). I felt like it’s time for something new and I was sick from November last year through beginning of January, and during that time I decided I’d search for new therapists, as soon as I’d be healthy again, but keep being in the group until I find a new one. After I was healthy again, I missed sessions and yeah idk. Kind of ghosted them. A part of me/I thought literally “Are they gonna finally kick me out?” when I didn’t go to the therapy. However, now I had decided to tell my therapist this week (in a solo session) I’d wanna find something new and meanwhile be in this group still. But then she told me they’ve (the therapists at this institute) collectively decided to force me into therapy break for one year due to not attending sessions etc. I realize as I’m typing this, kinda makes sense from an outsider perspective 🥴 I still feel like I’ve been done injustice, due to the way the therapist delivered it to me (I felt small in this session and also like I’m being scolded or punished by a strict parent. I got pretty angry) Idk sorry for this mess of a post but I haven’t slept much Anyway so there’s that. I feel like this is pretty unfair. I’m missing the group and everything already. This group was giving me stability and safety. I’ve not been aware of this till now grrr why is it always like this that you only realize it later on man fck. This sht 😠😤😡😠☹️ I’m angry. I’m sad and Imma grieve for a while. It’s also been the first irl experience of a secure attachment for me, when I worked with the first therapist. So I pretty much feel very helpless now. The group is run by an institute specializing in trauma therapy and I also had art therapy there and the break stretches out to the whole institute. Idk how to deal with this stupid helplessness I feel bad for all of this and grrr ughhh idk man. I feel like I’m not gonna be able to do anything without this institute and like I’m being let down. I think it also makes me flash back to when I was abandoned/rejected from my parents. I’m also ANGRY at them (the therapists) for not giving me basically a third chance and exploring the reasons for my being late etc there and instead just kick me out 😡🤬😤😠😠😠I’m a Uni student and already take longer time for studying due to mental health and been out of Uni last year for trauma and MH reasons. This place was like a rock in the ocean for me, smth I could rely on and could always come back to. I feel so helpless now that it’s gone and like I’m gonna be unable to do anything _________________**TLDR**; I was in a trauma group run by an institute, they now kicked me out/forced me into a one year break for being late and missing sessions. Idk why this happened, I feel angry and sad abt it. This was the first place where I’ve felt safe in relationships despite years of therapy already. Lots of progress happened here. I also feel helpless now and like I’m not gonna achieve anything without them. Feels like I have lost the ground under my feet and now I’m just gonna fall forever I’m terrified I guess. I’m 24 AFAB, I’ve got several mental illnesses including CPTSD.I had Covid in November last year and was sick for 2 months - basically bedbound. It started during the infection that I began to profusely sweat while in bed when I was resting. Not just when I slept, but also just during rest (I spend a lot of time meditating and I also sweat a lot there). I think it was bad enough that once I had to change my clothing at night. For a while I also slept with a towel underneath me cuz I sweat through my clothes into the bedding.I also had dry cough and was very exhausted during my bedbound time. Now since like 3 weeks or so I’m “ok” again - I feel good enough to go outside and live my life more or less. Though in the nighttime I still sweat, and I still have a persistent dry cough. I’m also exhausted still and my lymph nodes sometimes seem swollen? I don’t know if I have a fever, my temp always seems normal despite the sweating (??) and while I sweat as well, but I’m fucking scared that I might have cancer.I’m seeing my doctor again on Thursday but idk I can’t sleep rn so I wanted to ask here as well.I often go to bed thinking I’ll get sick again - cuz I feel like that (exhausted, and this weird “ill” feeling). The sweat occur at night, while resting, but also kind of start during the day sometimes? I am panicking to be honest. I don’t want to have cancer :( I tried chalking it up to psychosomatic but I just googled more abt night sweats and I feel more scared now and as if this is smth serious (good idea I know) I have this sinking “black” feeling of doom in my stomach right now. Edit: I have mild asthma too and go to my pulmonologist this week for a checkup. I messed up some things in my life (have to discontinue my current therapy for a year, financial problems, ghosted a friend out of shame). I feel very angry on top of all that lately and I think there are many big scary feelings from childhood coming on top that I’m not sure yet how to deal with. I struggle with giving myself and my feelings space lately, but I just wrote this letter to my inner child, after I had a shitty day that sucked and I feel a lot of anger and frustration toward myself today. Admittedly, I’m not sober rn, but I sat with my feelings for a bit just now, and generated a feeling of love and gratitude for myself. (Not sure whether to post it here or at NS Community, sorry if it’s the wrong sub 😳🙈)______________________________I love you. I messed up big time, we messed up, we are, I am overwhelmed by hate, frustration, anger, and shame. Sadness. Shame. More shame.But I still love you. Nothing can take this away from you. You are still just as lovable and worthy of love, compassion and empathy, as everyone else. I’m sorry I messed up. I’m sorry I let you down. I’m sorry I wasn’t the healthy, loving adult for a while now, I’m sorry I let myself, you, slip. I love you. I am so grateful you are here. I am grateful for myself. I could feel love, earlier, just some minutes ago, flow through me. I am learning to attune to you and be loving to you - unconditionally. I am learning to be kind and compassionate towards you, towards myself - with all my big and little parts and all the big and little feelings. I love all of myself. The scary parts, the intimidating ones, the ones living in the shadow and whom I don’t see yet. I am finding deep compassion for myself. And I am sorry I messed up and let you down. I just want to let you know - I love you.. There’s a hole in my chest Where the mirror should’ve been What my parents should’ve brought There’s nothing but emptiness there I can see itI can feel it There’s pain where love should be Hate and anger instead of compassionShame and frustration instead of empathy Apathy where everyone cares And chaos where there should be stability My love is your hate My pain is your trust My suffering your dignity Feel it, touch it Here on my chest Don’t burn yourself, dear friend Or you might get my scars embeddedInto your very little heartMy syncope is your destiny I feel I am the monster I ought to be I should’ve been a burning childInstead I am the charred one That wants to stand alone, energized With my wings burning So I can distract myself From this hole in my chest. Hey y’all, title. It’s sorta hard to get my thoughts out rn. That’s the kind of state I’m in. Brain feels mushy, I feel pretty sedated. I accidentally took too much Borneo Red about an hour ago? I’m going to sleep soon, I’m worried I’ll wake up in withdrawals. I take Kratom occasionally, last time was 3 days ago. I want to get sober tbh, or space my doses further apart again (maybe once a week or every two weeks), and today I kinda f’d up and took too much.I don’t measure my dose - normal dose is a teaspoon, and now my dose was roughly 2 tea spoons. Didn’t empty my cup though (made tea) so I still have a little bit in case I wake up in WD’s 🥲 (and yes I do get WD’s)Edit: ok y’all I got it, I won’t be in WD’s 😭 pls don’t shame me 💀. NSFW just in case. I dunno if this is the right place to post but I figured I’m just giving it a shot (no pun intended).So idk if I’d call myself an addict but I’m using drugs on and off pretty much. Idk yet why (or when) the “on” phases happen, tho it might be when I dunno yet how to deal with my feelings or handle a situation.I recently got (back) into Kratom and unfortunately, also tried an RC opiate. I like the feeling of these things way too much (big surprise I know) and I’ve been motivated to be (mostly) sober for the past year or so, as my healing process really got big. (Loads of trauma processing, learning to sit with my feelings etc) My motivation to be sober was: It’s worth it if I sit through my cravings. As I experienced it a few times that, if I just “sit through” the craving (of taking anything), I’m “rewarded” with feeling my feelings deeply, and really understanding myself better.However, I recently recovered from Covid which had me bed bound for 2 months. During that time, I used LSD once, MDMA once (both for trauma processing), and Kratom 5 days in a row (cuz I found a study saying it combats Covid 🫣). Now I’m back to being healthy-ish again, but not really, idk what’s up with my health and this is one of the things that make me wanna use I guess? (I still have a cough, constantly feel like I’m getting sick, trouble sleeping and wake up feeling like sh*t most days) I feel overwhelmed and very frustrated with myself and everything since getting back into real life again (which was ~3 weeks ago). I don’t know what to do, I gotta take care of some adult stuff but I really don’t want to. I’m mostly lying in bed most days and most of the time. I also see no point in staying sober rn. It feels so pointless. Why be sober if I can just get a bit high and feel a bit better and process my feelings a bit more for a few hours? I find myself unable to stay present with myself right now (which, when I was sick, worked out rather well). Idk why. Feels like there is this massive wall of toxic shame sitting right inside my head, too. I always *think* about doing all my responsibilities but I feel a massive resistance against it, and I’m just frustrated as heck and angry. I’m sober for 3 days now (haven’t taken anything except caffeine) but I just feel like it’s useless?I got into mind-body-connection (and also Dr Gabor Maté) while being sick and according to this stuff, I have lots of pain that would come up if I were to stay sober rn. But no matter how much I seem to sit with myself, all I feel is anger and frustration?? Idk. Bit of a vent but whatever I guess what I also wanna ask is: Is it “ok” to be not sober for a while if you’re going through tough times?? Like idk. I used to justify myself with “Yeah imo it’s fine to use when you’re going through a hard time, if it helps you stay alive, whatever helps” but my ego and my coping mechanisms and defenses broke about a year ago, and now I just feel a ton of toxic shame around using drugs Edit: yes I am in therapy, yes I already have tools for self-regulation. But I feel like I just hit a roadblock lately.. So idk if I’ve ever had a “real” psychotic episode but I definitely had hallucinations before (induced through sleep deprivation or just weird brain fuckery). It usually happens when I’m faced with feelings I don’t know how to process, or make sense of. I’m not diagnosed w anything psychotic but I have two personality disorders (BPD, NPD) and CPTSD. I feel weird right now, kind of “hot headed” or like there is floaty hot air in my head, and my thoughts start going into weird directions. Like I’ll think my flatmates talking in the floor talk about me/plot against me. Or I see a picture of smth and mistake it for something else and it takes a bit to realize I’ve perceived it wrong. I’ll get extra jumpy and paranoid. I’m feeling weirdly manic and have all these ideas but then crash and don’t wanna do anything (not bipolar I think, these switches happen within minutes or hours. And yes I know that BPD can have psychosis-like symptoms like paranoia).What does the beginning of psychosis feel like to you? And does this sound like it?. Idk I feel frustrated. I feel impatient too. I’m in University and I was sick for 2 months due to Covid, now I’m back to being healthy(ish) again and technically I should start living real life again.But I don’t want to. I gotta take care of some stuff (my financial situation, moving soon, exams coming up etc) but I just find myself coping constantly (read: almost daily). For me, this means I spend money I should save on stuff like going to restaurants/cafes or ordering food, doing drugs, lying in bed all day on my phone, playing video games etc. Brain rotting lmaoI feel kind of dead inside most of the time at the moment, especially when I engage in coping. The thought of my coping stuff is better than *doing the thing itself*. I feel sprinkles of excitement and curiosity/motivation in between but most of the time I feel sort of depressed or dead. I feel lots of rage at the moment too that I can’t get behind. I think the rage has to do with all that. I don’t f*cking WANT TO do adult stuff, I don’t WANT TO feel my feelings, I don’t want to sit with the damn shame that comes up. I find myself at a point where I know what to do in theory (journal, sit with my feelings, figure out what’s going on), but I just don’t fricking want to. I feel this is my inner child “acting up/out” (with the self sabotage and all, and yes the things I listed like moving or doing my exams are things I actually want to do, I figured that out while I was sick) and screaming “LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME THERES SOMETHING UP” but I just can’t get behind it?? I don’t know why or what is going on. I am frustrated. I don’t know what the point of this is I also feel angry right now. I feel like y’all would be missing information about my life in order to provide useful advice but I’m still asking for advice sooo uh idk 🤷 I also feel really frustrated about this post right now and sort of angry cuz it’s like cool now I said this stuff but I actually didn’t say anything with this post. It does not feel satisfying 😑Edit: reading through this again I feel like I’m being harsh on myself and also letting down my inner child by neglecting myself 😤 Also sorta think posting this is a step forward cuz I can suddenly find compassion for myself again Also ‘nother Edit: if I think of sitting with myself/feelings (which is I think what inner child wants, that and community cuz I’m also v lonely atm) I feel terrified and I notice SUCH a strong resistance against that, that I’d rather keep coping instead of sitting with my feelings. Dr Gabor Maté Podcast and ~~chill~~ having a panic attack. There’s a hole in my chest And it’s filled with pain Endless hunger and void Resentment and hate If I look past it Reach out my handGrab into the void It feels endless and dark It smells faintly like wildflowersBlooming on a summer meadow If you reach far enough If you do it long enough You can faintly, in the distance See a child, glued to the ground Sobbing lightly, cowering away Hiding from you Not even a nod or a call or a chant Can make them hear you Or acknowledge your presence For that, you’d have to fade And make me all yours and I would make you all mine We would form this new entity Chain each other to the ground Through a beautiful, violent Neverending ritual Fainting at the blood moon together In the moonlight, in the distance Far away from your soul Celebrating a new light in life What’s yours is mine, what’s mine is yours Yet I wake from my dream If it smells like wildflowers still You should reach into the distance Inside of my chest, and see the void Maybe find this sobbing child But if you reach too far away Tread from the path of your knowledge,You’d find me there, eating you Until I tend to my wounds. Not sure yet if this is gonna be a rant or more of an advice seeking thing. I guess bothI basically don’t want to be in real life right now. I want to be in bed, safe, cozy and warm, just laying there. No responsibilities, no real life stuff to do. I feel frustrated.I have been sick for 2 months due to Covid, and two weeks ago, I got better to the point where now I’m able to live real life again, and not just exhaustedly lay in bed.I don’t want to. I was sick and couldn’t wait to return to my daily life, and now that I’m better again, I am overwhelmed by everything I neglected for the past 2 months. I gave myself time to heal while sick and learned to be with myself when I was just laying there, even started up regulating practices like Yoga Nidra or diaphragmatic breathing (I have illness anxiety, the first few weeks were bad, then it got better as I was consistently gentle with myself, sitting with myself all day every day). I want back to that, I almost wish to be sick again. I am in Uni and exams are about to start. I have a bunch of stuff I should really handle, like making sure I get enough money, or looking for new flats cuz I’ll have to move out of my current place in 2 months. I am angry. I feel sick of neglecting myself, I’ve been huge in my coping mechanisms since getting back to real life the past week (going to restaurants and cafes, occasionally taking drugs, ordering takeout, playing video games, spending money I should not spend right now), and ignoring everything else. I feel there’s a part of me who really wants to not do anything. There’s another part that wants to neglect myself and let everything run to shit, dissociate away, not care, cuz I “don’t deserve it anyway”.I don’t really know what to do. Admitting that makes me feel weak and idiotic.. Yeah title. I accidentally flipped it around, I got my septum pierced yesterday. The piercer flipped it up for healing. Now it is down though. What should I do? I’m not gonna touch it. I clean it twice a day with a cleaning solution and Q tips, does this change anything about cleaning now?. Hello all, I got my septum pierced literally today like an hour ago. Do you guys have any healing advice you wish you knew before getting it pierced? :)It’s my first piercing ever. I don’t know much about the healing process yet. I am mostly worried about blowing my nose rn - is it okay if I do it, will I be fine even if I accidentally move it when trying to blow my nose? I just did this and I think I accidentally moved it a bit, and it hurt a bit. Now the pain subsided tho Is there any way to screw up the healing process? Cuz I wanna avoid that lol. Idfk bitch then y’all can be fcking happy ever after or whatever y’all just want me to not be around anymore anyway cuz I’m soooo up your ass huh?? Well fuck this, time to leave reddit I guess idfk 😡😡 …I do need a break tho, maybe…But I am SO FUCKING PISSED THE FUCK OFF nothing fucking helps or whatever tf idk man. I feel so angry. I feel so Aaaaangryyy. I am angry and full of hate. I also feel fear and terror or panic. And sadness. I don’t know. I don’t know. Not my autocorrect correcting “empty” to “empathy” lmao.Anyway yeah. Everything feels empty. I feel like a husk in the dusk, watching the pretty evening sun, sinking down further and further into the ocean of nothingness. I feel that nothing is fun, nothing delights me, nothing gives me this sparkle in my eyes and the tingling in my tummy that I used to get from just… doing the things that gave me a kick, a rush, anything. Going to restaurants or cafés all by myself makes me feel alone and reminds me that I do not have endless money. Doing drugs curbs my loneliness, stardust up my nose or disgusting green slime down my throat, makes my tongue go numb, makes me feel ok for being and 5 minutes later I’m alone again and coming down. Going to the city to put my head into the air, the towers and buildings dawning above me, and getting lost in the fantasy of a different life, the life of another, reminds me of how empty I am. Even meeting up with friends, people I’ve lost or regained or who want nothing to do with me anymore, gives me an okay feeling but when I’m home alone and on my own again - nothing. I feel empty. I don’t know why I exist, I feel like a shell stepping out into the world and just existing. Not driving, not thriving. Just. Existing. Is it my serotonin receptors being fried from using MDMA the other day, or Kratom? Or is it actual depression? Or is it the inevitable emptiness that comes over us when we see that our coping mechanisms just don’t work anymore? The only thing that makes me feel safe is if I lay in bed. All by myself. Eye mask on, curtains closed. Ally Boothroyd’s voice resounding from my headphones, announcing gently and softly: “This is Ally. And this is a Yoga Nidra meditation.” If I stay all by myself, protected in warmth and cozyness by my blankets, I am okay. If I feel my feelings, sit with myself, I am okay. Real life feels too much for me right now. Too overwhelming. I was excited to get back into… everything when I was sick. But now I wish to be sick again, no responsibilities, just lying in bed, all by myself. I feel so fucking empty.. I think it just doesn’t work anymore like this. Idk why. I am overwhelmed w everything and if I jump into doing and never stopping 100% of all time throughout the day (I.e. being out all day, never taking time to stop or for myself), my body says “NO!”. I feel rn as if I’m getting sick, my throat is kinda sore, my nose stuffed and I have yellow mucus. Idk man. I think maybe it’s cuz I’m more fine-tuned to my body’s needs now? Not sure but it’s just not working anymore Which is scary. The cope stops working. I’ll *have to* sit down and be with my feelings, I’ll *have to* stop escaping. It brings forth pain, if I think about it. Idk man. I just kind of feel scared. But yeah dunno. I notice how my body screams for much needed time for myself.. Cuz my best friend is gone for now, my other long term friendships lowkey fell apart and the people I studied with a year ago graduated now. I feel sad and lonely. I would like to have a big cry. I know not many people irl at the moment and I would have to make new friends in my studies. I feel scared of this and I feel like a kid in school again that can’t find friends cuz everybody hates them. I dunno, the past is catching up to me once again. I am terrified about meeting new people. Which is strange cuz I used to know lots of people, on a shallow level mostly though, and when I was more in my wounding I’d switch between people every other day and see someone else constantly, unless I had a FP. Then I’d just see them all the time I guess idk. But now, my wounds from earlier come out and I just 😭 I feel scared of meeting new people. Anybody else really vindictive? If someone wrongs me, at some point I’ll start to feel like I really have to punish them. I also get sadistic n imagine different ways in which I could harm them for no reason, in an over the top way, even if they didn’t really do anything. If I look at these feelings, i see a rlly hurt part of myself, i also learned to be mocking and vindictive from my dad. I wondered for a bit now - is this more of an antisocial thing or common in NPD too? I have ASPD (traits) as well so yeah.
    Trying to understand/learn from bad conversationI was chatting with 2 of my roommates last night, A and B. B has been getting on my nerves, lately. I care for her, but she has some values (or lack thereof) that clash with my own. She's fine being friends with people who secretly sleep with their best friends exes. She's fine using guys for sex that she has no respect for. She'll frequently talk about their appearances and habits in a degrading way and be like "i know that's not my person". Ok then why do you keep hooking up with him? "It feels good". And then after a few months she'll stalk them or get really upset at them if they don't do something right and doesn't take accountability for anything she does.She talks down about strangers about their appearances, too. I'm fine with talking shit about character. That stuff is real. But she'll be like "I'm so happy when I see ugly people together. Good for them". ????? That is so... condescending and terrible? I think it's pathetic to judge someone for something they cannot control. She'll talk about her exes and be like "he/she looks so ugly and it makes me so happy" (exes that never did anything wrong to her, they just parted ways). It makes her happy to put others down. She prides herself on being "hotter than everyone else." And then she'll have the audacity to say "I'm not really a hedonistic person." What.Idk. I spotted this superficial behavior early on, but my other friends were fine with her. We were gonna end up in the same room but I stood up for myself and told her that we would not be compatible as roommates. So I avoided that, at least. But I am stuck with living with her. I have been trying to think of how to reframe our friendship in a way where these vital clashes don't matter so much. Ok. So last night B was talking about a friend. This friend is doing something immoral. She's hooking up with her best friends ex. B was saying "it's none of my business". Thats fine if thats her boundary. But I just said "i am not friends with that girl because if she would do that to someone else, who says she won't do that to me?". B seemed kind of offended that I felt this way about her friend. I guess she wanted to defend her. But I think she was also defending herself. She justified how it's just "college" and "people do bad things. This is the time to do it". I disagree. I think you can be a good person and work on your flaws in college. At least, I try to.Then B starts talking about how her friend reminds her of a guy she's hooking up with. "They're both so weak willed and malnourished, like they are just so empty." I kind of just snapped at that comment and I was like "how does being malnourished have anything to do with their character?" She often relates people's character to their appearances when sometimes it's just health related. Idk I'm sensitive about that stuff because I've known amazing people who just have eating disorders. It's not because they're "weak-willed". Then A chimes in and defended B. She was like "no, I agree. Some people don't take care of themselves. They don't eat, don't shower. And they're also bad people." Idk, I think they missed my point. We're talking about the character of this girl, and you bring in her weight, which i believe is completely NOT your business. I get the "not taking care of yourself" piece. It can be frusteating to be friends eith people like that, but that's not how her comment was meant to be construed. She wanted to take her down, degrade her for how she looks. When i made this retort, B kind of looked at me and seemed super offended like I had made some slight against her. She cannot take criticism. One time, I kind of brought up how her relationship with guys and how she uses them and lies to them is dysfunctional. She broke down crying and started talking about how broken she felt. I honestly felt for her a lot. I'm not a saint. Ive been a shitty person. I've avoided my faults and lied about them and denied them. But its hard to be friends with someone like that. But I cant help her. I hold her when she cries. I listen to her talk about how empty she feels inside. I give her advice thats honestly pretty valuable. I would say i am a wise person, though FAR from healed/healthy. I encourage her to come with me on my outdoors adventures. But she just has a pattern of denying her faults, being unable to take accountability, being superficial and judgmental, and making impulsive choices that damage her relationships.The conversation last night moves forward. At this point, I've kind of checked out. I can tell I'm getting angry, and i can tell that B isn't going to change her views, that she just fundamentally clashes with me. So I thought "ok, I'm gonna save my energy and just keep making my dinner".I'm making some shitty box macaroni that I was excited for. I know you're supposed to add butter but I just pour in the powder and add milk. Ive made it before. It's good, it's fine even without the extra steps.Midway through pouring in the powder, A goes "what are you doing???" I looked at her kind of bewildered. She said "didn't you read the box? Youre supposed to use butter." I moved in with these people without a lot of house training. My parents weren't good with preparing me to be an adult. But I've taught myself a lot. I can cook OK, I mop, I sweep, i vaccuum, clean the toilets, wipe the counters, bleach the sinks and my shower, I organize the living room, I organize the mail, take out the trash, buy things to decorate the apartment, organize the groceries/pantry so we can find things more easily, throw out things to avoid hoarding/make space for things we actually use. I get that i can be kind of incompetent sometimes. I'm not the best at cooking. But sometimes i feel like A looks down on me for those flaws. I'm not sure if it's condescension or genuine care. I'm kind of defensive sometimes, so I guess I'm worried I took this macaroni business too personally. I'm also extremely close with A. Shes my best friend and we tell each other everything. I've spoken with her about my gripes with B, and she completely agrees. So i guess I felt kind of weird that she took B's side in this conversation.But in this moment, in my head, I was like ive made this damn pasta before. I know how to make. She's not helping me she's just criticizing me. I don't need to make it HER way.So i said "I've made it before. It's fine this way, i like it."A says, "but it would be so much better if you just did (this)".I just said, "ok, I'm not going to do that. I like it like this."She just seemd so frustrated and was visibly upset with me. Maybe i was being dense? I dont know. I felt like she was being really critical and condescending.I kind of snapped. I shouldn't have. But this whole conversation really brought out my defensive side. "I like my pasta this way. I don't need to make it your way. I'm excited to eat it. I think its going to be good. And I don't need to listen to how you want me to make it. I know you think I'm not good at cooking, but I manage fine and I feel like sometimes you just want to look down on me and take a dig at me."She just said she thought if I did one small thing, it would be better. OK? And i don't want to. I don't know why that upset her so much.I dont know who's in the wrong. She just left and went to bed.After this conversation, I decided that my judgments of these people's behaviors were completely valid, but that my emotional outbursts were not.So I apologized and just said to each of them, "I'm sorry for snapping at you, I was in an irritable mood." Didn't get any response. But yeah. Idk i feel like i always apologize and take accountability for my behavior. I'm very honest and open about my flaws. very. But i feel like no one apologizes to me unless I stand up for myself and call them out. I wish others could take accountability sometimes. I don't know.I guess this is a vent. If anyone has advice on how I could do better, let me know. I think I'm also looking for validation that I'm not crazy for thinking I was mistreated. But maybe i wasn't and I was just too defensive. Im kind of a sensitive bitch sometimes. Let me know what you think. I'm sure someone has been on either end of this conversation and has some wise words to give.I'm 20 and have to wait a bit to turn 21. I feel like ive outgrown frat parties and want to go out to bars but I'm not sure of any places that allow 18+ people due to drinking. Does anyone know any spots i could go to? I live near downtown.They canceled a party on me that I was looking forward to going to as a distraction. I tried journaling to write the bitterness away. I funneled love into my brain trying to understand. But they canceled their plans. I want to be social. I feel entitled to the plans they promised. I feel angry. I feel empty. I hate that I'm bitter like this. I tried to distract myself by drawing. Hoping my mood would change. I went on a drive. Hoping my mood would change. I went by the ocean and stared at the waves crashing and felt their anger splashing as powerfully as mine. Echoing back an ancient loneliness that only something like the ocean can have felt and understand without words. I tried to use music to mood alter. Also didn't work. I saw all the kids my age out and about having fun tonight. But I'm alone. And I can't even be distracted by the people I love because I just have this gaping emptiness inside. Or maybe I just crave anger because nothing else feels good so I'm seeking some kind of dopamine. I don't know.I came home and didn't speak a word. They're still watching their dumb ass movie. At least I didn't let any of the bullshit inside of me leak onto my friends. It's just in me and in the activities I did tonight. Maybe they just think I'm quiet for some normal, reasonable reason. Well they'd be wrong. But fuck it. I need a parent but I'm 20. Can't exactly vent everything to a friend, it's too overwhelming. It would be emotionally abusive to a boyfriend, even.So I'm just sitting here. Burning in it. I hate this anger. Hate it more than the empty sadness. At least being sad doesn't hurt people so much. It's not as selfish.My stupid fucking roommate just came in and made her stupid fucking noises and turned on the light then left. Idk why she's always FUCKING moaning like what are you a cat?No I love cats. I'm sorry roommate.I'm so irritable. Fuck my roommates. Fuck their movie. Fuck my neighbors. Fuck ANY and ALL couples nearby that are in love. FUCK THEM. Fuck all the attention seeking bitches outside. Even though I'm one of them. Hell fuck me too fuck my anger fuck my useless obsessive attempts to be better FUCK ALL OF IT IM EXHAUSTED. FUCK ALL THE DRUNK PEOPLE OUTSIDE. GOD. DAMN.I went on a date with a guy. Told him I wasn't interested then added how confused I was about dating and how I feel better single. This is the truth. I think some part of me also wanted to soften the blow of rejecting him. The day after we went on that date, I met another guy. He was wonderful. We went on a few days. Had a really strong emotional connection. Like, really strong. He understood me, accepted my narcissism, etc. I ultimately decided that I didn't have the physical attraction to pursue a romantic relationship with him. I told him that. We parted ways. Before that ended, my housemates and I hosted a party. I invited boy 1 and boy 2. I was still taking to boy 2 at the time. We weren't super obvious with it but boy 1 could tell.I felt bad about that party because one of my friends was rude to boy 1, and i felt bad that he had to see me going out with another person so shortly after we went on a date.I ended up talking to him about it (this is boy 1). I apologized on behalf of my friend who was rude to him. He said he didn't mind.He also said that he thought i was iffy that I was going out with another guy after telling him that I didn't want to date because I was so unsure of myself. I told him that I also chose to not go on more dates because I truly wasn't interested in him romantically. But I get his doubts. Idk. I was just so interested in the second guy. It felt so right, until I was more honest with myself. I just wanted to try to give it a chance. Am I a whore for that?I even told boy 1 that. "I thought you would think i was a whore if you saw me with boy 2 so shortly after our date".Idk. I feel ashamed. I know his judgments mean nothing about my character. But I have this need to explain myself to him. To make him understand. To make him see me as perfect again.That yeah I'm iffy about dating. But I liked this new boy.Ugh idk. I just feel ashamed.I was on westcliff during the sunset yesterday (2/27/2025). I didn't manage to get any pictures of it and since I was exploring some tide pools, my views was obstructed by a cliff. Does anyone have any pictures they'd be willing to share? :). I got unlucky and have been sick for nearly 4 weeks straight. Had no will to study at all during this time. Rescheduled and it feels like a weight had been lifted.My profile picture on spotify is me looking into a mirror. Its a nice picture. I look nice.It's just so ironic. Looking into a mirror, trying to see myself. It's just a shell. Looking at other people to see them reflect myself back. But I just see my empty soul in their eyes. It's so dark that I can't even see them. I'm lonely but there's nothing in here. It's not even sad it's just meaningless.. I'm not real. I'm letting go of my shell. My relationships weren't real. I did not love them. I wasn't attracted to them. It was just safe. They don't know that. They don't know how wrong I did them. They don't know how terribly I've acted. I don't want to tell them. Thats too terrifying. I just follow what feels good because I have nothing else.Where did I go? What am I? Maybe I got caught in a dream when I was 7 and just never came out.Hello, I have a roku TV and need a new remote. Does anyone know any brand that works, and that has volume buttons (roku remote doesn't have any)?. I have never experienced a stomach bug like this as an adult. I don't know for sure if I have norovirus, but I'm exhibiting vomiting, diarrhea, and cramping.You don't want to get this! It hurts, you can't eat, can't sleep, can't do schoolwork. It lives on surfaces for a few weeks and is transmitted through the fecal-oral route (gross i know). To clean it off of contaminated areas, especially ones where you eat and use the bathroom, use bleach. The virus is enclosed by a capsid that the flu, covid, and other viruses don't have. Only bleach can destroy that membrane. * and just for precaution, since this entails experimenting with cleaning products, don't mix alcohol with bleach, or you'll get chloroform. Dont mix vinegar with bleach, or you'll get chlorine gas.Good luck to anyone with this bug. Fucking sucks. I will be shitting in solidarity with you.Edited because it seemed like i was telling people to drink bleach. Dont do that 😊. My brain keeps identifying the howling wind as people screaming in panic and it's scary. It's hard to realize it's wind over the sound of the rain hitting my window.Saw a lot of emergency vehicles headed towards the boardwalk. Anyone know what happened? On the police scanner radio, I heard there were 4 patients.I'm trying to grow. I'm trying to be more intentional and thoughtful about my life, but i acted impulsively again. Will it be OK?. Can I get better? Even if I get better, will i ever be able to make up for all the mistakes I've made?. I have a therapist but I'm doing pretty poorly. I'm depressed, anxious, and my OCD symptoms are acting up. I need more frequent support. For reference, i am a 20 year old woman. Does anyone know any support groups i could attend in santa cruz? I would prefer in person.I feel irredeemable. I feel like ive made no progress. I feel like everyone hates me. I feel like i should disappear so my soul can finally rest. It is too exhausting to be good.Please someone tell me something kind. I am struggling to do it myself. I don't know if i deserve it, but i really need it. Please.I like male attention. This is just one of my flaws. I've been working on it.I obsess over whether I'm a bad person. I'll think about small things I do, pick them apart and convince myself I am a horrible person. I think this is honestly just the case like I really am screwed up. I have all these high morals and I never meet them and I make so many mistakes. I think my obsessions about my morals are probably exaggerated and too harsh. At least that's what everyone around me says. But whenever they try to comfort me and say I'm a good person it really upsets me because I really am bad. I like to seek male attention. I can be really really egotistical. I've been celibate for a long time and against dating because my mental health is too poor. But lately I've started flirting again for the first time in nearly a year and I just feel the ego trying to lead me instead of love. I DONT WANT THAT. I WANT TO BE KIND. I DONT WANT PEOPLE TO LOVE ME. I WANT TO LOVE THEM. im just so bad at it!!!! I feel like everyone around me just doesn't see me for who I really am. They shouldn't love me. I don't know why they do. I am not loveable. I am worthless and I hurt people all the time. So maybe it isn't an ocd topic at all. I think it's just real. But how do I get better? How can I improve when all I can do right now is obsess over everything I do wrong, wonder if I'm misremembering something that proves I'm a bad person, all the while I keep fucking up in life. I don't know. I'm exhausted. I genuinely have so little left to fight this. I hate myself so much. I wish I could claw my soul out of my body and pour its disgusting remains into the ocean.Am i redeemable? What if I have felt egotistical about too many people? What if I didn't try hard enough to be loving and kind? What if I impulsively stepped over too many boundaries?I've already confessed to my roommates today. I kept asking them if I am loveable. I kept asking them why they loved me. "Why do you love me? Why are you still here? I don't understand"I feel like i need to confess to everyone in my life that I am bad.I went to a small get-together last night at a friend's house. This guy there, A, mentioned he had a girlfriend a few times. I genuinely forgot. Later in the night, we were sitting on a couch together. We had a really long conversation about cars, our shared music tastes, and personal stuff about our upbringing. During this time I was pressed up against his side, as well. Like my boob was straight up on his arm.I slept on the couch. This morning, I heard him calling his girlfriend and it was like a slap in the face when I realized. I feel seriously guilty. I feel like I overstepped so much and that I went completely against my morals.I texted him a message basically saying that I had forgotten he was taken and that I wished I had both been more careful and that he should be careful, as well. He replied saying that he loves his girlfriend, that he would never cheat on her, and that he saw me as a friend.I feel really confused. Maybe I was misinterpreting? But we were in such close proximity and the conversation was very intimate feeling. I consider that flirting. It's hard for me to believe that that was a platonic interaction. I just replied saying that I was glad that was the case, and apologized for overstepping a boundary like that. I actually feel so guilty like i want to crawl in a hole and disappear. I also feel embarrassed if I was just misinterpreting the whole thing. I don't know what kind of advice anyone might have but I just need to talk to someone about this.Spent 5 minutes trying to figure out how to use a weird can opener. My roommate kept offering to help but I kept refusing. When I finally gave in I just started crying but she didn't see thankfully. I'm just so sad. Nothing special I suppose. What if my community discovers my shameful past and find out how troubled I really am? Would they be disgusted? Would they forgive me?This shit sucks. I got an NPD/OCD/depression combo meal and it's destroying me.How strange that some part of me was born wanting to be good.But my heart is evil, pleasure seeking. My thoughts are sick.Why bother wanting to be moral at all if it just means I am always at arms with myself?I wasn't made to love. I wasn't made to love.My intentions cut across each other.I watch a procession march through my mind, starting wars i didn't plan.I just have one consciousness to stop each soldier, one by one.Panting to keep up.I went to a bar alone as I am traveling with my parents and wanted to socialize with people my age. I went to the bathroom. I left the stall and started doing a ponytail in the mirror. My arms were above my head so my armpits were showing. I hadn't shaved in a couple of days so the hair was like... 3mm long. This couple barges into the bathroom. A guy and a girl. I was a little put off that a guy would be in the women's restroom, but i just ignored it, assuming he was really drunk and needed his girlfriend. The first thing he says is "You've got a hairy armpit". I was just kind of shocked. I didn't respond and just stared at him as he followed his girlfriend. He seemed weirded out that I was staring at him. Idk.My whole life, I have been EXTEMELY insecure about body hair. I am Greek, so I have a lot of it. So many times, ive heard comments about how women aren't feminine if they have body hair. I'm also tall. That doesn't help me feel feminine either, based on the cultural standards.I sort of just went blank when I heard that comment. I had been alone the whole night, so I already felt sort of socially isolated. Then, right as I was warming up and feeling like there were some cool people, some guy waltzes into the women's restroom where I am supposed to take care of my body, and makes a comment about me.I kind of wish I had made some retort towards him. But I remember thinking in the moment that it would be a waste of energy to respond to him. I'm not sure why this is bothering me so much. Maybe I am being sensitive. It just really hurt my feelings. I feel angry that he wont realize the impact his words can have.I feel this need to always have my armpits shaved now. I have to do it pretty much everyday to appear hairless since it grows so fast. But I don't really want to. It would be for the sake of other people's opinion of me...Sorry for the long paragraphs.Edit: the kind comments really helped me, thank you :). Hello, I'm visiting whistler with an injury that prevents me from skiing. I was going to ski, but had to cancel due to a surgery I had recently. Couldnt refund the whole trip, though, so here i am! What can I do locally to have a good time? Just looking for inspiration and ideas :). No part of you has ever fallen. You did not suddenly become flawed. You were born flawed. You were never going to be perfect. Time would have brought on your flaws because you are as you are. You are eternal. You only discovered your nature with time. Your past is a solid, unmoveable boulder. Grey, rough, smooth, heavy, frustrating, comfortingly still. You cannot fight the eternity of the past. You can lay on its surface, warmed by the sun. You can feel the grit dig into your skin. You have the right to be as you are.. Anyone been to the holiday parade downtown before? It's at 10am, not sure if I should go or not. What are the vibes?. I was curious to see if anyone knew anything about this topic. I recently had a surgery on my right shoulder so I have been writing left handed. Coincidentally, I have become really happy, recently. the past half decade of my life has felt like i was always about 10% miserable. Ive been through breakups, horrible anxiety and ocd, suicidal ideation, self harm, and just extreme self criticism. I feel like i have been blindly fumbling in the dark for so long. Ive been strong. Going to therapy, getting into DBT and mindfulness. But some part of me kind of accepted that things would always feel mildly grim.And then I got this surgery. At first, I thought it was the opioids I was given. But I stopped taking them 3 days ago and this feeling of childlike wonder and joy hadn't left me. It feels like i have been born anew.I go outside and the world is beautiful in a way that it only was when I was 14. I'm 20, now. I don't feel the obsessive need to compete. I just want to be. I also have an increased empathy for my friends. I have a healthy crush that isn't damaging my mental health. I feel hopeful but so in the present. I have NO IDEA WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. I am honestly confused and a bit scared. But even those negative emotions have a calming tinge tothem now. Everything just feels better, calmer, softer, warmer. The only thing that has changed is that I can only use my left hand. My medications have been stable. Maybe this has stimulated my brain in some way? The struggle, the newness of it, maybe that is why i feel so young. I don't know. Does anyone have studies on non dominant hand usage and mental health? I'm just weirded it by how happy I am. I'm waiting for it to end (it feels so easy to talk down negative voices like this now, though!!! I'm able to just be like... it might end, butenjoy it while it's here :))) joy and pain are beautiful partners✨️✨️✨️✨️) like literally who am i. Ive become a happy hippie.I'M SO CONFUSED LOL. Got the labrum repair surgery. 3 days into recovery and goddamn it hurts. Waiting for my tramadol to kick in even though I'm against opioids.Won't have to deal with shoulder dislocation anymore! Just a few months of consistent rehab and I'll be back in the game baby. How do I see my position in a class's waitlist in the MyUCSC portal? I have checked under pretty much every tab and followed the instructions to go to "class schedule", but it's nowhere to be found.. I've been maintaining a status of single for a while now. I've been very successful with rejecting advances made towards me and protecting my single life. It's awesome, I'm learning to love myself! I never thought I would feel so strong and at peace without a partner. Ok, so then I join this jiu jitsu club. Unfortunately, there is a gorgeous man there. We rolled one time in jiu jitsu, and something about the body chemistry snapped something in me. I think he's more attractive than my first crush from middle school (in my 3rd year undergrad now) -- this is a crazy statement because I was madly obsessed with that guy. I ever thought I'd find someone so beautiful again.When i had first approached him, i hadnt realized he was so cute. I saw him sitting alone in my peripheral vision, so I walked over because I was alone as well so I thought, why not make a new friend? Then he looks up at me and my heart DROPS. i hadn't seen how handsome he was. I would NOT have approached him if I had seen that face before. I would've been too scared.Fast forward to now, I've run into him at a party, we keep talking during jiu jitsu practices, and I have no fucking clue whether this man likes me or not. He has female friends that he's chill with so I really can't tell whether I'm just another friend. He definitely makes some effort to approach me and talk to me, but I'm also just pretty nice and sociable so maybe he likes talking to me platonically?? I'm kind of going insane. He's a little bit introverted and doesn't really push out his social energy. Ive been asking him a lot about his life because I'm curious about him and who he is. He doesn't really ask me much about mine. Idk. It's unlikely that he has a crush as strong as mine if he even has a crush at all.I haven't been through these violent swings of delusion and depression in so long. I feel like a little girl again.Honestly, I suppose it's better if he doesn't like me so we don't end up shitting where we eat. We both love jiu jitsu. And i also love being single.I do nogi, but i am a white belt. I likely have an upcoming labrum repair surgery from repeated shoulder dislocation, so I have to avoid rolling. To cope with this, I have been watching practices and doing some mild drills that don't involve my shoulder too much. Some stuff I've done is: headquarters passing, one legged x sweeps, and butterfly sweeps. I can put weight on my shoulder. What endangers it is rotating my arm backwards (like with kimuras), or falling onto my back where the momentum might force my joint to jolt backwards. I feel bad always asking people to give me drills to learn, so I thought to ask here. What drills would you recommend? I can watch them on YouTube and then try them on people at my club.I've had shoulder dislocations for years from a bike crash. I recently started doing jiu jitsu. I really like it, but I dislocated my shoulder pretty bad this past weekend. I told my mom about it and I ended up crying to her because if I get a surgery to fix this, I will have to stop jiu jitsu and my EMT job for 6 months to a year. The recovery for the surgery is apparently pretty rough. She told me to stop jiu jitsu altogether and see a doctor.I have two upcoming consultations for my shoulder with different doctors. But once this particular dislocation gets better, I think I'm gonna go back to jiu jitsu and just roll lightly. Idk if that's inconsiderate to my mom. I kind of made it seem like I wouldn't roll. I don't want to lie to my parents, but if I'm honest they will get really upset with me. I know I should be more responsible, but I CANT quit this sport I can't. I have really fallen in love with it. It helps me regulate my emotions and put my energy into something.Idk if this is even NPD related. I just posted it here because I'm narcissistic and I feel like this is a moment in my life where I'm being reckless and inconsiderate. I just feel stuck. I want to do jiu jitsu and my EMT job. I also don't want my shoulder to keep falling out. Not sure if all those things can coexist.This is new to me -- having issues in my life that are not romantic relationships.. Recommend me some electric guitar songs. They can be raunchy and jazzy or faster paced. To give an idea of my taste, I like Santana, Led Zeppelin, and Eric Johnson. Open to all suggestions, though.I hyperextended my elbow yesterday. We have an open mat tomorrow and I want to go so bad but I know I should rest. I'm just getting sick of getting injuries and having to stay away from doing things I love. I also have a shoulder that won't stop dislocating and I'll probably need surgery for that eventually. The recovery time for that is months, though.I guess I'm just feeling the mental toll from physical injuries. I know that letting myself rest will allow me to get back faster than pushing myself too far. But what if I never get back to it? Idk. Others who have recurring injuries, how do you stay sane?. I'm really new to jiu jitsu. My first few sessions, I was very open minded and awed by the sport. Now that I've been a few times and picked up some moves, I feel like I'm getting cocky. After receiving compliments I feel like I've adopted this "look at me I'm new and I'm pretty good already" kind of attitude. I really don't think this will help me learn at all. I'll just be more careless and less tolerant of my own failures, not to mention judgy of other people. I also just find it kind of pathetic when I recognize those thoughts in my head. I get pretty frustrated with myself.I know this doesn't paint me in the best light but I really want to be better. If anyone else has had issues with staying humble as a newbie or even later on in their experience, I'd love to hear how you managed this kind of mindset.Edit: thank you so much for all advice! I'm going to try to get the courage to ask a purple belt to fuck me up tonight 🙏. Anyone have the Addy for the dayger this weekend?. We got back together. He held me, we kissed. I could see his eyes and feel how warm he was. Then I messed up somehow, and he left again. Woke up missing him again. It's been more than a year since we broke up..
    I feel deep empathy and love but only for other narcissists. I secretly unconditionally love and support other narcissists and I feel like non-narcissists are out to defame and abuse innocent narcissists, as if their whole life goal is to prove they are humble and better than us. I wish I lived in a world of only narcissists.I’ve always been yelled at, excluded, and criticized since I was a kid and I used to be such a happy person who tried to be friends with and include everyone but then it was implied that I was doing happy wrong and I got harassed and teased and excluded (per usual). I’ve gaslit myself into believing I’m a wretched person and I was just born broken. I don’t believe anything I think anymore and am so full of shame I don’t leave the house or talk to a soul. Whenever I read that self-love stuff online I’m like “ok, but that’s stuff for other people (valid humans), not me”. I was so full of life and hope, how do I get that back when I believe I don’t deserve happiness and I’m one of the few bad, bad, irredeemable people in the world.. I just started a new Instagram account yesterday, and uploaded a reel. It already has over 1,600 views! I didn’t use any promotions, and barely followed anyone, so could someone please explain this phenomenon? Also, my insights say I reached 599 accounts already. What? (Not that I’m complaining).I am so sick of the repeats in runway rally squares! My house just got 18 squares at once for reaching 10 goals, and you would of thought that would give us ALL 18 SQUARES! But no! All we got was a bunch of stupid repeats!. Why the hell is a sixth grader posing in lingerie on TikTok? WTF? P.S., this girl started a club in third grade where she and all the girls verbally fucked and physically seduced boys. On the playground. WTF.Edit: When I say seduced, I mean they were ALL over them. I’m two years older than this girl, but the damn club was so popular people in my grade were joining.Another Edit: WTF.So there’s this giant fair that goes on for one week once a year. I missed it last year, the year I was going through a lot of mental health issues, and it sucked. The best memories of my life happened at that fair. With my mom. Apparently they meant nothing to her. I begged and I cried for her to let me go this year, but she said no. You know why? “Because I said so!” She then made the excuse about COVID, but the exact same day she broke my heart after leading me on for the whole summer that I was going, she was booking appointments for me to go to the orthodontist! Have people poke around inside my mouth! Every single person at school said how this was gonna be the highlight of the summer, and I was promised I was gonna go. And not to mention that I am more well-behaved and responsible than all of those kids combined! I get perfect grades, and, earlier this summer, when I hung out with the most popular guy in school, and he took me the house of one of his friends I don’t know, I walked away! I wasn’t even told I wasn’t allowed to go there, it was just because of my good judgement. I did the same thing when my friends decided to trespass into a daycare’s playground. I didn’t even get to the worst part yet. When I started crying, because all of my dreams for the summer had been crushed, my mom said, “Good, cry.” She actually sounded amused by sorrow. A little later on, when I was bawling while watching all the kids at school have fun on TikTok, she said, “If I hear you cry again, I’ll take your phone and smash it into a million pieces!”. I’m sure you’ve run into these accounts before. They have thousands of followers, but no work and no reading lists. They simply follow you, wait until you follow back, then unfollow you. Do they want to sell their accounts to actual authors who want to start up with an already massive following? What do they want?. When TikTok first came out, it had a lot of potential. But shallow people (about 75% of the general population), turned it into a platform where they can model for likes. It’s the comments that’s the most cringey of all. “OMG your sooo perfec“ “lmao better then alllll of us” “OMG like honey 🔥” and all these cringey comments are given to girls with ten pounds of makeup on. The word perfect is the worst of all. It just shows how low standards are to get respect in today’s society. They are so obviously trying so hard, it’s just cringey.These shows display some of the most shallow romances I’ve ever seen. One guy says, hi, I’m - insert douchebag name here -, what’s your name? Then the girl says, I’m - enter girly name here. Then they are “in love”, after a cliché getting to know you conversation, where they give and take the same answers you could have gotten from LITERALLY ANYONE ELSE ON EARTH! But no, they are so special and are meant to be. And of course, they are all naturally smoking hot, as normal people apparently don’t deserve love.I woke up this morning with a few followers. Then, suddenly, dozens of people just suddenly following me at once. Next thing I know, in an hour, I have nearly 100 followers. I started following back, just to give a good impression, but let’s be honest; I’m not gonna have the time to read books from 100 profiles! I always hate it when people follow me and don’t even take a look at my book, so I stopped after about a dozen people, and just started thanking them instead (other than the one person I actually had a connection with and actually had a book, most of the others didn’t). Well, for the few that I had followed back at the beginning unfollowed me. They had my follow, and that’s all these corrupted, passion-lacking scammers care about. Their profiles, (which had thousands of followers, even though they only followed a couple hundred), had no books, and their bios said one thing - follow me. Why are you even on Wattpad! This is a platform for authors, not desperate beggars! If you’re going to follow me, maybe try actually caring about my work?.
    We feel 'not good enough' because we aren't actually good enough. Lolllll God be playing pranks with me.What's even the point of living like thisI don't care about anyone, I just care about what people can serve me, I don't wanna be like this but thats how I am, people say love yourself, but what if my true nature is being a bad unkind judgemental rude mean monster who always wants attention and admiration and validation and knows only to manipulateI can't loveThere's no life without loveI just wanna be normal, mentally sane, ok, secure, value things and people in life, live happily, and die but guess what I'll die alone living a miserable sad lonely life. Am I just born to cause harm and suffering to others ? Only to take and take and take ? I can't give anything in return. I can only mask and fake being a goooood girl. What can I do to alter tamas gun (mode of ignorance) in my nature ? I'm filled with tamas and tamas only. I don't eat non-vegetarian food...I know that everybody has a basic human nature that cannot be changed (prakriti) but can I do something in my routine to live in more satvik gun ? Like is it like I move from tamas then rajas then satvik or can I move directly from tamas to satvik gun ? I think you can see how confused I am :p Plss help. Narcissism is not merely a mental/emotional issue. It's a spiritual issue. This would be long and boring read for most people (maybe im projecting lol) but it's the truth. Read this just for knowledge, no propaganda. Just from My personal experience.Our 'True self' as said by people here whom they cannot be, is our soul (aatma). We all are pure souls. A person/human nature can be good/bad. But a soul is beyond good/evil.False self is the ego (ahamkaara). It's fueled by fear, pride, ignorance.As per hinduism (the oldest religion in the world) there are three modes - the mode of goodness, the mode of passion, and the mode of ignorance. Hinduism is not only a religion, but a way of life. Great practices as yoga, meditation, even religions like buddhism and Jainism have originated from here. Even the concept of karma (actions).I'm an Indian born in a family believing in hinduism. 16 y/o, inherited this disorder from my grandmother because of genetics. True happiness = the mode of goodness and devotion towards an higher power (god).I see that we aren't able to love,because we mistake love for control and power or attachment.Surrender to any higher power you believe in. I believe in lord shree krishna personally. This is the purpose of our life. This is what differentiates us human beings from animals.You are free to believe in any higher power or not at all. I'm just sharing my gained experience/knowledge so far. I also see that many people here are afraid of death (including me) XD this is because we don't recognise that we are not this body but we are a soul. Our consciousness is highly underdeveloped. We don't have morals/values. We don't know what's good and bad. People say here that nothing is objectively good/bad but that's ignorance...We live in IGNORANCE. We are energy vampires, really negative people that's our basic nature. But the god/higher power doesn't differentiate. There's love and acceptance for everybody who practices devotion. Devotion is the important thing here.This is our prakriti (basic human nature) we can manipulate/hide/alter this through therapy but we cannot change it. We will be like this till the day we die. I know its a lil scary, but the truth. I see this in my grandmother, she believes in God but she is still a narcissist (nearly 60-70 years old). I don't say that practicing spirituality (hinduism) will heal you/god will change your basic nature. But that will definitely give you true happiness.Personal experience:- 15 years of my life I was brought up in a moral/value school and house and had really good friends with high values. after I graduated from high school, I shifted to a new place and completely got lost, went into deep depression. Lost all my old friends, lost touch with them completely, collapsed very badly, realised that I was a covert narcissist, the dots started connecting. I tried everything from ifs, cbt, dbt, schema, buddhism as a philosophy, loving kindness meditation, yoga/workout, mindfulness, Journaling, reparenting, Heidi Priebe...This was a temporary fix, won't deny the fact that it helped temporarily but I wasn't truly happy... something was missing.We aren't demons. We have demons inside us. And for that devotion towards a higher power is needed. That's the purpose of human life. We can chant the lords name, We can serve other people, We can be conscious, We have free will...I love interacting with people like me here...makes me relieved that I am not alone..I love this community and the people here. We are bad people by nature, accept it. I would sincerely urge people to read Bhagwad Geeta and especially to dig deep into Karma yoga...we have got one life, and human life is very precious. even I had just started to believe in god and my spirtual journey has just begun. I hope that i won't lose faith, I easily do lose faith when any minor inconvenience happens to me or if things are going really smooth >_<We are really lazy and entitled people...Take responsibility, no excuses. do the work, do good deeds, never stop believing in God and chant any lord's name, any higher power you believe in. Always consume good content, and spend time with good people."When nothing matters in life, what we do matters". (Karma/actions)People here run behind money, lust, physical appearance, respect/approval from people, nothing would give you the true happiness.We have come alone and we have to die alone, leaving everything behind here. Lord wants us to take his name. So that we reincarnate, and attain moksh (liberation from the cycle of birth and death). Truth is always bitter. Therapy is nothing but a mechanism to alter our actions, which is already stated in bhagwad geeta in Karma yoga. It's to control our senses.Just as y'all read Buddhism as a philosophy, I would request to read more on Hinduism as well. It will surely benefit you, you can start from simple Om chanting...I see that people in recovery here unconsciously practice hinduism for healing. God loves us all. Goodness always wins over evil (lesson from Ramayana, a Hindu epic) I can see people and even myself trying to be good people, as goodness will always always win over evil. We all are bad people by nature but we now strongly believe in goodness by our life experiences, and when we try to change it we feel enormous amounts of shame because we aren't good by basic human nature.Peace ❤️. Choose one (which cartoon did you enjoy watching more in your childhood). I feel like a schizoid...I am not sure about who I am. Has anybody felt the same ? How did you overcome this ? What helped you ?. Can anybody share their personal experience with how they came to have boundaries in life ? It's basically reparenting an emotionally 2 year old. I cross boundary lines, I don't even understand the meaning of it sometimes. I don't even have intentions let alone good/bad. Everything I do is a result of my emotions/disorder. I wonder if a 2-3 year old does have intentions ? They don't even see the world beyond them. Let alone forming relationships, maintaining them. This is from the perspective of an inner child inside me. How do you understand that other people have needs and respect them ?. My parents refuse to take me to a psychologist 😩 what do I even do. I may have adhd, you might think having npd means hurting other people and making people around the suffer which is true but it's unintentional. People don't understand that the pwnpd is suffering too. I don't find meaning in doing anything in life from friendships, to watching content, to family, to hobbies. Nothing is meaningful to me. I lack an inner drive for doing absolutely anything even if it's just taking a bath or making the bed. My relationships suffer greatly due to not having emotional empathy.Is it my fault ?? It surely isn't. Im not able to function. Feels like dead inside.I am 16, have oily skin and use a moisturizer daily. Do I need to apply a sunscreen too ? I'm a student and study at home, online.i feel like i have been deprived of a sense of inner peace/ my own authenticity/ meaning in life. so the only thing i would like to live is for travelling. travelling invloves just looking at the beauty of world and distracts me from my inner demons for some time. i love the experience of it. my goal in life is to earn money and travel with my family. cuz im certain that my family wont ever leave me and will always be there with me. im also very hyper independent so the idea of making them travel and then they appreciating me and kind of praising me seems so good...does anybody feel the same ?. as a pwnpd, your thoughts on it ? i feel so scared by it. maybe im just overthinking...but we do have an underdeveloped consciousness.I have to share laptop with my younger brother. The only time laptop available for me is like 6 am to 3 pm. It pissed me off so much that I cant study in the evening/night and it ruins the flow state I'm in. I can hardly do 3 hours productive/effective studying from 6 hours at morning. I'm not really a morning person. What should I do ? They think that these are excuses and I can study before 3 pm what the heck 😭I'm preparing for jee a competitive exam in India while my brother is in 8th standard.Procrastinater ultra max pro (12 days until phy and maths exam) plssss help. Hairfall gone. Dandruff reduced. Hair are softer and healthier 💕. I'm grateful for cookiesI'm grateful for having a great time playing badminton with my momI'm grateful for good food 🙏. Random thoughts. Life would be so much easier, if I could feel empathy for people like a normal person. Today I went to a family function and I could feel emotional empathy for toddlers but not people. So strange isn't it ? I can also feel empathy towards animals. Whyyyyy god why. It's such a curse. Is there any way I can feel empathy towards normal people too ? I think the problem with us narcs is that our emotional development is stuck at around age 3-4 ? I really wish if I could feel empathy towards normal people too.Title. I wanna genuinely love people, care for them, build healthy relationships and miss them. Not only seeing them as an extension of myself and seeing them as an individual with their own lives and have respect for their boundaries.I am highly sure that I'm a full blown NPD...I'm also self-aware cuz I have been wondering for years what is wrong with me...I feel like an emotional 3 year old trapped in an adult body. Npd means emotional arrested development...mainly because of emotional neglect and genetics also do play a role...I feel like I have inherited the disorder from my grandmother who is also npd. I don't understand What's my fault in having this personality disorder ? It impacts everything how I feel, how I behave, how I think...My grandmother has three children and each of their children has two more children. In the family of almost 10 people who could be affected by the genes of npd of my grandma, why did only i inherit this disorder gene particularly ?I also lack emotional empathy which makes it difficult to connect with others. I think that I'm gonna live alone. I also don't miss my father who passed away 2 years ago. I miss how he made me feel but not him as a person. I lack a sense of self. I don't know who I am. I don't care about other people. Sometimes I think that Is death the only way out ?I want to know that what is there in bhagwad geeta or any hindu scriptures for toxic/narcissistic people (or pwnpd to be more specific). I don't believe as such in God at this point but I'm spiritual and agnostic mostly...but I still want to know cuz I feel helpless.What helped you shed your defences of npd ? They no longer serve us now. We need a life of authenticity and vulnerability.Sorry for the post back to back but I feel really scared as I am alone. I tried to heal by being alone sitting in isolation with myself. As this is what I do when I can no longer maintain the relationships in my life. But there's no way out. There's no cure for npd. Only purpose in my life is seeking 'supply'. I hate how stigmatised it is but it's the TRUTH. I ended up so miserably only because of my mother. I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive her for this. I am really insecurely attached to her and feel only resentment and anger towards her. I also have a younger brother who is the only family I'm close too. I share my nothingness with him. He's perfectly healthy and even I try to keep the relationship healthy. Yk what I mean.I don't know. My inner child is scared, hiding in a corner. I just want unconditional love. That's a need. And emotional support. That's it. Is it too much to ask for ? Does a child does not deserve it ? Sometimes I think Can I somehow go in the past and change what had happened to me. I self harmed myself by neglecting myself and my needs and my self-care as a result of being neglected by my mom. There's no purpose. No inner drive. No motivation. Negative feelings (a lot). Depression. Anxiety. And it's getting worse and worse. Idk why I feel that it's gonna be even worse when I grow elder. Who knows. Idk I'm helpless. I don't have the courage to kms. I don't have the purpose and motivation to live. I thought that I had a good childhood. But I was wrong. It was hella traumatic for me. It seemed to be good from the outside but nobody really cared how I felt, what I did, apart from being objectified from my caregiver. I am still grieving my childhood. I wanna be a child again. I wanna be loved unconditionally, cared for, nurtured and just feel enough. Ok so I feel ashamed of seeking support now lol...can anybody be friends with me ?? You'll see a completely raw side of me and if I behave in a bad way pls feel free to correct me on my behaviour. Im sick of pretending but it's a part of the disorder. Fuck.I never want my caregiver/parent figure to abandon/leave me. This is my biggest fear. Also the fear of death. I never got emotionally supported enough in the childhood and lack an identity. Therefore I neglect myself and mould myself into whatever I can to get the love, validation, attention and admiration I may have bpd comorbid with npd. Anybody relate ?. I need a friend desperately with whom I can share my struggles and relate with. Can anybody pls be one ? It's so difficult to manage all these things. Pls reach out to me. Don't just upvote it boosts my ego :). Help. I'm so fuckin anxious. I don't think I'll ever be able to know my true self. The only thing I can do is to dissociate myself through hobbies like reading/music/watching something. I'm stuck with this disorder for life foreverI don't have a sense of self or personality. There are big gaps in my memory and trouble processing. I don't care about anyone. This is the truth. Ill never have a stable personality of my own. I always mirror other people. I don't have a sense of identity. I lack it completely. How can I love someone or someone can love me when theres no me ??? Pls don't tell me that it's burried inside me it's there. No use. I can't access it no matter what. Has anybody ever been cured from npd ?? Don't tell that it can be 'managed' or 'treated'. Ill never know the real me either ways. I'm going insane. I'm only 16. Pls don't tell me that you don't have npd. I'm so good at masking that nobody knows me. Everybody thinks that I'm fine but Im going insane avd suffering in silence. Being alone for life sounds scary, and never being able to meet yourself sounds even more scary. It's better to be dead than this shit.Everyday i wake up and see npd impacting my life. Every thing. Relationships being the most important. Relationships are the key to happiness. How the fuck am I supposed to be happy without ever being feeling connected to someone. I can't be cured and this is the truth.. I was emotionally neglected as a child. And never got consistent emotional support even for once from my original mother/caregiver. I was stunned after watching this video and I don't know how to heal from this.https://youtu.be/xwspmJ2vjCA?si=xDsntdJibBRRvNnL (by sam vaknin) I know that sam vaknin...does not believe we can heal...and even I don't trust it and don't find it helpful to watch his videos as I feel hopeless and demonized and dehumanised. But again that particular video seems so true (atleast without the stigmatising part). I feel very resentful towards my mother and I'm self-pitying and grieving the loss of my childhood. It also feels like I'm blaming my mom for how emotionally 'stunted' I am....idk i also feel helpless now.What the hell. I feel emotionally stuck too like an age 4 child. Completely disconnected and dissociated from myself. Although I can't change what had happened in the past, I don't really know how to deal with the 'mommy issues'. When I confronted my mom about the emotional neglect thing, she said that you have to raise yourself and look after yourself. She doesn't know shit about emotional support. She also said how i am 'stuck' in the past and she started making it about herself and behaved really in an emotionally immature way. She also added how she raised both my younger brother and me in the same way and how my brother did not have any problem with it. Im actually confused too that how my brother had never been emotionally supported too like me by our mother but he ended up perfectly fine and I ended up with a ✨ personality disorder ✨It could be genetics, as I highly suspect that I have inherited this disorder from my grandmother. He might have found emotional support outside the home. He might have met his emotional needs somehow. We had the same parenting. But I ended up feeling immense toxic shame and being an academic (and extracurricular) achiever in school completely neglecting myself and my needs while he didn't feel the shame and actually lived his childhood. Sorry for the long rant...I still don't feel like this is the truth (denial) but it definetely is. I never got the maternal love and felt safe with anybody. I might read the book adult children of emotionally immature parents and the book by John Bradshaw on toxic shame.I wouldn't wish this disorder even on the worst of my enemies. It's horrible. Thanks for listening the long rant.The void is making me cry 😭 is it gonna be there forever ? Scary. I feel nothing. Is my inner child dead ? Am I even a real person ? I don't care about the flair bruh. Never feeling connected to myself or others ? Alone for life ? What did I do to deserve this ? (Rage). Idk if a post like this is allowed here or not ?I'm seeing a lot of angel numbers these days 111, 222, 333, 444, very frequently (nearly daily) now. Its when I don't self-abandon and ignore my needs and work towards my purpose. I'm starting to believe a lot in angel numbers and feel gratitude.I'm also feeling a sense of self worth and a sudden spark of it in me. And it feels so good to achieve that. The work I put in feels so worthy.Also, I am starting to feel more 'normal' now, as I practice mindfulness and judge myself and the people around me lesser. (I still feel depressed, lonely, the void inside me and struggle with naming my feelings etc but the progress feels so good). I'm getting there slowly ✨. Collapsing is when the real healing happens. And I think collapsing again and again is good for healing although its scary lol. So like how can I collapse ? I know its tough- the depression, anxiety, emptiness, not feeling like a real person etc. but I wanna collapse as I have the time to heal as I have a long holiday.Do I completely detach and go into self-reflection. What can I do to make my facade-like identity collapse which is reliant on external validation and approval of others ?.
    Anyone relate?It's like...My mind has this habit of creating some idealised version of myself, and then I delude myself that this is The Real Me.In my mind, I situate this Real Me as different and separate from the False Me. The latter is how I show myself to the world. The former is distinguished as the part or aspect that I don't show, that people don't see, that remains hidden, suppressed, subjugated.But it isn't actually Real. It is a delusion of the mind. A delusion of grandeaur. When the delusion breaks down because it can't and doesn't actually exist in the real world, it's very alarming and confusing....There has - and still can - be a variety of idealised versions. Maybe they somewhat represent parts or qualities I have. But those parts are made *grandiose*: a kind of statue - those parts cast in iron in my mind.The All-Healed Compassionate Nurturer.The Mischievous Imp.The Cheeky Lad.The Narcissist.The Anti-Socialite.So many of these statues I have "become" momentarily.It's not that I don't have some of these aspects. It's just that they become so absolute, so rigid.As I said, I believe I AM them.I feel I've finally found the answer. The solution. The real me. This is it.But it isn't.The reality is so, so, so much more complex and fluid. The reality is that my self - like everyone - is relational and contextual and dynamic. It shifts around subtly depending on the situation....I write this a week after going through what I now think was another delusional phase. I "became" the Narcissist. I was all: Fuck it! This is me! I'm am attention-seeking, power hungry Narcissist, and I'm diving into it. This is it! This is the solution to all my problems. This is who I am.I even showed up in therapy with this attitude.And then?Then I stopped checking myself out in the Zoom camera, realised how I was feeling disconnected from the therapist, went about my daily life TRYING to integrate this Real Narcissist Me into my interactions and relationships, and ... ?It didn't hold up. It couldn't hold up.Because it wasn't real. It was a delusion....The reality was that I went about my days the same as I always do:Trying my best.Feeling my emotions and trying to massage them.Trying to regulate.Trying to get along.Needing to get along.Wanting to do good for others....I just want to be on guard for these kinds of self-delusions.Do you relate?I think I do this unconsciously:I switch between this ideal version of myself and something more real through my day, depending on the context.But it's not a manipulation. It's unconscious. And I not only try to give the impression of being this ideal version, but more freakishly: I also believe it. The blindfold goes down inwards.Then the illusion bursts and I feel much more that real self. Which really fucks me up, because it's so different from the ideal....The "should be" version of me is: something like:- super compassionate - super adult- considerate, conscientious- Nice - friendly - accommodating - other-serving- mega calm- peacemaking, peacekeeping- perfect carer / your best ever therapist vibes- perfect golden Buddha vibes. Om.A more real version of me is:- some of the above, but less intensely or absolutely, and with added:- major grumpiness, irritability, crankiness- extreme mood swings / intense feelings of all kinds, all the time- much more selfish and self-serving- ambitious, competitive, manipulative in order to get ahead or look good- approval and status seeking- mischievous, silly- flamboyant, attention seeking - vain- disagreeable- insolent adolescent vibes- frightened, lonely, sad, frustrated child vibes- shy, sensitive, introspective, wondering chid vibes- imp vibes- naughty wet dog coming in from the garden vibes- horny- ragey...The ideal version feels like a shell. At some point it starts to crack. I feel so anxious around others, that they might see through and know the dodgy bits.It's not that they are bad. It's that I habitually hide them. Unconsciously. Automatically.This is my npd. And I hate it.Presenting as one thing, being another....I write this as a way of trying to shift to that more real version of me, away from that ideal version I "become". This is my task.I love a task!. 😅And other narcissistic thoughts mid-meltdown as I catch myself in the mirror.Are you with me?!...#cutewithremarkableskin 🌈. I need to be silly. That's it. The KEY to ending this cluster b misery.Every time I'm in situations where I can't at least be a lil bit of a silly imp ... I die. I crash. I collapse.It's because that false self that tries to show people that I'm totally healthy and normal and adult ... that mask just becomes so unbearable.If I can't express that side of me, even with a cheeky glint or mischievous elbow wag, I start to implode mentally.Buttt...Living in this adult world - professionalism left, right and centre - having to not be a silly twat... It's so hard! And dull.I have to make sure I don't joke around inappropriately or otherwise I'd be BANISHED and FIRED. The urge to say inappropriate things in public is big, but I don't because everyone would look at me like: WTF!!?? YOU'RE FIRED.But I LOVE to joke and play like a teenage boy, even though I'm 42.WEEEEEEEEEEEE.......REPRESSED.Violins at dawn....I'm BACK and just as childish and world-conqueringly self-centred as I always was (yay).I know this is my emotional wounds popping open and triggering all this, but still..Ugh!I feel totally different to everyone else. I feel massively alien. I feel that if they peer behind the skin they'll see that I'm this defective lizard creature.Being with people is stressful. I feel like I basically have to contain myself massively in order to act normal and adult.Every false move is a give-away that I'm actually a cluster b maniac. STAY AWAYYYYY.STAY AWAYYYYYYY....I hate having to do this work ALL THE TIME.Every day is an opportunity for growth and positive change. Yes. BUT .......It's also bloody hard work.SOBBBBB.. I think I may have reached a point of understanding and forgiveness towards my parents, and a feeling of love towards both of them. And from.Despite everything. Despite all the anger and resentment I've been feeling over the last few years. Decades.This is particularly annoying because it means that a certain person in this community was right about the power of forgiveness. And I hate it when I'm not right. Really annoying.Don't get any funny ideas. ...Last week, I was going through the motions of "having to write to my Dad over email". On my To Do list. Then I saw his own email to me pop up, and I was like: OH FUCK. OFF. I didn't want to read it. A chore. I would have to respond in the false presentation that I'm used to. Because he's a homophobic fool who can't deal with the fact that I'm gay, so we just don't ever talk about my life apart from work.I opened the email thinking: Ugh.I scrolled to the bottom, and there he wrote:Love, Dad....He never writes that. But ... there it was.It actually hit me. It got inside. I didn't want it to. I tried to resist. I dismissed it. Ignored it.But I had to come to terms with that feeling I got from those two words at the end of his email: love, connection, care and warmth. To and from....Later in the week I set up one of our Skype calls. He lives abroad. And it was ... OK. It wasn't hideous. He has his flaws. He gets easily distracted when others speak. But then so do I. Maybe I got that from him. A connection.It felt good. We laughed.I thought: This is my Dad. Alive. Intelligent. Open minded. Hard working. Focused. Caring, actually. Wanting what everyone else wants: love, connection, respect....I visited my Mum today.As usual, I brought the lunch to cook. I hoovered. The carpet had so many crumbs and bits of rubbush. How the fuck did THAT get THERE?But I noticed that I just let it go. I kind of laughed.Compared to the past when I would have boiled over with anger and resentment. Compared to the past when I would have criticised her for this and everything else she did that I didn't like. Liiiiiike .... eating. 🌈 Or ..... breathing loudly. Or ....... falling asleep watching TV.We had quite a good afternoon. Lunch was good. She ate loudly and messily and it didn't fill me so much with irritation. Before: I was a whirlwind of anger over her sloppiness.There was a little bit of it, but I let it go.More, I thought: This is my Mum. Alive. And loving. Silly. Funny. Wanting what everyone else wants: love, connection, respect.Quite innocent, really. Perhaps a bit naive in some aspects of parenting, but with good intentions.She talks a lot about herself. But ... it's not malicious. It's just her thing.Before, for years, I could barely stay in the same room when she started talking about herself. Today it was a little bit panic inducing, but not so bad. I changed the subject.At the end of the afternoon, just now, I went to go back to my place. We had the biggest, best, closest hug. I felt her warmth and care. And I cared for her back.She looked at me and I looked at her. I saw her huge, happy, grateful, caring smile and I allowed it to imprint on my mind. A memory.Healing....Growing up with my parents really fucked me up.Realllllllly. 😅Dad was threatening, drunk, abusive, violent, controlling, narcissistic beyond the beyond.Mum was chaotic, narcissistic, naive, neglectful, abusive, controlling, explosive, a bit bonkers.They argued so much. For most of my childhood. I was this very sensitive child trying to hold the whole house together.Recently I asked my Mum what my childhood was like. Actually, I asked her if it was as chaotic as I describe it to others now. She said it was, and that I was a very anxious child and the peacekeeper of the family, trying to solve everyone's problems and arguments.No wonder I found it so hard to know who I was, who I am. So much energy expended outwards or dealing with the anxiety inside....But ... It is what it is. What it was.It's nice to let it go (the true meaning of the word 'forgive', by the by).It's nice not to have that heaviness. Not to carry that.It's nice to find peace and reconciliation. It's nice to feel seen. It's nice to have that connection now. These memories, now. They are alive: now....This is good, but also annoying because now that means that therapist is doing something good, even though I think she's NOT GOOD ENOUGH and I was thinking of telling her I'M QUITTING.I have therapy tomorrow and It's going to be really annoying when I tell her the good news.I'm staying in therapy. 😅. I went to a birthday dinner the other day and was seated with a bunch of other gay men I didn't know.We chatted about our experiences of growing up gay, and the emotional trauma of being rejected by society. We talked about the inherent shame, of feeling fundamentally flawed and defective.It was interesting to hear them all talk about issues of presenting as a false version of themselves in order to try to fit in. I mentioned the habit of presenting more "masculine" or straight around straight men, and everyone else immediately nodded in agreement.We talked about issues of perfectionism as a way of overcompensating for feeling defective and/or as protective against shame.We also discussed how various forms of grandiosity can emerge from the underlying sense of feeling flawed, as a kind of leaning-into the defectiveness and making it bigger and bolder. Obviously I was leading the discussion. 💅 More obviously, this was not new news for me (because I know everything. I am: AGI 🤖🌈).But it was nonetheless really interesting and HEALING to talk to other gay men about our shared experience of pain, hiding the self and grandiosity. I've heard others talk about the possible increased presence of pathological narcissism in LGBTQ+ communities or populations. I would agree.Growing up gay in a world still inherently scared and rejecting of us is a breeding ground for narcissism....On another homo-note, I am disgusted by the backstep in attitudes and legislation towards LGBTQ+ people in the US, particularly towards trans people.We came so far towards equality and then ... boom: we didn't....But we're here; and we're still queer.Because: ONCE YOU'RE INFECTED ... 😅with our "DISEASE " ...🙄...I live in the UK where Trump and his bro-cronies have some influence.I sincerely hope they come over here so we can protest like only Brits can. With a giant Trump Blimp!! ...My protest sign will say:EVERYONE'S A LITTLE BIT TRANS. 🏳️‍🌈. This is my experience of npd. What's yours?...It's be the best or go bust.It's go large or go home.It's they go high, You Go Higher.It's gimme that gold medal or I'm going to kill myself....It's over-achieving and it never being enough.It's pushing myself to oblivion....It's slumps into suicidal ideation over the slightest error or lack of attention.It's the shower water pouring over me and not being able to move. It's trying to give myself hug and nothing shifts the pain underneath.It's walking out the shower and smiling and telling my partner and then myself that everything's fine....It's : I'm healed! ...It's every day a thousand different emotional states.It's chaos.It's a rollercoaster....It's going outside or interacting with any other person and instantly Trying to Fit In and Look Normal. It's habitually feeling inferior, judged, trapped, limited, unheard.It's automatically working to prove, show, demonstrate my worth and value.It's simultaneously wanting to connect with people and seriously mistrusting them.It's thinking they can see right through you and trying all the time to cover up....It's hiding the turmoil of my feelings.It's analysing my every move in case I fucked up and revealed the mess below the surface.It's a Total Performance Artwork.It's not relaxing, ever, lest I slip up.It's being whatever I think people want to see.It's consciously borrowing what "Normal people do".It's not having a clue who I am.It's constantly telling me that I'm a piece of shit....It's everything catastrophic could happen to me.It's everything's going to be alright as long as I have my abs.It's wasting hours and hours of my life trying to gain said abs.Just. Out of. Reach....It's suddenly feeling like I'm the greatest thing ever.It's totally idolising myself.It's being turned on by the thrill of my achievements or the way I look.It's loving my abs!!!!It's suddenly not giving a shit about anyone else.It's feeling intense contempt or irritation towards others for their faults or for critiquing or doing anything that disturbs my mask of perfection....It's thinking that something is a really good idea and going for it whole hog.It's suddenly realising what a terrible - and embarrassing - idea that was after all and spiralling into anxiety and shame and delete delete delete....It's hilarious.It's brilliant.It's fantastic.It makes me special.It's so stupid. It's so silly.It has me laughing till I cry.It's a mischief.It's funny....It's ingrained.It's in every cell (including my precious abs). 🤘🏻It's trying to erase and wash it off but it won't go away....It's lonely.It's feeling it's something no one understands, not even my therapist or any other pwNPD....It's still here. I'm still here.It's one day at a time.It's getting better in some ways.It's not getting better in others.. I wonder if this is a core reflex in my daily life: I feel constantly under pressure to grow, improve, show mastery, be free of flaws and mistakes, show up well, perfectly...I had a bad week in various respects. OK, not wholly. But I seriously went into work overdrive in the first half of the week, and really pushed myself way beyond what is healthy for my body. Again. It was really scary how ill I felt from the over-exersion. I can't live like this. Literally, my body not tolerate this level of exersion.It seems so easy and so unconscious to get like this. I am so automatically watching for signals from others that I've fallen short or am doing well. My sense of not only self-worth but basic sense of existence is often - always?? - grounded in what other people think of me....If someone sets a bar, I will push myself so hard to reach it and go beyond.A friend once described people in terms of horses and mules. Horses stop when they're tired. Mules don't. They go until they drop dead.I don't care if that's not zoological reality. I can really be a mule.I need to be a horse....Has anyone else managed to make this kind of shift from self-obliterating striving to balance and knowing - and keeping within - your limits?. When I perceive that other people are doing things that I don't like, and I find myself getting into an intense rage, I need to pause and look inwards to the underlying and historical pain rather than express that rage at them.When people do things that I feel are inconsiderate, lacking in empathy, unfair, unjust to me, or sabotaging or limiting my freedom, my identity, my status, my sense of belonging, or making an intrusion ... When I feel that "other people are making me feel" humiliated, inadequate, less-inferior, unseen, invisible, cast out, rejected, unacknowledged, invalidated ... When I feel anger and rage in response to any of this, I need to explore the associated memories from childhood and find a way to be with, tolerate and comfort the wounded parts of me that are behind the rage and anger. I need to allow the rage to dissipate and shift into sorrow for those past wounds, and hope and energy for more healthy and stable expressions going forward....Please feel free to amend. I've been struggling with intense rage this week and I'm trying to do something about it.I've been watching this Heal NPD episode on narcissistic rage on a loop. I can see myself in many parts of it.https://youtu.be/MAK0ZUOuZ3U?si=YPXgBC1iabSY7ZpPI wrote out the above message to myself as a way to try to consolidate some of the strategies being suggested in this episode for managing and processing rage.I'm on a short holiday with my partner and friends, a couple we know from our neighbourhood.We've known them for about ten years or so.This is the first time I've been with them for an extended period and felt happy, at ease and able to get along with them. Prior to that, and stretching back to when we first met, there was more and more paranoia, hostility, jealousy, and anxiety around and towards not only this particular couple, but really everyone.So sitting with them, feeling confortable to talk about all sorts of things, getting on well and having that sense of friendship and respect is really striking to me.It's another sign of how this past year of intense therapy and several years of self-work have helped me so much.Yes, it's yet another recovery post. 🌈 Soz! But this experience feels significant, and I want to mark it. I don't mean to be grandiose about it, and I'm still up and down and have my dysfunctional habits. But I also hope it's helpful for anyone here....Thinking about friendships in general, I've had so much intense antagonism towards so many friends over the years. At one point, probably my late 20s / early 30s, I had pretty much cut off everyone, or was just using their friendship in a transactional way. Or, they were friends of my partner, so I **had** to be around them. I would fairly openly talk down about his friends, or find ways to limit how much we saw them. When my partner went out on his own with them, I would get very paranoid, jealous and angry. If he stayed out late, I would get intensely enraged and ruminate uncontrollably about how they were "leading him astray" or that they were talking about me behind my back. If he was late, I would call him repeatedly to see when he was coming home. I would be furious that "he was keeping me awake" by being out late. If he didn't pick up, I'd call his friends, of course putting on a quiet, light tone of enquiry to disguise my temper.My partner has always been very sociable, and would organise frequent dinners and trips for us together with friends. There were so many evenings when I would be seething at the dinner table with people: when they talked "too much", or "didn't ask me about me!" or when my partner got overt attention or praise from them. Just: seething.There were so many weekends visiting people with me absolutely boiling with jealousy, irritability, anger, competition, all the while trying to hide my hostility and - lol - trying to come across to the friends as the "better partner" in order to "win" against him.We would go on holiday with people and I would often have extreme tantrums and blow-ups, not in front of the friends themselves but embarrassingly close in terms of earshot. I would get enraged over such tiny things: what my partner was making for dinner that "wasn't right for me"; whether we were "doing too much" or "being too generous" to others. Of course, after my rage had past, if then turned into paranoia about people hearing me like that. I would try to pretend that nothing had happened.Or ... I would triangulate to try to get the friends to be on "my side" of the argument, putting my partner down.Or ...I would go into a cultivated semi-catatonic state, where I would be very withdrawn, sullen and blank around people. If they asked what was wrong, I would just stare or say "nothing".This is all true. This is absolutely how I behaved. It's hard to describe how often I was in such a terrible state around people. Writing this out now, I'm just like: Wow! I WAS SO DISORDERED! It's both terrifying and embarrassing and funny in a kind of "what the flying fuck!" kind of way. Jeez!I've said this before, but at one point I found out from my partner that his friends had commented to him that I "wasn't worth it". Of course, I was so angry to hear that, but it was actually one of the catalysts that gradually nudged me towards doing more and more self-work to change my behaviours. This was all quite a few years before I knew anything about NPD.My partner also has his own dysfunctional traits, but nothing like this. Nowhere near. Writing this out, I feel sorry for him. ://I'm lucky that - somehow - we stuck together. Just ... lucky....Things started grafually improving a few years ago. People have commented to me many times over the years how they've seen positive changes in me. It's both good and a little embarrassing that it was so obviously bad in the past. But I just try to look for the positives. Of course, at one point I totally got grandiose about my progress and thought I was A Great Person. I couldn't wait to "show off" my New Personality to people. Oh my...Then I crashed again once that delusion broke.But it wasn't totally delusional. There had been some positive shifts....Therapy this year seems to have helped no end. It's really accelerated the recovery and got me into a more levelheaded state.One year ago we were living with a friend while our house was veing renovated. Even then, I had so many evenings barely containing my hostile mood towards this guy, who was very generous and helpful to us.He's actually a very nice man. I just found his positivity and friendliness annoying. I would have silent tantrums in the hallway while everyone was in the kitchen, just to get rid of my anger. Oh my god.I still sometimes find this guy a bit annoying with his overly rosy worldview, but ... I'm also much more able to say to myself, "Hey. Come on. He's good guy. Stop fixating on the negatives (that aren't really negative). Just ... see the bigger picture here." Then I'm much better at relaxing and enjoying his company.And generally I am genuinely getting along so much better with people. I can feel the positive changes - and I try to steer away from grandiosity about it. I feel so much more able to enjoy other people's company, and be part of the group. I don't need to hog the attention. I don't compete with my partner. I ...I don't do any of those behaviours I described above.OK. That's actually not quite true. I can still feel that old antagonism around people, but I am more able to let it go.Also, the other day I did go into one of those withdrawn sulks around friends. But ... I pulled myself out of it. Jeez: it was really tricky to do in the moment, but I did it and turned the day around for myself as best I could. It wasn't perfect, but it was a good step in the right direction....Anyway, look:Therapy has helped. I don't know quite how or why, but it's got rid of the hostility over time. The anxiety and extreme mood swings have also diminished.I was a wreck. I was very difficult. I was a bit of a dick. A snob. A raging snob. Ugh....Ten Years Later...I am able to know myself much more, express myself well, be with people and appreciate them. I'm building friendships. I'm changing the way I come across for the better. Day by day. My life is turning around.Writing this has, to say it again, been a bit alarming. Because that really was me. I'm just gonna sit for a bit now and contemplate that journey. Just sit and be quiet for a while.I feel sad that so much of my life was spent like this. I kind of just want to feel that sadness for a bit. It encourages me to continue the work. In an hour we are meeting up with our friends again and going out for the evening. I'm looking forward to it. Another step in a good direction.I'm also gonna give my partner a hug.. This is one of the criteria for BPD, but it's something I've always experienced. Even after all the self-work and therapy, my moods (and related urges to act or behave) can flip around intensely through the day. Today I've felt very: calm, bored, restless, agitated, manic, numbed-out / dissociated, sad, angry / enraged, and now a bit frazzled again as I write this. It's a lot to contend with.Affective instability is one of the criteria of a BPD diagnosis, but this and identity diffusion are really the only ones I relate to. I know that NPD and BPD overlap, and that the criteria are problematic or questionable.But I do wonder who else who identifies more with NPD experiences this symptom.Has anyone out there recovered to such a degree that you've become stable in your moods?I work hard to regulate my mood changes so that they don't effect other people. It's challenging, and although I'm much better at it on the outside, the inside can still be quite wild. It's also not great for my physical health to experience such extremes of emotion, I think / worry.Just curious about other people's experience and any suggestions that come to mind.My parents are still alive, but I feel like an emotional orphan.Have I ever been a real child yo my parents? Or, have I merely been their need-gratifying machine?...I try to connect with them both. It is a range of things: limited, inconsistent, fruitless, painful.I rang my Dad on Christmas Eve. On hearing his voice, I felt a fulfilling connection. But quickly the conversation turned into him talking to me about his interests and thoughts - including a fairly lengthy detour onto his tax accounts. I went into my obliging listener mode: showing up "nice and happy" but feeling emotionally detached and invisible. It's so hard to get one word in. Again. Same old. Same old.My Mum is staying with us. I try to give her hugs. I feel for her own pain and anxieties. I reach out but she is really limited in her welcome. She frequently cuts me down or complains in one way or another. She pushes me away. I show up as the obliging son. Once more....It is painful to reach to your caregivers and find a lack of reciprocity, mutuality.I am trying to allow the pain of the disconnection to have space in my body and mind. I have been crying. I want to let it flow. Console. Mourn. Grief. Loss.I notice I still have a fair amount of dysfunction around my sense of agency in my life.I notice I frequently feel "powerless" to get my needs met in relationships.Other people are "trapping me" or "inhibiting me". "If it weren't for them, I'd be free. I'd be myself."That kind of vibe.In response to this underlying assumption, I notice I habitually give-in or yield to the situation I've just formed in my mind:"Oh well. There's no hope."That comes with huge anger, sometimes rage, and chronic hostility towards other people.In response, I socially withdraw. I feel sulky. I numb out. All of these modes play multi-functional roles of shutting down the felt pain inside, but also passively-aggressively trying to either signal to other people that I'm suffering (in a victim-like way), or trying to bring them down to my low.I can pull myself out of these states more easily now, but they are still there as reflexes.Alternatively, I can react with overt anger and even aggression - which obviously doesn't go down well or help me in the longer term....Another response to feeling powerless is the tendency to "wedge-in" my need-meeting into my life, but in ways that keep me feeling trapped, and not breaking the interpersonal patterns.I get up very early to be on my own for a few hours and have "me time." I workout and look in the mirror, admiring myself. It gives me that impression of "being seen". But I'm not actually being seen.It also gives me that feeling of being powerful, in fact: omnipotent. I feel invincible in that mirror. I dance. I lift. I push. I am strong and graceful. I am brilliant. Beautiful. Powerful.Anything's possible.People then wake up and I stop my routine. I put everything away and switch to showing-up in ways that I think are acceptable for the other person. I put on music they would like. I make them coffee. I sot and talk with them about what they want to talk about.This is all very "nice" of me, but the chronic nature of these patterns means I am habitually negating self-expression of really any kind.Again, my mind turns to: "Oh well. Happy hour is over. Time to hide. Time to serve the other person. I have no choice."I feel unseen, invisible, and angry that the other person is "making me do this."...There are other ways in which this pattern plays out. I often feel intruded upon, dominated, crushed, invisible, denied of my needs and preferences.Now, I have parents who have very strong wills. My Mum also frequently shuts me down or criticises me for expressing myself. At the same time, I find her very intrusive and overbearing with her own opinions. When she does this, like she literally did just now as I was writing this, I feel both intense rage as well as hopelessness. "There's no point even trying to contradict her because she presents so much as invulnerable."She is rarely 'wrong'. Instead, she presents herself as an authority in most aspects of life, and expresses this through some pretty harsh put-downs and dismissals.The painful roots of my problem, right there. Something for deeper exploration in therapy....I also partnered with a person who is a really strong character, who has his own anxieties about his place in the world, but who tends to just take the limelight when he wants it. He also has a short fuse and interrupts me and shuts me down. Again, he has that habit of shutting people down - not just me - when he doesn't like something they say or do. I think he jumps to a lot of conclusions about what people are going to say, which leads him to snap at people. We fit together like a lock and key in some dysfunctional ways: he tends to just share and lead and be loud and fast to get his needs met. I tend to hide, can't be bothered, or go quietly resentful, and then feel bitter about him "dominating me".I noticed this yesterday during Christmas lunch. He played some music he liked and really loudly. He started talking about it to the group, how much he loved it etc.I noticed myself getting really angry and feeling resentful about "how hard it is to live with someone who dominates so much and leaves no room for me."I quickly said to everyone that I was going for a bike ride. At the time, it was a reaction to feeling trapped "by him". Out on the road, I found myself ruminating angrily about him. It took a while, but I gradually tried to shift my perspective to see the patterns I've described above in myself: feeling like a doormat, not bothering, but instead feeling chronically bitter about my "lack of freedom"....Now, living with a strong-willed partner and dismissive mother, there is actually evidence to support my feelings. But I must try not to fall into that internal, resentful ruminating. It doesn't achieve much.Instead, I need to shift my stance and enjoy my life.This is my life. I'm with other people, yes. But I'm already considerate and other-seving **enough**. I feel I could do with being more assertive.I **do** have agency. I **can** express myself.I need to try to weave in that self-expression more into my days when I'm with people so that I get my needs for autonomy and self-expression met in relation to others. I need to do this in balance with giving space for others to get their needs met. If people do genuinely shut me down, then I need to turn towards joyful expression despite their dismissals. That is their dysfunction, and I can't change it. But I can still do or say what I think is true snd right for me, in a respectful way.I need to not hide away but put myself out in the open.I do it here, in a post. But that's easy. That's actually still hiding.I need to do it in real life as well....At the same time, I can't ignore the pain of not feeling appreciated or seen in childhood and in the present.I can't whitewash over those feelings and those wounds with positive perspectives.Over-positivity is another form of dismissal. It really pisses me off.There is a pain that needs tending to. Grieving. Mourning.The pain of those emotional wounds.Someone commented on a post of mine from almost a year ago, before therapy started.I re-read the post and was startled to see how much I was suffering at the time, and how different I feel now: much more stable and self assured.Here is the post itself:**Constantly Seeking the Approval of Others**https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/s/6aKDSyRcl9I replied to the comment saying that I don't relate to the post. I mean, it now feels weird that I would ever worry so much about what people think. But I really was like that....I was curious about any other differences i noticed between older posts and now.Again, I was startled, even a bit shocked to see how much I was suffering.Two of the posts I read were:**Noise**https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/s/gh1RzTQQGiand**Pushing Myself to Absolute Exhaustion**https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/s/Kj7AwXnNUiMy mind was fractured, like speeding through AM Radio stations, catching glimpses of voices and white noise.I was frequently pushing my body beyond physical limits to try to reach impossible standards while neglecting my health.I don't feel like that and I don't do that any more. I can still feel elements, but my self-care is a lot better so I don't get to that crazy place any more.Obviously now I'll jinx it and be in intensive care tomorrow. 🌈...I've done a fair few posts detailing recovery.In the past, I definitely (but unconsciously) did this for supply.Look at meeeeee!Look how healed I am!When I joined the sub 2.bit years ago, I was like: Wow. I'm already healed. Time to teach n' lead. Show my lil peanut pups The Way of The Nut.But obviously that mask crashed - several times and I gradually realised how fucked up I was underneath.Sometimes talking about recovery progress still feels a bit cringe to me because I think it gives off those same attention-seeking, grandiose vibes, or that part of me that gets grandiose about Being Healed is still there. So I do have to watch it.But ... Looking back at those and other posts from before therapy, there really HAS been a positive change. I am sharing it to note it for myself but also to reiterate that it's possible for other people who are struggling. If that's cringe, so be it. It's interesting how things have changed....I think "The Work" of therapy has not been so much about "trying to do the right thing" or "be a better person".Instead, it has been about gradually opening up, revealing and expressing a LOT of trauma to the therapist. I have also gradually shared more of my parts so that I feel more "seen" and more able to accept these parts as aspects of who I am. My rebelliousness, my kindness, my cuntiness, my sensitivity, my compassion, my aloofness, my sorrow and grief, my rage. Rage. Rage. Rage. Lots of rage.The Work has also been about gradually trusting another person and feeling care from them. I still have that mistrust of her, but I am now talking about it more openly and calmly. The Work continues. There is a lot of trauma and a lot of rage to work through. But ... I am in a better place.I'm like a naughty dog who's been highly trained to be obedient and "good".Deep down, I'm still a bit of a dog....Family Christmas. Started on the 22nd, ends 28th.I was really dreading this all year, fearing tension and arguments.But I feel it's going to be alright, actually....I notice I play the role of the helper to everyone. Fetching this. Finding that. Running here. Joining the dots. Making things work. And it's ok. My motivation is not that I particularly want to do these things out of joy or interest. It's more that I feel strongly that I "should". So the helping is a bit of a chore, but ... I do it.The house looks so ordered, by the by. Makes me a little high....It irritates / infuriates me that people are forever asking me where something is or to help them with this or that. But I try not to show my negativity.On the Inside, I'm like:WHY ARE YOU SO DUMB!?!!!?? CAN'T YOU DO THIS YOURSELF!????!!!!?But I'm also like:Chill. Chill. It's not so bad. And you're helping. You're making it nice for others.No arguing. No harsh blurts or put downs or tantrums. I mean: yet. But I don't imagine they'll be any, actually. Not from me....I had this idea the other day of trying to behave in ways that are for the greater good, and it really resonated with me for the first time. At 42. Oops.I play the role of "being nice" when I'm not feeling that way. I say the right things, even if I don't feel them.Calm, encouraging, supportive on the outside. On the Inside: all sorts of acceptable but also tricky feelings and thoughts. Antagonism. Hostility. Irritation. But for the first time, I've been not like: Fuck! What if everyone realises I'm a bad person underneath! But more like: I know I have all these antagonistic parts. And that's ok. I can just manage them so they don't hurt people.So... I *have* been showing up "well" and "nice" like my false self. But ... it feels functional rather than desperate.I do try to show a little of my authentic wanky bits in appropriate ways. Jokes etc.But I can't display those parts too much. When I do, I get chastised for going overboard.Fairly socially conservative family etc. Still. I'm not that bothered. I am authentic as I feel I can be right now....Other things I notice:I notice myself catching people smiling and laughing and then thinking to myself: These are my future memories. I want to cherish them.A pang goes off in my chest. I feel warmth and joy for other people. Sympathic joy.That's not new. But ... it feels nice.So I'm not all bad. I know that. This is not a new thought either.Good boy.I am a good boy. Or a part of me is....This sub is important for me.I'm here for many reasons. One is to express the less socially agreeable parts somewhere: the antagonism, the narcissism. I use this space to revel in it, even.I love a good NPD meme. Makes me smirk.I glance in the mirror and smile a devilfish grin.Then I go back downstairs and join in with the family and get along.Good memories in the making. I hope. I think so.What a weird mix. But ... it feels ok....I don't think this is me "recovered". I would actually like to be more authentic with people. Work to do.But ... it's a good stop on the path. Good enough to make a happy Christmas overall.I dunno. I'm just spilling.. The false self mask that I put up - or tried to put up - for most of my life was very much this happy, agreeable character. It hid a whirlwind of conflicting emotions and disagreeableness underneath, and was hard to maintain. Nonetheless, I believed strongly that I 'should' hold this happy face up to hide my inner turmoil and negativity. It was and continues to be a particular struggle situations where that social mask is almost 'required'. Those middle-class dinner parties have posed a special challenge. Trying to uphold that facade while sitting at a table for hours on end, all the while getting triggered literally left, right and centre....Further back in the recovery journey, I was very much invested in hiding my 'bad parts' (only for them to explode out in unfortunate ways). Through therapy, I find myself in a slightly different scenario. I now appreciate more of my whole self, including the normatively regarded socially less acceptable parts. My grumpy parts, my spiky parts and grouchy parts, my irritable parts.It's not that I want to particularly revel in these traits - anymore. I've been through a stage in my recovery of leaning-in to the 'dark sides' perhaps a bit too heavily.Instead, I do try to channel these negative feelings into something more prosocial. But I don't think I'm quite as adept as the (seemingly) more healthy people I observe around me.I notice that they may share their grievances and frustrations, but it's done in a way that very much leans to the positive, such as 'making the most of the opportunity', thinking resourcefully and so on.As a result, I can see how they all get along with one another relatively effortlessly. The difficult parts are aired, but through a strong positive filter....I can see that this has many benefits. But I also find it very triggering, still. It really rattles me, and then awakens a feeling of shame around my own irritability and negativity.I feel 'bad' or 'less than' for being a bit of a grump, or for openly sharing my frustrations in a more dramatic manner.At the same time, I feel irritated by the other person's "lack of wholeness". Their positive social mask, which I see as really helping them in their relationships and work, feels fake to me. I have a strong aversion to joining in with that positive spin on life. I spent so much of it trying to hold myself up behind a thick fake wall of Being Nice. I just don't want to go there.Instead I want to be what many of us do: real.Through therapy I've found that the real me is a mixture of things, good and bad, ugly and pretty, adaptive and maladaptive, that I enjoy as part of my whole humanity.I suppose I have to accept that people have different coping mechanisms, and that I need to respect how others choose to behave.But ... I can tell you ... I really thrive in social situations where I can show up as more my whole self, grumpy bits and all....I don't know what's right or wrong here, or how 'recovered' or not I am. I'm just spilling and wondering.. The recent advances in AI have led me to appreciate and enjoy my humanity - and humanity in general - so much more. In turn, it has also helped with some aspects of my narcissism.Yes, I have been worried like the rest of us about the extent to which AI might undermine human capabilities.But probably more than that, for me it's shone a brighter light on the question of what it means to be human and helped me to appreciate those things very much more.Namely, it's our flawed nature that I have come to enjoy and even savour. While a computer can spill out seemingly perfect content and communication in an instant, humans have to take a lot of time, overcome all sorts of physical, mental, emotional and social challenges to produce that content or express ourselves clearly, and can make many more obvious errors in what we produce.Ok, yes, computers make mistakes. But to err at the level we do really is to be human....In turn, this appreciation of our innate flaws and capacity to make mistakes and errors has helped resolve aspects of my own pathological narcissism to do with achievement, performance and perfection.I already cannot compete with a lot of what AI can do or will inevitably be able to do in terms of producing content of any sort.I try to be coherent and clear in my posts, for example, but inevitably I will miss things or won't make myself as clear as I would like. My sentences contain miztakes. My memory is limited and I forget some if the key points I want to make. After a while, I fatigue. It becomes harder to continue, and more flaws" and inconsistencies creep in as my mind wonders and my cognitive capacity deteriorates.When generative AI first came to my attention, I had the idea that I - and we - would need to learn to "out do" or "out smart" the technology. We would need to show up as more brilliant and perfect than AI to survive in this content-driven world.But quickly, I began to see the flatness of AI produced content. It dazzles for a moment but then becomes boring to me - because a computer did it, not a human. If a human had done it, I know it would have taken huge effort and that that person would gave had to overcome considerable limitations and challenges. Furthermore, there is a human behind the human content, with a unique history and memories and feelings and associations, all of which not only interest me, but allow me to feel emotionally invested and connected to that imagined person. That person who wrote the post, wrote the email, wrote the music, produced the film and so on.All of this has helped me to relax regarding my own flaws and mistakes. I am, after all, only human. It has also motivated me in regard to the content I produce for work and online. When I come up against struggles and challenges, or if I flail at my tasks, I know that these are inevitable because of my humanity. But seeing other people overcome these challenges to reach their goals, I admire and respect what they have achieved so much more. It inspires me to pick myself up when i've gone off the rails, to continue in my pursuits despite my innate limitations and blocks, and to try to overcome as many of the hurdles that come my way.Yes, I could use AI to help me in the content I create. I think it's helpful in doing some of the background work. However, personally, after using it to create content and then ditching it, I now know that I want the things I put out to be from me, and for people to know that it came from me: a flawed, conflicted human with a lot of day-to-day challenges and limitations....As it turns out, perfect presentation isn't everything.AI is amazing but ultimately dull to me.It's much more engaging to interact with humans, with all our cracks and slips and inherent difficulties....This helps me relax and appreciate my life, the people I meet, mine and other people's experiences, and our communication, warts and all.In short, I doesn't matter if I slip up. I will! I'm huma.n But I can still give life a good go.I'm not sure if I made myself entirely clear, but I'm tired now and can't be bothered to continue. That's good enough for now.This came up in therapy today.We talked about the disconnection both I and my therapist feel in the therapy relationship at times.We both agreed that there can sometimes be a strong connection between us, but that it can waver and suddenly fall apart.It happened all in one session today. Very rapid shifts from one extreme to another.This has been the case all along in therapy, but it is good to talk about it. I have "nearly quit" / "nearly thrown my laptop across the room out of rage from what the therapist has said" quite a few times. But then later I have felt real care from amd then towards the therapist. As we finished today, I said I felt a strong connection. She said she did too.It felt good. But also icky....During the session, she commented that she wondered that because I hadn't experienced much healthy connection as a child, that this had formed the template for my engagements with ... everyone.It does.I do. I do find it hard to connect for very long. I like it and then I don't. It feels scary. The thing is, the more people push to get to know me, the more I can run away and shut down. Just ... be patient with me. I'm struggling. I have a really strong wall that comes up.I used to think I was very trusting. But I'm also realising I am ... not so mistrustful but ... uneasy with my boundaries and getting close to people.It's both. I leap right in and then jump right back out.I don't know how to manage it all very well. But I want to try. I guess....I'm so back right now. I'm trying.I listened again just now to the PD Raw podcast for NPD Awareness I was on with several others back in July of this year.Since that time, I've continued quite intense therapy and have been telling people how transformational it has been for me.So it's a mixture of interesting, alarming and funny to listen back to myself six months ago and find that my description of my inner experience was very similar to how I understand my life now. I'm fact, it even seems I had a slightly better grasp of my predicament than I do now.HAS NOTHING CHANGED???? WAS ALL THIS THERAPY JUST POINTLESS????...I've written many times about positive changes, so I won't do that again.Because it's also helpful to see a kind of stability in myself over this time.Stability in instability. My brain is still very wild. I'm still fragile and delicate. I still flip through so many different moods every day. I still use some of the same coping mechanisms to try to help myself....It was interesting, though, to listen again to that podcast. Because this time I actually listened!The first time a) my mood swings were so intense that I found it hard to concentrate, and b) I was so competitive and envious of everyone rlse on the episode, and spent much of the time silently anxious that I "didn't belong" and being annoyed by other people's responses.So ... lol ... That's nice that I could actually pay attention and ... I learnt quite a few things from the others on the show. So ... Thanks! ;)...It's cool. I really don't have or want to have that grandiosity like I had or did before. Go therapy!. My therapy experience yesterday has left me feeling transparent.Literally, I feel see-through. But not invisible.What I mean is: I have a much stronger feeling of who I am, and who I am not. It's like I'm transparent right to that real part or parts now. When I start faking it in one way or another, I can tell now that it's not me. Much more easily. If feels like those false parts are floating ahead of me, and I'm trying them on for a moment. But I now they are not really me....This is both incredible but also scary. Because now I can't fake my way through life.That's good. But when I see and know just how much false-self was / is happening day-to-day, it's a bit disturbing.I wonder what people will think when I show up as me. Will they like me? It still feels like I'm asking that.But ... it's also like: tough luck. Because I can't do that false self stuff anymore.Oh dear. And whoopee....The false self is really selves. It's been my protective armour, hiding who I really am underneath.That armour manifests through my entire presentation.It's been like wearing the broken pieces of a giant mirror, each fragment reflecting back to a different person - literally everyone - how I want them to perceive me, based on how I perceived them. I've basically been mirroring everyone, including my family and partner.It's there in the way I speak, the tone of my voice, the language I use, my style of speech...... in my way of walking, my choice of clothes, the gestures I make, my movements ...... and in how I show up to people in all manner of ways....Suddenly knowing that there have been a lot of false selves showing up, even up to today and continuing ... it's embarrassing and a bit mind boggling. And there's grief for having covered up so much.But I also now have that clear view to who I feel I really am at the core. There's no hiding anymore. I feel see-through. Transparent.By the way, I also see how that true me has really been there all along, hiding from me in plain sight. I'm pretty sure other people saw it too. It was just me who ran away. It was me who learbt to hate that part and so tried to cover it up by mirroring people or copying or fantasising about who I could be....So now I need to let go of those false presentations and ... speak like I naturally speak, move like I naturally move, do what I would naturally do.No funny business.I just need to do that and work out - maybe for the first time - what feels natural and what doesn't.Scary. But necessary. And now: inevitable. No turning back.I can't unsee it....This morning, on my bike, I gestured to a driver, thanking him for letting me pass.And it felt like I was saying, "This is me" rather than "This is the person I think you want me to be" - out of fear of showing up in a natural, spontaneous way. The fear of rejection. Humiliation. Shame. Banishment. That simple little move. Me in a hand-wave. I felt it.When I was a child, like many people here, I was caught in the middle of my parents' arguments, sometimes their violence. I was the diplomat, mediator, conflict resolver, peacemaker. Aged ... 7, 8, 9? Something like that. ... Today I've been reflecting on how maybe the traces of that past play out in my mind day to day. I often find I am caught between two - or multiple - pressures around what I 'should' or 'should not' be doing. Or even just thinking or feeling. ... Schema Therapy detour: I've been really into Schema Therapy for a few years, and now in treatment for almost all of this year. One thing I like about it is how it helps to 'map out' the different parts of ourselves (or 'modes'). For me, this mapping allows me to see and understand my parts more clearly, and attend to them or respond generally in more adaptive or healthy ways (or through the so-called Healthy Adult mode). In the ST model of NPD, it is said that we can have a very strong Demanding Parent mode. This is the internal helicopter or pushy 'parent' in our minds, telling us what we 'should' or 'should not' be doing. To a certain degree, this is normal and adaptive. But the Demanding Parent mode is really over-the-top. It is 'Over-Demanding', relentless and omnipresent. In response to this, we can experience a sense of pressure and anxiety. Our so-called 'Vulnerable Child' mode is being tormented by the Demanding Parent inside. One way we can cope with this is to flip into an Overcontroller mode. This is seen as a common response for pwNPD, and I definitely relate. In that Overcontroller mode, we try to live up to the standards of the Demanding Parent. We go to the nth degree. We push ourselves. We try hard. We show up 'well'. We are Overly Nice. Compassionate. Hard Working. Achieving. Beautiful. Successful. The best. When we reach the targets set by the Demanding Parent, we might get that high - which I would associate with a combination of a Self-Aggrandiser mode, and a 'Detached Self-Soother' mode (which can similarly be seen in addictive behaviours). We've reached that pinnacle. We are The Best. And it feels so bloody good. It's also a world away from the pressure and anxiety of the Vulnerable Child, which is still there underneath. ... What I see, though, is that most of the time, I don't reach that high. Instead, especially when I'm working from home, or on my own for any length, or just trying to make decisions for myself, I can be quite locked-in to an Overcontroller mode. I haven't *quite* reached the goal, and the stress of feeling that internal pressure and anxiety about what I 'should' be doing is pretty strong. I'm wondering if the Overcontroller can be a default mode of mine, to be honest. ... But, getting to the point of this post, I've been wondering if, like when I was a child, I might have two - or multiple - Demanding Parent modes, and/or multiple Overcontroller modes working against each other. It's like I'm caught in the middle. It causes a decent amount of grief every day. Each Parent mode is telling me a contradictory thing that I should or shouldn't be doing, and so I flip between multiple attempts to meet those contradictory standards. Both Overcontroller modes still have that sense of angst and pressure, and, after a while, I can get really overwhelmed with anxiety. It can lead to panic or some other form of dysregulation. ... For example: I like to work out. I like to keep healthy. I can be really happy doing it. I enjoy it. Great. But then my joy for it shifts into this more Demanding Parent mode pressure: I *should* be doing it, because I should be maintaining my look, my standards, my muscles, my weight, even my passion for it. It shouldn't stop. My mind starts spinning: "When am I going to pack this into my day? Maybe I'll get up even earlier to fit it in. Am I doing enough?" But then a contradictory Demanding Parent mode starts piping in, telling me not just that maybe I can take a break or rest, but that I absolutely *should* take time off. It's pressure from the other direction. And by the way, that *should* comes with a hidden self-criticism, a hidden inner critic. It tells me that I'm failing, bad, terrible, crazy etc for 'not being able to rest sufficiently or manage my schedule, or go about my workouts in a relaxed way. ... In response to this, I see that I flip into two contradictory Overcontroller modes, each one reacting to the respective Parent modes. I see that this flipping between these different poles or different standards can happen very rapidly. Like, in the space of a few seconds I can go from one to the other: "Get going with that workout, boy!" \- Ok. So I start the workout. "Stop! You're crazy for doing this!" \- Ok. So I stop. It's an example of how it could show up. But I'm realising that: this is quite a pervasive pattern in my life: Call a friend. No, leave them alone. Go for a walk. You should take some time off. No, stay at home. You need to work. Tidy the house, you lazy bastard. No, leave it messy you overcontrolling neat freak! ... No wonder I have experienced so much anxiety in my life, especially on my own. I have these two poles of opinion about almost every aspect of life. My Vulnerable Child mode - the part that experiences the anxiety and stress as feelings - is in disarray. Which way do I turn? So much pressure from all directions. It can leave me quite paralysed. It happens very frequently: that internal battle between my parents, and me trying to manage both of them simultaneously.Wow. It's a big part of my day to day experience: Do this. Do that. No don't. Do this. No don't. Get to it. No, this. ......Chaos.... Another thing I like about Schema is that the Healthy Adult mode can be cultivated to help in these situations. It can become mindful of what's going on (mode aware). It can then work to 'cut through' the chaos with a more level-headed response. And that is what I really need to do. I think my/our Healthy Adult mode is identifiable because it doesn't come with that pressure or angst. Whereas one Demanding Parent might say: "You bloody need a 15-minute rest, you idiot! Stop overworking!", the Healthy Adult response is: "I'm gonna have a chill and feel into my body, try to be with and relax, and then go from there." I can do that. But also: my overcontroller modes can be really strong. So it's real work.It's interesting to me, though, to see it like this: my inner child caught in the middle of these two, conflicted parents.I'm happy to spot it, because that can help me towards more freedom in my life.It's true.There is a part of me that finds any everyday action of others a sign that they don't like me or similar.Someone leaves me on read for any minor length of time: I assume it means I wrote something offensive and they're annoyed with me.A friend doesn't contact me for a week: They've had enough of me and have discarded me. That's it. We're done from their perspective.And my habitual response: Oh well. It's over. No point trying.Or if I do try and they don't respond: it's all over. The fat lady has sung....That same or similar part of me also cannot take compliments: Someone apparently wants to chat with me, and even says so, or says they're enjoying talking with me: It's a lie. They're just being nice / patient.Someone says or writes a compliment: Nope. It's all lies.Again, my habit is to not bother communicating with that person anymore.I'm really not fishing for compliments here. I don't they will be of benefit anyway....I was thinking about this and other examples this morning. I was out on a walk by myself in the city. Seeing so many people - or to my insecure mind: "everyone else" - out with friends, having a relaxed, fun time etc etc, I realised...I realised I was denying that I felt lonely to myself. And then I had to actually dig down inside to bring the lonely feelings to the surface and try to be with them.I did, and had a little tear and consolation. Woop. Woop. Go me.But then I continued to spend the rest of the day ... pretty much ...Isolating myself....I had a thought:"I'm done with that isolation part of my life. I want to connect much more and maintain relationships much better."Ah. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.I'll start that first thing on Monday. And I'll be really good at it. Like a task. Like cleaning the house or doing work admin. Something I compartmentalise into certain parts of my day and not others.Because, to that still-present - I assume wounded - part of me that believes people don't want anything to do with me, find me a drag, a nuisance, irritating, a fool, embarrassing, weird, strange, odd, too much, too little ... whatever angle it chooses to take...... it feels scary to maintain relationships. I might get hurt. So it's easier to cut off and dismiss. Isolate.I'm not actually that down about all this. I'm just like: Oh! Something to explore. Therapy tomorrow (yay!).I feel like I should be smoking a cigarette right now. I've never smoked in my life. It's just the image looks right to me:A cynical, sad, lonely, angry inhale. An even sadder, lonelier out breath. I drop the cigarette on the concrete and stub it out. And walk on. Alone. It's a grey, cold day.Later, I'll play chess on my own.Tagging this as Recovery Progress because I still think it's cool that I spotted it.GO MEEEEEE!Yours, everyone's favourite friendly, totally healed narcissist. 🤘🏻👑🌈...Gosh. This disorder has 14 million angles!! 🤪. My inner critic tells me I am pathetic and weak, feeble, useless, selfish for ...... for not being able to function well some days....I'm doing well...Then out of nowhere, comes ... overwhelm, distress, panic, existential worries....Why? I'm confused....I try to push it all aside.I try to get on with my work.I give myself a 15 minute break....But there it all is. Still....I am hanging out the washing. Something useful.My Mum texts - out of nowhere - to say that she doesn't like the plans I've made for Christmas, and is not coming to our home.Specifically: she is upset that we are taking her to the ballet on Christmas Eve. What a terrible crime.In the conversation that follows, I try to stand up for myself, as calm and level as I can be. I'm actually proud for standing steady against her volatile, chaotic, explosive stabs for once.She tells me to go to hell....After the shock wave... I happened to have therapy.A lot to process....So ...In a nutshell...The trauma bond I had with my highly chaotic Mum since childhood debilitated me.No wonder I find it hard to function.Out of nowhere:Chaos.Dealing with chaos.Managing the chaos I was used to at an early age....I decided to take the afternoon off today. I need to process. To just be in my body. To feel.Without time limits....Documenting this moment.Maybe makes no sense to others.Makes sense to me....Standing strong.Standing up for myself.Caring for myself.Taking the time I need.I just had therapy. It was a really intense session, where a lot came up in a spontaneous / chaotic way, involving lots of anger and tears directed towards my mother (who'd've guessed, eh!?). It was so good to spill all of this out.But at one point near the end, I had to stop because it was too much to handle. My therapist asked what I needed, and after a while, I said I needed some reflections from her as to what was happening within me from her perspective.This led to a conversation about the levels of personality organisation from a psychoanalytic perspective, those levels being: psychotic, borderline, neurotic and healthy. I mentioned the Heal NPD YouTube channel and Dr Ettensohn's work, which have been helping me.My therapist then said that to her, I came across as being in the borderline level of personality organisation; not that I've got BPD, but that I am in that range of thinking / mental state.This didn't make me depressed.It actually gave me so much clarity: to have someone (after eight months of working together) place me somewhere on that spectrum. She's not a psychoanalytic therapist, but has some psychoanalytic supervision, so she knows it in part.I told her: it helped me feel grounded. Finally: I don't have to guess or overthink: am I this or that? Do I have a personality disorder or not? Am I making this up?Well... No.Actually. No.Goodbye Eternal Inner Doubt / My Mother....After the session, I caught myself in the mirror (naturally!). Having that recognition of being at that level of personality organisation, and essentially - by definition - actually having a PD ... it's like a cloud lifted and I saw myself in a new light.I actually saw myself with more, real, compassion. Because all that shit from childhood did affect me enough to cause this. It really did happen. This is really me.And it gave me some sense of stability in my self: Yes!! I'm quirky. I'm weird. I'm odd. I'm strange. Because I have a personality disorder....This is me: your personality disordered piano tutor.This is me: that personality disordered bloke in the supermarket buying lots of eggs.This is me: with my childlike dress-sense. Bring on the colour. Because in some critical ways, I am still a child inside. I got stuck along the way....It allows me to forgive myself, for trying my best to function despite my daily struggles. Daily triggering. Daily battle to manage my emotions. Daily problems interacting with others. Daily issues with self-concept.No wonder I find work difficult. No wonder I struggle with things most people seem to manage well.Oh, that's why I behaved like that with the pharmacist the other day!Oh, that's why I keep feeling that way around people.Oh, that explains... Everything!...Not that I'm gonna stay here and wear it like a badge of honour forever. Or at all, really.It just gives me a sense of self. A clearer picture of who I am right now.It also gives me a place from which to grow.Ok, so I'm HERE, and I want to get THERE (Healthy).They say it can be done, so ... I'm gonna....May I say:Go to therapy if you aren't there. If you suspect you have a PD, bring it up. Share what you know already. Allow things to take time. Get some clarity as well as treatment. I think the former is part of the latter.This whole thing of 'is it right to get a diagnosis or not'? Does the diagnosis even mean anything? Well, to me, yes. It helps me understand. To see more clearly. To clear out some of the chaos of my mind.I just want to make a note of this and I'm interested if other people relate.I think my mind is still not very accurate - on an automatic level - when it comes to interpretating the actions of others. I believe this is the poor mentalisation associated with having a personality disorder - though it could be a human thing as well.I notice that my habitual thoughts about people are often very negatively biased, or very much over-inflated. There is typically no evidence to support my assumptions. Even when people provide evidence, I can struggle to accept it.I do challenge my thinking. Sometimes this is easy, and sometimes it's hard.But I'm at a point now where I can see how these misperceptions can really impact my life. For example, they can lead me to avoid people or sustaining connections. When it becomes clear that I'm wrong, there is regret and sorrow.So I want to be more mindful of my biased assumptions and make extra effort to at least consider different perspectives....For instance:When people reach out to me, I can easily automatically think they don't really want me in their lives, but are just doing it to be kind.It's the same when people give me compliments, or I can think they are flattering me to use me for their own gain.When people don't reply to me, I very quickly think I have annoyed them, or they must secretly hate me or have had enough of me.I habitually assume my work clients see me as a weak, fragile, strange, weird, odd man. I think they are frequently fed up with me....Or I think they are glowing in admiration for me.When my therapist flicks her hair in a session, I think she must be sexually attracted to me and is flirting.When I'm out and about, I think people see me and are variously: admiring, lusting after me, intimidated by me....I can and do override my assumptions, but it takes effort.However, I guess I have to keep going and double down on my efforts.I notice that when I do, I'm able to build better relationships and have a more grounded self-esteem....Just before I went to press 'Post', I considered not bothering.I caught myself thinking that other people would think either very negatively or positively about what I've written. I saw their scrawled up faces of judgement, or them rolling their eyes or laughing at me. I saw people bouncing up and down in over-the-top admiration.Both of these assumptions of people's responses almost stopped me from posting. Not that my posts are the be and end all. But it would be ashame not to share and exchange with other people. It makes life richer.Every now and again, I have interactions with my parents where their words or behaviour bring real clarity as to how my pathological narcissism developed.Last night, I made one of my duty-of-care catch-up calls with my Mum. I don't really want to talk to her, but--I think to myself--she lives on her own, she doesn't see many people, and she must be lonely.Perhaps if my sense of obligation to make that call could speak, it might say:"I need to support her and bring her the things that she needs."An image comes to mind of my Mum in some giant bed or on a throne. She sits and waits for people to meet her emotional needs.I am one of those people. In fact, I am the principle servant of this Queen Bee, bringing her emotional nectar.This is how I was programmed as child: to believe that my Mum relies on me to meet her needs, and that I must put my needs aside and play the role of maintaining her ego....Feelings of guilt and obligation have followed me all my life, as has the resentment that stems from that chronic self-subjugation and negation.At the same time, I express none of this to my mother. Underlying this self-silencing is unprocessed fear.It's a partly irrational fear-based-belief that my mother won't be able to cope with any disagreement or criticism, and that she is too fragile to regulate her own emotions. Diversions from my role as propping up her ego will lead her to lash out at me, and fall into self-loathing despair. I say 'partly irrational' because there is evidence of this being true, based on my past experience with her. At the same time, it's not as if I am physically unable to open my mouth to disagree with her. It just remains shut because the fear is so strong. I wonder if I can ever break through.Another image comes to mind. This time, she is not on a throne, but instead is running around in some explosive, sad, despairing agony. This image brings up feelings of sadness and sorrow for the tragedy of it all: this person - my mother - who also carried so much trauma and pain, but was not or will ever be able to have it properly processed, or have adult-like and mature self-regulation abilities to bring her the stability, calm and healthy self-confidence I wish she was able to know....The call follows a rhythm I am now accustomed to, and yet naively hope that might be different *this time*. It rarely is.The first part of the call is a conversational exchange where I share some things that have been happening in my life.I am habitually selective as to what I share. I am half-consciously wary of offering anything of my life that she may hit upon and attack, so I hold back a considerable amount.It's not as if I'm not telling her about taking drugs or my masturbation fantasies! I'm largely not telling her the every day things: my tastes, my preferences, my opinions, my interests, my travels, my experiences, and any very minor issue I have.When I do share these things, they are heavily critiqued, and I am told how I *should* think, feel or behave. I feel my personal boundaries being ignored and intruded upon. I feel controlled and pressurised to bend to her will.While I do try to maintain my differences and personal boundaries through calm disagreement and restatement of what feels right for me, my mum does not give in. After a short back and forth, the 'only option' feels to be to present a false agreement of her opinion to appease and placate her.Here I perform the role of the subservient, pleasant son, propping up her ego and negating my identity and sense of self in her presence....The second part of the call typically begins with me offering my mother time to share her updates."What have you been up to?"- "Nothing.""Well, you must have thoughts and opinions."This leads to, not a conversation, but a monologue from a protagonist on stage: my mother, and her obliging audience: me.These monologues can last 40, 50 minutes, compared to the 10 minutes or so before where I discuss things in my life.The narratives here have some central themes: the ridiculousness of other people's behaviours, and my mother's obviously superior perspective.There are also almost intolerable rants about politics, mostly centred around wars (currently in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere). My mum is obsessed with war. Through it she sells herself as a highly empathic, compassionate person.Her language describing her knowledge of the latest news is really difficult to listen to: atrocities of this, slaughter of that, blood spilling here, whole nations of terrible people over there. Her tone is piercing. Her speech is fast and relentless. It is a gushing fountain of emotional charged words. I find myself getting overwhelmed by it all. In the past i asked her to stop. She would react by attacking me for not being able to tolerate The Truth. So I no longer disagree. I juet turn the volume down on my phone. This maintains that 'space for her' that I instinctively feel I 'should provide', while also offers me some relief and protection.I sound a stream of utterances that I hope indicate that I'm listening and in agreement. At this point in the call, it is all about performing that role of the engaged audience member. Underneath that, I am actually highly distressed and desperate to get away, looking at the clock to see how much longer would be reasonable before I close things off. ...In the last part of a typical call, I try to end our conversation in a way that again 'doesn't hurt her feelings'.I find an excuse such as needing to make dinner.Last night, in this final segment, my Mum offered something back to me before we departed. I know she knows that these rants are not what people want from her. I sense her embarrassment and shame.She comes forward with a gift as a form of compensation for her shame. She offers me some glimpse of connection and appreciation:"And thank you for sending those photos from your holiday."And then immediately:"Just one thing: can you not send any photos where you are pulling a stupid face. You never used to do that until you met [my partner]. You look awful. So please send photos where you look nice.""OK, Mum. Sure." I am by now emotionally flat and almost unable to respond at all.The call comes to a polite end.Inside I am - and have been - suffering terribly. Really terribly.Afterwards, I notice I flip rebelliously into a grandiose state in which I feel big, bold and antagonistic. I take a walk to my local supermarket. I feel like my presence is intimidating, and I like it. I have my baseball cap, my big coat, my chewing gum, my steely eyes, my sharp beard, my powerful, lean body.Everyone look at me.Everyone get out of my way.Fuck you.And Fuck You....This morning I awoke and had terrible panic attacks. After they passed, I felt so sad. I slumped into a childlike depressive episode, and shed tears, feeling existentially fragile....I want to just pick out aspects of the above encounter with my Mum that, as I said, to me point to the ways my own pathological narcissism developed.I don't mean the standard DSM interpretation of NPD, but the - I think - much more relevant and accurate definition based on object relations theory:an underlying narcissistic personality style, but with an inability to maintain a healthy, stable, mature self image, leading to the deployment of a range of other immature defences such as splitting, idealisation, projection, introjection and feelings of omnipotence, and consequent fluctuations between grandiose and vulnerable states and resultant identity diffusion.That is NPD to me, and that is what I have experienced in my adult life, and continue to grapple with every day.It has gotten a lot better! People complain about self-awareness, but it is a very helpful tool. I want to be more self-aware, not less, despite the challenges of 'knowing'....That call last night made clear so many root causes of my disorder in my relationship with my mother:- the misattunement between parent and child- the child, learning that parts of the self are unwelcome by the parent and breaks connection, while others are permitted and sustains connection, also learns to split off and hide or show parts, or present a false identity to the parent- unable to connect properly with the parent, and through a lack of mirroring from the parent, the child develops coping strategies of self idealisation and other-devaluation: the grandiose self. Big, bold and antagonistic.- these grandiose states are not self-sustaining, and require feedback from others to prop them up. ("Everyone look at me. Everyone get out of my way.") They easily collapse into extreme vulnerability and existential crises (which I relate to my panic attacks and depression this morning)....I know these mechanisms are happening. But they still occur on an automatic and irrational level.I wish I could break these patterns just like that. But it's complex and outside of my immediate ability, especially in these triggering situations.I am trying with all my might to push through and make a more stable life for myself, more wellbeing, better connections.I am spent through all this reflection. If anyone has anything that you think might help - insight or suggestions or just that you relate - I'd be grateful to hear back.My therapist highlighted something to me that I wanted to share: We have this chance, now as adults, to treat ourselves in ways that are different from how we were treated as children.Our life can be one of reparation, of making repairs to the - rather broken and dysfunctional - template for life that was handed down to us.I like that.Tool kits at the ready.... Our parents typically treated us badly, and modelled behaviours or perspectives that were dysfunctional or harmful.They argued and fought in front of us instead of working through their problems through discussion.They ignored and dismissed us instead of listening. They over-controlled and intruded upon our personal boundaries. They were over-cautious and over-protective, instilling a sense of fear about the world and other people. They over-glorified some of our attributes but rejected others. They treated us as trophies, scapegoats, and surrogate partners; as objects, not as whole, complex individuals. Through their behaviours, they devalued us and modelled a treatment of others that was damaging.We internalise this, so it becomes how we treat ourselves, others and our relationships....As adults, however, we have the chance to do something different. We can treat our bodies and minds with care and compassion. We can listen to our bodies and look after them. We can treat others with respect. We can listen to them as best we can. We enter into conflicts with a resolve to maintain calm and consider different perspectives. Every time we do something like this, we are repairing that broken template we grew up with, and grew to understand as True and Good, but that turns out to be so harmful.... For me, it's motivational to keep this idea of making a 'repair job' on my inner workings and relationship dynamics. It takes away the feeling that I'm fundamentally at fault for the way I treat myself and others. Instead, I can more easily see that it's all stemming from that dysfunctional template. But I can repair it. I can make repairs. ... When I was a child, my mum was absolutely dismissive of any kind of health issue I had. She frequently ignored, invalidated, and belittled me when I went to her and told her I wasn't feeling well. She would go on to tell me that I didn't know anything about being ill, and that *she* had really known illness when ... blah blah blah ... insert story of how she was in bed for six weeks some time in the 1980s. This left me with a range of very dysfunctional behaviours around my health, including extreme health anxiety and panic, frequent existential crises, OCD, body dysmorphia, fear and avoidance of going to the doctor, and of anything being 'wrong' with me, and—at other times—pretty extreme over-control of health in the form of orthorexia, eating disorders centred around restriction, and over-exercising. ... A couple of weeks back, I had a routine appointment with a pharmacist. They asked me—because of my age—if I wanted a blood pressure test. The results showed slightly elevated blood pressure. They suggested a 24-hour monitor taking readings every 30 minutes. That took place yesterday. I hated it. It brought up all my fears about having something 'wrong' with me and of people judging and treating me badly—with the same disdain and ridicule of my mum—if the results showed any physical ailments. In the middle of the night, I really wanted to pull the plug on that bloody machine. But I didn't. When I got the results this morning, they showed that my blood pressure was mostly OK to slightly high. But they also spotted a heart arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, that showed up in 20% of the readings. It's not certain that anything is wrong. More tests are needed, which I'm going to seek out as soon as possible. I also don't have any particular symptoms, so I'm not really worried. Rather, I feet a real care for myself, for my little heart. I'm going to listen to what it is saying and take it seriously. ... I've long had a suspicion that something might be up with my heart. It tends to go wild when I eat high-carb foods or drink wine. So I cut back on those years ago. People around me—my mum and my partner—have always been dismissive of my hunch that something wasn't right and that these foods were making it worse. So many arguments about me not wanting to eat pasta because it kept me up at night with a pounding heart. Today, I have my chart that shows evidence that I might be right. I'm not going to shove it in their faces (though a part of me wants to). Instead, I'm going to quietly seek out further tests and any treatments prescribed by doctors. ... I am the adult here. It's me in charge now. My mum was so dismissive of my health concerns, and I attracted a partner who has similar tendencies, unfortunately. But it's my body. It's my little heart. Maybe nothing is wrong, but I feel emboldened to take really good care of it, the way it should have been cared for as a child. My little heart, beating away quietly—maybe with a cute hiccup now and then when you're stressed. We're going to help you out, little fella....I want to repair the relationship I have with my body. I want to repair the broken template I was given for how to respond to my body and feelings of being unwell.Not with inner criticism. Not with ignorance or avoidance.Instead, I am taking my little body by the hand, to figure this out together.I want to write a few things about my healing / recovery journey: how it's been going, where I am now, and what I'm hoping for the future....I've been in weekly therapy for 8 months. It's Schema Therapy for the most part.During this time, I've noticed many positive changes in my self-image and relationships with others. These changes haven't been exclusively contained to this period. I have had therapy in the past, and having been trying to work on myself for many years. But this round of therapy has really up'd the frequency and intensity of positive changes.I think a combination of factors have helped make this therapy work well. One is, I've stayed in therapy, staying through a few periods where I thought it wasn't working, devalued my therapist and wanted to quit. Staying in therapy brought about more and more moments where I felt safer, understood and cared for, and that I was intrinsically ok. I shared more. I stopped over-conceptualising, trying to do the work of the therapist, stopped trying to be so self-reliant. Gradually, I've been able to work through significant traumatic events of the past, and receive suggestions, guidance and other re-parenting from the therapist to help me with my relationships. Things have gradually got easier and better....For years, for example, I have had significant difficulties even being around my Mum. A false self I put on of "the nice son" in her presence hid an emotional whirlwind underneath of intense resentment, anger, rage, frustration, anxiety, panic, guilt, worry and so on. I could hardly stay in the same room for the sheer overwhelm of intense feelings, including fear that I might lash out at her.Recently, though, I had a very significant breakthrough encounter with her through which I was able to try new styles of interacting and communicating. I was much more forthcoming with my thoughts and feelings, and behaved in ways that I wanted to (in terms of my demeanour or everyday mannerisms) as opposed to "should". That seemed to help resolve a lot of the inner conflicts I described, to the point where, for the first time in many years, I was not only able to feel much more comfortable around her, but I actually enjoyed myself, and even noticed that I didn't want to leave. This felt like a major event for me. I was really taken aback by the turnaround and possibility of having a good time with her and feeling warmth towards her. It delighted me. However, I also believe that it needs repetition to explore further, and build upon. I plan to "go back in" in the coming months to practise my new styles of interacting....With my partner, I have honestly felt new levels of love that I didn't know were possible or were missing until I experienced them recently. I'm a real song-lover, and listen to a lot of songs about deep relationships, intimacy, love, and relational conflicts (alongside the intricate EDM and pop that i also enjoy listening to). Just recently, for the first time in our 18 years together, I chose to listen song about deep affection and love for another, and felt that I wanted to channel my warm, positive, respectful thoughts and feelings through my imagination towards my partner. I have never done this before. (!!!) I didn't even know until that moment that I was missing anything beforehand. But through that experience, I realised that this was a new kind of love for my partner. I felt it, and it both made me happy and shocked me that I'd not experienced this before. I had thought that I did care for him, but it's always been tinged with jealousy, competition, resentment, anxiety, guilt and worry, again. I'm not going to suggest that those feelings are completely eradicated, but I do believe there has been a significant shift towards actual love, which I don't think I've known before in the same way or to the same degree....With friends ... Well (I'm smiling because it's been a good turnaround there, too) ...Most friendships I've had in my life have been marked by covert feelings of - once again - antagonism, jealousy, resentment, confusion, anxiety, rage, alienation, and fluctuations between superiority and inferiority ... All of this and more I have habitually masked behind a false self that attempts to come across to others "like they want me to". I have been the Chameleon. I have over-mirrored and lost any sense of self, which has in turn caused a lot of confusion and anxiety. I have charmed and delighted people; entertained them. At many points, however, the mask has become unbearable to wear. Most of the time, this led me to retreat, to physically avoid people, while internally devaluing them in hidden fits of envy, rage and judgement. Occasionally, my mask has slipped in front of people, and I have either shown those very negative feelings to others, or I have become overtly withdrawn, aloof and sullen in public. This has in retrospect been an unconscious attempt to get help and care from people. It has, of course, been completely dysfunctional, typically pushing people away.Over the last few years, and increasingly through the therapy I'm having at the moment, however, I've been able to make a lot of progress with friendships. Like with my Mum, I have been practicing lots of newer styles of interaction with people generally: being more forthcoming with real thoughts and feelings, and behaving or even carrying and presenting myself as I enjoy rather than how I assume I "should". In fact, it was through practicing these styles with friends first, and experiencing positive shifts in my sense of self and my relationships, that I gathered some tools and confidence to then try with my Mum.It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what has happened with friends other than to say that I feel more stable around them; I feel more natural and comfortable in my own skin; I feel much more respect for others, and them being different to me; I feel much less antagonism, resentment and hostility; I notice that I have a lot more fun and feel more content. There was a point where some of the previous antagonism I felt had fallen away quite suddenly, and I thought to myself how nice it was not to feel that feeling. I realised I had quite enjoyed the antagonism, and that it hadn't occurred to me that not feeling like that - and instead feeling at ease with people - was a better state to be in!I still notice my negative feelings towards others crop up frequently. I also notice that I still have urges to avoid people. But I have been - more or less continuously! - trying to challenge these urges and explore, understand and counteract negative thought patterns through pushing myself to try different approaches, and see things from different perspectives....Finally, regarding self-image, I do notice more ease in myself, and more stability in my sense of identity. I still have a fair amount of identity diffusion or confusion, and my sense of self still can oscillate or wobble around in ways that leave me confused and sometimes very anxious. But this has reduced to a good degree.I also notice a big reduction in the need to impress people or seek approval or admiration. I no longer feel the need to stand out in the same way I did before. I still dress in my colourful attire, but that is much less about impressing people as it is just enjoying those clothes and colours; living as I want to.Ok, I'm still vain. I like the way I look, and work to maintain it. I suppose one difference between now and in the past is that I uses to be very ashamed of my vanity. These days, I'm just more at ease with this aspect of myself. I joke about it more openly, and am OK with people seeing me as vain, and even not liking that about me.Interestingly, overall, I notice that I see myself as quite ordinary, and that I like that feeling. I also notice a concurrent feeling of belonging with others: being a complex human being. I do still feel alien and awkwardly different and anxious at times, but it's less intense and not as enduring.Instead, I notice that I'm much less worried what others think of me. That worry is still there, but easier to work through. So that's nice. If people like my style, ok. If they don't, ok.I do still want to do well in my life, but I don't associate my sense of self with that success. It would be nice if some things did come about in my work, for example. I would like to achieve a few things. If those things don't happen, however, I'm not quite so bothered. I can still be happy in my life. It's not to be all and end all as it used to be....Overall, I see a correlation between practising more free self-expression and improvements in self-image and relationships with others. This has spurred me on no end, to the point that I have tried to take every day and every interaction with friends, family and my partner, as an opportunity for growth. It has not been straightforward or easy. Neither has it been a perfectly upwardly trajectory. I'd say I probably "fail" every day and frequently retreat into my dysfunctional narcissistic states. But I do believe that those "failures" - during which I re-experience a lot of negative feelings and dysfunctional thought patterns and behaviours - provide the chance to explore and understand my inner conflicts, to try to challenge them, and then make amends, make changes, try again in the next opportunity, the next moment.I have work to do. Watching the recent Ettensohn video on Borderline-Level NPD highlighted to me where I still have problems. Although I can much more easily and outwardly function in everyday life, issues of splitting, projection, introjection, idealisation, envy, rivalry, competition, antagonism, devaluation, superiority, avoidance, anxiety, identity diffusion and more are all still there in the background. They are reduced and less problematic, but still a part of my experience. For me, they indicate the work I need to do more of, and that I still could do with therapy, even though at times recently I've thought (and not for the first time!): "Yes! I'm healed! So long!"Will I ever be fully recovered? I used to think a flat "No". Or more: I didn't know what recovery might look like, because I hadn't experienced much of it. But now I am hopeful about the future, because experience has taught me of the possibility - and the delightful surprises that can happen on the recovery journey. I don't know if I'll fully recover. Maybe? Who knows. I just honestly keep trying to work myself out of this thing, this trauma, this sadness, every day.It's the middle of the night. I should be asleep.But something is keeping me up and I want to document it, release it....It's a deep, deep fear I realise I have... ... of myself....I knew it was there, but haven't quite felt the magnitude of it before.In the process of therapy, I'm realising just how wounded I was by early life experiences.My home was a terrible place to grow up. My parents let me down in so many respects. Subtle but actually shocking the ways I was really let down.And then throughout my childhood, I was frequently bullied at school. Very frequently. And I had friendships that seemed promising and yet never materialised. I felt manipulated, mistreated or let down by friends. I felt, even as a young child, that I needed to perform not only for my parents, but for people my age. I needed to cover up, hide parts of me, and only show what I thought people wanted.I've never before realised the extent to which I did this with practically all my peers growing up. It was just normal to me.It was normal to me to go to school every day, for all those hours of socialising, learning to socialise, interact, understand relationships and my sense of self, and yet be highly on edge pretty much all the time in case I was harassed, threatened, teased, openly rejected, humiliated, physically attacked, shunned, and have promising relationships fail.I was incredibly lonely. I felt I had no one to talk to about it. No teacher. No parent. No friend. No one. I just managed it by myself....As a teacher myself now, I can finally see how awful that was for little me. What a monumental burden.What a monumental burden, both at home and at school.Funny how that word really means something to me right now, the words all pouring out:Monumental.A mountainous weight on my little shoulders.This gigantic wound created from all those traumas inflicted on a very sensitive body....That wound, I realise now, terrified me even as a child.I knew it was very deep.It was painful. It was angry. This monster inside which so many people here describe: Borne of those thousands of wounds accumulated.That deep, deep fear of myself, that monstrously wounded part of me:What might I do if I didn't manage to contain it? Contain the rage. Contain that monster.Might I kill someone? Might I kill my parents? My I kill people at school? Friends on their way home?...The answer is: no. Well, I didn't at least. And it's unlikely now.But as a child, I didn't know this. So I thought it was not only possible, but my destiny.Unless I contained that monster. Held it back. Controlled it. Forced it down. ...That was the psychological template of my childhood:People mistreat you.No one really cares. No friend. No teacher. No parent.So much pain and anger I don't know what to do with apart from be scared of it, push it down and try to control it.Control myself for the rest of my life....No wonder I've struggled all my life with socialising.No wonder I've felt so held back in making friendships. That template from the past pasted on the present and future....I have a real knack of invalidating myself. That's something I link quite clearly to my Mum. She frequently, directly invalidated or undermined me and my experience. Every angle.In therapy today, we looked at a memory from my teenage years of me being bullied quite ferociously by my peers.At one point, I noticed an inner critical voice shouting at me: "This isn't an issue at all. What a waste of time for the therapist. People have many more and bigger issues than you. This is stupid. This is pathetic."I related this back to my therapist.She was good. She said, "No. This is serious. Bullying is serious."To me, she was talking to that inner critic, to my Mum.I consciously took it in as a bit of re-parenting from the therapist....There's a lot to unpack. I thought it was just about my home life, but it's not. It's everything.A seriously wounded, sensitive person.A monumental burden.A lost child that needs re-parenting.Just acknowledging that....OK. That's it.Nunnite.Lol. Bet I jinx it now and it all goes tits up!But yeah, it actually has gone well.Boom....Fourth therapist I've seen. Been seeing her weekly for 7 months. It's Schema, and the main ways that comes across is through us talking about different parts of my personality, how they came about (clue: trauma), and ... just a huge amount of care and compassion from the therapist.For a while I was totally awkward about receiving that care; nurturing. I presented my "I'm alright! I've got this in the bag already!" persona. But then we broke through that somehow. There was a naturalness / spontaneity that came about in our conversations, and I started ...... just opening up more about the childhood trauma, and less about the narcissism....Lots of crying. Lots of making sense. Validation.Some education on things I didn't learn about myself and people generally as a child.I don't need to perform.When I share (in a respectful manner) the thoughts that I previously held back, it works out well and interesting things happen. Life is more interesting....It's weird. It's not like I'm doing much apart from sharing and crying and being supported.And then weird things start happening later. I feel less shame in random parts of life. I feel bolder. I'm more able to care for others. Feel....OK. Boring stuff over.I also get to be me. And feel like I have a me. More and more....I'm not happy every day. But I feel like at least some of the binds of my mind have loosened. The clamps have been taken off....I've been integrating my cocky side into various realms of life.No more Mr Nice Guy Covert Narcissist. It's more what you see is what you get.I wanted to flag up three different but related frames of reference that I think help me on my journey. I wonder what people think about all this.Partly, this is for me to keep them mind - because I find it useful to do so, but keep forgetting! Partly, it's also because I think there are quite a few posts here that conflate the different frames or concepts I'm going to mention under the umbrella of NPD or narcissism, when it's maybe not really the case. I think I've done or do the same, and I can see how this gets me stuck....Those frames of reference for me are:1. That I identify with the concept of the highly sensitive person (HSP) or "orchid child"then2. That I experienced a lot of trauma and neglect and relate to the concept and symptoms of cPTSDand 3. That I experience pathological narcissism, which for me is about the fluctuations between grandiosity and vulnerability. I see that my (fragile) grandiose states or modes or behaviours developed as coping responses to and defence against the childhood trauma, while the vulnerability aspect might be explained as the feelings and thoughts of my traumatised mind reactivated. Something like that....One tendency I've had in the last couple years is to focus on the narcissism as my main point of reference for the problems I experience day to day. It makes sense because I've been trying to wrap my head around since the while self-awareness cliff-drop.The other two have faded to the background, until recently when I've been exploring trauma much more in therapy - and the concept of cptsd on my own. (Thanks to people here nudging me in that direction. It's been helpful)....Ultimately, I think holding these three frames of reference in mind is useful as I go through my days. It helps me to work out which aspects of my experience are more about narcissism or trauma or me being a sensitive person. It's not that there is an absolutely clear line - because there isn't.But I helps because I can then think about which strategies I adopt for managing my daily symptoms....For example, today I've already had some intense mood swings or episodes this morning - which is usual for me.Some of that I would in retrospect relate to being highly sensitive. For instance, I can get easily overstimulated and overwhelmed by things like noise, or if I'm given too much to do but someone.Pointing out the HSP connection reminds me that i can get overstumulated, and that I may need to take a break or do things that are restful and quietening, or prioritise tasks and let others go.Additionally, though, I've had some chaotic thought patterns today that point to a trauma response. I noticed I didn't trust my partner and felt what he was asking me to do at one point was unfair, and that he didn't understand me. Flagging this as related to past trauma helps me remember that I struggle with misinterpreting other people's motives, often "feeling" like they don't care about me. But with that connection to cptsd in mind, I can try to remember that this "feeling" relates to feeling like that as a child - because I really did experience a lot of neglect in this area. It helps me to challenge my own thoughts, but also forgive them - rather than being confused or adding another layer of shame.On top of that, I can see how my coping response to when he asked me to do certain things was maybe in the zone of narcissistic: Getting overly self-righteous, victim-y and devaluing his status and experience. Keeping that aspect in mind helps me to again challenge my own thoughts and behaviours, recognising them as a self-aggrandising coping mechanism. Then I might reflect on how I could go about the interaction better, or make repairs between us, so that there is more equality and mutuality between us....Fuck, what a load of work!!!! 😵‍💫🤪...But still, I think it's helpful to keep these different frames of reference in mind, pretty much all the time. It can also help me search for particular resources or get particular help.. I've looked quite a lot into emotional needs, and considered how they were unmet in childhood for quite some time.But - like I can imagine is the same for many people here - the extent to which my needs as a child were unmet was pretty extreme, beyond those lists I've read and reflected on. ...I've just had therapy, and it's something that came up in discussion. (I cried, obviously). I'm not moaning or tearful about it right now, though. I'm just documenting. Trying to make another step forward. Trying to see what you people think....My parents did such a shit job of raising children. It's not just that I didn't have my needs for security, stability, freedom of expression, development of my autonomy, individuation, my own boundaries and limits, and dare I say play, fun and joy with my parents... all of that severely curtailed and unfulfilled. It goes much further, and I would guess that it does for many of us.It's like, my needs for understanding my physical, psychological, emotional self were really neglected. Neglect isn't the right word. But I can't think of the right one now. My childhood left me with a real and more-or-less constant confusion and anxiety about the workings of my mind. ...I have a powerful, vivid imagination. But I have a part of me that's hugely scared of it. Scared of my imagination. I am a sexual person. But I'm also massively confused and destabilised by sexual feelings sometimes. A part of me equates them with deviancy, thanks to the lack of education from my parents. Or them equating sexuality with deviancy and perversion. I really struggle with what it is to be a man. It's something I've been obsessed with all my adult life, and earlier. I know gender is a complicated thing, but I have a basic confusion about my sense of self as a man in the world. My Dad was a terrible role model, but my Mum was also very sexist and shamed me for being male - which I've mentioned a few times here already.That mentioning-again of the same issue is a sign of my ongoing confusion and obsession with trying to figure these kinds of basic things out.I cried today in therapy talking about how it was only a year or two ago when I worked out how to feel more natural around people and engage in social situations at work without the crippling anxiety or superiority that I felt all my adult life. I think I have so many deficits in so many areas. Yes, I can charm and perform and play all sorts of roles. I can download other peoples' behavioural styles and mimic them like a robot (which I do less now, but can still feel that reflex). But I lack so many things. I lack the ability to take different, adult perspectives on situations - quite often.I can observe my thoughts and feelings and have self-compassion. Now? .... That's good. But I am surprised by how limited my capacities are in certain respects.For example, a lot of the 'advice' I give to people is often out of a book, and I'm just repeating it without feeling much (apart from grandiosity at 'being the one advising people with this magical information').No jokes. There was one point where I was massively into Schema Therapy, and I would be able to regurgitate the 'right answer' to help people in difficult situations. But it wasn't really coming from me. It was me remembering what I had read in a book.Not that that's totally bad. But ... I mean ... come on. It's a sign of the limited ability I have.(I still do this Schema-copy-and-paste thing, but less so, by the by. WATCH OUT!!!!!! 😈)...I said to the therapist today that I think part of what I need from therapy is guidance about how to be a human. She said that she wasn't sure if it was about 'being human' so much, as about being genuine. I'm not sure what she means. And I guess we'll have to wait until next time. Or not. Because my brain will be in a completely different place, and we'll be working on something else....But .. just for now : No wonder I struggle so much. I think that's something important I really got from therapy today. After the session I had an image come to mind of the therapist thinking about me or talking about me to a supervisor or colleague. In my mind's eye she was saying that it makes sense why I have all these difficulties, and grandiosity and vulnerability etc. Her image of me (in my imagination) was one f understanding and care.We were talking about that in the session, so it's not that it was out of nowhere. But I thought that it was good to have that random image come to mind of her 'backing me up' and showing understanding. It made me realise that more-or-less up to now (7 months in) I've had this background feeling that she's looking down on me.So that shift feels good. It feels good to feel that someone has your back. It feels good. ...Go to therapy! Stay in therapy!. Just over 24 hours since a huge wave of sadness and desperation about my traumatic childhood and its affects on my mind, it's as if nothing ever happened.I'm back, horny, and grandiose....There's a new guy starting at work later this week. I've not met him, but i know a few things: He basically does what I do. He's male. And a part of me has been anxious about how I'll compare to him.I found myself fixated at one point today: will he be better than me? Will people admire him more?...I was doing some work prep and caught myself more or less consciously thinking this:"OK. I see. A rival. Right! Let's get to it!""I'll work harder. I'll show off my skills, sneakily, while acting all modest.""On the surface I'll be all sweet and charming, but underneath I'll be checking out where this guy stands.""There's only two outcomes: 1. I'm better and more likeable than him already. Then it's only about maintaining my standards and elevating as I please.""Or 2. He's better than me, but I hold fast, pretend like nothing's off with me (even though i'll be partly crushed) observe him on the sly, copy and download his skills like some terrifying AI, work hard and outdo him.""Either way, I'll win."...I'm partly really embarrassed to share this, but it's also exactly what's going on. I don't want to hide and pretend I'm all sweet and innocent.The sadness and despair of yesterday are gone. I can hardly remember what that was like.I'm predominantly feeling competitive, supercharged and antagonistic....It's just how my mind rolls, and is an example of the huge swings that take place very swiftly.I'm aware of this and both kind of going with the plan above in part, but also trying to ground myself and remember the trauma stuff, remember what is better, remember that I need connection, not achievements or praise....But my narc brain is now struggling to care. ://Someone slap me.There isn't a part of my life that has been greatly sabotaged by the effects of my childhood.Not one relationship. Not one interaction untainted. My work. My ability to prosper. Be happy. Everything has been hit.I'm in my 40s and still struggle every day. I struggle with fear, anxiety, depression, stress, anger, rage, projection, shame, not knowing who I am, not knowing how to behave with people, alone, suicidal, and then all of a sudden feeling high, manic, superior, detached, indifferent, antagonistic, hostile, pretending everything's ok, utterly confused, scared of myself...It's just chaos, and I do my best to manage it.I'm crying really hard.I didn't deserve any of this, and I've done my best for so long to get better. I've worked so hard to try and live a better life, get on with people, challenge my paranoia, find myself, forgive, forget, be compassionate, be more generous, find more peace ...Just to live one fucking day without this fucking crushing weight tormenting me.I'm not going to do anything like harm or kill myself, but I'm just so fed up of this.I'm sorry, but maybe there are people out there who say you can fully recover from this. Well, I've been trying for 20 odd years and I don't believe it's possible. Narcissistic behaviours: yes. I get that. But the wreckage that is the traumatised NPD mind. I don't see how you can completely recover. I think you can build resources and live more easily. But that's basically it.I need a nap.The amount of anger, frustration and resentment I carry around has really hit me. It's extreme.And the extent to which I suppress it is pretty extreme, too."Everything's fine" on the surface. But underneath, it's really not. The resentment bubbles, and I push it down. It seeps through in disguised forms. Every now and again there's an eruption and I flip out.But I'm now realising just how intense this resentment is. And it actually scares me how hostile I can feel towards others....I also see how this resentment formed early on. Establishing that narrative helps me feel more grounded.Parentified child; emotional incest / enmeshed relationship with my mother; terrified of my threatening and violent father; Mum was emotionally unstable and paranoid; overcontrolled and intruded upon; shunned for being myself; given too much emotional burden dealing with household arguments from very early on; took up the role of diplomat and counsellor... You know the drill.The key themes I see here and behind this resentment I feel are Self-Sacrifice, and Self-Subjugation.That is, the chronic and just plain wrong pattern as a child of putting other people's needs ahead of my own, and holding back my needs and feelings out of fear of retaliation and the general emotional fallout.It's more than just putting other people's needs first, it's the negation of my own. It's that pushing down of my wants, interests, preferences, desires, needs, rights, boundaries, limits for the sake of the other: the first Others being my dysfunctional, abusive parents. Ut's the wiping out of myself, making my self invisible, merging and confusing my needs with the needs of others to maintain their emotional stability.!!!!That situation became the template for so many relationships and interactions. It's so automatic, you have no idea. I have led a life being with people and doing things that aren't right for me, but I have done so a) not to rock the boat, b) out of a sense of obligation, and c) not wanting to deal with the emotional fallout, which I was essentially trained to do.I was a slave child. Enslaved. Trapped.But you know what: I realised recently that it's more than that: I actually cared!! I wanted people in my family to be well. I wanted my mother to be happy. I was so sad as a child that she wasn't. I felt grief for her life, early on. Compassion. I was so sad for my older sister, experiencing that constant nightmare as well. I was so sad. I was sad even for my drunken father. I was sad to see the rage in his eyes. I knew even back then that he was lost and confused in himself....So much care.I tapped into that after therapy last week. It really hit me how much I cared.I see that underneath the resentment is sadness, but also that care and a wanting for everything to be OK. It feels good to know that that is there, rather than just an endless pit of anger. I'm sure it's in there in all of us, ultimately....So I have that stable rock of childlike care for the world.On top of that is a mountain of resentment from a sacrificed childhood.No wonder I struggle today with doing things for others. No wonder I struggle to care. No wonder I have these bouts of intense selfishness. No wonder I can be extra polite and charm the pants off people and be nice and go out of my way for them again and again, while underneath seethe with frustration and rage. Contempt. Scorn.The blueprint of the past plays out over and over....Last night, after a weekend hosting a party with my partner for his friends (again! It's been a pattern of late), I couldn't sleep for the frustration and stress of it all. The effort of this weekend has been intense. People bearly lifted a finger. The resentment kept me up, ruminating, boiling, seething...The thing that finally got me to sleep was joining the dots to my past and remembering how those patterns of self-sacrifice and subjugation were created and have played out in and since childhood.I'm taking all of this to therapy. I don't want to keep sacrificing my life - my self - for others.The phrase to be 'in one's element' refers to something like being in a situation, environment, doing some activity, or interacting with people in a certain way or style that feels really good and enjoyable; natural and energising.It's something I've been thinking about as a way of trying to help with identity confusion: just being mindful of when I am 'in my element' and when I'm not. It's help me feel what is more 'me' and what feels false or not right for me. It's also helping me to then bring out these certain 'in my element' sides of myself in situations where I don't thrive as much, so I can feel more natural and 'myself' and enjoy more situations, rather than just mirror other people to survive. It's like: being proactive rather than withdrawing and being miserable....So when or where are you 'in your element'? When or where do things just flow well and you feel good? With which kind of people? What activities? What situations? What kinds of relationships and interactions?...For me, there are many situations, reflecting different parts of my character:When I'm with people, I absolutely love engaging in banter. The cockier and playful the better. Those are often the types of interactions I like the most. I also like one-to-one deep and meaningful conversations. I can also be in my element when I'm helping people I care about (though I have limits!). I love dancing with other people. I love snuggling with my partner (when neither him or I are being a dick).On my own, I love listening to and practising music; performing less so, but I like it when the practice has paid off. I love walking and daydreaming. I love dancing by myself, dancing in the mirror; working out in the mirror; checking myself out in the mirror. Biking around town like a silly boy-racer (in my mind). I like writing these posts, and interacting with people here.I also feel in my element in quite a few work situations, where a mix of my nurturing, playful and mentoring sides come out and it all feels very natural. Work is also where I can try to excel, which I like to try to do. It's a balance because I also need to mitigate the stress etc. But ... at the moment, it's going alright.. I've just been realising how dysfunctional - or just plain sad - patterns from childhood between myself and my parents are still repeating in my daily life. Still! The same!...I have so many childhood stories of sharing my joys, interests, opinions, ideas etc with my parents, only to receive frequent invalidation, humiliation, shaming, disregard, or one-upmanship from them. It was incredibly saddening and frustrating at the time, and very confusing.As an adult, I have continued to repeat the same patterns: trying - almost desperately - to show my interests, abilities, passions or insights to people and to feel from them the engagement and validation i didn't receive from my parents. It's like desperately trying to get that unmet need for healthy attention as a child fulfilled. One problem here - I'm just seeing now in writing this - is that the people in my life I'm sharing this stuff with are not my parents, so they are very unlikely to respond in the very nurturing and wholehearted way that I need. It's a sad state of affairs to try to keep getting that need met but not being able to.Unfortunately, that pattern comes with a hypersensitivity to criticism and rejection - given my past. So I can still get very disproportionately reactive when people don't meet my level of enthusiasm with similar attention or interest.In the past, i would either absolutely flip out when I felt ignored, slighted or invalidated, or slump into an intense - though brief - depression, before once again thinking to myself that I need to *rise* like a phoenix, to *prove* my worth to people, this time trying *even harder* to *get it right*; to then *finally* get that love, attention, respect, validation I crave. Need. Needed back then at that crucial stage of development, but didn't get.I'm now much better at modulating those difficult emotional reactions when I don't feel "seen" when I share something. But not always and not entirely. The same reactive patterns still take place. Just happened yesterday with friends, I just realised....It's actually quite surprising how much if my mental power is focused on doing things to get attention or approval from others. I know I'll never reach perfection, but I still try very hard.The perfect performance. The buffest body. The healthiest diet. The best at my job. The most stylish. The most number of upvotes....All the time reaching.I can tell you that when I do feel that more nurturing care from others: I absolutely glow with warmth. I relax. It's different from the adulation from doing something "well" or "great". It's a warmth that seeps in deep and feels very nourishing.One of the things I think has been most impactful about therapy for me, in fact, is receiving care from the therapist, and actually feeling it. I do feel like she cares for me, and I can see lots of issues dissolving as a result of our interactions. But I still find certain traits really entrenched....Oh well, best get on. I have work to do: gotta keep proving my worth to people; standards to maintain.I guess I still can't escape these cycles completely ... But ... The highs are pretty cool! 😂So I'll take that. And keep trying. Including not flipping out when someone doesn't pay me attention i think I deserve (I WIN!).No. I try to take in the care that I need. From my therapist, from friends, from myself....Fyi: This post is an elaboration of a comment I left on YouTube.... is that people can say things and go unchallenged. Like little King's of our respective opinion castles.It inhibits exactly one of the things we could benefit from: to enter into healthy debates in which we share our authentic thoughts, are open about where we disagree with one another, express ourselves in ways that don't undermine or invalidate the other, and so hold and tolerate different perspectives that aren't our own.I haven't posted for a while. I have a little story behind that, and I wonder if anyone relates in some or similar way. Or maybe not. :)...A couple of weeks back, I finally accepted something I had known in the back of my mind for a while, but wasn't able to acknowledge: That my posting here was functioning more and more to feed a grandiose, idealised version of myself, and was reinforcing dysfunctional ways of relating to people, both here and in real life.It's been a tendency of mine generally. I was increasingly presenting this version of myself as 'the one who's making steady progress on the road to recovery'. The NPD hero that people cheer along. Well done me. The 'Recovery Progress' flair had become my go-to. It didn't invite questions. It didn't invite discussion. It didn't invite challenges. It invited, for me, cheers and accolades. It wasn't completely like this, 100%. It's not like my posts were one big manipulation or cover-up. I did try to write from an authentic place. But there was that subconscious element....Then I realised a couple of things:This way of communicating and using the posts was protecting me from my vulnerabilities, from appearing vulnerable to people here and to myself.But the truth is ... I am vulnerable and fragile. Yes, things have changed for the better. But ... Reality is that I have many ups and downs, and I try to manage them every day, pretty much.It was also inhibiting the way I related to people, here, in my mind, and in real life. The posts were serving to prop up that grandiose image to myself and other people, more than serving what I really need: to actually relate to people; to form connections.I would leave my reddit notifications on after posting. The little "Ding" from my phone became an exciting opportunity ... to receive praise, admiration; a propped up sense of self.It wasn't entirely like this. But ... Too much. Too much....I stopped posting as soon as I realised this in full. I had a little crash, understanding that I had - yet again - entered into some kind of grandiose delusion, this time in the writing and posting process.I then said to myself that I wouldn't make any more posts, but only comment - trying to connect more on a mutual level with people, rather than this 'top-down' interaction that the posts can lean into.But more recently I wondered if this was actually a kind of avoidance - and overcompensation - of the issue, that might not help me so much - or other people, dare I say.So I thought: What if I could use the opportunity of writing posts here to do the thing that I need, but really struggle with: actually relating to people and real life, seeing their perspectives, accepting differences, and forming connections, rather than serving the one-upmanship that can be my habit....So that's it. I have things I still want to share and say about living with NPD. But I'm not going to post under the 'Recovery Progress' flair be default - which I was doing.I would like to be open to more discussions and questions. And I will leave my reddit notifications on. But I hope now that little "Ding!" from my phone can be a chance to relate, communicate and forms some kind of mutual connection, more than just receive praise ...... which I don't need as much as I need actual relations with people.. I am continuing the process of discovering and revealing my authentic experience and sense of self to myself and people around me. It is a process of trying to access the 'natural self' (real self, I guess) that my therapist talked about and we seemed to locate in therapy a few weeks back.Since that time, I have made a concerted effort to feel and let out more of this 'natural self' with friends and family: sharing more of my real thoughts and feelings, expressing myself in a way that feels right for me, while also trying to respect the situation and the other person's feelings and boundaries as best I can. It hasn't been a perfect process, and I continue to make steps forward and then steps back. But there have been some interesting and positive results.As part of all this, I have continued to reflect on what that 'naturalness' or 'realness' is for me and how I can access it.One thing that helped was thinking about some of my 'default modes' and how they appear in my body and mind: how they feel, how I think when I'm in them, and how I feel like behaving.As I've reflected and found more confidence in what feels more natural for me in the moment, I have in turn put these before people, or simply acted more in those ways. Not acted, actually. Just existed in those states with less fear about what people might think, and more ability just to stay there.This has not been easy, because my inner critic has sometimes been screaming at me to not put out what I want to say, or shamed me for thinking or feeling something 'wrong'. But I have tried to push myself to test out how this naturalness is received.So far... so interesting! I'll say a bit about that at the end....As part of my reflections of what that naturalness is, I have for the moment noted three default modes I seem to switch between - although they can occur simultaneously as well. I could further dissect these into submodes (which I do according to the Schema approach).But identifying just three primary default modes of behaviour is actually quite useful (rather than 20!). There would also be self-reflecting / inner-dialogue parts (i.e. my inner critic and more balanced inner mentor, or however you want to say it). But I'm more curious about the default behavioural modes in this instance, because it's been an experiment in how I can be with other people.Here are the three default modes I've come up with so far. It's not a perfect description, and I don't want to think toooo rigidly about it all. But it's something. And it feels more-or-less right and real....I do I have an Adult mode.It comes out in various situations (most strongly with work-related things, but not only). I can 'fake' this mode, but I do also genuinely feel it at other times.If it's strong, then I'm at most balanced, structured, focused and clear in my thinking, have a healthy degree of self-care and self-regulation, and make good efforts to be prosocial in my actions. I am loving of people and cherishing or life. I feel wise! :) I feel respect, gratitude and compassion for others and want to make connections and be helpful. I feel grounded and stable, and very self-refexive. My body is open and welcoming, my breathing stable. I'm all up for encouraging and nurturing other people's wellbeing and growth as well as my own. I listen well and feel a lot of empathy.In this mode, I value mutuality and connectedness, collaboration, peoples' differences and making collective progress. I'm interested in other peoples' perspectives and open to learning....I also have a strong Adolescent mode (oops).I'd say that this can be a nub of my experience, a mode that is most often present or quite strong in my mind in various situations, and that I have to moderate quite a lot through my Adult mode through a lot of self-mentoring. (I'm not feeling it particularly right now. Maybe he's having a nap).If this 'teen mode' is really, really strong - which to be fair happens mostly when I'm alone - I am self-aggrandising, self-adoring, mirror-gazing, autoerotic, self-absorbed, irritable, rebellious, vain (and more vain (and then some)), anxious about social standing and status, of what people think, nervous about my presentation, but also pretty confident people are jealous of / want to fuck me. I feel entitled to admiration/worship and for the world to work in the way that 'I want'. I get annoyed when people do things I don't like or agree with, and is easily bored and irritable when I'm not somewhere in the centre of attention, or when I have to do things for other people. I devalue all over the shop, and get up to loads of bitchy mischief. I'm a thrill-seeker, especially when it comes to feeling sexually excited. I'm grandiose and flirty, getting high on the possibility and power of sexual attraction - and being the centre of all that. I have an urge to pop down to the local gay sauna and have sex all day. Course, it would be all about me....Then I have this Toddler side. I say 'toddler' rather than child, because it seems to feel more right for me. If this mode is strong, I am quite simply a toddler in a middle-aged-man's body. My moods fluctuate from one intensity to another: suddenly angry, sad, happy, elated, manic, joyful, contented, adventurous, silly, excited, lonely, terrified, abandoned, slave-driven, caged-in, enraged. I want to show off and share MEEEEEE 'to Mummy and Daddy' / my friends. I can be full of wonder and energy. Life feels like an adventure, and I can feel connected to nature and people. My mind is full of imagery and curiosities. But then I trip and fall (metaphorically), and have a little (or massive) meltdown. I grab my blue baseball cap and swivel it on my head and it cheers me up no end.I can also be kind in this mode, but more of a childlike kindness of giving people a silly hug or a cheek-placed kiss.I don't really have values in this mode. I just feel. My body distorts into different childish positions. I slump, I sink, I jump, I skip, I wiggle... And my face is like rubber, expressing through garish frowns, silly smiles, sticking my tongue out, sad-sap faces, snarky grins, showing my teeth, wiggling my nose.This mode needs a lot of self-care from my Adult mode. I have come to care for this side of me and feel a lot of self-love....I've tried to keep these different sides of me, and notice which one broadly \*wants\* to come forward. I have been allowing that to come through, testing out to see how they are received, as I said. ...So what have I done?I have shared that I have a PD with more people.I have been talking about what that is like. I have told people about my Toddler and Teen sides and about my extreme emotional experiences.I have told people that I'm incredibly vain and highly sexual. I have worn more provocative and colourful clothing and told people that I have this attention-seeking and slutty side that needs to come out a bit.I have said that I'm suddenly sad in my toddler mode. Or elated. I have pulled my childish faces. I have suddenly done a bit of a dance in the street. I have put my base all cap on in the middle of conversations. In that teen mode again, have allowed myself to dominate more of the conversation sometimes rather than holding back too often.I have felt my irritation, boredom, entitlement, admiration seeking, rage... all the difficult things, and not shoved them in people's faces. I have allowed my face and body to shape or move in alignment with these feelings or urges. But I have capped them from coming out tooooo much, while still acknowledging for myself that they are there. Instead, I have tried to just contain them. Sometimes I have had to pull back or consciously try to access a more Adult stance. I do want to have actual relationships with human beings.It is trial and error. And trying again. ...Early days. But the results are coming in.Turns out that - despite what my inner critic screams at me - my Teen and Toddler sides can have a place, and be acceptable, and even be likeable and enjoyable AND EVEN HELPFUL for people. They do need moderation through my Adult mode, and that feels right for me, too. But yes: they can open other people up a bit. That is awesome....Some people - including my partner, unfortunately - have questioned and even moderately shamed me for when the Teen and Toddler show through more now. That has been rather crushing, and fed my own inner critic and confusion about my sense of self. But ... I am soon reminded that these parts \*are real\*. I feel them. And so, I have a choice: I stay stuck in the old ways I've behaved - acted - trying desperately to be more of that Adult all the time, but which brings me so much anxiety, stress and sorrow - for the lives of the other sides of me unloved.Or:I conținue to bring forward those Teen and Toddler parts - through the appropriate filter of the Adult mode, to be sure (which includes not popping down to the gay sauna, unfortunately) - and people are just going to have to get used to me as more of the dynamic person I am.Because... I love my Teen and Toddler sides. And I want them to have a place. They are me. They are real. I want to live as a real person. A real life. To a decent degree, bearing my life situation and relationships in mind.Something like that.... What I am really enjoying in therapy recently is a kind of dissolving of my false presentation with the therapist, and a kind of allowing myself to be natural in that relationship. I have then been excited to use this experience as a template for my real-world relationships and sense of self, and I can see that it's making for better life satisfaction. Through various sessions, I have seen a shift from this stance of 'being in control' of myself, and 'showing up appropriately or contained' \[in order for the therapist to like me\], and instead just speaking and behaving more freely, so as to let her see more and more of my 'ugly' or 'not ideal' qualities with not so much of a filter; allowing them to appear in a less controlled and more fluid way....In my more defensive (neurotic) stance, I show up as someone who 'knows all my schemas and modes already', and revels the intellectualisation and conceptualisation of my experience and behaviours according to the Schema model. I will say 'appropriate' things like, "A part of me \[or a particular schema mode\] thinks X" or "I can see that my Demanding Parent mode is strong'. My quasi-unconscious intention is to 'show the therapist that I have a healthy part, and that "I got this."' Underlying this, if I dig quite deep, is a background anxiety that the therapist will see that I ... really don't 'have it together', or that she will see things about me that she won't like. I present my 'ugly' parts in quite academic terms, an act that functions to separate my self-concept of 'me' or 'who I am' or my sense of self from 'those ugly parts'....What I noticed when that defence dissolved - in one session in particular - was that I started feeling able to say more what came up in the moment, and express it spontaneously - as I said: with less filtering. I also noticed my body posture shift from more upright and well-presented and attentive, to a little more slumped or relaxed. I heard my voice also soften from the more 'well presented academic tone' to a slightly more street and colloquial "Posh Sauf Lund'n" accent / dialect.I was able to say to her that I felt, for example, suddenly sexual and then quite soon afterwards: sad. Of course, I'd said these things before to her, but in that way that's more 'a part of me, the grandiose part, can feel very sexualised' or 'I feel sad, and (BY THE WAY!) I'm ok with that (just to be clear). I don't mind being sad' - which is again, for me now, a way of managing the presentation of that feeling.Without the filter, it was more: I feel sad. And I actually wanted to cry, and I allowed her to see that for a moment. Not the more overblown crying I had done before. Just subtle. Peering in....We talked about this shift in the session, and the therapist came up with the term: my 'natural self', accessing all these different parts of me without filtering.It really lit me up and energised me.I suddenly felt ... acceptance, both towards myself and from the therapist. I even felt that my real self was likeable - no lovable - or that if it wasn't for other people, it didn't matter to me so much. Because I loved it....I felt excited that I could work with this experience in real life. Since then, which was a couple of weeks ago, I've made a conscious effort to try to recognise and drop my false presentation of 'being 100% well and stable and mature and healthy' and really managing my words and style - from my language to what I wear in certain situations - and leaning more into saying things spontaneously and seeing what happens, despite my fears or sense of shame around potentially saying or doing those things.It turns out, folks, that when I spontaneously say or do things that are outside what I consider 'the norm' or 'what I should say or do', that they are not detestable, or if they are inappropriate for the other person, I can pick up and do a repair job - with an apology or something. Or realise even that it doesn't matter, really. It doesn't matter if the other person didn't like or agree with my style 100%. It actually feels nice when we can be different.I can also see more of a dissolving of my habit to silo-off different parts of myself for different contexts or situations, or hide or show parts depending on who I'm with. I just feel more able to 'be me'. Me: goofy, clownish, emotional, grumpy, quirky, entertaining, a tad unethically flirtatious, antagonistic, spiky, provocative, needy, silly, show-off, disagreeable, self-centred, playful, bumbling, sneaky ... with a tinge of weird malevolence that I'm still coming to terms with.And all my other brilliant facets....All in all, as it turns out. It's more and more ok to be me. People seem to generally be ok with how I show up naturally. OHHHHH!Is this because / after I've done a lot of work on myself... ? Ah, another time.If it could speak, it'd say things like:"You playing that song for the umpteenth time on repeat IS A SIGN THAT YOU ARE MENTALLY ILL AND ABOUT TO HAVE A TERRIFYING PSYCHOTIC BREAK!""Clean the house! Make sure everything is tidy. IF THERE IS ANYTHING OUT OF PLACE, you will be SEVERELY PUNISHED, or something TERRIBLE OR LIFE THREATENING will happen to you!""Other people need you to be there for them. DROP EVERYTHING NOW! OTHERWISE SOMETHING TERRIBLE WILL HAPPEN TO THAT PERSON.""You cannot take a break. You cannot relax. You have to keep working to PROVE YOUR WORTH! YOU ARE OF SO LITTLE VALUE, you need to keep making up for YOUR TOTAL FAILURE OF A LIFE and YOUR PARASITIC NATURE! You should feel SO FUCKING GUILTY for how fucking LAZY YOU ARE compared to others. Look at them struggle while YOU DO FUCK ALL. YOU JUST KEEP WASTING TIME.""You should feel TERRIBLE FOR HOW YOU TREAT PEOPLE!! Your behaviours lead people to a point where they are OUT OF CONTROL. THEY MIGHT KILL THEMSELVES because of you. YOU! YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY REPAIR ANY DAMAGE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!""YOU ARE ABOUT TO GO MAD. No reason. And then YOU WILL DO SOMETHING TO REALLY HURT SOMEONE NEARBY. You have TO CONTROL YOURSELF. YOU WILL KILL OR MAIME SOMEONE ANY SECOND."...Look, I'm a generally decent, over-hard-working bloke who's never really hurt anyone apart from some BPD-style outbursts. So none of the above has any evidence behind it. But my inner terroriser is built from childhood experiences, and keeps taunting that child part of me that is terrified I could do something.And it plays on a loop in my brain in so many situations often during my day.It flashes in my mind not so much as sentences or words, but more as horrific images of what I "could do". It causes a lot of a dissociation and panic.Again, like I've said in other posts, this is related to my co-morbid OCD. But I'm writing about it here as a post in part to take to my therapist. I want to describe to her this critic that is more a terroriser. I'm doing some EMDR and my hope is that I can reduce the impact of this thing on my day-to-day functioning. It's debilitating. I kind of only realised yesterday that my critic was actually more a terrorist. Causing terror....My narcissism or grandiosity created - and still creates - an escape from the torment.I attended an online presentation by Schema Therapy researcher, George Lockwood (coz I'm like that). He's done a lot of research into the needs of infants, and how these needs stay with us throughout our lives.He proposed five sets of core questions that, if we could speak, we as infants were kinda asking our mother and father when we were with them, and that subsequently this 'inner infant' is still there in us all asking everyone we meet.I thought they were relevant to share here. They are:1. Do you see me?2. Do I matter? Does it matter that I'm here?3. Am I good enough as I am?4. Am I special? Do you find me endearing? Do you like being with me?5. Can I be me? Do I have space to be fully myself with you?He talked about the importance of eye contact between infant and parent (and later friends and relatives and therapists) in terms of 'asking' and 'answering' these innate questions, bearing in mind that the parent (or whoever) needed to respect the child's cue for when the eye contact was too intense. (interesting)....His (and others') belief is that Western-style parenting trends are diminishing the amount of quality - and much needed - close contact and nurturance that parents are giving to children in order for them to function well.He focused particularly on the contemporary trend towards early bottle-feeding, early separate sleeping for the child, the relatively swift return to work of the mother after childbirth, and the notion that children should not be molly-coddled at an early age but rather 'cry it out', as all damaging the child's psychological development.He points to historical and current indigenous populations for evidence of humans actually needing many years of close contact with the mother, particularly at night while the child is sleeping on and off, to regulate their emotions, their self-image and connection with others.He suggests that the the reduction in mother-child contact in our societies is a key factor in the rise of depression and anxiety and other mental health illnesses....For me, the questions above really resonate in relation to my experience of NPD as an adult. I can see that I'm really wanting them to be answered positively by others. It's like I'm almost begging for it (and not in a good way ;)). But that I tend to assume that they won't be 'answered' well (based on my infant experience, I wonder?).These ideas also give a possible explanation as to why people generally say that societies are becoming increasingly narcissistic....Hm. It seems we are not alone in our search for validation. Nor in our emotional deprivation and suffering. Nor in our narcissism!Ugh! I hate it when I'm normal!...No, actually, wait! Fear not! Coz I reckon - feel in my bones! - we are definitely still The Most Emotionally Abandoned and therefore Most Narcissistic of all!! Yay!So everything's alright, and you can go back to sleep. Nunnite. Daddy P.. I heard from a therapist in the last year or so that an intense fear of losing control might be common amongst pwNPD. I certainly relate and I wondered if others did too.I just had a stream of panic attacks this afternoon, which I connect to this fear. It was while I was socialising, which was challenging. But the good news is I was able to manage and maybe even grow through it....I've had this kind of panic attack since I was a teen - so over 25 years at least. It's come and gone and got easier to manage and be with, but it can still feel pretty nasty.I experience it as a few things happening all at once, or in very quick succession:There is usually some triggering experience or misperception of my social situation. It could be that I say or do something quite innocently, but that I think I see a dodgy look from someone that comes with the thought, "Oh! I bet they think I'm weird." This can then trigger anxiety, which builds very quickly into a surge of fear and a strong flight stress response.I typically also quickly start to experience intense Depersonalisation / Derealisation (DPDR). This form of dissociation brings with it a kind of brain fog, distorted vision and some giddiness.This tends to quickly lead me to have racing thoughts, where a part of me is hyperanalysing my experience and worrying / catastrophising that "something terrible is about to happen" and "I am going to go mad, lose control of my faculties, have a psychotic break, start hallucinating horrific images, and do something awful to someone, or say something inappropriate" and be socially humiliated, shunned and rejected.I then get intrusive flashing images of all of this happening or about to happen.This all swells to a peak of panic. This then leads me to automatically want to do something to "control" the situation. Through CBT I have learnt that these controlling measures unfortunately reinforce the underlying fear that "something bad will happen UNLESS I control myself" and "I need to control myself" and "I am dangerous".Some of these controlling impulses might be: leaving the social situation; or telling myself some controlling message like "Stop it! Stop it!" ...I've had some CBT for comorbid OCD.Over the years, I've learnt to recognise that all of the above is an OCD or panic attack, and not actually going to happen. More and more, I can do this during the panic. That doesn't necessarily quell the intensity of feelings straight away, but it helps, and I can now more easily just allow the peaks to come and go.The more recent understanding that all this might be related to an underlying fear of losing control is also helpful.I have come to know that activating this kind of interpretation, or any other kind of thinking related to executive functioning (i.e. mindfulness / meta-awareness, reflective thinking, compassion etc) helps to quieten the amygdala response, and so reduce the panic.There was a time when I was having panic attacks throughout the day. But now I can manage it much better.As a result, my panics don't last as long as they used to, and I can function *more or less* without so much disturbance.But fuck: it's still difficult and horrid in the moment....Relating this to other issues associated with NPD, I have wondered if one common thread linking these panic experiences is that they tend to occur when a) I'm socialising and b) I'm being quite extroverted, even - damn it - authentic.So there's that potential association:Show up as "real" or more flamboyant, and experience some terrible panic.I have also traced this to childhood memories where I did show up as my flamboyant self and was directly and overtly shunned or rejected by my parents and others (school bullies etc) for doing so. I wonder if my brain is taking the experience of "being authentic" as "highly dangerous", therefore triggering the panic.I can't be sure, but I think it's an interesting possibility that I can certainly imagine and relate to. It makes sense.I think this has historically made it hard to actually do the work of being authentic.I have shyed away from social situations, and over-controlled my outwars expression to "stay safe."It also just caused me to maintain the fear....But ...Good news, babes! Today I fuckin' stayed through the panic and continued to be authentically extroverted and flamboyant amongst my pals.Fuckin' triumph, mate. 🤘🏻...8Fuck this fucking disorder. 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻. Not what anyone would expect from a narcissist. But I do have this habit, tendency, mode in particular social situations.My grandiosity appears at other times to compensate for my self-diminshing. 100% that's how my narcissism works.But in certain contexts, I will unconsciously hold myself back. I will self-inhibit....We have friends of my partner's staying this weekend again. They arrived yesterday, and despite my best efforts, I was feeling anxious, flawed, lonely and sad after one night of being with them. It's not all that's going on. There were some happy moments. But those parts were and are strong....I'm out on my bike this morning to get some air and privacy; get me back my sense of self, which feels obliterated. Little tears rolling. They reveal my underlying stress and sorrow.I'm using the time now to reflect on what's going on. What memories are coming up in connection with the present? How do they make me feel? What would a "good friend" or advisor or caring person do or say to help me feel better? ...I realised that there were distinct moments in the conversations with the friends where I stopped myself from speaking up from a place of actual expertise, or sharing my talents and abilities.Self-limiting. Self-sacrifice. Self-subjugation.Again.It's embarrassing how frequently these themes come up here for me. But I guess I'm maybe slowly chipping away at life-long habits....Example:I can play the piano pretty damn well. I'm an actual piano teacher. It's taken me 30 years of playing, and much self work and therapy, to feel good about my playing. But I can be good. I enjoy it.One of our friends is also a musician. But I am objectively more experienced and technically better. I wanted to play during the evening yesterday. It helps me connect with myself and find my confidence. But I quietly told myself that I shouldn't do that because it could bring up vulnerabilities in the friend. I really said that to myself.Or it could look like I was showing off. It would ne awkward afterwards.I felt vulnerable in even thinking about playing. It felt off. So I cut my nose to spite myself. I just sat there chatting with the people, feeling awkward and anxious anyway. ...Now, you could say that I was being kind and thoughtful regarding the feelings of the friend, and in some ways I was. But it was over-kind and over-thoughtful.Because in comparison, the friend was quite happy to talk about her opinions, ideas and expertise.And my partner "shows off" with his great cooking skills, which everyone appreciates....But me? I'm left there: not sharing, and holding myself back, dumbing myself down unnecessarily in other ways. Not revealing expertise in conversation. Selling myself short in stories of my various projects and ambitions. Putting a lid on how much intelligence comes across....Why? Why the fuck do I do this? Still! Thoughts pop up in my mind:Not wanting others to feel small. Well ain't that nice. A protecting veil.Not wanting to be seen as arrogant. Not wanting to be rejected because I "think I'm better than everyone else"....Oh!! Now there's something.Memories from school days float to the surface. Of me feeling like I need to dumb myself down, not share, not reveal, in order to fit in.Feeling socially isolated because I was the clever kid.Being bullied because I did well in school or was a good kid.Being bullied or ostracised because of my interests and passions.All things that's an adult I know are wrong and not worth worrying about. But my child self is still haunted by these memories. They hang in the mind of my mind unknowingly shaping my behaviours in the present.Interestingly, also at school, I was often a self-proclaimed protector of people who were being treated badly. I would stand up for them or just be with them when they were down. I was kind. But I also blocked out my other strengths in the process of trying to be nice to others....My inner advisor says:"You are free from thise bullies in the past. You don't have to swlf-limit any more. You're not in school. You're not a teenager. You are free to share your strengths and abilities. You are capable in various ways, and adults generally like to see the capabilities of others come through. You know this for yourself because you were enjoying the strengths of the friends last night at certain points.""Get back on your bike. Go back home. Stand tall. Have a coffee. Play that piano. Enjoy it."🚲...Quietening myself out of fear or for the sake of others; not voicing my preferences, interests, pursuits; not sharing my abilities.These are key themes, stories, or my life.Another is trying to undo it all, find and be myself with more ease.Traits of NPD tend to be approached with confrontation and limit-setting in wider society and even in therapy.When I look at or experience treatment for NPD, I see much more leaning towards confronting the dysfunctional traits, putting a limit on them, bypassing them.The message I receive is that 'the narcissist is wrong, has done something bad, and needs to change.' \_\_\_\_\_\_It's no wonder then that pwNPD are said to struggle with therapy if this the stance or approach taken.If therapists or friends or partners go straight in with confrontation or limiting aspects of someone's personality, who is going to respond well to that?These modalties do have a place, but I think they are over-emphasised and too often a first port of call. Quite frankly, they are also easy options for outsiders. It's easier to dismiss and punish narcissistic behaviours rather than try to understand them. The narcissist is blamed, shunned. Other people can get on with their lives. It's easy.In my own therapy, I also experience a kind of shunning of my narcissism. I have been told that my grandiose parts are 'in the way' from 'proper treatment'. They feel dismissed. Ignored. Now, I'm happy to admit that I need to explore this with my therapist, and I could be wrong to a degree. But I also think there's an element of truth about it.The problem, for me, is that if you tell me that parts of my personality are not welcome, I can feel more antagonistic and rebellious. I lean into the grandiosity even more, which doesn't help me resolve past traumas. It's a shot in the foot, I know, but it's how it works. It's a mechanism that goes off.But why wouldn't I act like this? This is a part of me being put aside. It doesn't feel good.\_\_\_\_\_\_Why am I and other pwNPD so very sensitive and 'unhelpful' in treatment in the ways I've described? It's not because we are juvenile monsters and simply 'need to grow up' or 'quieten down'.Instead, it's often because of early childhood neglect. Things we didn't get from our parents. Needs that weren't met, setting up our behavioural impulses.Things like: lack of healthy attention and nurturance; over-control and criticism; belittling and shaming; being set too high standards to achieve, or given too much responsibility; or parents who lacked responsibility in setting up structures, guidance and limits for the child.It's a lot for anyone to bear. So when any additional 'should' or 'must' or even 'could do' lands in our way from outside, we can be highly reactive. When we are confronted with 'you did something wrong and you need to change', we don't respond well. Because this is essentially what we've heard in one way or another from an early age. It triggers a lot of emotional wounds that show up as antagonism.\_\_\_\_\_\_What I think is more helpful is to look past the reactive behaviour, and see the person who is struggling with a very strong inner critic and concurrent feeling of defectiveness developed through the kinds of experiences listed above.pwNPD - like any other human being - need:\* to feel more free from our inner critic\* to know how to recognise and soothe our vulnerabilities\* someone to say, "I understand why you get so reactive. It makes sense to me."\* and, "You are fine. I like you. I love you, as you are - warts and all."\* and, "Who do **you** want to be? What would **you** like to do? How can I help you?"Then, within that, we also of course need structures and limits. We need to be guided towards realistic expectations, putting in reasonable efforts, and making empathic considerations regarding how our behaviours affect our relationships, other people, and ultimately ourselves. And yes, there may need to be limit-setting and some confrontation when behaviours get out of hand. But it needs to come from that initial empathy for our emotional sensitivities and sore points, protection from the critic, and encouragement to develop our autonomy and sense of competency.\_\_\_\_\_\_Help me feel like there's room for me to be me, grow and express myself; be myself. Help me release the grip of my inner critic. Help me tend to my wounds. Help me to dream and feel free.I need these over and above being told what to do. Trust me that I can work it out if I'm given the freedom to grow in my own way.I sometimes use an imagery technique when I’m in a really shitty place. It can really help me in all sorts of ways depending on how I use it.I was in a really low place today. I used the technique and it worked, so I wanted to share it here.The technique is all about bringing to mind an imaginary supportive figure to talk to us and guide us.As far as I understand, it’s a way of activating our own internal mental resources, via the imagination. With practice and time, I have found it easier to do this, and the approach has really helped me through some very difficult times.I believe there’s evidence to show that the brain doesn’t totally distinguish imagination from reality and memory. The three are somewhat interconnected. Working with imagination is therefore partly interpreted in the mind as having actually happened. So by imagining a supportive person to come to our side, be with us, talk to us, act on our behalf and even suggest how we might behave to help ourselves, we partly experience it as reality.I use the imaginary person to help me understand and meet my needs in difficult times. Sometimes when I’m really entangled in intense emotions, I find it confusing to know what my needs even are. So I have found it helps more to ask myself: ‘Who do I need? What kind of person do I need to help me right now, and how would they act to help me?’The person that comes to mind could be someone in my real life, or someone from TV, Film, YouTube, some well known person. Over a few years of using this technique, I have built up a collection of imaginary helpers, ranging from actual therapists, friends, meditation teachers, my sister, friends, and even celebrities. It’s basically anyone that I associate as being able to fulfil that need in the moment.I have five categories of these imaginary helpers. I’m not totally fixed on the names, because there is some crossover, but this is it anyways. I also tend to use them in this order, but always.**Overseer:** This person is a very calm starting point. They are there to sense broadly what’s going on, and then point me in the direction of other imaginary figures.**Carer**: This person is there to validate my feelings and offering some alleviation through kind and gentle words of understanding. When I’m depressed, sad, angry, worried … whatever it is, I imagine this very warm-hearted person softly saying, ‘I see you’re feeling \[sad\], it makes sense, and I’m so sorry you feel like this.’ I imagine them at my bedside with their hand resting on me as I breathe, just allowing me to feel whatever it is, and offering me support just by validating my experience. This has really helped me. I don’t know, I just find it so soothing. When I’ve not been able to sleep through the intensity of my emotions, it has allowed me to relax and fall asleep. **Advocate:** This is usually a strong, sturdy figure who comes in to protect me from unhelpful criticism or hard words from others. I also use it when my inner critic is bashing me, playing out an imaginary dialogue between the Critic and Advocate (who I always make sure wins). My advocate stands up for me against the criticism or negativity. I imagine them doing this. They defend me in a very diplomatic and contained way. It’s never aggressive, but instead about gently but sturdily asserting my needs, rights, explaining my feelings and the reasons they are there. It helps me to feel good about myself, reminds me of my values, needs, rights, and sense of self.**Mentor:** This is someone I bring to mind to help me in making decisions on how to act. It’s usually someone I consider very wise, but also understanding of my situation, and on my side. Still, if I feel like behaving like a dick, they will advise me not to act out, but instead reflect on why I’m feeling hostile, grumpy or antagonistic, and try to understand and soothe the underlying feelings of fear, sadness, frustration, or whatever. They have a tempering, moderating quality, aiming to make sure I act for the greater good.**Encourager:** I’m not sure on the name of this one. It could also be ‘Cultivator’ or ‘Nurturer’, but I think none of them capture it entirely. It’s a person who comes to try to activate joy and creativity. If I’m in a really bad place, I’ve imagined them coming in to remind me to put music on and dance (which I love to do). Or they might suggest I take a walk in nature, or get me to see the funny side of things, cracking a joke with me. They remind me of my interests and goals, my preferences and my good qualities. So that’s it. I’m not convinced I’ve written it out perfectly, but : it has really helped me. Maybe it’ll help someone else. Give it a try. It’d be interesting to know how it goes.
    I never realized that feeling like your pain is "better" than someone else's can be a sign that you feel superior to them. I always imagine narcissists as people that dislike being weak and showing vulnerability. Not showing any weakness or frailty. I picture them as grandiose not covert. Like most people do. I have recently realized that I am a covert narcissist. I have suspected this for some time but I am 100 percent sure now because of a recent post here. I enjoy showing people my pain. I love getting the attention and the sympathy. There is nothing better than that. It's like the more miserable I am the better. The more worthless, shitty, inadequate, small, insecure, pitiable I feel the more I relish in it. I feel kind of disgusted and ashamed with myself to admit this. Being covert is a strange experience. I haven't met anybody from my country on the app. Why not both?. I have little attachment to my country and have a hard time feeling proud of my people whether it's athletic champions, musicians, writers, etc. I feel that that's their accomplishment not mine. I don't understand why people feel proud of them. I think this may be because I don't feel represented/relate to them.I read that anhedonia has something to do with it but is there something more at play here? I have always had a difficult time feeling positive emotions and when I do I don't feel comfortable expressing them. It feels unnatural and not safe. (Emotions feel overwhelming in general).This is mostly with other people. I don't feel comfortable showing them positive emotions because I was bullied when I was younger (this goes way back since I was like 8) for reasons and whenever i did feel them, whenever i laughed or smiled alot, i was made a big deal of so there is an element of social anxiety here too but it's not the full story. I don't want this post to solely get responses about this problem being caused by the bullying because the bullying was caused by not feeling emotions at all. Me podrian informar sobre cuales tipos de grupos o meetups hay en san juan o en el area metro en general? Me interesa mas bien grupos de personas con autismo, "geek", gamers y sobre costura. Se q en facebook existen grupos con esos intereses pero ademas de facebook donde puedo encontrar personas con mis intereses. I see many posts by members saying that they got diagnosed. This makes me wonder how. I have been trying to get diagnosed for a while now and my psychologist doesn't take it seriously. She just brushes it aside and goes on how I can better my life. Of course this is important and I realize that this is the whole point of therapy but I feel like getting a diagnosis would add a possible new spin on my treatment overall. I think she just doesn't believe in diagnoses and treats the symptoms instead. This seems to be the case with my past psychologists too. Most of them never bothered with one either. I have brought it up at times but again nobody takes it seriously. Maybe I am not communicating it clearly. Thats possible since I have a hard time expressing myself well enough. I also think that maybe this could be a regional/country thing. I live in Puerto Rico and Hispanics tend not to take mental health seriously. We dont like to talk about it and treat it as if it was something to be swept under the rug. I don't know if I should bother bringing it again. I've never been a very talkative person. I have always sorta kept to myself: only speaking when spoken to, nodding yes or no, etc.. Never had many friends or people i felt comfortable talking to. I was a loner in school and missed out on alot because of this. I suck at making conversation because i have zero social skills and never practiced much. I don't get anything when speaking to someone. What I mean by this is that I don't feel any joy or pleasure when I talk to people. I mostly feel a bit annoyed when I have to talk. Its almost like a burden. I feel a bit ashamed about this. I dont understand why I am this way. This isn't just when i have conversations. This is even with yes or no questions. Even with small social niceties. I feel no sense of connection with people. They are like some abstract thing that I don't really understand or want. How can I feel something besides annoyance when I talk to people? I can't connect with anyone because of this. I want to feel positive feelings when I talk to people.
    Second post in a row but I’m confuuuused. My memory has turned to shit and I can’t focus on anything. My problem solving is 0 and I have to turn to others to tell me what to do. I’m clumsy and slam doors accidentally and knock things over. I’m just embarrassing myself everywhere. I was never like this and could solve things very easily before. Would you mind sharing your journey/experience with that?. I’m not sure what to do. I still have relationships with my family and my best friend and now I realize that the person they know is a fabrication. Now in conversations I just have nothing to say or contribute. I think of jokes or things to say and realize they’re so superficial and just basic things to say so I don’t. Because I don’t want to be fake. But then it’s just awkward and nobody knows what to do and I just make some excuse to leave or for them to leave. I look around my room at my decorations and realize I can’t identify with them anymore. And I used to be so proud of what they represented on behalf of me. I thought I was so cool and down to earth and relatable. I have a job I need to keep a front for. I’m losing my ability to actually focus on the job because this is all I can think about. I work directly with the public and coworkers and need to be able to at least communicate with them but I’m losing my vocabulary and everything. Forming sentences is like impossible I’m so fucking lost. How do you navigate this?. I know I need therapy. A lot of it. But I’m craving comfort and I know that should not be the reason for going. I feel too fragile to face anything right now and I’m afraid a therapist would (in my best interest) break me a little so I can start my recovery process. So I’m trying to motivate myself to just do it ✔️ lolWhat does therapy look like for you guys and how is it beneficial to you?. So I just moved back in with my dad. I’m 24F. My mom died in an accident when I was 5. I was raised by my dad and a network of his friends on top of some babysitters. So I’m aware he can’t have the full picture of how exactly I was brought up, but I’ve been asking him questions and trying to clarify some things so I can understand why I am the way I am. I keep getting answers of “you were so loved” and such. But I don’t know. I remember being a kid and having nightmares about my dad yelling and throwing things. I was terrified of him in that way. I haven’t brought this up to him because he’s being kind and supportive and I’m scared of what might happen if I confront him with these memories. My childhood friend has a memory of him holding a pillow over my face for a while… but he’s so hippie and chill now. Only smokes weed and plays guitar. Super Buddhist. I experienced some SA from a certain babysitter. Extreme emotional neglect from one I had right after my mother passed. Others were teenagers who gave me beer and took my sister and I to the cemetery to scare us. I have asked him about earlier stages in my life (first 1000 days) and he swears everything was normal. But then why do I have such a hard time connecting to people? Or maybe it’s just attachment trauma from my mom passing? But I developed grandiose thinking and pushed myself away from both my dad and sister claiming to be the “black sheep” that nobody understood. I was moody and snarky and antisocial. I was put in spec ed in elementary school for a speech impediment. Apparently when I was even younger nobody could understand me when I tried to talk. I’m wondering if maybe that points to autism? My grades were poor until my dad expressed disappointment and then I became an overachieving straight A student until graduation. This is such a ramble and I’m sorry. My brain is in huge denial of everything and I feel disconnected from myself and my past. I’m dissociating so hard that I’m losing frontal lobe functioning and forgetting words and grammar :/ so sorry if this all doesn’t fit together or make sense. Do you all have any advice? I want to sit down with my dad and get an honest recap of my childhood since I can’t remember much. But I’m afraid he will distort information in order to come off as a better parent. He wouldn’t let me invite friends over several times in the past if the house was messy and he never attended school functions because he was scared the other parents would judge him. Also criticized my outfit choices and how they would reflect on him as a parent. He’s pushing to get me in therapy while I’m still on his insurance. Maybe it’s my black and white thinking but I’m just so confused on how to approach anything with him… is he partly to blame or was it just major misfortune and bad luck that led to this?. It feels like you all have personalities. Souls. Selves. When I read your posts and comments, I can see your humor and intelligence and that you all have different opinions on things. Enjoy different things. Experience different things. I see a soul in pretty much all of you. I know we all feel robotic, and at the moment I feel more robotic than ever. (I tend to be pretty witty and funny when I text but that’s all disappearing for me apparently)But I know it’s there in me. And I see it in all of you, too. There is potential in all of us. There are genuine things behind us. I’m not sure if it’s just masking but *some* part of you guys come up with these things, and that’s something. I just wanted to say that. I could write an essay on my complex feelings about death reaching back into my childhood and I did, lol, and deleted it. As much as I’d love to write a autobiography for supply, I’ll resistI guess I’m just wondering how everyone deals with the possibility of punishment after dying?. Do you feel any kind of happiness, gratefulness, appreciation, anything like that? Connection to people?. And if it’s mirroring and manipulation and cleverness that gets me there, what’s the problem? I feel good and they feel good. I’m not malignant. I don’t enjoy making anyone feel bad. If I even get a whiff that I may have said something insensitive I immediately backtrack and try to fix the situation. I don’t know, man. I’m definitely deluded right now and I guess hoping for someone to bring me back to earth. Or validate if this is okay. If I could just go back to being the funny and kind girl I was, would there be something wrong with that? Fake me is me and everyone around me at their happiest. Even if I’m a bit self centered and doing it for my own life satisfaction. Fuuuck. I’m curious what yalls dreams are like. Mine, since childhood, have always had almost nothing to do with my real life or the people in it. They’re usually something out of a fiction novel. I used to have repetitive dreams as a kid about being an undercover spy. I almost thought it was true. Or I had several about being a fairy or a mermaid. I’m not sure if that’s normal or not. Mine now are always based around relationships or friendships. Mainly just people liking me and wanting to be around me. I always banter with these people and just feel wanted and needed, and like we’re all having a good time. How about yours?. And it was amazing. I wish I could go back. I was singing in the shower and feeling pretty and now I’m back to wait who am I? Fuck. If I can be grandiose and follow moral rules I’d be set. But now that I collapsed I can’t stay there, even though I have (maybe fake) confidence I could do it without hurting others. I remember when I was very young I cried at a scene in a movie because they were separating an orphaned brother and sister. I hope this means that I have empathy in there somewhere, I just need to access it again. Every time I try, though, I feel obligated to solve everyone’s problems. Especially with all the fucked up shit going on in the world, I’m not sure I can take on empathy at the moment. I wish I could start small but even just my partner having a rough day at work triggers me and I almost get defensive for the OTHER people who made his day awful. I just had a call with my sister who met this amazing guy who is super into her and I was just envious and mad that I’ll never be able to have that. Some part of me doesn’t even understand empathy. Like, how am I supposed to feel your feelings without inheriting them as my own? Idk I also don’t CARE. Like I just want everything to be playful banter and fun ): I can’t take these emotions idk what to do with them besides say sorry. Or be jealous if it’s positive emotion. I get resentful. Ugh. wtf even is this life?. I know the facts of my life but I don’t have memories attached to them necessarily. I used to I think. Idk now when I think of my memories I get super uncomfortable and my mind puts a shit ton of space between them and me I can’t go deeper than like a picture of the memory. I can’t think straight right now, my mind goes blank literally every two seconds, I feel on the verge of a panic attack but I keep dissociating constantly to stay out of it cause I have a shit ton of stress that’s very time sensitive and I cannot lose function. It feels like losing my train of thought every two seconds. I’m so scared I won’t be able to ever connect with ANYTHING. My dear cat who I’ve had since I was 6 has been missing, presumed dead, for seven months and I can’t bring myself to think about her. Or remember her. And when I do I don’t get that emotional. What’s wrong with me? Is this ASPD not NPD? Ik you guys can’t answer thatOkay I have to go cause my brain in not cooperating. Edit- this became more of a relationship post lol. So if any of you have partners I would greatly appreciate a read and advice if you have anyI’m still collapsing further and further, and I’m not very eloquent at the moment so I’m sorry if any of this doesn’t make much senseBut if we don’t have a self, wtf can we do? Just live as nothingness? I have a partner who I am losing soon because I think he’ll be better off without me. Honestly. Even though he’s cared for me like no one in this world. (Rambling oops, anyways) But the last month or so since learning about NPD it feels like I’ve noticed that everything I did and said was tailored to his tastes. Like I noticed I adopted his personality. And so I caught myself doing this and now stop myself. And we have literally ONLY had small talk. And hours and hours of not talking, just on our phones or something. I can’t think of anything to talk about and when we watch shows I can’t pay attention or form any kinds of opinions on what’s happening. I can’t relate it to anywhere and therefore have no “ground” to stand on. If I’m really nothing, I have nothing to offer. I used to entertain and have so much fun with my partner. I guess what I’m trying to say instead of going on side quests, is can’t I just stay who I was for him? Is there harm in that? If I can stay away from the manipulation part of things, is it okay? And what if all of this masking is actually just manipulation to get him to love me? God I hate this so much. It’s fucking torture. lol I’m convinced I was a narc since birth. As a kid I went to school with a princess crown and dress every day. I refused to wear anything else. I cheated at every board game. I would get so mad if I lost at anything and would go days without talking to the person who beat me. I loved going to get shots because I wouldn’t cry and it made me feel superior. I gave up on skills if I wasn’t immediately good at it and would hate anyone who could do it. I stole quite a bit from people at school and also grocery storesI’m curious if anyone remembers what they were like as kids?. I’m considering getting another kitty after mine went missing 6 months ago ): I had her since I was 6 and she was my world, and my NPD is getting in the way of grieving. It’s like she was never there. But she helped me so much. I don’t want to betray her by getting another cat, but I need some support. Have animals helped you while going through a tough collapse?. This song from Arcane reminds me so much of my NPD 🥺😭 Wasn’t sure how to flair this but I wanted to share it if yall haven’t heard it yet and see if anyone relates. It takes me like 3x longer than usual to do something. I have to think every tiny motion and action through. Things that should be so automatic. I forgot my grammar and speech and everything. I feel mentally disabled. I can’t function at ALL. Is this normal?. Even if I had friends I wouldn’t ever be able to connect with them. I can’t connect with my family. How does ANYONE accept this?. I just went to dinner with my best friend from elementary school and she mentioned something about being so scared of my dad every time she came over. I was like ? Because I have memories of him yelling and I remember having nightmares of just him screaming at me. But I asked her what she remembered bc I’ve always had that feeling but my dad is so chilled out now and very distant but caring? And she told me one memory she had of me and her playing with my sister. We always wanted to hang out w eachother and my sister always annoyed us w wanting our attention. (She’s my little sister. And I feel a bit bad about this now, but remember she also tended to overreact) and my friend put a pillow over her face. My sister stormed off crying to my dad and he apparently came running towards me and pinned me down and put a pillow over my face thinking I’d done it. She remembers me yelling and telling him it wasn’t me ): idk how to process this and how much deeper it could possibly go. So, my birthday is 06/06/2000. I remember my dad joking about me being the devil secretly. And I loved that shit. I was like “hell yea 666, rebel!” My friends at school even started calling me Satan, not in a mean way I don’t think. It was more of a joke. Well, my first ever two tax returns were BOTH EXACTLY 666$ back. Now that I’m coming to awareness I realize I see it everywhere. Idk if this sounds super woo woo or not but I swear it’s just uncanny. And the angel number 666 literally means “you gotta stop and evaluate your life. You’re focusing too much on the superficial and materialistic things.” Idk it’s just odd to me and I was wondering if you guys notice that number?. I’m right on the cusp of falling into one, I’m in it like 10% and fighting my ass off to not let it keep going. I’m on probation because I got a DUI ): can’t even drink to help. I’m so scared. I’m not strong enough to tolerate that much pain and I’m also living with my partner, we’re separating at the end of our lease, though. I don’t want to go through it with him here because I’ll probably coerce him into comforting me. He fell in love with my false self.It’s absolutely unbearable. I feel like I’m dying. Hi all! Im recently suspecting NPD, I’m pretty convinced. I know yall can’t diagnose me. I’m feeling intense fear for going through the process of collapse. I’m trying to ignore it so much before I go actually insane. I’m scared that if I give into the fear and shame and guilt, my mind literally won’t be able to handle it. I can’t take that much pain at once. I can’t believe we’re all going through this. After you collapse, everything else collapses. I want to badly to be held by a mother while it goes down. How is anyone supposed to heal from this, especially this late?. As soon as I got out of high school, I got horrible anxiety and dread seemingly out of nowhere. My whole identity and personality collapsed. I couldn’t hang out with friends or family because I would be so nervous the entire time. When I went to therapy my main complaint was that I wasn’t who I used to be. I used to be confident and funny, people liked being around me. Started meds and felt immensely better. I’m still trying to find out if I have NPD. It scared me a lot. I do seek validation and attention from people, but everyone in my life believes me to be a good person. I’m overthinking everything though and would just like to know if that was a collapse without self awareness.. I started Zoloft 100mg (directly after trying Effexor) four days ago and oh my for the anxiety is unbearable. I’ve also come to strongly suspect myself of NPD, or maybe I’m just a huge piece of shit. I don’t remember much of my childhood. I know my mother passed when I was 5 and her and my dad were off and on when she was alive. I know I experienced some CSA but on me to another child by manipulation from a babysitter. I know I started writing stories about characters getting madly bullied in 1st grade and imagined they were me. It gave me pleasure. I fantasized about being bullied. I know I had frequent nightmares/ sleep paralysis/ straight fear of dying or someone else dying. It would keep me up. My dad worked nights, though and I usually tried finding comfort in a babysitter who was actually just a guy my dad knew who smoked cigarettes in the house and never really interacted that much with us. I remember I’d go to the living room and he’d be watching tv and would tell me “just go to sleep” and I would stay and watch tv trying to calm myself down until forcing myself back into mine and my sisters room. It eventually developed where I’d have to sleep in my sisters bed with her because I genuinely was so scared. She ended up telling my friends it was super embarrassing. Anyways, this is definitely not the sub for this I can’t believe I just ranted about all that. I’ve just been freaking out more than usual and would like some comfort in knowing it’s partly due to the meds and not my realization that I’ve been emotionally detached from everyone and everything forever and hurt people in the process (:. Or I’m at the very least a narcissist. Or have certainly behaved and thought like one to a pretty high extent. When it all dawned on me and I became self aware of it, I felt scared. Terrified. I always thought I was a good person, but I was acting selfishly. I feel like I need to isolate myself from the entire world. I’m selfish and self absorbed. I don’t actually care about people. I don’t want to be lonely. I do love having friends and being around people. I know I could probably change with work, I do have empathy I just choose not to feel it and try to give help in a way that’s less painful for me. I don’t know. I don’t know what to do. Therapy is on the list. I feel tempted to just going back to my old ways because I felt happy and comfortable. Nervous af. Give me some success stories!. I just started meditating again after a few years off because I’ve become sort of numb. I can’t even transcribe my thoughts anymore it’s just gibberish at this point. Now that I’m meditating again (breath focused mindfulness) it’s like I can focus on my breath and be “thinking” at the same time. I’m not sure how to approach this since I remember last time I was consumed in thoughts and had to return back to my breath. It was great and took some effort like building a muscle in my brain. I’m not getting that this time… I’m focused on my breath and the gibberish in my head is playing 24/7 anyways. I can’t make it stop, it’s as though I’ve become so good at running on autopilot the past few years I can get things done but my main priority is still my head. Any tips please?Edit: I think labeling might come in handy for this? I’m trying to start over on my HeadSpace app and it said to make sure I feel confident and comfortable with this basics before moving on. If you’re gonna judge me or say negative things, just leave. I’m asking for advice. Please. I’m fully ready to face my consequences just looking for people with experience as this is my first offense. So, Friday-Saturday I drank pretty heavily. Probably 15 drinks total. No drinking Sunday. Monday morning had 10 ish drinks learning I didn’t need to test. I bought those larger shooters assuming they were about a shot and a half each (I KNOW IM STUPID) later found out they’re pretty much three each. Had to test Tuesday. I waited as long as I could and had about 43 hrs since my last drink. It’s always sent to a lab. I’ve spoken to my PO and she has witnessed how much trouble I have peeing in front of someone. I’ve joked several times about how I’d need to drink an absurd amount of water next time. Well… figured my best chance was diluting the fuck out of it and using it as an excuse and being extra cautious/ stop drinking at all in the future. Figure she might let me off for that. Soooo after learning I had to test at 2am Tuesday I drank sooooo much water. At least like 150ml. I probably had 50-60ml within an hour of the test. What are the chances I diluted enough to “pass” this shit? Thanks in advance for all the supportive people and fuck off for the judgement (: Edit: this would be my first violation ever if she decides to push it. What can I expect from that? I’m prepared to restart my sentence and face jail time. She seems chill and never even knows my UA scores till I get there. She has to pull them up and check them. She scheduled our next check in three months out because I’m “so compliant”. Edit: I needed to add that I took like 10 500nl etg test strips leading up to the test while hydrating and they all came out negative. Not a super faint line either, like pretty visible and obvious. I know these aren’t super accurate and labs have a bunch of specialized equipment for that stuff. But i would much rather have a dilute I could explain and excuse than a fail. I don’t want to unnecessarily snitch on myself, ya know?Edit: lab cutoff is 500nlEdit: I’m 24, 132 lbs, 5’8, female. If you’re gonna judge me or say negative things, just leave.

There was this guy with a few YouTube videos about TM and meditation in general. He mainly touched on anxiety. I remember a specific video of him on the grass with water and a city in the background doing an interview with his co workers about meditating. He’s the reason I got into TM. He also had lots of videos of him on stage with large pieces of paper explaining the ins and outs of anxiety. His name was Ken or something. I’ve been searching forever and can’t find a single trace of him. I know he’s a business man of some kind. Does anyone else know this dude?. I was on Zoloft like five years ago and it wass absolutely amazing. After stupidly going cold turkey I got back on maybe a year later and it didn’t do shit even at a higher dose than I previously had. But I can’t stop thinking about how well it worked for me that one time and considering trying it out again. I’m currently on Lexapro and it’s not helping. Has anyone experienced this? Is it possible it will work again if it’s been so long?(Also I was on Zoloft that second time that it didn’t work for like seven months with still no effect). So… I feel horrible, hopeless. I used to be so fun. I used to have friends and I loved them more than anything, just making them laugh was all I needed. It made me so happy to make people happy. And I’ve abandoned everyone. Everyone. I’m not me anymore. I can’t bear it. I’m only 23 and I’ve been going through this since I was 18 after graduating. It started off as being so fucking fearful always. I wasn’t thinking MY thoughts anymore. I don’t even have opinions anymore. I don’t even care. And it makes me so SAD like not even sad I mean like sobbing into my pillow wishing I was never even born because wtf happened to me. What’s wrong with me?? I was so hopeful and happy. I wanted to dance on the beach and bathe in waterfalls and laugh and laugh and laugh with all my friends and meet new people and discover all the beautiful things about them. And just love. I just wanted to love, it’s the moser beautiful thing that exists. And I can’t even feel it anymore. I can’t think. I’m having 1000000 thoughts at the same time it’s like I’m not even thinking. I can barely read or pay attention to anything I have to watch memes 10 times before I can even react in any way. I miss finding things funny. I miss making jokes and being witty and loving and a reliable friend. I’ve lost the life I worked hard for. I loved so hard. I did everything for everyone because I just loved that. Now I’m mad all the fucking time at everyone for stupid fucking reasons. I can barely form coherent sentences unless I’m typing which also takes forever, cause I’m so overwhelmed with thoughts that I can’t even make out cause there’s too many. I feel so dumb. Nobody wants to be my friend and when they do I’m too scared of how I am. I don’t even know what I’m scared of. That’s I’m not enough? I’ll eventually selfishly abandon them because of my stupid fucking self and feelings that I don’t even know what they are? I don’t want to die but I can’t deal with the grief of that life I could have had. I was so free spirited and spontaneous and adventurous. It would have been so amazing. I’ll stop ranting I’m sorry, I have my family to talk to but they’re so god damn positive and “well you can be happy with this life too and just find something you enjoy” but NO no no no no no I can’t. I can’t stand knowing what could have been and just accept this. Anyways I’m on 10mg of Lexapro from my regular doctor at the clinic I think y’all call them GPs. And it’s been about five and a half weeks and nothing has changed. I was on Zoloft a couple years ago and it was amazing but I stupidly went off cause I never wanted to believe that I’m broken. And then I tried again for five months and it stopped working. I also drink now, it started like a year ago, I drink almost all day every day. I’ve only gone three days without it. Sometimes it allows me to socialize and kind of be me again but never 100%. I got myself addicted. I know lex doesn’t work as week with it but I just can’t without it. I think I might kill myself without that crutch. I’m so damn lonely. I have nobody. I wish I was happy and my family didn’t have to be disappointed or trying to help me in their own way. I wish my dad didn’t have to worry about me. I love him so much. He doesn’t deserve a daughter that’s always sad and scared. My mom died when I was young and he gave up EVERYTHING for me and my sister. I just want to be me again. God so bad. Idk some encouragement would be nice. I’ve been on this sub since my day one trying to be hopeful. Idk you guys all love each other but I never felt a a part of the community but I’m posting this anyways. You don’t have to help me and there’s no reason you should but I had to let this out Thank you SO MUCH to anyone that bothered to read. I truly don’t feel worth it. But if you made it to the end of this post you must be pretty amazing and I hope the best of the everything for you cause you deserve it ❤️.
    is anyone here on medications? if so, what medications and how are they working for you? im going on antidepressants & stuff for anxiety soon, and im nervous on how it’ll play out because im not diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorder, just NPD. they were prescribed for my empty feeling & chronic boredom, so im really skeptical, and i hope it won’t be a waste of time.. hey guys, not sure if this has been discussed in this group before but i want to know if anyone else relates to feeling chronic boredom & emptiness and can possibly share some tips. i’m constantly bored & empty, seeking thrill & excitement but nothing brings me that joy & pleasure. yes, i have hobbies (main ones I gravitate towards are journaling & scrapbooking. im drawn to creating), yes i try NEW hobbies also. yes i talk to people, im extroverted so i can talk to anyone really, but i mean interactions and friendships feel… surface level and not as intense or deep as id like them to be. and socializing is just really fucking hard because of how judgmental i am; as soon as someone says or does something i don’t like, my perception of them changes. i live in a city so i go to places and do things with people and by myself. i love learning… i spend a lot of time researching things & im in college. i consume content that is supposed to be educational, funny, & entertaining. i listen to music pretty much all day everyday because i can’t stand silence. but despite doing all of this, i feel like a robot. it feels like im just doing all these things to pass time and get throughout the day until it’s time for bed… then repeat it all the next day. i feel hopeless. pretty much the only thing that brings me joy is praise and validation. but even then, it doesn’t even last long. it’s a temporary high and it just boosts my ego. i want to feel good when i do normal things like hobbies and interacting with people. this feeling is consuming me, it makes life feels pointless. i sometimes envy my cat because she’s easily entertained by literally anything !! LOL meanwhile im constantly snacking or looking for drama to help with my boredom.. i’ve felt like this for years. i don’t know if chronic boredom & emptiness is related to NPD, but regardless, can anyone here relate and tell me what you do to overcome this feeling? please !! before i start abusing substances or something lol. hey! hopefully this isn’t a repetitive topic and im not even sure if i asked the question in the title correctly but, how do you guys handle being perceived negatively and mistreated?in my case, im referring to discrimination and abusive language type of perception & mistreatment from strangers. i know a reasonable response to that is to get away from that situation & try to make yourself feel better, and i get that. and i obviously do my best ignoring the offensive things people say and move along with my day. but ive been hurt all day and angry and i keep crying in like, intervals lol. talking to someone about my feelings & getting validation for my feelings isn’t enough. i wish i wasn’t so passionate & i wish i didn’t feel things so deeply like this. how do you guys cope?.

    *Rant, but I want you to rant with me if feel like it.* Turning into Howard Hughes over here with my Ruminations/anxiety. The way of the future, the way of the future. No Ego Big fake Ego No Ego Big fake Ego. Identity Identity Identity. INNER CHILD. INNER CHILD. Broken broken broken. Real feeling? Fake Feeling? Emotional Responsibility? Rebuilding a core IDENTITY. Cycles cycles cycles. Triangles and **triads** and drama. Real and Justifiable response? NARCVAMP FEEDING ON SUPPLY response? Is everyone a narcissist? Everyone everywhere sounds like a *fucking narcissist*. How to **\[insert something horrific to do to a person**\] the NARC. The Narc. My Narc. Your Narc. Narc Narc Narc. I'm burnt the fuck out. To settle, I put pause on my therapy because all of the therapy words were becoming to therapied to feel real. I think that this is okay. I have an appointment for the early April and a designated day to review my progress/what I've learned.. Tl;Dr: What I’m doing in therapy. Doubt labels and ineffective v effective responses. Combating assumptions I accepted that I didn’t just have traits about a month ago, but was fairly certain I was heading to the diagnosis for over a year now.Sometimes, I think that is what it takes to bring a pwNPD to a place of understanding. My therapist has been laying the groundwork for so long, so now that we’re here— essentially we ware back to step one:Accepting and Acknowledging the traits, but also recognizing what good traits I have — but without assigning doubt to them. I posted last week that I had to be ✨nice ✨to myself.I ran into the problem I read here a lot: but are these good things REAL?!?? So we’re using the *doubt label* idea where you figure out the negative line of thinking, ineffective responses, and find effective thinking and responses.. I’ve never read ANY vampire books other than Anne Rice. I would love something that has some darkness, but remains more in the light side. Contemporary probably? FMC can be whatever so long as she isn’t a total Mary sue.. I just realized my career is a great outlet for my narcissistic traits that comes with very clear rules and boundaries. I can be my more grandiose baddie self at work while working on my real self in therapy. It sort of creates a natural way of regulating and coping, if that makes sense. And everyone is consenting to their role. Wouldn’t recommend it if you have issues with violating boundaries.. We’re beginning to form an authentic sense of self to ground myself in, so I’m to write the various roles (mom, partner, daughter etc — not in the sense of “playing at something) I have in life. List the ✨positive✨characteristics I take on in these roles. (Because I’ve already written novels of my negative ones)I’m not really a grandiose type that can tip off the scales, I’m a hollow type that’s like “I have no idea who I am.”I often feel blank inside, unsure if my positive traits are bullshit or not. But I do have many— including narcissistic traits that are helpful. I guess my thought from this session is “How can I be so defensive/sensitive about an ego that’s dust?” All good things crumble at the slightest trigger breeze.. Day one of progress: I guess the positive is that my therapist clocked me early and had been working on my sense of “authentic self” the entire time. I figured it out with her along side my psychiatrist today when I wanted to discuss this ridiculous manipulative action I wanted to take (I didn’t). But it shocked me into a session like “what is this spiteful spirit?!” (I’m not usually that level of malicious). They slowly introduced my lack of “emotional responsibility.” The fact I explained every reason why and what abusive daddy trauma it came from before even saying my mean ass confession. Then I felt aggressively defensive, ashamed, ego destroyed, cried, then angrily writing about the presumption that I haven’t had any “real consequences “ for my narcissistic actions due to being surrounded by other narcissist like people. Honestly now I just feel empty. It’s odd because I don’t know all the nuances within NPD, but I don’t feel like I lack empathy. Is that even possible? My brain is broken — do I just have fake empathy to feel human? It feels sincere…Thank fuck my children have been in therapy— their therapist insists I’ve fostered great emotional intelligence 😭Thanks for readingPS: still have no idea what my authentic self is. I think it is mostly mashed potatoes at this point.. What we’ve been calling thermometers since June 2020 when we had covid brain (ataxia).TIFU by taking a romantic bathIt’s my last day in beautiful Hawai’i, so why not cap it off with a luxurious candle lit bath? I’ll tell you why—because I laid back to relax and burnt a large chunk of hair off the center of my head.I thought my bath bomb was fire scented for far too long of a moment, y’all. I smelled burning, remembered the bath bomb first THEN the candles. I sat up and said loudly “ohhh noooo” . To which my husband automatically responds “Did you burn your hair on the candles?” Yes I did. My souvenirs are now an amazing squid tattoo and a monk looking bald spot. Okay, it’s not that big, but there is a nice sized spot in my precious hair. About the size of a mandarin orange. Did you know the British gave Hawaiians an orange tree after they Killed Captain Cook and spread his bones equally among the chiefs? This was because they felt the British took more than they gave back. Hopefully this story distracts everyone from my bald spot. I blame this lapse of awareness on the intense Waipio Valley uphill hike. Certainly couldn’t be the wine tasting that clouded my judgment. No obligatory “not actually today” because I’m still soaking up with the smell of burnt hair as I post this. Yes, to the obligatory I’m on mobile. Also, I had to repost this several times because apparently I cannot read either. TL;DR: I burnt off an orange sized chunk of hair during a candle lit bath.What’s your “must read” page turner that I can gobble up in a few days? I’m an avid reader and current events have me wanting that HEA and comfort that romance can provide.TIA ❤️. Anyone else get anemia of any sort? Or Hemolytic Anemia? I’ve been having mostly the neurological (brain fog, tingles, dizzy, tinnitus, ataxia) symptoms with shortness of breath. Today the doc called because they may run an anemia panel on me due to a low ferritin read. I give blood fairly regularly (last time was March) and my iron is always “great”. I’ve read people having HIGH ferritin getting worse symptoms, but the only thing I’m seeing on LOW is studies suggesting some COVID-19 patients get Hemolytic Anemia. Usually older and with other conditions. I’m 34 with a good BMI and overall healthy.
    Recently experienced an episode of anaphylaxis that would not go away and lasted for three days straight, it was bad enough that I didn't know if I would wake up the next morning from suffocation in my sleep. On the third day I went to get help but they said they couldn't do anything or give me epinephrine because my blood pressure was too high... My blood pressure was high because its always high when I am around any doctors or medical professionals, and its very stressful especially because for three days I was barely able to breathe and didn't know if I was going to survive or not. Can't take benadryl because I'm allergic, so there was nothing they could do. Sometimes I wish MCAS would just kill me already so I don't have to suffer like this anymore. Every day is Russian roulette. It seems like there is no point in living when my body is trying to kill me every day. I am losing hope. Will they just let me die if they can't administer epinephrine? I don't understand what is even the point of seeking medical help honestly. Lately I've been having a flare up and my symptoms make me feel shame and regret for eating. It's like everytime I eat I get sick and think "I shouldn't have eaten that". Tonight my mother ate one of my only safe foods (again) so now I practically have nothing to eat, it just makes me think thoughts like "I guess I don't deserve to eat anyways". Has anyone here felt that your MCAS made you develop an eating disorder? Mostly wondering about restrictive EDs but MCAS also made my BED worse because I am forced to be so restrictive I couldn't help but impulsively binge on foods I wish I could just be normal and eat but then I get a huge severe allergic reaction that lasts days which feels like a punishment. I feel like I'm constantly being punished for eating. Its messing with my head. It's hard to eat much with MCAS, and drink water, so I'm probably dehydrated and malnourished. I try to eat whole foods but they never seem to satiate my hunger. I feel like I'm constantly hungry no matter what. I eat dense foods like meat which should be fulfilling, but they just aren't. If I eat more "empty" processed carbs type stuff because its easier to eat, I just feel empty and painfully full and bloated but never satiated. I don't know what to do. I can't eat enough meat to sustain myself because it's difficult for me to eat it, but processed foods just make me overeat cuz they are not dense. Feels like a neverending cycle that I can't escape and leading to my eventual demise. Initially I wanted to install a new operating system on my phone for security and privacy reasons, as well as desires of degoogling. But for us, the most beneficial part of this is that we can have many different and separate user profiles for all of our interests and needs, and it's now so much simpler for us to share a phone. Ever since I've installed Graphene OS, I've wanted to tell other systems about it because it has helped me so much. Everything is finally organized and I no longer feel constrained to fit in the box of one alter. It's not that difficult to install Graphene OS, and it's so beneficial if you wish you had one phone for each alter. My mind feels a lot less cloudy now, and I hope that at least one other system can benefit from Graphene OS, I just had to share. If you want to learn about it there's a subreddit r/GrapheneOS. I'm sick of looking up advice about what I should do because all the advice says "just don't eat histamine" and I'm eating low histamine foods that were once safe and its all causing anaphylaxis, water too. I don't know what to do anymore.The area I live does not have a functioning hospital, and I have been considering if it's best for me to move to a large city. I do not have epinephrine. I have heard that some ERs won't treat MCAS anaphylaxis, and I assume you'll only receive worse treatment if you are not officially diagnosed, and sadly I haven't been able to find a doctor who takes my health seriously. The last "hospital" in my area has been infamous lately for letting people die in the waiting room. I am beginning to think relocation is my only option because of how severe my anaphylaxis is on a regular basis I am surprised that I have not died yet, and I am also beginning to wonder how long I have left until I do die without medical intervention because of the shitty area I live in.. Sometimes I'll be having a conversation with someone, mandatory/not by choice, and I notice them repeatedly trying to get an emotional reaction out of me while becoming increasingly angered that I don't match their facial expressions. Sometimes when they drag the conversation on longer I will just mimic them so they are satisfied and finally leave me alone. Do you notice people getting angry with you because you don't match their emotional energy? How do you deal with it? Some of them are so persistent in their attempts to get a reaction that the conversation will literally go on and on unnecessarily forever to the point that its obvious and embarrassing until I finally decide to force an expression. What the heck is wrong with people?. Ate salmon tonight which was one of the only safe foods left and it made me extremely sick. I feel like giving up. I just don't know how I am supposed to live like this, constantly suffering and being punished for everything I do, even drinking water. Weed is the only thing that helps my body not have as severe reactions, as I cannot afford daily epinephrine, but I cannot even afford it on a regular basis, and I don't want to be high all the time. I am always miserable I don't know how to live like this anymore. Anyone else wish there was a "narc abuse" bot on Reddit that replies to every comment conflating NPD with abusers and tells them to stop spreading ableist crap and educates them on why "narc abuse" is a harmful ableist concept as well as fictitious... Pretty sure Reddit as a platform wouldn't allow it, but it would be nice for us to not have to constantly explain to full grown adults that "narcissist" is a disability, not an insult or a synonym for "evil".
    Because it is?? I don’t describe it that way to get pity points. For almost the entirety of my life, I felt that something was happening to me that other people could not understand. It’s not even in a ‘woe is me’ kind of way, although in the past I may have expressed it like so, but objectively, NPD exists in like 1% of the population?? Of course people with NPD uniquely suffer, as do people with BPD and other forms of mental illness. Mental illness is more isolating and easily misunderstood than physical illness. It truly is an agonizing and different kind of suffering that most people don’t understand and can’t express empathy for like they would automatically for someone in physical pain or someone who has been abused.I just don’t understand why I’ll watch online videos of people dissecting NPD and they’ll do this goofy “narcissists act like their suffering is SO unique and only THEY are going through SO much.” Because that’s literally how it feels? I don’t have control over the way that feels and your misunderstanding only adds to that component of suffering that this illness creates.
    It seems that way to me. I like challenging people, it's like playing an exciting video game. If the game is easy, I'll give up too. I find myself ruminating about people who said the most horrible things to me and forgetting the ones who were nice to me.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTWNnmymMc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTWNnmymMc4). I find it very strange because I feel like I have a very strong empathy for my dog ​​and my favorite person, but almost nothing when I see people I don't know suffering or even family members, with the exception of my grandmother who raised me when my parents had to abandon me. This is very strange, anyone else here?. How can I truly tell if I’m narcissistic? People have been calling me that, but when I reflect on myself, I don’t see anything wrong with the way I act. However, I’ve noticed that people seem to be distancing themselves from me more and more, and I don’t understand what I might be doing to cause it. Is it possible that I’m missing something about how I come across to others? If so, how can I become more aware of it and work on improving myself?. I’m feeling really sad because I know I’m narcissistic, and I can’t seem to stop drinking. It’s like I’m caught in this endless cycle where I feel the need to prove myself, to be seen, to matter—but deep down, I feel empty. The alcohol makes it worse, but in the moment, it feels like the only thing that helps me escape my thoughts. I hate feeling so dependent on it, but no matter how much I want to stop, I keep going back to it. It feels like I’m losing control, and I don’t know how to break free.My ex-boyfriend pointed out a curiosity in my behavior. He said that I never like to write or send him audio and that I prefer to make a conventional phone call. In his theory, I do this because I constantly change narratives and when confronted with text or audio as evidence, it would invalidate my new version of the facts, which he claims is gaslight.In fact, it has happened in the past that I have denied behavior and a commitment that I had actually made and had written down and this left me quite embarrassed. Does anyone else avoid leaving traces wherever they go to avoid liability?. What do you think about this and what irritates you the most and makes you feel bad? I believe that when we do the silent treatment it is because it is the thing we hate most and find unbearable. Being ignored, forgotten, especially on my birthday, and feeling like people don't care about me is like a stab in the soul. That's why, when I want to make someone feel bad, I ignore them, but I suspect that no matter how uncomfortable it is for them, nothing comes close to the discomfort I feel when I'm ignored or ridiculed, like when my partner responds to me with jokes full of irony.. We usually don't admit it, but it seems to me that we are in love with broken people or people with some disorder, in my case I like BPD. I tell myself I want stability in relationships, but what I unconsciously seek is chaos. I love the rollercoaster of emotions and it makes me happier. I suspect that I would like my partner to always be somewhat inaccessible so that I would always be in search of conquest. The shit of everything is when I feel like I've won them and I lose the desire to conquer and the search for newness consumes me and then I'll cheat. I still love it when my Borderline partner breaks up with me and then comes back asking for forgiveness. I feed on the toxicity of reconciliation.. In your breakdown did you isolate yourself? Did you look for supplies or meet other people? I had a crisis with social media and started deleting many people and avoiding socializing. I felt so ashamed and all I could think about were the things I did to my ex and how he would have eventually exposed me to my friends.I feel extreme paranoia/distrust that he was running some smear campaign against my acquaintances and that he had eventually contacted my ex to get news about the things I did in my old relationship. He, my last ex, even came to me and said he missed me, but I'm really afraid of being set up by him. Maybe because I'm not a trustworthy person, I don't trust people. Does anyone else feel paranoid?. I know I hurt a lot of people in the past, but I can't remember what I did to them. Getting to the point where I looked for them as if nothing had happened and as if they were my friends. I just get ignored. How can this happen? The other day I ran into an old friend at a party and went to say hi. He just turned his back and told meIgnored.. I know I hurt a lot of people in the past, but I can't remember what I did to them. It got to the point where I looked for them as if nothing had happened and they were my friends. I just get ignored. How can this happen?. Do you like people who hurt you? Today I had a fight with my ex and accused him of several things, including defamation, that he would be looking for my ex to talk about me, but I still don't know if this is paranoia. I still don't know why I talk to him, but I feel that something connects us, but I'm afraid he'll shake me at some point, so I'm always on the defensive, even though he says he loves me and wants to get back together. I think he has BPD and I accuse him of being very emotionally unstable and having ups and downs, and I say that I want stability in the relationship, but I still know that I'm the one who pushes his buttons. It's crazy because he attacks me with words when I do something to him, but even so it's all unintentional. I don't do it intentionally, like making him jealous.After your ex finds out that you are a narcissist, and he says that he accepts you as you are and now he is temporarily living in a city and knowing that he comes back, considering that according to him he would accept a kind of open relationship and that he wouldn't mind If I knew you were seeing other guys, would you agree to get back together? It seems to me that it would be the best of both worlds, to have someone who loves you and who doesn't mind betrayal. I'm very tempted to accept it. but at the same time I don't want to hear about him with other men. How crazy is that. I think I want to live the best of both worlds and I think that if the world were free I would fall in love with another guy, I would leave him in the gutter. but the same could also happen to me. but look, our sex was surreal!! I want to, but I don't want to. help me!. I don't want to date someone who is way below me. But at the same time I feel extremely uncomfortable if I have relationships or if I live at an age where people are way above me. I hate the mediocrity of people around me, but I can't live in NYC, São Paulo or any kind of Berlin because I can't compete with them. I hate this thing. Anyone relate to this?. Do you think there is something spiritual with narcissistic disorder? Is this karma? Why do we always attract the same type of people? I attract borderlines and what they do to us and what I do to them seems addictive. I destroy them with attitudes and they destroy me with the sharpest words and make me see who I am. Then I disappear and they always come back. What a shitty life it is to like broken people, because unfortunately I don't like normal people and they don't like me. We are a complicated species.I think I was born to be crazy about these people who call themselves narcissists. I've tried in many ways, but it seems like nothing in life makes sense in attracting normal people, it's like embracing the devil, but what the hell is it that I'm not attracted to normal people? It seems like it's a destiny and I think I have to embrace it. The times I don't think about this rollercoaster of emotions, I want to die. I think my ex and I will die embracing each other in our misery.Disclaimer: "I don't want to accuse borderlines of being people who hurt others, I know I hurt as well. I just wanted to say that my relationship with them is conflicted and painful." And I like it 😂 Do you feel more attracted and ruminative towards people who hurt you? At least I find it really boring to be in a relationship with people who are nice and do everything I want, it's not challenging. I think that's why I'm attracted to unstable people like borderlines, because in our fights they destroy me with their words, they tell me to go to hell, and then they come back, and our reunion is triumphant, with amazing sex. Until another fight happens. I think the stigma makes people believe that trauma bonding only happens to “victims of narcissists,” but I feel like I'm also addicted to this push-and-pull game. I want constant control, but borderlines, especially, are very smart and don't let themselves be controlled easily. They are challenging, say what they think, love me and hate me with the same intensity I feel towards them. Share your experiences with this and why you’re so drawn to people who make you suffer.**Question:** Is there a theory that suggests people with BPD have a limited number of individuals they can interact with at once, leading to difficulties in managing multiple social interactions? This happens to me; even in a group of friends, I usually focus on just one person.**Answer:**What you described may be related to a common characteristic among individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): the difficulty in managing multiple social interactions simultaneously. While there isn’t a formally established theory stating that individuals with BPD have a limited number of people they can interact with, many report this struggle in social situations.**Possible Explanations for This Dynamic:*** **Intense Focus on Interpersonal Relationships:** People with BPD often have a strong need for emotional connection, which may cause them to hyper-focus on one person at a time to ensure the interaction feels "safe" and controlled, avoiding any risk of rejection or abandonment.* **Difficulty Regulating Emotions in Social Settings:** Since individuals with BPD tend to experience emotions more intensely, dealing with several people at once can be emotionally exhausting. They may find it easier to concentrate on a single interaction, where they can have greater control over their emotional reactions.* **Fear of Rejection or Abandonment:** When interacting with many people at once, the fear of not being accepted or that an interaction may spiral out of control can emerge. To avoid this, focusing on just one person might feel like a safer way to ensure that connection remains solid.* **Cognitive and Emotional Overload:** BPD is associated with cognitive overload during intense social interactions due to emotional hypersensitivity.

Even my dating apps can be abandoned. What about you?. I start to buy fake instagram profiles and try to reach him on everywhere. I need to know if he is suffering like me. I can’t stop thinking about them. It’s crazy, like intrusive thoughts. I think I have this kind of feeling with all the people I love bombed!!. Most of my family members called me a self centered guy. My gradma told today while traveling I say things are not supposed to say. Like from my mouth disgusting words come out. I have been in a relationship with a grandiose narcissist and he told me that I have rages even bigger than him. I have really bog problems with relationships, I don’t know if it is BPD or NPD, but Im soo self centered and I don’t mind about helping people, even my grandma and sometimes I feel ashamed. I have a really trauma bond to my ex and I like it. I want to destroy and love him at the same time. I dont feel a envy person in the way I suffer and want to the envied person to fuck, but at the same time when I scroll the timeline of my brother who is becoming successful in the field of house building I cant stand. Hey, I can say that in the normal thing s of life like work I cant be envious of a successful colleague, but hey, I discard people as toys and I don’t know if we can travel between a way pf being narcissistic or not. But yes, I have discarded so many people and sometimes I come to them as nothing has happened and I don’t know what I did to them. So I try to guessing what I did wrong to them. Help me! Sometimes I guess I have some amnesia related to what I did to people and I cant remember.. I don't know what to do with my envy anymore. It's something surreal and shameful for me. If I could, I wouldn't even want to know that this concept exists, but I feel a lot of hatred and anger towards a person who thinks they are my friend. How can this happen? Am I a demon? What is that? My envy is not just wanting to get what he has, but making him lose everything, making him miserable like me. Help!! I need to be a better person.Do any of you have strange sexual desires, or are you addicted to sex? Or do you have a paraphilia? I have a date scheduled every Wednesday, where I always make up a lie for my boyfriend, saying that I have to work or catch up on some things at work, I turn off my cell phone and I'm going to do drugs and have group sex. I feel devastated doing this, but it's something I can't control. Anyone else?. One thing that leaves me in cognitive dissonance is thinking: how can I write beautiful poems for my boyfriend if I'm a narcissist? To write poetry (I do this when I'm drunk, of course) we need a lot of emotion and feelings. But how do I write poetry if I, in theory, don't have access to my emotions? Although my grandiose narcissistic ex was sweet and sweet, when he was drunk, he cried like a child. My narcissistic father also gets emotional when he drinks alcohol.. I don't feel like calling my parents or siblings on their birthdays. It feels like an obligation. I also don't feel like giving gifts to anyone, nor do I have the desire to bring souvenirs when I travel. The other day, my friend told me that her dog, which I liked a lot, died, and I felt nothing—I just wrote a few words to comfort her. All my friends from the past, I've discarded, mainly because I keep moving to different cities and never miss them. It's all very strange. I suspect that I might be a vulnerable narcissist, and I don't feel ashamed to talk about my mistakes or flaws as long as it brings me some kind of attention. I used to think that all narcissists hide their weak side, but maybe that's true only for the grandiose narcissist, not the vulnerable one. I find it odd that I live more in my own world and in my head, even when I travel. When I arrive at a place, it seems like nothing there is exciting. I lose interest as soon as I have the object by my side. What intrigues me is that I can go months or even years alone, as if it's some kind of self-supply. I avoid people and relationships, and I always think they don't deserve me, that I'm far above them. I find all the guys in my city unattractive and always have this desire to move somewhere where people deserve my presence. I can do many things on my own, as if I don't depend on anyone, which makes me question the idea that a narcissist can't survive without admiration. I also have no issues being alone with my thoughts. It's perfectly normal, and I don't feel any discomfort with it. Anyone else?. 1) How do you feel about the traumatic bond with your partner? Mine describes it as an addictive drug, in which he wants and desires me even though he knows all the abuses and evils I have done. In my case I also have an addictive feeling, as if I can't disconnect, stop thinking, control, know if he has moved on with his life and it seems like an obsessive thought, I can't stop thinking even when I meet a new person. It's like a punishment. What is your experience like? 2) Another question, what does reconciliation feel like? the first days of your experience? It seems that having a relationship is only fun if it's this rollercoaster of drama, I think I'm addicted to drama..
    I filed almost 2 years ago. Our case started very difficult. Relations improved recently as did coparenting somewhat. I made lots of concessions to get some deals done. I learned of infidelity before I filed. And then I learned of more infidelity that occurred a year before I filed. It doesn’t surprise me. Does it bother me? A little. But not so much. If anything it’s more confirmation for me that I left a person that didn’t value me and wasn’t good for me. Goodbye and good riddance. I’m actually smiling because the future is bright and I’m going to live a good life not next to a cheater.. Is fucking terrifying. Wow. How do we undo this part? I’ve done lots of work. EMDR. But this aspect here is frightening to my core Because it’s true. They are all objects for me to gain supply. Fuck! Cognitively I know what I need to do and say. So I can appear to care. And try to convince myself I care. But in the end. It’s all about me and my needs and I need to be served and admired. Emotionally I am a little child. Terrified of abandonment. I need some resources for this object relations shit. It’s so hard for me. I hate it. But I’m getting better at accepting that I have made mistakes. I had to end a relationship recently that I believe was becoming unhealthy for me. I’ve been self aware now for about a year. She kind of knew what I was but she was in denial about what she was. I’m in therapy. She was not. I’m learning to cope in healthier ways. She is not. So I know I made the right decision in leaving. And then I feel the shame waves hit. You fucked up here when you did this and etc. I start fixating on all the things I did wrong. And I have to remind myself that I need to give me grace. That I need to give me love. Just when I start to sink and spiral in that dark place I pull myself out and start talking positively to myself. I go for a walk. I meditate. I am 100 percent sober. No booze no drugs. Just the gym and work and the church and my friends. I don’t have new supply. I can get it rather easily. But I don’t want it. I really need to take care of myself right now and that is so hard for us as we really thrive on that external validation. I’m going to kick my ass in therapy and get these traits to go down. I’m tired of this disorder and I want my life to be more balanced. I’ve cone a long way and I know you guys can too. How dare you run and don’t give me attention. Give me a secure attachment or give me an anxious attachment. But the moment you go avoidant on me you are getting dumped in short order!. It’s been 16 months of separation now. No one but us can understand what it feels like. The hours before drop off when you know they will soon be gone. The empty room and the toys that are left unattended. It’s like a never ending heart break. Sometimes I do better. Others it hurts. Only my divorce brothers can understand this pain. “Find something to distract you” how about fuck you. How about I miss my sons and fuck you with your distractions. Fuck you all. I miss them and my life has been diminished without them in it. I filed 14 months ago. Still maniacal hatred for me. Litigation continues. We’ve spent over 100k in fees and experts. She won’t even agree to 30 minutes later on a drop off. The kids ask to do things with me so I’ll ask for a little more time and she always demands them at the time of the order. She’s brutal and vicious and full of anger and fury. I pay all her bills but she still seeks to take the kids from me. I’ve never been hated by anyone as much as she hates me. I don’t even hate her. I fear her. Like a demon that seeks to destroy me. It goes on and on and it doesn’t get less. This is the cost of divorcing a bad person. People are human and they will make mistakes.Cognitively I understand this. Emotionally it is a different monster. The discard devaluation splitting goes haywire. HOW DARE YOU MISTREAT ME LIKE THIS. NOW YOU WILL BE PUNISHED. Like a fucking switch they are turned off and seen as nothing. And of course the punishment almost never fits the crime. It always had to be like 10-1 to satisfy the insatiable ego injury. Part of this also plays into the devaluation cycle and the push pull dynamic. Pull away, regain emotional self control and then slowly reel them back in with the hoover. It must be exhausting dealing with this. I have to remind myself that in order to heal from this madness that I need show grace. And empathy. And understanding that people are not just objects but that they have feelings of their own. It means making yourself vulnerable enough to get dumped and not rush to the exit in order to discard them before they leave you. It means being healthy enough to tolerate and handle getting dumped without falling apart. I once dumped a woman who I saw was ready to leave me. So even though I beat her to the punch I knew that she was really the one to leave me. This one hurt me a lot because I knew that she didn’t really love me but used me during a time of need. I was a source of rides, sex, and a good time. I know I’m rambling but it’s all connected. When they fail us they hurt us. And when they hurt us it reminds us of our shame and that triggers our insecurities and hence why I think we devalue, discard and punish so harshly.. Ok fine so let’s say that “we” were psychologically destroyed as children. And now we realize that the person in control of our minds is not really us but who we think should be in control of us. I looked at the abyss and it looked right back at me. Ok fine. Fuck your abyss. I still want to be here and still want to be around. I love what’s left of me enough to still want to be here. So….how do we go about rebuilding ourselves? And who has successfully done so.. Ok so I’m in a collapse. I’d say my first real one. Ongoing high conflict divorce proceedings and battered finances have precipitated this. This is now prolonged 3 days strong. Characterized by deep depression, lots of crying, some suicide ideation most of which has passed. Toxic shame is engulfing my soul. And overwhelming me. My previous defenses are useless and I don’t care for my fake constructs anymore. My gf who I’ve been intimidate with for a few months but have known for the last 25 years is basically taking care of me. There’s no grandiosity left and I’m looking at myself for who I am. No more dissociating as the drug to distract me from the shame. I have my therapist and my 3 closest friends and girlfriend taking care of me. I wonder how long this will last. I want to get better and stop this cycle. I want the pain in my chest to leave. I want the emptiness to go away. I want to generate a true self and a real self love for myself and others. I want to be healthy. I am fucking collapsed right now and can barely move. So my question: how long can I be in this state for? I don’t have a diagnosis but my therapist says I’m cluster B and highly narcissistic. I can resonate very much with y’all. Been aware of these issues now since March or so.. I have a 2-2-5 schedule. Sometimes I call themfor FaceTime when they are with her on the 5 day period. However, our divorce has increase in hostility recently. I don’t want ANY contact with her at all. If that means I don’t speak to them during the 5 day period I think I’m ok with it for a while. Do you call your kids on her timeshare? My boys are 6 and 4. My divorce is extreme high conflictThanks. It’s always the hardest part. There is a 5 day period in our schedule where I don’t see them. It’s always the worst after the first few days. The sting doesn’t go away. I know they say stay busy and I do but man I’m a fucking father and to be away away from them this long and losing so much time with them now that they are little I can’t get used to it. The sadness is real. This is the hardest part about the divorce. Not being with the kids. I have a 60-40 schedule (60 for her). It will be 50-50 soon. I miss my boys. She made me feel like shit and it was time to leave for many reasons. But without sugar coating things not seeing my boys for half the month just kills me. I still struggle with it on at least 4 days a month. Some guys cope better. I don’t have a gf and I’m one year out. Trying to learn to cope with my new life situation without “needing” someone else. It’s working so far.. So what of the beautiful golden years? The best years of my child’s childhood. Evaporated due to her hatred of me. Those are years I’llNever get back with my boy. It’s very little consolation for me to hear that “when he’s older he will understand” well yeah so what about from 6-18? That’s 12 years gone. Wiped out. Erased. And they don’t always come around and sometimes when they do they are so damaged that you don’t even enjoy the relationship with them because of how much trauma they have suffered. It’s enough to mourn the failure of the marriage and the loss of the family unit it’s quite another to see your relationship with your child get destroyed through no fault of your own. You can be the best parent fighting for custody exercising your time in a good way, being loving and caring and healthy and the alienators poison is so powerful that it’s lol for nothing. I’ve spent over 60k and we have evaluators and therapists involved but they are no match for the subtle evil these people can enact on your child. It’s the worst evil in the world watching this happen to my boy. People lose children to accidents, cancer, war, etc. and we lose them to alienation. Stay away from cluster b personality disordered people the trauma they have allows for evil to work deep within them. Im about a year out now from my filing. Of course our divorce is high conflict. The whole 9 years. Psychologists involved for child custody allegations. Abuse allegations. Substance abuse allegations. It’s a narc shit show. My ex is very likely NPD. I have strong traits with no diagnosis. However…..I’ve noticed the traits are settling down now. Significantly. My narc traits were bad growing up for sure. ADHD diagnosis several times over. Maybe some ASPD here and there. But wow, things have really settled down now. I’ve noticed my splitting has mellowed a bit. I hate less. And I love less. More balance to my emotions. Less fantasy. Not being romantically involved with someone has been very instrumental in my healing journey. I’m still not ready to date. Not because of my ex. But because of me. I don’t want to give any of myself to anyone. Other than to my kids, friends, and family. I feel my empathy is growing. First for myself. Which is key. Giving myself true love and true grace. I survived a brutal high conflict divorce. I still have my babies. And I managed to do this with WITHOUT primary supply!!! No drugs either and primarily sober. I find myself sneering at coupled people seeing them as weak so I still need to check my grandiosity lol. I feel myself getting stronger in this journey. I wish everyone the best of luck. Hey guys. In a high conflict divorce with a narcissist ex wife. Trust me she’s a narcissist. 100 percent. I have strong traits myself. But nowhere near as delusional as she is. We’ve already blown through 100k in attorney fees. Two ex partes. Child custody evaluation underway. High conflict parenting classes ordered. Talking via app. Police reports and false allegations. Parental alienation on her end. The whole 9 yards. Guys, you can never “win” with them. They always have to win. They will be petty, bitter, spiteful, no matter what. If you say no to them about ANYTHING they ask. A recent example she wanted to pick up my boy on my moms bday from school despite it being my day. Because of me telling her no, it’s a full on shit show with her doing everything she can to be difficult. We don’t have orders yet. Which makes this very tough. But I’ve learned something about myself through the process. I beat her when I left her. I won my life when I decided to get rid of her. I left her to gain my life back. She’s the loser here. She will end up bitter and ruined. Her drinking will destroy her body. She will have her little victories with the kids. Maybe she will successfully alienate me from my older one. But it doesn’t matter. Because I escaped from her toxic soul. And saved myself. She can never win because I saved me. And that brings a smile to my face. It’s been said that men should stay away from dating for the first 12 months during their divorce. As a rule of thumb, the longer the relationship, the longer you should stay single. We need to recover and heal the wounds. If you have kids this really holds true. The kids need to recover as well. So my buddy is going through his divorce which began in September. He has started a new relationship going 100 mph in February. He has two boys, aged 11 and 4. His STBXW has already moved the new guy in. My buddy with the new cupcake gf is NOW CONSIDERING MOVING IN WITH HER 400 miles away. Minimum 8 hours of travel by car. This man loves his boys loves them so much. But his mind is NOT in a good place. The fact that he’s considering this idea shows he wasn’t ready to date. I’ve seen this happen time and time again. A female friend of mine is nervous that her ex is moving 800 miles away to be with his cupcake. A 50-50 custody is about to turn into 90-10. She’s freaking out as her life is about to get much harder. Guys, if you have young kids. STAY SINGLE. For as long as possible. DONT MOVE AWAY FOR HER. The kids will grow. Then move. But now they are little you will regret missing out on these precious years. Once you leave the local area for her, you are leaving your kids for her. You ex will use that against you for alienation purposes if she chooses. I guess in the end we all don’t love our kids the same. I always said I love them more than others do. And it’s true. I’m right here for them. We went to a legit Music venue with thousands of people jumping up and down to beautiful house music. It was a younger crowd but there were plenty of people in their 30s and 40s to where you don’t feel out of place. I am 42male. I’m really starting to have fun now and am talking far less about all of the mess. My divorce is high conflict with child custody litigation underway. Total costs approaching 90k. Getting very close to the one year mark now. Last May is when my STBX attempted to have me arrested for domestic violence. The few months before this she began to record our arguments and was attempting to paint me a bad light. I was told by some of the recipients of the videos that she was doing this. Anyways her calling the cops on me was the last straw which led me to hire my attorney and prepare for the divorce. The last twelve months were so hard. I still lived at the marital property up to march of this year. And I lived with her twisted teen daughter who became weapozined against me. I made a vow that the next twelve months will be far better than the last and we are off to a great start. Child custody is now under the control of court appointment expert evaluator. My case is high conflict lol. As a result no dating until the very least I get my custody orders. Still nowhere near ready for real romance anyways. I was forced to wait to file due to some paper I needed to move around (divorce planning). I would have filed last year at this time if I could have. So I guess it’s basically a year out. Whatever hopes I had that she would straighten out and get some help are all gone now. My friend groups have changed dramatically from the married people to the ever growing single crew. I basically do whatever I want on my free days and am super dad when I have my little ones with me. Cheers to being single. Cheers to NOT having to simp on social media for the obligatory Mother’s Day post. Cheers to all the fun events I’ll be attending without an aggressive and sloppy drunk who would embarrass me and ruined my time. CHEERS TO BEING FREE FROM TOXICITY. It’s growing and the self validation and self love is the most amazing feeling of my life. Cutting off unhealthy supply has been instrumental. I’ve chosen celibacy going forward and absolutely no dating whatsoever for as long as is necessary. When that will be I don’t know but I can assume at least until the new year. At the age of 42, I was in relationships for 20 years back to back. Throw in a high conflict divorce with an unaware narc and this is the result. I suffered a deep collapse while weaning myself off unhealthy supply but in this process I found love for myself. My faith in God has been strengthened as well and I have slowly removed the toxic people from my life. I battle with the grandiosity monster nearly daily but I’ve learned to control it. Not needing someone romantically is very powerful and I can feel the grandiose side of myself sneering at those in relationships as weak. I catch myself and reframe into it a more Healthy message that “some people have healthy relationships”. I read about people feeling “lonely” and I’ll I read is weakness and scoff. Again, denying one’s needs is not a smart move. We have to acknowledge our needs in a healthy way. Maybe I’ll have that one day. I won’t close the door. But for now I’m building my true self. Little by little step by step. Removing the anger and replacing it with self control. Hahah imagine the normies “OMG what a narc he loves himself so much he doesn’t need anyone” is it narcissism to love oneself radically that you reject romantic relationships? I guess we can fall into that trap as well. Everyday is a challenge. Everyday I wake up and I have to fight my disorder. I can’t let the grandiosity take me too high and I can’t let the depression sink me too low. The voice in my head likes to bring me up up up or down down down. Controlling the voice is key. Telling the voice that WE ARE OK BEING WHAT WE ARE is the self love I speak of. Not the “you are so handsome they all love you” or “you are nothing look at you how pathetic you are”. I don’t think I’ll ever wake up one day being cured of this. But either way growing self love it will keep me safe from all these wild adventures that lead to chaos. That’s all. I used to post in this sub last year. Then we began divorce proceedings and all hell broke loose. We are in heavy child custody litigation. Surprisingly, my soon to be ex wife has held resilient in the face of the divorce proceedings. Suffice to say, she is starting to slowly break. The debt is piling, the friendships have eroded. And slowly the children are getting accustomed to their new lives in two homes. She is losing control of the narrative. I don’t see how much she drinks as I don’t live with her but I hear it’s now twice a week. I figured by now she would have increased the alcohol intake to several times a week now but not all alcoholics are built the same. As for my life. Wow so much better not being around this shit. No one around drinks like her and if they do they are responsible and don’t become angry and toxic. I’ll never be with a drunk again. I’ve done lots of hard work and therapy. I have worked on my codependency and my own narcissistic tendencies. I want to be the best version of myself. And if that means staying single for life I’m ok with that. Starting to find real joy now. Little by little day by day. I’m so glad to escape the ravages of alcohol. I went to al anon and I was terrified at the stories of people stuck with their Qs for life. Break free!. So I’m in a divorce. Of course I’ve split her to hell and she’s been devalued into dust. HOW DARE SHE DEFY ME! lol Anyways I find myself literally unable to have memories with her. Very few memories if that. Apparently it’s called dissociative amnesia? My wife of 9 years been together for 12. The worst pain was the loss of supply and attention. Very little to do with her. Wow we are so jacked up in the head. And yet sometimes I still find myself trying to see if I can get her to show interest in me. She’s disordered as all hell. I like to see if she wants me still. She is a very small source of supply now but still a very tiny one. But yeah. Once I’m done with them it’s like I was never with them. The memories are so faint. Weird. Hey guys.Typing that out is crazy! I’m 41M. I filed for divorce last summer. Was with her for 11 years. And before that I had 2 relationships from 2004-2012. So I was in relationships for 20 years!!! Which brings me to this sub. I’ve now been alone and single since last summer. Closing in on one year. At first it was hard as my brain was used to being with someone. But I knew I needed to stay single as I couldn’t get sucked into a new relationship. Codependency issues of course that are getting addressed. And I stayed strong. I have young kids that need my full attention. Custody is an ongoing issue. Closing in on one year and I’m doing good. Making lots of friends. Going out. Camping and skiing. Doing things. And most importantly no romantic attachments taking from me. Draining my energy. Nope. I’m saving all my love for me and my kids and my friends and family. There’s zero space in my heart for a relationship and I’m very glad I was able to make it this far without it. I’m confident the next year will be far easier. I hope to remain single for at least a decade and possibly even forever. I’m guarding my heart and my feelings very carefully and I’m so thankful that I’m taking good care of myself.. STBXW continues to go darker in this divorce process. We are a high conflict case where we are in a custody evaluation. She’s making abuse claims about me full stop. And I allege she’s a drunk (which she is). She refuses to give me equal parenting time and does everything in her power to limit my overnights to 8 a month. She is beginning to engage in alienating conduct. I am documenting everything. As she gets darker, the more it verifies to me that I made the right decision. The more she’s selfish with me, the happier I am that I divorced her. The more she hates me, the more I smile. She has minimal value and the kids will be better off if she just ran off with some man. Unfortunately we are stuck with her and her evil spirit. She really believed she would get me to react with all her games and manipulation. Nope. I would never ever jeopardize my future and my lifestyle for her worthless ass. But I did tell her she never loved me and that she used me. And it brought me great joy to tell her these things because it’s the truth and I absolutely love exposing her for the user that she is. Because I did in fact love her. She never loved me. I can live with this now. It’s a shame she didn’t but hey life goes on and I’m thankful that I was able to wake up and realize this and LEAVE HER. lol. No matter what happens I can laugh to myself that I dumped her. I ruined her plan to tag me for long term support. In my state 7 years of marriage means 3.5 years of alimony. Oops. I have so much devalued her in my mind that literally nothing she does can hurt me anymore. Even if she poisons my kids with her venom it will not affect me. Because evil people like herself act like that. It’s my job to counter her poison with love to the children.Lastly, I really tried to be friendly with her for the kids sake. But it takes two to coparent. The final discard is coming for her. This is where she will be downgraded to an obstacle and nothing more. Such is the hell of high conflict custody battle Good luck my brothers. And I absolutely fucking love it. I’m on a good one so this is for my divorce brothers out there that are hurting It will get better I promise you I think about all the enslaved men out there doing the song and dance for some affection. I think about all the simping going on for Mother’s Day lol not my problem! I think about my brothers out there in their sexless marriages. I have a best friend that at best gets laid 3-4 times a year. He’s a decent dude not the best husband but not the worse by any stretch. I think about all the men that get abused and taken advantage of. I was used by my wife and her daughter. It was terrible how they treated me. No respect. No honor. Just a resource to be extracted from. They used my best parts and used my codependency against me. But I dug deep and broke free. And now they are trying to take my little ones from me. They treated me bad in marriage and are treating me worse in the divorce. And now the Lord has turned my heart into stone. For any woman. I asked him for this and he gave it to me. I have my friends my parents my family. And the others that I love. But for a woman I have nothing to give period. Not even my body I have chosen celibacy that way they can’t even get near it. No sex nothing. Fuck them all! May God be with you all my brothers. Be strong for yourselves for your children. We will survive and thrive!. 10 months of separation. Moved out around 2 months ago. Went on 6 dates. Got some decent practice in. All of them wanted a boyfriend which is something I’m not doing right now. Custody battle is in full swing. One of these in particular showed some legitimate interest but again communicated that she was looking for some serious. So I turned off the apps again. Going back into monk mode. NEED TO REPAIR MY BROKEN PARTS THAT REQUIRE VALIDATION. Must learn to get through life without it. I must learn to thrive without external validation. I’mDoing it but I feel so dead and empty. Broken inside. I’m surviving but it’s a challenge. I’m good looking and can easily get a lady if I want too. I need to heal so I can break the cycle. I have deep trauma from childhood. I belief I suffered abuse from the age of 3 possibly even younger. My mother’s rages were severe and they damaged my psyche. It’s the reason I ended up marrying someone like my STBXW. We are very similar. Monk mode for me entails absolutely no dating. No talking to women period unless they are strictly friends. And deep therapy and prayer to rebuild my broken core. Thanks and good luck.
    I'm so sick and tired of everything I say somehow being taken the wrong way when I didn't actually mean anything like that. Or when I'm trying to prevent any potential misunderstanding people just get annoyed at me and this is ruining all my relationships.I cant shake the feeling that everyone looks at me with pity and as inferior if they discover that I'm pretty lonely. Especially people with partners and active social lives. I self sabotaged getting to know these types of people 2 years ago because I couldnt believe that any of them looked at me as an equal and all secretly judged me as being a loser.

I self sabotaged getting to know these types of people 2 years ago because I couldnt believe that any of them looked at me as an equal and all secretly judged me as being a loser. Theres no way they dont.Are they all just lying to look better or do they really believe this bs? Because people always do this subconsciously. Everyone always is nice to popular people but if someone is lonely and has very little social life nobody cares because we have nothing they can benefit from. This is especially frustrating if you’re just trying to make more connections. I dont see it ever happening though. Hes gonna die drunk. As if alcoholism isnt bad enough on its own his autism has made alcoholism his routine.I know its probably just my body trying to catch up on all the real sleep it hasnt been getting but seriously how long am I gonna feel like this? I want to work out again but I have no energy at all and want to go to sleep again already after 6 hours up. My muscles feel flabby and nonexistent. Time on the gym membership is wasting. I made it to just over 2 weeks around October-November then had a relapse which lasted until last Thursday. I felt so much better then and was actually able to go to the gym. Just tried to yesterday and could only complete 1 set and go home. I just feel so tired and foggy and weak everywhere. Back then though I thought it would never end but another 3 month bender after that cant have done any good. How long can I expect this to last?. All the people I wanted to be accepted by want nothing to do with me and throughout my entire life I’ve been bullied and rejected by everyone being told how fucking annoying and worthess I am for when I just wanted to be understood for the first time. I’m 24 now and scared for the future and don’t really see any point in continuing. If every single time I try to be close to anyone this happens and I should just shut up so I dont completely lose everyone.My life is fucked up and if its only gonna be like this forever I dont know anymore. I’ve never been valued by any friends ever and everyone just faded out of my life and I can tell nobody cares if I try to reach out. I’ve never mattered to anyone and never will. If I cant even find friends that value me at all but simply just tolerate me then a relationship is completely out of the question. Who would willingly want to be with a worthless fuck like me. How long did it take for the brainfog to go away? I’m not sweating or shaking or anything anymore but my head feels like I’m not really present. Like what would actually change about his situation if he suddenly had infinite money. worst shit ive ever heard his voice sounds ridiculous.
    I’m learning to get better at it with therapy. Like being able to do the confident thing, even though it scares me. I’m scared of giving someone high expectations of me and failing to meet them. I’m terrified of looking like a failure. I’m terrified of someone thinking I’m smarter than I really am. I’m scared of them losing opinion of me if I don’t meet their expectations. And I feel like everyone’s expectation of me is to be perfect. That I need to be perfect to be good enough to deserve love. I try so fucking hard all the time.I’m working on believing in myself to be able to do a good job and knowing that it doesn’t have to be perfect to be good enough. That I’m worthy of love just by being me.. I don’t really know how else to explain it. I just have a really limited sense of “existing” I just don’t really feel real. When I’m interacting with someone, I can kind of “snap into it” but when I’m left to my own thoughts I just don’t really feel like I’m here.I’m not sure if this will make sense. I think I feel sad pretty much all the time. I notice that I’m dissociating more often. I feel like I’ve been waiting for my life to have some sense of meaning or purpose for the past year and a half since my ex left me and I became aware. I don’t feel like I’ve gotten that. I feel like I’m still waiting but for something that I now know will never come and I’m continuing to wait “just in case.” I am struggling with the thought that I just need to seek supply so I can feel alive.. I realized that since I first creeped my ex’s Instagram in October and saw he had moved on with the classmate who was “just a friend” That I haven’t been back to look at it. I haven’t been back to look at hers either to stalk and obsessively go through every single picture tearing her apart as a person while simultaneously trying to see how I could be more like her to get more of what I want in life.I also feel like I’m running out of time to get those things that I want in life. I am seeing and feeling signs of aging. It’s hard not to feel like my time has passed.I was in a pretty good place and hadn’t smoked weed in like a week. And then I posted on here about how my professor from college who I thought was a mentor ended up being such a fucking creep literally, social media stalking me… I blocked him on everything but the discomfort from that happening and realizing that he probably never saw anything in me as a student, he probably just saw me as ass, it’s too much to handle. Disgusting grooming bastard. I’m just so fucking sickened . It’s hard for me to cope with these feelings. I don’t even know how to identify what they are . I just feel very violated . And I didn’t even realize that this was the reason that I relapsed until last week. I just feel like I need to say it out loud. I want to bury my feelings and hide in weed.. We talk about connection on here a lot and my therapist talks to me about it a lot, but it’s just really hard for me to connect to people when I don’t really have people in my life and avenues for meeting people to connect with seem few and far between for me. I’m 34 so I’m not old, but I’m also not surrounded by people my age all the time with infinite options for friends. Even when I was in my 20s in college, the perfect recipe for making friends, I still really struggled. And I don’t seem to ever be capable of making friends with the people I work with. I’ve tried meet ups in my area and they just don’t hit. I don’t know I guess I’m not really looking for suggestions or anything because I feel like I’ve tried the things that I have access to. I guess maybe if you have advice that isn’t generic bullshit that I see everywhere else I would be open to that. Mostly I’m just wondering if anyone feels as alone as I do with no idea how to fix it.. For example, if someone was like “have you met so-and-so they are sooo nice/pretty/smart/funny” I immediately feel like they are trying to insult me. I feel like idk why they would be telling me that other than to say that I’m NOT that thing. A couple months ago, one of my friends was talking about this other girl I haven’t met before and she was like, “she’s like the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen.” I’ve thought about it every day since she said it, nagging at me like a splinter, how could she possibly think someone was prettier than me!?. He had extreme emotional regulation issues and I stayed for the sex. With my awareness now I think he was likely BPD. To look at him, he wasn’t my physical type like at all, but the sex was bomb and he was fucking obsessed with me. The validation/supply was unreal. But it wasn’t love at all. I saw him as beneath me because of his appearance for sure. Like he was dating out of his league and he knew it and he put in so much effort. And literally anything I wanted to do sexually he was just game. Like anything to please me 😂🥵 But ultimately he wasn’t who I saw myself having any kind of future with. I felt embarrassed to be seen with him in public and long term my plan was always to meet someone else more attractive who could give me what I wanted. And in the meantime, the sex was definitely worth staying for and I didn’t meet anyone else before the relationship came to a head. I remember him falling into a deep depression and me making him go to therapy and then I stayed in the relationship because I wanted to look like I was the loving supportive girlfriend, but I wasn’t. I was pissed he wasn’t fucking me anymore. I felt so much resentment that I was having to deal with this person and all of their emotions like snap the fuck out of it and meet my needs again. Like I don’t think I ever made him feel like he was good enough. He gave me presents one time and I remember feeling this wave of clarity that I felt absolutely nothing for him like I wished I could just disappear right there and never have been a part of his life like he had never known me. I cried because I felt so sad for myself that I wasn’t with someone I loved. Why couldn’t I love this person? But I couldn’t ever leave them because then I’d be alone. But after so long of him, not meeting any of my needs, I just really didn’t have a use for him anymore so I broke up with him. He was crying and I felt nothing.So I really do think I am broken. I don’t know if I can be fixed; I don’t know what there is to fix.And creeps who DM me will continue to be blocked 😇😘. I was just talking in a comment and needed to make a full post because I’m just so angry! I hate having to work with the same damn people nearly every fucking day of my life. Having to pretend to like people that I can’t fucking stand! I swear to god everyone is so fucking fake! And we’re supposed to just not mask and be our true selves? Well my true self hates you! My true self fucking hates being told what to do by anyone! My true self thinks you’re beneath me and I have a list of reasons as long as my arm why! All I’ve done since my shitty day at work is fantasize about killing my sloppy, stupid boss and think about how badly I just want to quit this job after only 6 months and start over in a new job that deserves me!! I idealize how much better it’ll be there but I know it will end up being the same fucking story where I hate everyone and the work is stupid and beneath me and thinking about how much better it would be if I was in charge! I can’t keep playing these fucking social games and I can’t keep job hopping I’m just so fucking sick of all of it!!!!!. I currently work in a small team and I see mistakes my supervisor makes constantly. I’m not able to make any difference because they’re the supervisor all I can do is fix their mistakes the best I can per protocol but it’s still having a negative impact on the end work product. Or sometimes I will have a question about something and they will tell me what to do so I do it and then afterwards they say it was the wrong thing so I have to correct what I’ve done and look like the idiot when they are the dumbass who gave me the wrong information in the first place! This just happened so I’m fuming! 😤🤬It’s always been this way with people I work for making mistakes all the damn time - how can they be in charge when they are so incompetent!? I end up just leaving jobs because I can’t take it anymore and my new boss ends up being just as stupid! I need a job with full autonomy it’s killing me I’m going to lose it!. I’ve been so close to downloading Tinder, but I know that’s not the answer. I know that’s not what I need. It’s just been over a year and a half and I’m like having serious doubts that I’m even fuckable and I know that is supposed to come from within but literally HOW!?!?! Unless someone is FUCKING ME!??Like I know that I’m hot. I stand in front of the mirror and look at myself and yeah, I’m naturally just fucking gorgeous. I can also nitpick myself from head to toe. Sometimes I do that too, but I’ve really tried to get better about not doing it. Someone wanting to fuck me is how I validate all of the good things I feel about myself. It’s how I feel loved is by being desired. I think it’s because I was sexualized early as a child. I’ve always been pretty and developed early I was stacked at 12 and I HATED it. I grew up hating my body. And when I got attention from the guys I liked it was still uncomfortable but I felt like it helped to cancel out the attention I didn’t want. I felt like safe fucking who I wanted to fuck. And then someone I was fucking at one time went on to later rape me. I became so desperate and needy just looking for anyone who could keep me safe. Literally anyone who was willing to commit to a relationship and only fuck me. And then my last relationship I found out he had been cheating on me the whole time with sooo many people. And I was just this big fucking idiot who was willing to ignore it for so long because of how good he looked, we looked, I looked on paper. I didn’t think I could be “this person” any other way than by being in that relationship. And I fucking hated him for it for making me so fucking dependent on him. So I punished him mercilessly for 5 months while simultaneously breaking myself down further and further inside while showing him someone confident, independent, glowing up. It was all true, in some way. I was doing things I knew would make him leave while still hoping he would stay. He would trigger me with shit and I would make him live to regret it. I loved making him feel like the bad person so that I could feel like the good one. I loved pushing him past his need to please until he was the fucking asshole we both knew he really was. Pushing me past the sad girl to the psycho bitch we knew I really was. And then letting him dominate me sexually, switching, while i completely emotionally detach but also connecting in a way that’s so carnal and real. Fuck you, I still love you sex. Not being able to dominate him because it required vulnerability from me and I couldn’t get there anymore with him. He couldn’t even admit that he was into men too. I stopped respecting him. Needing him to stay but wanting so badly to leave and just not being strong enough and him being fine with letting me go. I was not going to let him go for anything. I lost fucking everything when he left. And he did it so easily as soon as he found someone new. And if he had kept me I would have stayed until I found someone I thought could give me what he couldn’t and I would’ve left too. Neither of us could lose the other because we couldn’t be alone but also because we still had a use for the other. He needed me to make a good impression at school and I needed him to show me a successful application cycle. We were two incredibly fucked up (unhealed) people using and manipulating the shit out of each other while lying to ourselves so that we could feel better about it - why was it so fucking thrilling!?I found me in another person and I lost that and I don’t ever want to feel anything with anyone again. I don’t know how to feel love without feeling THAT. I have talked about the time I got close recently with my ex coworker and I saw how fucking messy and gut wrenching it was going to be and I was so excited and drawn to it. I alluded myself into thinking it was going to be anything different than a disaster when he’s not just a coworker he’s 10 years younger than me! And yeah, I’m 30 fucking 4 I’m way too old to be doing this shit! But yeah the sexual validation it’s not even about being horny like I don’t even want to masturbate it’s not about pleasure it’s just about getting fucked. Like please someone want me while I degrade you. Like that’s gonna make me feel so safe and loved right now. It’s gonna make me feel all the good things about myself are true! But I know that’s not what I need to heal and I know that staying celibate and continuing to gain insight is what I need to heal. It’s just really fucking hard.And no, this is not an ad for any kind of service so if you send me a nasty fucking DM like the ones I’ve gotten in the past you will be blocked immediately! Fuck the fuck off!. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to become a doctor for 10 years longer than that really but actively trying to find a way to make it happen for 10 years. I finally found a path and it’s going to be really hard but it’s possible it’s finally possible and so I realize the only thing standing in my way now is me in my sense of whether or not I’m even gonna be able to do this like I’ve been self sabotaging for so long, and trying to hide in relationships and meet superficial needs trying to get from a partner what I knew I was never going to get from them because what I really wanted was to be a doctor and I wasn’t doing it and I wasn’t being it all my life I never knew what I was outside of that so it became my entire identity I never formed anything else. It’s what I attached everything to. And if I really just can’t be that then I don’t know what else I am. I dictated this into my phone instead of typing because my thoughts were just coming too quickly. I don’t know if there are typos and frankly, I don’t want to reread what I’ve written because then I’ll probably delete it and I need this to be out there I think.I can make great first impressions but I can’t sustain it. I try but I ultimately just end up isolating until I find another cluster B to sit in the corner and be freaks with until the situation ultimately implodes.. How do I make myself stop when I realize that’s what I’m doing?. He’s like 60 the thought of it is so disgusting! He keeps finding me on new platforms and messaging me even though I’m not responding. It’s kind of funny and pathetic so I guess I do get supply from that! 😂My friends are telling me to block him so he stops but what fun would that be 🤣. And when I was with them, why did I want to hurt them just so I could make it better?. In case you also have no one in your life to say this to you today 💐💝For self-love, I’m going for a walk in the park today and letting myself cry as much as I need to.. All of my family lives in Ohio where I was born. I’ve gotten to see my family once a year which may have been for the best because they all turned out to be selfish and crazy. I guess that’s where I get it from. My mom moved me to St. Louis when I was two because she met my ex stepdad and he got a job here. He used to beat the shit out of us until they got divorced when I was six. I would visit him every other weekend until he found a new woman online who lived overseas and brought her here and started a new family with her. I guess he didn’t need me anymore. I wonder if he beat the shit out of them too. He died in 2023.After that, my mom had many boyfriends (all varying degrees of asshole) until she met my current stepdad. She held onto this one. He’s rich. She never has to worry about money anymore. They bought a second house last year. It’s in Ohio. It’s right on the coast of Lake Erie where you can see the ships come in. I’ve only seen it in pictures as my health has been too poor to go see it in person.I have a few friends here in St. Louis, but aside from that I’m pretty disconnected. I’ve had nothing but shitty relationships and have continued to sabotage and be unable to form connections because of everything that she’s put me through. I’ve wanted to move away from St. Louis over the years and have mentioned it multiple times in each time she’s always said “what if you need something what if you need help and I’m not there and you have no family around who’s gonna help you?”We were talking today about their lake house and she tells me “I’m getting the heck out of here and moving there as soon as I can.” I was brought here and isolated just to be abandoned as soon as the opportunity came along.. Thank you! :). I started having pain in my left calf again like when I had my DVTs diagnosed last June. The pain has gotten worse over the last three days. I went to the ED and they did an ultrasound which showed that I have a chronic clot. They recommended compression stockings and me on my way. Even with the compression stockings, there’s pain. And even with trying to move as much as possible, there’s pain. Is my chronic clot what’s causing this and that’s PTS? I am already seeing a hematologist and have been talking with the office, but they’re taking a while to get back to me and I’m so anxious about this! I’ve been reading on here that there’s hope for this to get better in time, but I don’t know if that’s for PTS that’s due to chronic clot or when your valves are insufficient? When she did the ultrasound, she showed me that I had blood regurg as well. And I would think that would be due to valves and not the clot?I don’t know I’m just so confused and upset about all of this. I stopped taking birth control for years and then decided to start back up again and within six months I got two DVTs. Biggest fucking regret of my life.A lifetime of dealing with this now because I went back on it for six months.. I’ve been single and celibate for a year and a half now by choice and I know it’s been good for me. I don’t want a relationship and I don’t want random sex and I’ve never been one for friends with benefits. I’m far too possessive and catch feelings within five seconds. So I don’t actually want anyone I just want to *be wanted* by someone - I miss that feeling a lot. Maybe that’s what supply is on the most basic level. I don’t know. I just know that what I liked best about being with someone was feeling wanted and I miss feeling that.. For me it’s singing! :D I’ve never been able to sing, like actually sing, in front of anyone. When I’m alone, I’m singing on and off all day long. There’s always a song in my head and I just love music. When I’m alone, I try to imitate the voices I hear and imagine that I sound just as good as they do if not better. It gives me a feeling like I could be a star if I was ever discovered, but I also could never put myself out there to actually sing for anyone because if someone were to tell me that I was a bad singer a part of me would die and I would feel like I could no longer engage in that hobby without feeling like a pathetic failure loser. It would be a dream come true to take singing lessons someday but I feel like I couldn’t handle it. Any criticism would kill me.I don’t feel bad about it I feel pretty giddy! It’s nice I looked it up online and they’re like $50.It’s punishment for how he left things. I had my eye on it since he had started working there so even though he’s a runaway coward I feel like it’s even.. It’s freaking me out idk where to go for this and am worried about a bad infection :(. And it’s all I let people truly have access to so I feel like the outside needs to be enoughIt’s all I feel like people care about ultimately and it’s how I’ve always been treated. I feel like it’s a really big factor for me. I think it’s something I always thought was confidence but as i become more aware (and as my therapist points out to me) I realize that it’s me using my appearance to help seduce, get my way, and influence how I’m perceived. I am always curious when things go well for me how much of it can be attributed to me being attractive and that coming with natural advantages. I think I’m still working on being able to tell when I’m being manipulative.We were talking about things I have a pattern of doing to others and my entitlement to their space to the degree I don’t allow them any privacy from me. The conversation got to a point where she said this (title) to me. My mind just went completely blank and all I could do was shrug and say “I don’t know.”I’m just kind of at a loss of what to think because I’ve opened up to her about some pretty horrific shit that’s happened to me. I guess my behavior and lack of remorse (for what I admit was/is a long pattern of lying and manipulation of others and pretty significant violation of their autonomy) was/is bad enough that she thinks something even *worse* must have happened to me? Is my behavior just that abhorrent?I guess I’m just processing all of this out loud since it was really disarming when she said that and it’s been on my mind since.. I was laying in bed exhausted from crying for 4 hours thinking I’m pretty tired and might just try to sleep. I try to dry my face and end up getting eyelashes in my eyes. I’m trying to flush them out with eye wash and it’s not working and my hair is in my face and I start to spiral. I rip my hair back into the tightest bun possible and start blasting my eyes with eye wash, shocker they’re irritated as hell now. I begin screaming my grievances into the void making my cats run and hide. My face is still wet but when I try to dry it my skin is raw from all the fucking crying and I just need to get in the shower NOW! I’m ripping my clothes off and I can’t get my ponytail out of my hair because I made my bun so fucking tight. The water is heating and I’m straddling the side of the tub at this point raging in tongues because I’m so fucking mad I can’t form words. I shower angrily at first then start to calm. Now I’m back in bed exhausted hoping to fall asleep soon and wondering who it was that made all that ruckus couldn’t have been me I’m a sleepy baby.. My mom didn’t even mean to get pregnant. She was knocked up at 21. Didn’t even marry my dad. My grandparents raised me for my first year of life and then she met my first stepdad and moved me out of state. He beat us and then divorced my mom when I was 6 and got some woman from Russia to come over and he had 2 kids with her and he died in 2023. Next guy also left for another woman and her 3 kids. She dated a bunch of other dead beats and I was shipped back and forth between her and my dad and had no boundaries in either home because I was literally home alone most of the time and raised myself. When I was 18 she had me change my last name to hers instead of my dad’s to really show him - she’s the one who gave me his name in the first place which makes no sense when she wanted nothing to do with him anyways? He didn’t even pay child support.I told her when I was 21 I should’ve been aborted. I had relationships fail over and over again until here I am at 34 single and really don’t see a point to any of the life I’ve lived. I don’t see a point to living now my life sucks, I have no direction, and I’ve been in so much fucking therapy you really think something would’ve helped give me any kind of meaning at this point. Nope.I have been celibate since becoming aware. I thought it would all be for something good until the first person I attached to ended up just being a fucking liar and ghosting me. Our fling was the one good thing I had in my life in the last 1.5 years and losing that is enough to make me feel like I’ve lost fucking everything. Like what do I have? A job that pays shit, no work friends, a family I’ve cut off, and no realistic, tangible hope that things will improve in those areas.I have a couple friends and 2 cats that are probably the only reason I haven’t just killed myself already. But it’s not like they needed me. They all would’ve been fine had they never met me.I have tried to quit smoking weed so many times the last 4 years and it feels impossible. The only reason I haven’t smoked today is because my throat started bleeding yesterday and I wanted to smoke so badly when I got home I was sobbing and just growing more and more enraged thinking how weed is the one thing I feel like I can look forward to and it’s actively harming me.There is no fucking point to me existing and I just fucking hate it here.. I’m looking at my past relationships for what they *actually* were and realizing I absolutely used these people to fill my own needs. To make me feel a certain way about myself. To make others see me a certain way and create a certain image. I think that was my fantasy really - it was more about me than anything else. I wanted people to admire me because of the person on my arm so if these people weren’t going to make me look good I wasn’t going to be with them (publicly). I would accept attention privately from people to feel good but had there been any public association I would’ve been humiliated. I think back to *who* the people actually were that I dated and I don’t even know. I can remember some of their hobbies and some of the more significant dates, experiences we had but in terms of who these people were as like people/individuals? They all are pretty interchangeable for me. I can compare them in terms of looks and who the sex was best with. I can remember the sex most out of anything it was the biggest focus of the relationship for me so it makes sense. Idk maybe I’m in my ego right now idk I’m still processing this I looked at myself in the mirror when I got home today and just started sobbing immediately because of how much I fucking hated being inside of this thing I was looking at. The idea that there could be a real person in there swirling inside of so much ugliness and could actually be worth loving and sticking around for. Idk if she’ll ever get it because I’m just so fucked up. I can’t even be consistently loving towards her how could anyone else? I don’t set boundaries with men and can’t form a relationship with one that’s not based on sex, I smoke weed like everyday is my last day of freedom, and I can’t feed and hydrate myself consistently. All I can do is perform well at work and look good ok that’s what I’ve got right now.But if you asked me a couple weeks ago when my coworker was still obsessed with me how I felt I’d tell you I was on top of the world and could achieve the dream I’ve been self-sabotaging for several years. Now I feel in a hole I’ll never get out of. How do I see these flaws and love this person who could be doing so much better than she is and she’s not because of me. And how do I forgive her for that.I feel the more stressed I am the less capable I am of eating. I can feel the hunger pain and the thought of anything is repulsive. I spend hours thinking of food item after food item just hoping one of them will sound palatable and it’s to the point I get weak, have migraines, brain fog, irritability. And then I have a sensitive stomach so there are times I eat only to get sick and the food comes back up.I wish I didn’t need to eat at all it’s just a feeling of stress compounding and even bowls of weed smoked a day will not get my appetite to where I’m capable of eating with consistency. It just gets bad like this sometimes and right now it’s been since the start of December I haven’t been eating much at all. It’s not something that’s a constant issue but in the last year it’s been worse than it had in over a decade. Because it’s also been the worst year of my life in over a decade.Whatever I just want to be able to eat consistently if anyone has any advice let me know.. She said I am projecting an illusion onto people that I then attach to and, over time, when the person presents themselves not to be that way I feel betrayed and abandoned by them and I try to change them to fit the illusion. I realized after she said it that it was accurate of every single relationship I’ve had and I kind of freaked out saying how defeated I felt. She reassured me that, that was why I was in therapy and now that I’m aware of it we can work on it.But my god I haven’t been dating a bunch of criminal masterminds spinning these webs of deception it’s been me putting the disguises on them in the first place and falling in love with people that aren’t even fucking real. It’s just a fantasy in my head, the same one over and over again, that I play with every new partner thinking this one is going to be it because they’re *sooo much different from all the others*!Isn’t that insanity? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results? Fuck. So this is why my last therapist wanted me to stay single I guess. Idk how to end this. Tell me it gets better?. I mean I guess I know *why* but like whyyyy 🥺I know it won’t change anything about my life circumstances, and yet I crave that empty external validation like it’s going to save me. It feels like getting free money. But the kind that you blow all in one night and wake up no richer.I actually thought I was handling this right and listening to my therapist and setting boundaries and turns out I drove someone to quit their job. And that’s with me trying to do the right things and being self aware. Jesus Christ this is so fucked. Relationships only ever lead to a colossal fucking mess I’m so sick of everything. It was a group of women only and it was centered on all of us having attachment issues. I had been in the group, meeting virtually once a week, for a few months and then a new girl joined. She was polished and outspoken and I immediately hated her. She was good at opening up and she was good at proving emotional support to the other girls. I was trying to control my emotions but I would be in session and my heart would pound the entire time because I just wanted to fucking explode I hated her so much. Then one day the therapist was talking to her and said “I can tell you put a lot of effort into to your appearance and looking put together” and while I remained silent internally I was losing my fucking shit. I figured it wasn’t healthy for my physical health anymore so I quit.Fucking bitch is fake as fuck and the group is pathetic for not seeing through it.She’s nowhere near as hot as me. But looking back now I realize where the anger was coming from. Feelings of inadequacy, intimidation, fear. When the therapist made that comment I interpreted it as them saying she was the prettiest girl in the group, was perfect, and better than me in all perceivable ways. And I felt like she just started the group and was making connections with the other girls in ways I hadn’t been able to for months. I felt like all the girls liked her better than me and like they were all ganging up against me every time they would have a positive interaction of any kind. I was dealing with my own feelings of not being good enough, broken, and then the therapist went and said that and it was like confirming all of the worst thoughts I had about myself.I was dealing with self-hatred and projecting that hate onto her. Why can’t I do better? Why can’t I be like that?I think I do this with more people than her and I think I do it a lot. I think it’s why I have a hard time making friends with girls in general. I’m not really sure how to work past this.. I broke today.I lost something very special to me today in the parking garage and a security guard helped me find it. I started to tear up telling them how special this thing was to me. They offered me a hug and I took it.It was genuine connection and it felt so wonderful. And I see how empty my life is of that, truly. And admitting to myself how much I want that, genuinely. And I am a sobfest tonight because I feel like I came so close to having that again, and it wasn’t real. Once again I fell completely in love with an illusion and had my heart shattered in 3 weeks.My therapist helped me understand and truly comprehend how my own actions in this led me to where I am. I realize I am not a giant victim in this and that I have complete disregard for boundaries, a massive need to please others because I crave intimacy while also at the same time being completely terrified of it, and I have hypersexuality and create these intimate relationships in places that have absolutely no future or is in some way completely inappropriate or plain dangerous. And to be honest I knew when I was with him I was playing with fire. I was just arrogant enough to think that I was smarter so I wasn’t going to be the one who ended up hurt in all this. And I did what I needed to do to put an end to the relationship on my terms with him believing he was the only one at fault and me walking away still looking perfect. Wanting him to suffer forever and torment his mind silently.Anyways I got off track because I’m blazed again tonight, as usual but yeah wanted to be accountable for my bullshit so here I am 🙃.
    Currently in a bit of a slump career wise, and I am seriously considering switching it up ie switching fields entirely. But then I keep reminding myself that it might just be the grandiose thinking and that it’s a bad idea, I should just settle. But then again it is not NOT unheard of in normal people to switch careers. You guys are usually really smart and good at telling those kinds of things, anyone has a good idea? Like how do you tell the difference? We have to act on our impulses sometimes too right? Otherwise all npd would be stuck in the same position for life, and that’s not normal either.I believe one of my worst/most narcissistic things is that I don’t tolerate vulnerabilities in others. This is ugly so bare with me.If I hear about someone who is going through stuff that I have also gone through but they ”allow” themselves to delve into the pain, it’s nearly impossible for me to empathize with them. For example: someone is bed bound due to depression, and are home sick from work because of that, living on state money and fully being taken care of. It’s like ”I suffered the same thing, I didn’t get to surrender, you are telling me you do?”. I was depressed to, I didn’t get to be home sick and have other people care and PAY for me, I had to get up and pay taxes and contribute. I had to push through the pain, every single day, and cry during the bathroom break. Somehow it makes me lose respect for someone and see them as someone immoral, less worthy, someone who is selfish.It’s very illogical because A. It was always my own choice to ”not surrender” ie seek support (because I am so uncomfortable with vulnerability, so really it is my own fault) and B. Obviously I don’t know exactly what they’re going through. This is just by judging from the outside that ’our life should be roughly the same amount of shit’.If it is someone who has gone through something that I did not, something that I can gauge is much worse than the hardships I have gone through, it is easy to empathize. Say it is someone who had their partner pass away, I feel deep sadness and care for them. But say it’s someone who is devastated from going through a breakup, I don’t empathize.I feel like it should be the opposite. Like I know how rough it is to barely get out of bed with depression, I know how breakups feel. I should be able to feel MORE for a person experiencing that same pain. Instead it’s the complete opposite??? Why? And how do I fix myself?Edit: you guys are some of the most insightful and self aware people. So thankful for all of your responses!. If so, for how long? Is that possible for us?Of course healthy/normal is relative, but let’s say for as long as the other partner has not yet (lol) complained about your behaviour and you feel that you have been able to be a healthy partner.. *title is supposed to say ’no excuse’ lolThe empaths love to use the ”well I went through trauma as well, and now I am an EMPATH. What’s your excuse?” I wonder if maybe trauma + support = increased empathy or becoming an ”empath”. Trauma + insufficient support = NPD. If it’s true, then basically they are saying ”I received support in my trauma while you had to face it all alone, loser!!”. What do you think?The more I think about it the more sense it makes. Maybe npd isn’t caused by trauma itself, but rather the absense of support in the face of trauma?I don’t know if anyone has a similiar experience, but in my case I was taught as a kid that if I experienced pain (normal part of life) other people would make it worse. They would also be the source of the pain. What do you do when there are not enough positive experiences to counterbalance the negative? Well you distance yourself emotionally, and learn to always put yourself first. It does explain the lack of empathy but doesn’t really explain the hypersensitivity to criticism and low self esteem. I don’t know.It sucks that there’s not a lot of research on this topic. How about you? Did you grow up with support? Do you think it was trauma that made you this way? Or lack of support? Or something else?. When I was a kid it felt like everyone was automatically gravitating towards eachother, like magnets. I was born without one. I took pride in ”not needing anyone”, while everyone else seemed so needy, I felt so special.Today I wrote to chatgpt, trying to understand the core wound of my npd. I talked about my dog, and we concluded that what I experience with her is love and empathy. I feel her pain and distress in my body. I feel her happiness too. Her needs before mine, always. This is very unlike my human relationshipd.Then it clicked, that my dog is actually giving me care, unconditional love and empathy, and that our relationship mimics (although ofcourse different in many ways) what other people experience in human-human relationships.It never clicked for me, until now, that human relationships could contain those ingredients too. I honestly thought that other people had relationships for mostly practical and fun reasons, nothing else. Which was how I viewed other people too. Keep eachother around for fun, but keep your walls up, people can’t be trusted. But no, apparently, people gravitate towards relationships because they (pointing to the second point here) are looking for love and empathy. The same empathy and love I feel with my dog, that I didn’t knew was missing in human relationships, because I didn’t know it was supposed to be there.All of a sudden it makes sense why they gravitated towards eachother. From a biological standpoint empathy is self-serving. You care for another human being, they care about you, you both end up with greater chances of survival. That’s that. Self-sacrificing is not really a thing. But yeah, if you don’t even know you have something to gain, why do it. If this is the case, it doesn’t make me a monster, it means that everyone else was busy looking for something delicous that I had never tasted yet.Or maybe I have misunderstood the whole thing. Anyway, it’s weird, because I see a lot of you having completely awful stories which explains why you got this messed up. I really don’t.
    i need him i need him i need him i need him in order to feel like a person but hes fucking blocked me and moved on with his life and its NOT FUCKING FAIR because HE HAS AN IDENTITY he is a person outside of me but the only time i feel like a cohesive fucking being is with him and through his perception i genuinely dont know if i can live a real life without him and be anything but a walking shifting void of a carcass please tell me you guys understand what I meanWHAT DO I DO GENUINELY edit: thank you for all the kind responses with genuine advice, im gonna come back to this when i start to spiral :) hope everyone who relates to this finds healing and self validation, in the end being cut off from supply is for the best.
