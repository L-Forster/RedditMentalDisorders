Used to when hovering over something it would circle the word in a little box that I could stretch out to translate whole sentences. Now it just highlights a single word meaning I have to hover over every word in the text I want to see, incredibly inconvenient. How do I fix this?. Like there's medical peopleThen there's developersMedical people know what to do with information and what it meansDevelopers know how to use a devices capabilities to gather that info through sensors and such (think smart watches) Who connects the two? Do the developers consult doctors? Are there doctor-devs?. Hey all. Looking to buy my first project car, something pre 2010 and under $10k. I would like it to be a more sporty type car instead of a daily driver/truck that I can have fun driving and learning about. What brands and models are pretty beginner friendly to crack into learning about cars? I work as an industrial mechanic for machinery so I already have all the tools I could possibly need, luckily that part won't be a problem.I've leveled, ran my first layer z offset test prints, cleaned the bed, dried the filament, but they just won't stick. Running PLA at 210 nozzle 80 bed. Any ideas? No clogs either. It'll go fine the first bit and a few layers later it will spaghetti or elephant's foot on me.I understand north and south, but what makes Asia "east"? East of what?. 1 apple has enough seeds to spawn like 20 apple trees that have 1000 apples that have enough seeds for 20000 trees that have 100000 apples that Like dude wtf infinite food glitch. Title. Such as "I can't remember his name but it was an older gentleman"I feel as if "Lady" or "Woman" isn't as respectful as the gentleman term.Just brushed mine for the first time in 2 weeks.. It sucks when depression denies me even the most basic self care..So, I'm thinking about visiting the local temple to sit in and relax, take part in the community, and at some point volunteer my time in whatever way possible to help. I would like to note that while I am atheist I understand that everybody is welcome, right? I'm simply wanting to take part as I believe it is a kind and fulfilling community to be a part of that does good things for people. Questions:- How do I wrap my head? With a basic square bandana? What kind of wrap style do I use, like how do I actually tie it as I've never worn one. - When taking shoes off, does that include socks? - What are the most common times to sit in on a service? And are there common times for meditation? - Any general tips/advice so I don't accidentally offend anybody? - I have seen it is common to bow to the scripture, how is this bow done? Just a quick one, more of a 90 degree, or like a full on knees bow?. At least I'd have money instead of blowing it all on fast food and being a fat fucking loser.I'm building something that will be like a bag, but with a constant flow of a gas going through it. If you were to just fill up the bag with gas without letting it out, it'd pop, but if you just broke a hole in the bag it would let outside air in. I need something that would let the bag move out the excess gas, while not letting outside oxygen in. Any idea what sort of valve or something could do that?. Visiting IC today and I'd love some recommendations.I understand that working out equals burning calories, but I also understand that working out burns a woeful amount of calories. To eat what they eat would take like 24 hours of exercise to burn off. How do they eat this much and not get fat?. Not always, but I have to avoid it a lot when it happens. Scenes involving orgies, threesomes, sometimes even one on one sex, and any type of sexual activity that is taboo, they put me into basically freak-out mode. I have to turn off the TV and curl into a ball, sometimes screaming, hitting my head, punching things, and shaking. For note, I am diagnosed autistic and while I do have trauma relating from a childhood sa event, flashbacks are not a part of these freakouts nor do I think about it at all. It seems that just things sexual in nature overstimulate me and make my mind go into overdrive which causes a freakout or something? I have no idea and I don't know how to bring it up with a therapist either.I used to do -0.360 and now to get a proper print I need -1.4. What's the deal here? I'm using the same resolution, speed, filament, etc etc but one day after I cleared a clog the -0.360 never worked again. Anycubic Kobra Neo.Hey all, just want to see what we're working with in 2023. There's so many conditional boosts and such now that it takes some intense research to find the most damaging. I remember the days of around 40 million being max, with V2 Rayleigh. What are your highest damage teams on the calculator in 2023?. I'm trying to get rid of my Kia because I've lost all trust in the company, but as I save up a down payment to do so I have spent an absurd amount of time trying to decide what to get. I've decided between mazda and toyota but then it brings up another issue. What kind? A sports car? They have bad mpg, more expensive to buy and insure, more likely for me to get a speeding ticket. An SUV/Mini SUV? Also bad milage, but so much space. A compact? Great mileage but I'm a big guy. I'm just so stuck in the middle of all these options.I have depression, I get sad about my looks which further makes me depressed. How am I supposed to worry about grooming my hair, skincare routines, etc etc when it takes all of my energy to simply shower, shave, brush my teeth, and use deodorant?. I don't wanna see that stuff bro... I understand that long ago some nsfl subs were banned causing a possible increase in other subs but that was a couple years ago..https://i.imgur.com/IFdkaky.jpg. We have an online store in which we sell products from many various pieces of media. How would we find out what all these medias belong to and how to get permission to sell this merchandise?. Taste of Italy on University Ave for me. Best sandwiches I've ever had. Always get a spicy buffalo toasted on hoagie. Super friendly vibe too.For the longest time I never understood the actions I took as a stim and they always made me think I was severely messed up mentally, especially the fact that I am able to supress these actions in public/around others made me in some way feel like I didn't actually have it. Like why do I do it in private but I can easily control it around others by actively supressing? 1. Head tapping. I splay my hands out and tap my head. Happens a lot when I'm watching a show that excites me. I tap with my thumbs and rotate my wrists to then tap with the other 4 fingers, very rapidly. 2. The jolt. This one I always made me think I had something very wrong with me. My entire body will do a quick jerk, a jolt, just a quick shake. Happens sorta uncontrollably when I'm very stressed or sad. Also happens when I'm happy or excited.I noticed after leaving work today that I did something really stupid. A piece of equipment was on a cart and needed to be put in the place it was going, 2 of them were lifting it and the front end needed a third person (me). So I stood on the wheeled cart and lifted it, it almost slipped from under me but I continued and nearly pulled a muscle lifting up this end of the equipment. We got it in the spot, but I didn't even think about how stupid that was until I left work. There were 3 men besides me and all I thought about was "Gotta get the job done Gotta get the job done". Is this normal in construction work? I feel like I've seen this mentality a lot of "Get the job done no matter what" even though we're trained to not do that. What the fuck is this?? They want $500 to add me to a list to wait that doesn't even guarantee I'll get a car. How is this shit legal. Everytime I go to dealership to see my options, I try to negotiate. Car price. Trade in price. Options. Etc etc, I've always been told to be firm and negotiate the best offer, but EVERYBODY seems to be like talking to a rock wall! Is negotiating a deal dead in the current car market or am I just not good at it?. Hello all. I am an industrial mechanic who specializes in a specific type of equipment that is in abundance in all sorts of factories. I'm taking the biggest advice I've seen here time and time again; if you have a unique skill, SELL IT. What I specialize in is repairing this equipment, which also means I am good at diagnosing the equipment for problems. Even in such a way that I should be able to guide customers over video call to the correct places on the equipment so I can tell them "Here's your problem." Unfortunately I can't just travel around and make this a legitimate in person business as I don't have that capital. But I would enjoy it as a side gig. My selling point would be charging a pittance compared to what bigger companies would to diagnose issue. (What is considered a pittance to a large company is still considered a very very nice amount to a single person.) How would I go about this? I'm looking to create a website, and start networking from 0. I may be able to find some smaller businesses in my area to do physical work in before I move to doing work in the online space for customers states away, just so I can get a small following built up.For the last couple years my brother has tried and tried to convince me to become his truck partner. Now I love the dude, peas in a pod and all that, but I'm worried about the money. He always seems to be flaunting wealth the couple times he vacations at my place per year, buying us stuff, fancy restaurants, the works. I assume he just lives frugally the rest of the year. So. Between truck leasing, repairs, etc etc, how viable is it?. Like Caribou Lou and Brass Monkey. 2015 Sorento. Engine Replacement under engine knock, my AC no longer blows cold air and it's record heat. I can barely drive my car when it's been sitting in this heat all day and the closest they can get me in is December when the heat will be gone anyway! Should I call corporate? I need some sort of recourse or reimbursement for the suffering I'm gonna have to go through to sit through this shit.I got a letter notifying of my suspension for speeding in my previous state, but last week before getting the letter I had gotten my new states license. Does this mean I'm good to just ignore it since I both no longer live in that state and am no longer licensed in that state?. I've had edamame before but you're supposed to eat them without the shell, you can eat the shell but it's rough. It's there any good way to prepare whole green beans so that they will go well in a stir fry without the toughness of that shell? Will just the frying process soften it?. Got my engine replaced, a month in the shop. Get it back and the guy tells me "We topped off your freon it was at about half. Might be a leak" and now my AC doesn't work. It blows air but it doesn't blow cold air, which is unacceptable in these current temperatures. What do I do here? Leak or not my AC has worked just fine for 2 years since getting this car. It's only stopped working after they put a new engine."Stop eating in your room"I realized as a fail my diet, it all happens in my room. I don't want to go to the kitchen and make something. I'll doordash. I'll order pizza. If I would just stand up and walk outside of my room, chances of breaking my diet go down a LOT. From today forward I'll be implementing a no food/drink besides water in my room rule. Anybody else have experience with this?. I understand back in the days when a watch could be called a hand crafted piece of art but these days when laser cutters and computer aided things can cut out any needed piece, what commands such a high price on some watches anymore?. Hi! I'm 21, have a 684 score. Looking to improve this before buying a house next year. Currently owe a little less than $1k in credit card debt, $13k on a car, and $2300 in a loan I took with rhe bank. I'm having trouble between wanting to save and wanting to pay debt, does anybody have any tips? I have no savings, because every extra money I get I want to pay off debt, but I'm worried that I won't save enough money for the closing costs on my house within the next year as well if I put all my money on debt. Advice greatly appreciated! I'm not sure how 684 is for a 21 year old but I feel it could be much much better.My least expired 2 months ago. My landlord is extremely forgetful, and while I have been in contact about a new one, she has still not provided and we have been on a verbal (Non recorded) agreement that I will continue paying my current rate until such time that she provides a new lease. If I am living here leaseless does this mean she can kick me out at any time? Conversely, am I free to just up and leave without notice?. 21 year old Worker from Urbandale. I make about 60k, which is plenty to make rent and live. But how am I supposed to crack into the housing market around here? Every house I see seems to have absurd estimates for monthly payments not even including insurance! How is one supposed to afford a house?? The only things that are even close to affordable are places that are half fallen apart. I'm interested in Psychology as I gave an intense lifelong interest in the human psyche. But I can't do math. I'm autistic and it just doesn't click. For my first degree in electric substation utilities my aunt would sit with me 4-6 hours every Saturday and I still barely passed Precalc with a D. I have cried actual tears forcing myself to try to understand math and it just will not click.
    Those lines that make you do the stank face“I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do” is up there for me. I genuinely don’t want to be an older age. The idea of saying 26 or 27 when someone asks how old I am sounds fucking horrible to me. I’m just about coping with the fact that I’m 25 now.Not because going into your late 20s is an objectively bad experience. Its more so because of how society (especially the college age and below) vilify and basically makes fun of being around those ages.It’s the “your pushing 30 and you’re still doing this or that” that I constantly see. It’s the whole age gap conversation that I feel like I see every other day on social media. The idea that I’ll soon be seen as a “creep” for being attracted to a 20 y/o is so deeply depressing to me. Especially cause I feel like I was just 19/20/21 myself and I blew that whole period of my life living like a hermit, just letting the weeks, months and birthdays just come and go. I feel like my youth is gone, and more than anything I want a second chance at it.I just feel like people my age are already parents, in serious/long term relationships and a few are even engaged/married. Life truly is moving too fast and a large part of me wants out.What’s a disguised/seemingly innocent line that’ll have a girl thinking about you (or at least what you said) after you part ways?. Do people consider “episodes” only as those instances where the heart races rapidly?I feel momentary skipped beats that last for a second or two almost daily, multiple times a day, all while having a normal heart rate. However, I’ve had 2 “episodes” where my heart rate goes crazy high and required me to go to the ER to have it normalized.Does it sound like I have paroxysmal or persistent Afib?For extra context: My heart rate returned back to normal both times after 6-8 hours following a Diltiazem injection and a Metoprolol tablet.Those mid/lower table players that can every now and then pull off a world class performance or score a ridiculous goal.Eg. Almiron (that insane 2/3 month period last season), Iheanacho (that period at the end of the 2020/21 season), Gerard Deulofeu. Who do you like watching interviews/social content from the most?Bellingham, Conor Coady, Alex Oxlade Chamberlain come to mind for me.What’s the one thing you tried that actually gave you noticeably positive results? Even if it was short lived.Not even necessarily the best overall, they don’t even have to have end product. Strictly technically gifted dribblers. Couple of mine are Zinckernagel, Brennan Johnson, Onel Hernandez, Josh Bowler. Why do earlier episodes suggest that he became the OCD germaphobe that we know him as only AFTER Trudy died, but later episodes show him being that way in flashbacks/memories of him when he was really young?. Authority figures? Your peers? Complete strangers?. Why do boots feel clunky on my feet and make me feel clumsy? Can anyone else relate?. And how tf do you cope?? It’s the most awkward thing to experience ever.I’m talking doing things like playing a sport, going to/finishing college, working etc. Tim talking doing things like playing a sport, going to/finishing college, working etc. I’m 23 now (which I know is still sort of young), but I already feel like I’ve missed out on my youth because of how reclusive I’ve been forced to be because of my SA.I’ve been basically a hermit since like 17, and it feels like I blinked and now I’m 23. I haven’t made any friends, or had any sort of dating life in that time period (despite going to college). I mean sure my life can make a change for the better at any point in the future, especially if I live long, but I just feel like I’m going to completely miss out on the best years of my life and idk if I’ll be able to live with that regret. Can anyone else relate?. My hair's grown out right now. Do I have to get a low cut to start out with? Or can I get like a 2.5 and start from there? (I have coarse hair btw).
    I have been suffering from depression and anxiety and accompanying brain fog which has gotten worse over the past few months. It has taken a toll on my cognitive abilities and my ability to stay motivated and/or productive. Nevertheless, I came to know that I somehow managed to top my class in a subject today. On the bright side, I felt relieved because I felt like I hadn't become too dumb altogether because of my condition. On the other hand, I wish that I could share my feelings about it with someone; how I could not feel happy despite receiving the splendid news (it's a small win ik but given my struggles, it means a lot to me); how I still feel s\*icidal; how I am still racked by self-doubt, and how I wish that I would not wake up tomorrow when I go to sleep. I know there will be a lot of kind people in this sub who will listen to me, and I have met a lot of people through forums like this one, but at the end of the day, nothing quite replaces the feeling of being able to feel secure to open up to a friend in person that you can trust, and who understands your condition. Unfortunately, I don't have the latter. A lot of my friends who were happy for me are nevertheless the same ones who betrayed my trust and belittled my condition, and given my trust issues, I have to just pretend to be happy despite the fact that I still feel terrible because I really do not want to divulge anything to anyone who knows me.. I have gone through the same stages so many times I am beyond exhausted. I feel passively suicidal and wish that someone would shoot me or I'd die in an accident or something. Being beset by these thoughts exhausts me to the point I feel numb and I dissociate from myself and whatever is happening around me. I fall into a state of being unproductive and become listless. At this point everything is a chore including basic things like brushing my teeth, doing my laundry, or going to the grocery. I have to then put all of these tasks on my habit tracker to create an incentive to do all of these things, and manufacture motivation by seeing the "streak" that I have maintained. I somehow then muster the energy over the span of weeks to reach a functional state where I am fairly productive. Then automatically, or by virtue of some trigger, my passively suicidal thought become intense, I become exhausted and the cycle repeats. I have been living through this hell for 2 years now and I don't know how many more of these cycles I have left in my. The sheer mechanical nature of this makes me dejected and I induces a feeling of helplessness. I hate this.I want to add the property/metadata "type" with the value "essay" to all markdown files in a particular folder. Is there any way to achieve this?. There are several [news reports](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/hamas-blocking-evacuation-of-civilians-in-gaza-idf-ahead-of-ground-offensive/articleshow/104438188.cms?from=mdr) that say that Hamas is blocking the evacuation of civilians from the Northern part of Gaza, with the source of this information being the IDF. I am doubtful as to the veracity of this claim. Can someone verify if this is indeed true?. I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOEV7q7B2DU) of Advocate Jai Sai Deepak's arguments in the Supreme Court during the Same-Sex Marriage hearings. I found several points raised by him in this excerpt to be extremely problematic and deserving of criticism, and since afaik, nobody has responded to his arguments, I have written an admittedly inchoate response to some of the points that he raised. These are some of the arguments raised by JSD that I intend to respond to:1. **When the petitions raise the issue of change of heteronormative attitudes, the society has a right to participate in these proceedings**2. **Does social conservativeness have no place within the constitution?**3. **The nature of the submissions has the effect of individualizing socio-centric institutions such as marriage** **The absence of society's say in this matter demeans the institution of marriage and takes away its social character.**4. **The fact that the legislation that is the subject of the proceedings is SMA warrants the society's participation**5. **The object of a marriage is a child**6. **Public morality is fashioned by normative attitudes and the norm is decided primarily by the mainstream.**These views in my opinion expressed by JSD in my opinion have not received sufficient attention or criticism from left/liberal circles. These views are highly problematic in my opinion since JSD is making a case for entrenching majoritarian fiat under the garb of "democracy". While it may be contended that JSD is merely playing the role of a lawyer in this instance, I believe that his political views, as well as his arguments in the Marital Rape hearings before the Delhi High Court among other things, reflect a propensity to subjugate minority rights and concerns to "social norms" and "public sentiment", a discourse that is dangerous and deserves some pushback. The comments on this video have unfortunately engaged in blind praise of JSD's oratory skills without evaluating the strength of his arguments. I do not intend to pen down a full critique of his arguments here but I would like to put forth some objections to what I find are glaring deficiencies in his arguments:* While society's right to participate in these proceedings cannot be gainsaid, the current government (as well as its predecessors) has a lackluster record when it comes to engaging in substantive consultations. For eg., the absence of meaningful consultations by the Centre was evident from the pushback on the 2019 Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019. The government virtually ignored the responses by various trans rights groups to the successive versions of the bill proposed and enacted a bill that pretty much went against the grain of the NALSA judgment.* Notwithstanding the importance of meaningful consultations by the Centre before passing Bills, what if the "society at large" decides that same-sex marriage goes against the grain of its norms, and thus ought not to be recognized? It is here that one must point out that Democracy requires not just majority rule but recognition of minority rights as well. One of the mechanisms designed for this purpose is the recognition of Fundamental rights under our Constitution, which among other things, mandates equal treatment of those similarly situated. In response to JSD's question as to the "place of conservative voices in the Constitution", the answer would be that those voices find a place insofar as they do not go against the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to all citizens. Any other conclusion would dilute the very purpose of Fundamental Rights. The Special Marriage Act (SMA) is an explicitly secular law, since it is open to those who do not want to get married under applicable personal laws. Thus, it inherently excludes religious and cultural conceptions of marriage (that are by and large embedded in heteronormativity). Marriage, notwithstanding its purported religious origins, is no longer a mere sacrament, rather, it is a status conferred by law that among other things, carries with it additional rights and benefits such as filing taxes jointly, inheriting property, and opening joint bank accounts. Once the SMA is extricated from its alleged social and religious embedding, the question that arises is whether SMA discriminates against heterosexual couples. Now that heterosexual relationships have been decriminalized five years ago by the Supreme Court, the key question that needs to be addressed is whether the artificial classification that SMA creates between heterosexual and same-sex couples is valid. In my opinion, it is not, and thus, there is a good case for the court to provide a stipulated period for the government to make the necessary amendments to the SMA to render it inclusive of same-sex marriages, failing which, the provisions of the Act should be read as inclusive of same-sex marriages.* JSD's statement that the object of marriage is procreation is beyond facile. Firstly, if this were necessarily the case, then impotent persons would be prevented from marrying, and impotent couples would necessarily have the status of the marriages get annulled. Marriages serve other legitimate legal needs such as choosing nominees for insurance policies, joint filing of taxes, and so on, and their purpose is certainly not restricted to that of child-rearing.* JSD's appeal that public morality ought to be dictated by mainstream normative attitudes is a dangerous one to make, since it can render the fundamental rights of minorities vulnerable and amenable to the whims of majoritarian tyranny. Arguably, his argument that the legalization of same-sex marriages under SMA necessitates the participation of all communities obfuscates the secular substance of the statute. While there is a case to be made that legalization of same-sex marriages under personal laws ought to be done only with the consent of the particular community, the same doesn't apply for SMA, simply because SMA was envisaged to cater to the rights of those persons who wanted to marry *outside the personal laws*. For instance, a [Pew survey](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57647931) apparently found that most Indians are opposed to interfaith marriage. However, that is not a valid basis to repeal the SMA and render interfaith marriages illegal. The same logic applies to same-sex marriages.* As an endnote: I feel that a lot of JSD's discourse is problematic since his ideas seem to revolve around appeasing the base prejudices of the population rather than trying to elevate them. His arguments in this video reek of rank majoritarianism which unfortunately has not received sufficient pushback, and even more regrettably, a lot of people seem to uncritically lap up this rhetoric. There are a lot of prejudices deeply rooted in our society, many of which cannot necessarily be surmounted by minorities making their case for their rights to be recognized. To suggest that LGBTQIA+ couples should patiently await the recognition of their rights in the waiting room of history is an egregious suggestion to make; one that is redolent of authoritarianism and must thus be firmly rejected.For the past couple of months, the performance of certain GTK/GTK+ apps such as xournal++ and foliate reader has been marked by slowness in scrolling and lethargic response to commands. For instance, when I try to highlight a line of text on foliate, there is a delay in carrying out the desired operation. Similarly, on xournal++, the scrolling functionality has become extremely slow and delayed so much that I can no longer use the app on my desktop. Any possible solutions to this problem would be appreciated.Would appreciate it if anybody could give me access to a pdf version of *International Economic Law: Text, Cases and Materials by James J. Nedumpara and Leïla Choukroune*. My anxiety has gotten worse. So has my paranoia. My short term memory has fallen to zero. I hear voices at times (I have a family history of schizophrenia) I can ot focus during lectures. I am too exhausted to have ambitions. I fell like if I end this now, I will probably leave a better image in the minds of my friends and go out with a little dignity.i am so paranoid that I cannot trust anyone anymore. My ties with my family are broken. My friends have inadvertently hurt me so much that idek what to feel. I have kept deferring this decision way too long and I have always regretted it. I am tired of it all.Hanging by a thread. The outage which reportedly commenced on 3rd March 2023 continues in India. At this point, I am ditching the app. I was looking forward to returning to using the app after a 2-year hiatus but this level of instability is simply unacceptable.I used to use clickup in 2021 and I was looking forward to resuming using the app for personal project management. However, the app seems to have been "outages" which I never experienced back then. Are these really frequent? If they are, I guess I am better off settling for alternatives.I have been suffering from depression for a while now and my anxiety (which I realized has existed for around 5 years or more) has become worse over the past 2 years. Over the past year, I have become distanced from all my friends. Some of them were very cavalier about my condition which really angered me and I ended up distancing myself from them. Many of them left me on seen when I texted them about my condition and they never got back. When we hang out as a group I don't feel the same anymore. Before I used to be really cheerful and conversational. Now I am just a bystander while the rest of them have a good time. I want to communicate with them, make jokes, and be as lively around them as I used to be but I cannot bring myself to do that despite my best efforts.I feel really sad and extremely dejected. Nothing makes me happy anymore. Last year, when I used to hang around with my best friend, I used to feel really happy for that period most of my problems seemed to temporarily melt away. Not anymore.I would appreciate any advice as to how to come out of this rut. I don't want to carry on living like this. I want to feel happy again. I have enrolled in therapy and I am also on antidepressants. But things still look bleak and I am tired.I am using this app called Twos which by default does not have an option to pin the app to the system tray. I am aware of Kdocker but it requires me to pin the app to the system tray in every new session. Is there anyway to permanently pin an app to the system tray?. I keep imagining myself getting shot, hanging myself, slitting my writsts, or just leaping of the top of a building. This happens during classes, when I am hanging out with my friends, when I am trying to study, or when I am going to sleep. It's gotten so overwhelming that I overcompensate by appearing overtly happy in public. I don't know for how much longer I can keep holding on. I feel utterly alone. I constantly hear a nagging voice saying "I shouldn't be here", "I should have ended it two years ago". I feel like a walking corpse.Asking out of curiosity. Is there a quick and painless way to actually kill oneself? No pain, just a blissful exit. Without much hassle. Are there any ways to mitigate brainfog from anxiety? My cognition really slows down during and immediately after any anxiety episode.Anxiety and depression are the banes of my existence. I want it all to end. At one point I just know that I will lose the resolve to put up a fight and just end myself.My anxiety has intensified over the past 2 years and I am exhausted. Even the most mundane tasks stress me out and give me panic attacks. When I am at my work, every assignment I get leads to a panic attack and I end up crying in a desperate attempt to ventilate my anxiety. I have tried meds and therapy and neither seems to help. I don't know for how much longer I can put up with this.I remember being happy until I just stopped being so. I have been diagnosed with depression in anxiety, I am 23 years old, and I am dealing with immense career-related anxiety and uncertainty about my future. In this state, is it even possible to be happy? What is happiness? Is it being around people who love you? Or is it having the freedom to do what you like/love doing? I genuinely want some answers because I am at a loss here. I have read that seeking happiness as something to be achieved is the wrong way to go about it. Happiness just happens. How do I make it happen?. Well I am an adult but I am still in college. I graduate next year and I am one of the most fragile people around. I used to be extremely strong. I lost my best friend at 11, my mom became a mental patient around the same time, my ties with my parents crumbled and I weathered all of this. But over the past two years, I have lost my willpower and become soft. I cry at any thing and everything. The slightest pressure or stress that I face causes me to well up and this is what I have been facing in my internship. I just feel that life is rejecting me like some bad organ transplant.I am a university student currently in my penultimate year and I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for a while now. I know that after reading the title of my post, I will probably get a lot of messages from very kind people who are kind enough to reach out. The problem is that I wish there were people in my friend circle or family who understood me. Nobody I know really understands depression and anxiety, and this makes it difficult and honestly tiring for me to communicate my problems to people close to me. I know that things will get even bleaker once I graduate because I will slowly lose touch with my existing friends as well. I am so scared of being alone and having to live the rest of my life that way. I just feel lost and extremely lonely.I have been suffering from anxiety for over a year now and sometimes I feel that I have become slower. I also struggle to recall things that are at the very tip of my tongue. Is this a common consequence of anxiety?. Last year at this point my pet had just died, I had suffered from almost 50 complete breakdowns in the span of 2 months, I had just begun suffering from anxiety and my career was going nowhere. Cut to a year later, I am seeking help and I secured a decent internship which has given me a glimmer of hope. Nevertheless, the year was still cruel; I fucked up in my academics, I almost killed myself at one point, and I started hearing voices (which is scary given my family history of schizophrenia). I feel nothing but I am just listlessly trudging forward, though I don't know why.Is it possible to create a custom callout without an icon? Or is possible to render a callout with no icon, similar to how we remove icons for admonitions?. The update progress stops at 68%. I am unable to update 21 apps via discover. I am unable to update these apps even if I use the commands `sudo pckon refresh` and `sudo pkcon update`.I am not sure if this is a common problem right now (akin to what happened a few months back with the github issue). The community plugins page does not load. I am on a Linux OS and I have tried running Obsidian through the Snap, Flatpak, Appimage, and .deb installations but the error nevertheless happens.Wanted to know if anyone else is experiencing this issue. Obsidian was taking an inordinate amount of time to load (around 5 minutes). I turned on restricted mode (which disables all plugins) which led to the app loading in seconds. I later turned off restricted mode, and disabled each of my plugins one by one. The problem was resolved when I disabled dataview.Went to the edge of hostel balcony situated on the 7th floor. I have had suicidal ideations in the past. But I always felt uneasy about it. Today was different. I gazed down and this time, the height and hard pavement at the end of it all seemed welcoming. I could just feel the urge to jump and put and end to it all. My anxiety has reached its zenith, I can't function anymore, I have irretrievably ruined my life. I don't even remember walking back to my room. All I remember looking down while resting on the railing through tears in my eyes wanting to jump and recede into nothingness.My semester ends in less than a week. I plan to put an end to things shortly after going back home.I have been having anxiety for a year now. Unbearable anxiety which has worsened my depression, which I presume I have been having since 11. Until the pandemic hit I was resolute and weathered through everything. My mom has schizophrenia and her condition has worsened over the past 12 years. During this time I became a poor student, lost all social skills, and became an introvert with very few friends. Nevertheless I had some hope. College was a breath of fresh air for me and I was looking forward to rekindling my old fire, now that I was far away from all the troubles at home.The pandemic however threw a wrench into my plans; I fell into depression, my anxiety worsened, and owing to poor network coverage at home I could not attend classes and learn. Post-pandemic I feel lost. I have become severely depressed and it has made me a worse person. I have become prone to outbursts of rage and I stand the risk of alienating most of my friends. Ever since my mom's illness I have had strained relations with my family and my friends are all that I have. Now I stand the risk of losing that as well. I am not an asshole; I love them and I care about them but I can just viscerally feel that I have become a liability. I have tried to be productive. I have put in a great deal of effort but things never worked out. I attended classes regularly, put in effort, but owing to my depression, anxiety, and accompanying migraines, things have inevitably spiralled out of control. I can't cope with this any longer. **I have also started hearing voices since the past 2 weeks.** The trajectory of my mom's illness resembles the stages that I have been through and I am scared. I can't recognise myself, I look at mysI don't know what I have lost in myself. Earlier I used to only experience mild suicidal ideations. Now they have turned into a resolved conviction. I look at my mother and other sphizophrenics in my family and I see people who have lost themselves and everybody who cared for them. I can see myself ending that way and I cannot bear that though.I have drafted parting mails that I want to send to my professors who were kind to me and helped me; the ones I know cared about me. I wish things did not have to come to this but they have. I am tired of living. I have nothing to lose. I want to put an end to my steep fall before I come to be remembered as a dispensable deranged wretch. But I can't keep losing myself anymore. I just feel that I have a deep hole in my existence that nothing can feel. I feel haunted. Therapy has not worked, meds have not worked. Most of the time I feel that there's a lead in my chest weighing me down and making me sick to my stomach. This is no way to live.I want to obtain the total number of tasks and number of completed tasks in a particular file. Is there any dataview query that can be formulated for this purpose?.
    I’m a psychologist and depressed. I feel so bad for my clients. I have to go to work because how else am I supposed to afford life? I have no enthusiasm or energy for therapy and have been a horrible cheerleader. I went into this field to help others not feel the way I’ve felt, but it all seems hopeless.EDIT: Thank you to everyone who posted. I just met with two clients and feel like I really helped both of them. I almost called in sick today but coming in was the best thing for me to do! I think sometimes I have an unrealistic view of my work. Like I’m supposed to say the right thing every moment and magically make suffering go away. But small changes are big eventually.. Living in California, two kids (5 and 7), married 14 years. It is becoming more and more clear our marriage is over and I am worried about finances. I will see a lawyer next week but any advice here would help me sleep better tonight. Husband has always made 2-5x more than me.. We live in an expensive area (Silicon Valley) due to his job. We currently make the same amount because he works for a startup, but future income potential is big. How do I request alimony and child support to take future into account? As a % of income? What % am I entitled to? For how long? Am I only entitled to salary, or what if his start up sells? He put me through graduate school. Will that make a difference? I assume I will have more than 50% custody because my husband does not drive so it would be hard for him to get kids to and from school each day.I have been thinking about divorce for several years but I’m worried it’s just a “me problem” of expecting too much from life. My husband and I met in college and dated for 9 years before marrying in 2019 (so almost 14 years = 23 years total). Our main fights before kids were about him working too much, division of chores and sex Which I think are pretty typical. We generally got along and have very similar values. Since about 1 year after our oldest was born (kids ages 5 & 7) everything feels like a slog. I feel like we are just coworkers in parenting. And even that doesn’t really go smoothly. We haven’t had sex in about 4 years (and rarely for years before that). I find him really negative about everything and it feels like hanging out with the family is a chore to him. I also really hate where we live (Silicon Valley) and we both stopped (him) or dramatically reduced (me) drinking 2 years ago (which was much of our entertainment before, but no severe alcohol issues, like 3-4 drinks on weekends). We’ve tried couples therapy twice and more recently finally getting babysitters once a month for a date night. But when we go out it feels like pulling teeth to connect. It also feels like a chore. My husband is very responsible, allows me to work part time to keep my stress lower, extremely loyal, very generous. We don’t have fights anymore. We just avoid each other and go through life like parenting zombies. We love each other deeply in the way you love a relative or childhood friend. Should I just be grateful for what I have? Has anyone else divorced with no red flags (fights, affairs, alcoholism)? Are you glad or do you regret it?. I started 150xl about a month ago, just upped to 300xl 5 days ago. I have been feeling really jittery and revved up. Can’t concentrate on anything. Also, crashing around 6pm. Anyone experiencing this. Tempted to go back down to 150 but maybe I should stick out 300 for a few more days?. I started 150mg xl about two weeks ago. I notice my muscles have felt really tight and I feel like an old lady when I get up and down from the floor. Anyone else experienced this? Does it go away?. Any recommendations for misophonia friendly guided meditations? I love Andy on headspace but some of the other writers I love have awful smacking noises between words. For example Tara Brach and Kristen Neff. I also like the Yoga with Adrienne meditations.
    Hi,I have a this problem where I keep myself stuck in a situation that is making me depressed. I am so scared of change that even thinking about it is making me physically sick and I start to panic. I want things to change but having to feel these intense emotions is not possible at this moment.Anyone here that felt this way and got out? What did you do? Cbt and medication didn't help.Hello,I have depression, mostly because of the situation that I'm in and because I'm too scared to change something. I hate my job and am trying to find out what would be a better fit, but I couldn't find anything that sounds even tolerable yet. Also I'm too scared to let anyone in my professional life know (because of the stigma).I guess I have a tendency for depression and am mentally 'weak', or that an anxiety disorder is causing/ worsening the illness. Depression is officially diagnosed, nothing else. Sometimes I feel like I am neurodivergent, made several online tests (most of them confirming my suspicion) but I don't trust them. I try to answer truthfully and after the test i feel like i manipulated it somehow.I'm not sure if the depression is causing the symptoms or if i'm depressed because of neurodivergency/ something else. Treatment for depression hasn't helped me yet (4 different medications and talk therapy). I don't know if it's not helping because the situation doesn't change or the method the therapist uses doesn't work for me. It also hasn't helped me being less afraid of change or finding out what I want etc. It only got worse.If anyone sees this and has an idea of what could help I would be so grateful. I can provide more information if needed.Thank you.English is not my first language. Sorry for mistakes.My job makes me depressed. The pressure already is too much for me and I'm actually still a beginner.In my industry it's all about selling as much as possible, I don't enjoy that, quite the opposite. I'm always extremely nervous. I don't have to sell anything myself at the moment, but I will in the near future (I know I hate that because i already have experience).So far no one has noticed how much i struggle with this. I can pretend so well that I even get promoted. This makes my situation worse because the next level comes with my own sales figures. I also get stuck deeper and deeper. If anyone notices how little I want to do this, I'll have to leave the company (or so they say).I could look for something else, but I don't know myself well enough to know where to go. As long as I don't know what I want, I need this job (bills lol).Does anyone feel the same or similar? I have the feeling that everyone around me is completely happy with the job or can at least tolerate it, but it really bothers me and I could cry every day.Half of my twenties have been lost to this illness and no end in sight. I feel like I'm losing the "best" years of my life and the longer this goes on the more hopeless I get. It feels like it's not worth fighting anymore because then I'm not young anymore. I don't know how to describe it. I feel lost.Edit: thank you for the many responses i read every single one. This depression is kicking my a** right now, so I'll respond when I find the energy. Just know that your answers are much appreciated.Hello,I'm struggling with intense anxiety right now, it seems to be getting worse and the littlest things make me anxious to the point of non functioning, sweating, struggling to eat, sleep or talk sometimes. How do you cope? i can't take it anymore.Hallo,wie oft geht ihr zur Therapie? Ich habe meine Termine meistens im Abstand von 2 Wochen, manchmal passt es leider nicht und es sind 3 Wochen dazwischen. Finde das ist leider zu wenig, da dann Sachen passieren, die ich gerne durchsprechen möchte, dann aber so lange warten muss.Was ist bei euch so üblich? Sollte ich das ansprechen? Habe Angst das mir dann gesagt wird das die Kapazitäten nicht da sind und ich mich anders umsehen muss, das ist ja leider eine unmögliche Aufgabe.Danke schonmal fürs lesen!Update: bin bald wieder auf mich gestellt. Die Therapie läuft bald aus und wird nicht verlängert. Wie es dann weiter geht weiß ich leider nicht.Hello,Do any of you have any tips on how I can calm down? I've been having severe problems with my symptoms for 2 weeks and am looking for something that will help. I can't take it anymore.Maybe a tea or something similar?I come from Germany.And please don't use the normal tips like doing sports etc., unfortunately that doesn't help me.Thanks!. Hi, I never posted to reddit before and english is not my first language. Bear with me. I am really struggeling right now. I have been dealing with depression on and off since I was a teen, I am in my late 20's now. This episode already lasted 4.5 years. I tried medication, after trying 4 different kinds my doctor said he cannot help me anymore. I have been in therapy for a year now with no real improvement. I’m too scared to go to a mental hospital because then there is no more hiding my illness, right now im so depressed that I’m considering it nonetheless. I’m trying to use all the typical advice to the best of my abilities. My job makes me miserable, but because I have bills to pay and no idea of what I want to do I’m stuck. I’m scared that if anyone notices that i’ll lose my job (very unlikely but I’m still scared) or of beeing ridiculed. Right now I’m forcing myself to take a course in this industry just so no one at work notices that in reality, i hate this. Avoidance at it‘s best. Unfortunately for me, in this course we have to do things that make me extremely anxious (I did not know we had to do these things beforehand). Additionally, my dog that I had since I was a teen is sick and might not make it. I feel like this will be my last straw, I am barely functioning right now because of this (just enough that no one I’m not close to notices). My family watches him because I have to go to work, but when I’m at home I’m watching him closely and everytime I think something changed my stomach turns. I feel like my family takes this possible deadly (if handled incorrectly) disease lightly and does not watch him as close as he would need. I’m grieving even though he is still here. These last few years have been hit after hit. There were heart surgery, several strokes, Cancer, a rare autoimmune disease that almost led to death and a death in my immediate family. I don’t want to be too specific. I’m so scared that someone finds this and knows it’s me (I’m not scared of people in my personal life finding this, but in my professional life, there is no room for „weakness“). Everytime I try to talk to my family or friends I feel like I’m talking to walls. Most of the time they simply ignore me. I guess it’s because they don’t understand this illness, don’t take it seriously and/or don’t know what to say. I’m at a complete loss right now. The situation with my dog makes my already miserable life unbearable, even worse that i have to go on as if everything is fine. I guess I needed to vent to people with similar stories or feelings just to feel understood for once. Thank you for taking the time.
    I compare myself to a lot of people. I have low self esteem coupled with body dysmorphia, eating disorder, depression, ocd, anxiety and idek what else. I just don’t ever feel good enough. No matter how hard I try I feel as if there is something off about me. I feel like I give off this desperate, negative energy that people catch on to.My roommate is this really beautiful, popular, and happy law student. She’s literally always happy and never complains about anything and never seems anxious or depressed. She has so many friends and attracts a ton of people. She has a great body too and no issues with food. Also has a lot of nice clothing, jewelry, shoes, and more. Meanwhile I am constantly in this fight or flight mode with me biting the skin off my lips until they bleed or chewing my nails off. I never feel “clean” like I always have a grime on me even though I shower and wash my hands constantly. I feel as if my body looks strange. I’ve been dealing with an eating disorder for the past year and a half. I feel so distraught and cynical about the world. I don’t have a lot of friends and am just a very negative person. I know this and I want to change but it’s incredibly difficult. I literally just think I have a horrible energy about me.Laying in bed is about the only thing I enjoy. How can there just be happy people enjoying life with no worries??!! It makes me incredibly resentful.My ed is rooted in my perfectionist tendencies, but it also exacerbates them. I never feel adequate. Never feel like i’m thin enough, never feel like i’m hardworking enough, never feel active enough, never feel like i’m studying enough, never feel like i’m dressed right or look good, don’t have really any friends.I’m in my graduate program (it’s one year but very intense), and I feel overwhelmed and busy all of the time. I feel guilty when I take a break or when I’m not actively doing something. My brothers gf is also doing a similar grad program (we have the same major) and she works at the same company as I do. Her entire internship she was working 60 hours a week while doing school while maintaining a great physique. I on the other hand was working maybe 45 hours in the busy season and didn’t go to the gym. I do pilates at home and walk daily but I have been really slacking recently because of my grad program.I’m barely working 10 hours part time while taking classes and I feel so overwhelmed. I feel like I never have time for anything. Just blow drying my hair is difficult and I always look like a mess. Meanwhile my brothers gf is taking a full set of classes while working 40 hours a week and doing cycle bar and going to the gym. And she always looks so polished and has perfect work outfits. We had a free Olive Garden dinner tonight at the office and I literally ate a large amount of lasagna and breadsticks. Then my brothers gf posted on her story of her in her cute workout set after a cycle sesh. I feel like a fucking lazy slob. I don’t deserve that food. I’m not doing enough to warrant that food. If I actually was productive and had a real fucking work ethic then maybe.I have a boyfriend who I am grateful to have and spend time with, but I really don’t have any close female friends. I’ve struggled with friendships growing up. I usually end up being the outcast of the group. I’m a college graduate and I’ve noticed a lot of my boyfriend’s fraternity brothers and their girlfriends are starting to get married and have bachelor/bachelorette parties. Their girlfriends (fiancés i guess now) are having these big Nashville/New Orleans/Vegas bachelorette parties with a bunch of their friends and it looks like a blast.It’s just hard to know that I don’t really have anybody I could consider a close friend to be a bridesmaid when I get married. I also know I probably won’t be asked to be a bridesmaid either. My boyfriend and I have talked about marriage (we’ve been together 2.5 years) and he wants a wedding with all of his best buddies and fraternity brothers as his groomsmen, but i don’t really have any girls i could have as bridesmaids.I keep pushing for a smaller wedding if we did get married because of the shame that i don’t have many friends. it makes me feel pathetic and that i’ve somehow failed at being a normal socially functioning human. it’s embarrassing not having many friends. I just long for some sort of close female friendship. i already feel inadequate compared to other girls when it comes to looks and lifestyle. but the fact that they have so many friends and i don’t just makes me feel worse. I’m a nice person, I like to joke around, I like to listen to others, I like to dress up and go out sometimes. I don’t know what’s so wrong with me. There has to be something so off putting about me.She eats whatever she wants, doesn’t cook much, and doesn’t really work out, but has a great body (flat stomach with a great pear shape figure). She’s small and dainty and feminine. Her features are small and she has long gorgeous hair. She also owns a lot of nice things and just generally has great fashion taste. She has no qualms or issues with food and always invites me out to eat with her. I will go occasionally but usually politely decline because eating out is extremely stressful for me. She’s also super happy-go-lucky and optimistic and approachable. Men and women like her and she has several friends. She never seems to be worried about anything. I, however, feel like I’ve been in a constant state of stress and anxiety for several years now. I’m constantly worried about food, how my body looks, and my looks in general. I exercise daily and if I don’t get at least 10,000 steps a day I feel like a failure and get anxious about gaining weight. Anytime I eat out or eat a full meal I feel like a pig and feel extreme guilt. I’m isolated and don’t have really any friends. I’m a negative, stressed out, and anxious person. I am visibly underweight but I still feel like a monster because of my height. My clothes are all frumpy on me due to a lot being too big, I bite my nails constantly, and I have dark hair on my arms. I just want to be small and dainty and pretty and feminine and likable. I’m so freaking miserable with myself it’s unbelievable. My thought process is that if I can’t be small and dainty and soft and feminine and curvy then I can at least be thinner than others. It feels like the only thing I have control of.I’ve been on tiktok and I keep getting “what i eat in a day” and “day in my life” from whether it’s health and wellness girlies or ana/disordered girlies, and it sometimes makes me feel bad. Like my diet isn’t clean enough or I’m not exercising enough. I eat pretty healthy, restrict, and exercise but I still never feel like I’m doing enough.These girls are making three grass fed meat and veggie meals a day and having morning homemade lattes and then going to the gym everyday. Not saying it is impossible to be healthy and work full time but where do they find the time?? I’m exhausted after my 8 to 5, I exercise a little and make a small dinner but it’s not as elaborate as they are. They lowkey are condescending about it too, like they are something you should strive to be and you’re not as healthy and fit and beautiful as they are. “I can’t be friends with you if you don’t go to the gym” is one post I saw. Another post was a girl just cooking meals and working out all day and was like “this should be your goal”. Girl I need money I actually have to go to work lol Not really defending obesity and laziness just I think tiktok makes us feel inadequate and that we need to overdo everything to be healthyRant over thanks!. I thought it would make people who were rude to me or disliked me suddenly like me and think of me as worthy. Getting thinner didn’t make me feel more worthy. I still have like zero friends. I just get slightly more attention from men but I still feel absolutely ugly and isolated. I think the root of my problem is that I’m a miserable, narcissistic person who drains any sort of positivity and energy out of others. I think that’s why I have no friends. At least I’m skinny lol. Went out to lunch with my bf’s family in the city and we went and got pizza. I hadn’t eaten all day as I was fasting and this was going to be my OMAD since if I ever go out to eat I will not eat anything else for the day because of cals.My bf’s dad said “everytime i see you, you get smaller and smaller!” in front of everybody at the table. I was so mortified. Like he meant it as a compliment and I’m not upset at him but it was so triggering.It’s just knowing that at one point I was bigger and everybody knew it and could see it. It’s not necessarily the weight loss it’s the fact that I was huge before when the rest of his family has always been thin and tiny is like so embarrassing. That period of weight gain in my life is forever haunting me and I want to forget it. It was a severely unhappy time in my life.Growing up I was unathletic and very timid when it came to team sports. I remember in gym class growing up I was laughed at for how unathletic I was (especially when we had to run the track or do gymnastics). I was a skinny kid but hated participating in sports. My parents never forced me to do any sports and therefore it left me unfit and with no stamina, also with not a lot of interest in health or fitness.I wish I was in a sport like track or cross country that would have boosted my metabolism or made me really fit and introduced healthier lifestyle choices. I feel like Im the flabbiest piece of crap ever. I have a friend who did track growing up and she is so thin and has so much lean muscle she looks incredible and she doesn’t even really workout (just runs).Not only did growing up unathletic and clumsy make me a laughing stock growing up it left me flabby and out of shape. I’m literally underweight too but I still feel fat and flabby. Still feel like the loser kid who was kicked out of gym class games.These girls know exactly what they’re doing. And people in their comments will be like “yeah they’re not bodychecking they’re just existing!!” when the creator is clearly showing off their body in a triggering way. They’re so smug about it and just accuse concerned people of being “chronically online”. I know men struggle with social anxiety and trouble interacting, but they have just a natural advantage over women. Guys are less judgemental and it’s way easier to interact among a group of men because they literally don’t care about superficial shit a lot of the time. They can just vibe.When i meet women I am instantly intimidated. Women are often judge mental and can be stand off ish. I feel like they are looking at me up and down and can sense my anxiety.I love being a woman but I feel like it’s so much more difficult to make connections as a woman because we always seem to be in competition with one another.Edit: jeez a lot of negative comments. i’m not stupid: i know men can be judgmental and not all women are intimidating (i have girl friends who are awesome). in no way am i saying men are better or have it better it’s just something i tend to notice. i just have noticed this when i joined greek life and just my general experiences.I’m the one who fumbles when speaking making everyone laugh at me. I rolled my ankle at the trampoline park in front of my sorority sisters within 10 minutes of being there and everyone just awkwardly stared at me. I’m always the one who looks awful in candid photos and gets laughed at. I’m always looking around me and worried that everyone is laughing at me, judging me, or disgusted by me. I hate being perceived. just got off the toilet from having diarrhea and i have a bad headache. don’t worry i’m drinking water now but damn i guess the black coffee ain’t cuttin it. I want to take the subway to a shoot. I want to come home to my quirky little apartment I share with my equally quirky roommates who are also models. I wanna be able to wear whatever the hell I want or wear designer or be in brandy melville because i’m ✨skinny✨and I look good in everything. I wanna go out at night and meet countless people at events and clubs. I want to eat chinese takeout. I wanna explore what the city has to offer with all of my interesting friends. I wanna make tiktok’s on the sidewalk with my other nyc model girlie friends and just look like fuckin cool Gen Z kids.Bro everytime I see models on tiktok, I long for that lifestyle that is portrayed. i know it’s probably not that great, i just want to live the romanticized version. also no matter how skinny i am i’m too curvy to model lol and not tall enough. Managed to reach my GW recently, yet I still feel huge and not thin enough. I’m borderline underweight. Even my parents mentioned how much weight I’ve lost and have shown some concern. I don’t feel that I look much different? I still feel like I look the same before my ed really set in (if you can really call it an ed, I feel like I’m faking it half the time). It’s an obsession and i’m not satisfied.My friends are mostly all tiny. They eat whatever they want and never seem to think about their weight. I was scrolling through TikTok and saw one of my sorority friends in a bikini. Not an OUNCE of body fat, yet had great boobs and ass with a tiny waist. It’s seriously fucking with my head. I’ve lost a lot of weight and I still feel like a flabby disgusting pig. I tried on a swimsuit after my weight loss and while it was noticeably looser, I still had fat around my stomach and hips. I’m literally so upset right now it feels like it’s all for nothing because I’m still fat! My body dysmorphia is so severe and I just feel worthless.I was raised in a generally loving household and never experienced any significant childhood trauma. But as I grew up I struggled to fit in with my peers and felt constantly isolated. I was bullied by my “friends” and was often told that I was disliked, weird, and ugly. I thought that going to college would change my life and that I would be happier and meet true friends. Turns out none of the girls in my sorority would accept me and I find myself in tears, alone almost every night.My younger brother, on the other hand, has had no problem making friends. He’s had best buddies since elementary school, and now he’s off to college out of state with them and I know he’s going to make new friends. He’s always been popular and liked. He was always so mean to me growing up; calling me weird and ugly and always asking me why I had no friends. I just have never truly had a person who i could call a friend or a supporter growing up. i’m doing better now as i’m meeting people at work but i wish i had a group of close friends who i could always have. i guess i am too weird for people to understand me. I could wear the trendiest and nicest of clothes, but i still feel like I’m not truly a woman. I’m not normal looking. I could wear the exact same outfit as another girl and she would look normal and I would look so unflattering and unnatural. I constantly feel like everyone around me looks like a normal human, and I’m this disfigured creature that is pretending to be human.These people would call me ugly and run away from me. When I would talk they would put me down into silence. I thought that I’d eventually have my glow up. I’d be way better off than these kids. Except these kids are super rich and popular and they just continue to thrive and go to the best schools and have the best things and travel and go to concerts with their friends. Meanwhile I have maybe one person I can ask to hang out and I ended up gaining weight.Whether it’s in person, on tv, or social media, I get super triggered and it makes me want to binge or starve. Every single time I eat I’m hyper-fixated on the calorie count and feel like a disgusting pig after I eat. All food does is make me gain weight, why do I need it to survive?? How do these girls just exist without having to constantly worry about eating and food?. Growing up my mother never seemed to encourage me to practice self-care and beauty habits. She’s the type of lady to never have her nails done, never have makeup on, and dressed very casually. I went to an elementary school with wealthy, cliquey kids. The moms were all dressed impeccably and glamorous. Their kids were dressed well and looked pretty (for elementary schoolers haha), because it was an expectation. I was always sloppily dressed with messy hair, because I didn’t care much. My mom didn’t care either. I was excluded because I never looked as nice as the other kids. Now I’m an adult in college and I always feel inadequate to other girls. They grew up being told to dress and look nice, so now they’ve grown up always having nails, hair, eyelashes, and outfits all nice and done up. I lag behind as I can’t afford these niceties regularly. It’s so frustrating and upsetting not being able to look and feel beautiful because you were never encouraged to value beauty and aesthetics. It’s also frustrating always lagging behind on trends because you can’t afford them over half of the time.Every time I go out with my friends I’m self conscious how I look. Even when we are literally just going to get ice cream, I plan my outfits and look so meticulously just to feel like I’m on their level. They could be in their most sloppy outfit and still look cute and presentable, with nails and eyelashes done and always dressed on trend. I’m ALWAYS off. I don’t understand my identity or personal style because i’ve literally never had a female beauty/style influence to really grow from.Growing up it’s been tough making friends. I grew up shy which turned into social anxiety. It didn’t help that I had trouble reading certain social cues and having strange interests. To this day I’ve noticed I still struggle with learning when to stop talking and shut up. I interrupt unintentionally because I’m too excited to get out the words that are trapped inside my head.I’ve had people tell me to my face that they don’t like me since I was around 10. I’ve had friend groups abandon me, I’ve sat alone at lunch, and I would often do nothing all weekend. I was called ugly and weird. I was ostracized from my middle school friend group. In high school my “friend group” often avoided me and openly expressed their dislike of me. I had girls I’d only talked to a few times call me names and talk crap about me behind my back.I went to college and rushed a sorority. I thought that, hey, fresh start at college, I can maybe try and pretend to be normal and make friends. Nope, fucked that up too. Would talk too much and make jokes nobody understood. I always pushed it too far.It’s my fault that people dislike me. I can’t read social cues, I interrupt, I’m weird, I’m cynical and overly pessimistic. I also am not overly fashionable or have the time/money to be like my sorority sisters. I hate going to events because I am so horrified that everyone is talking badly about me.For some reason, skinny people can wear anything and pull it off. They look dainty, mysterious, and like a model. I used to be so thin but my fat ass can’t control myself so I gained nearly 30 pounds. Now i’m desperately working to be back where I was but it is so difficult.I go to a clothing store and see the cute outfits on the mannequins or see outfit inspo on social media, but i know i’ll never wear it because i’m not skinny and ethereal. What’s the point of dressing cute if the body under the clothes is so disgusting? I feel like some sort of imposter when I try to dress cute. I don’t deserve to look nice.All I’ve done this whole break so far is stay home and house/petsit while my parents take a trip. My “friends” made plans without me, my brother is going to the beach with his friends, and all of my sorority sisters are having fun trips. God I feel so awful. I’m supposed to be living it up in college. I joined a sorority but can’t make a single connection. All all I do is just feel so empty and lonely. I’ve been spending time with my dog and cat which makes me feel better, and I’ve been exercising. I went and got food at a restaurant in my hometown. It’s been okay, manageable. But as I think about it, my life is destined to be this way. Lonely, with not much to do except be in my own thoughts. I have nobody who truly cares about me or asks me how I’m doing.I’m always the person in the group that mainly sits in silence, or can’t get a word in because no one is interested in what I have to say. In one of my classes I sit with an assigned group. Every time I go to class when we work on an assignment the three of them huddle together and work on it and seem to ignore me. It’s kind of comedic because I usually get the assignment done quicker and I usually am the one who is correct on the problems. Today before class started they kept talking about study abroad trips and traveling and none of them even looked at me. I love to travel, and I felt like I should mention something but it didn’t feel worth it. Idk i just feel like this in every social situation. I rushed a sorority to make friends in college and network. Last spring I gained close to 30 pounds due to unhealthy eating habits and more sedentary lifestyle. Prior to this weight gain I was very thin and never worried about my body. I mean I had a ton of issues with my looks but I was thin and that’s what mattered. I went to the beach last summer with my sisters and we took pics. I looked absolutely awful. My face was all fat and deformed and my body was unsightly and pasty pale. My friends were all cute and thin. I cried after seeing myself. Ever since those photos were taken I became extremely insecure about how I looked. They really showcased how bad I look. I now constantly am comparing myself to my sorority sisters and girls I’ve met in greek life. It seems to me like all of these girls are thin and tan and blonde and gorgeous and happy.I’ve lost quite a bit of weight but I still feel so hideous and disgusting. I’m always gonna feel fat and ugly compared to these girls. I just wear baggy clothes all the time and have made excuses to not go out because of how awful I look. Just a rant. don’t join greek life if you have bdd or other body issues lol. I spent a couple of hours getting ready. I showered, did my hair and makeup, and picked an outfit. I recently highlighted my hair and it gave me a slight boost in confidence. Maybe with lighter hair I can finally look more desirable.Then I got a notification I was tagged in a post. It was my friends and I at dinner a couple hours before. I was hesitant to look but when I looked all I saw was this monster. My face is all deformed and bloated. My teeth are huge and make me look ridiculous when I smile. I was discouraged but was planning to go out anyways.But what caused me to shut down completely was seeing one of my friend’s tiktok they made before going out. We were going to a ski lodge party, so they were dressed in really cute ski lodge themed outfits. They looked so thin and cute. I looked at myself in the mirror and I was nearly spilling out of my jeans. My chest is bigger so I felt huge in my top. I have broader shoulders so I just looked so masculine and unattractive. My outfit also wasn’t nearly as cute and I looked ridiculous. As soon as I saw the tiktok I canceled going out.I just didn’t want to be seen looking so sickening next to my perfect bodied, outgoing personality friends.I’m usually a believer in being the bigger person. If I go through a break up, I wish them the best and have no ill will towards them. But the fact that he cheated on me really made me secretly hope that he and his new gf wouldn’t work out. I just didn’t think they were gonna work out anyway because of the circumstances of them getting together (cheating lmao).Maybe I’m crazy, but i’d occasionally stalk her IG page to see what they are up to. I checked today and he’s completely gone from her profile and they’ve unfollowed each other. I wanted to confirm and her FB said she was now single. Sorry I just feel like he got what he deserved!edit: i was not constantly viewing profiles or stalking. my ex is blocked on all social platforms and i hadn’t spoke to him once since our breakup. i would view his new gf’s page every couple of months to see if they had even worked out. more of a curiosity thing. my ex graduated and doesn’t even have a job and i am doing much better in life. i wouldn’t have stayed with him anyways since he doesn’t seem to have much ambition in life. i have moved on and have a partner who treats me well and wouldn’t do such a thing.edit: wow, thanks for the awards!.
    They will tell you that this drugs won't change your personality... What a lie. From a smart, resourceful and highly motivated guy I became stupid, sluggish, tearful pussy who doesn't care about his family and friends at all. Fucking bastards. I think there are only a few more months left for me of this life. That's fucking sad. I had a great life, and it still could have been like that if it's not for the psychiatry. It only took 3,5 months of ADs to took it all away. Everything I had has been taken away. My mind damaged, my body damaged. I'm done at 26. I'm turning 27 in three months and I think these are my last 3 months.Is it possible to reverse it and it's effects? Is there a safe way? Are drugs such as cabergoline or bromocriptine worth it?. Anyone can tell what hormones I can check? I'm 26 male.I have elevated prolactin, testosterone within a range. What else should I check? Estrogen? Progesterone? Something else? Any tips?. I'm trying not to give up. I went to endocrinologist to get hormonal panel, told her I have issues after ssri with libido etc, that my prolactin is high and I asked for full hormonal panel with estrogen, shgb etc. to get some overview and maybe fix this. What she told me? That she will give me enough blood tests, ignored my request and gave only prolactin, testosterone and basic thyroid tests that are all right cause I have checked them already. That was fucking private appointment, not from any insurance, I'm paying money for it, paying for this tests and yes of course I can't even get what I want. I wanted to fucking yell at her, but after I told her about psych meds such agressive behaviour won't do me any good probably. And ofc she told me that my prolactin can't be caused by ssri and all my state is probably due to stressors in life. I'm fucking done. Does anyone have any idea how not to fucking kill yourself? You tell this idiots specifically what's the problem and what do you want to check, so basically you are doing their job for them and pay them for it and still no, even prescribing you fucking blood tests are too complicated for them. I seriously lost all my faith in everything at this point.I have problems after SSRI. I'm trying not to give up.

I seriously lost all my faith in everything at this point.I mean, I kinda got used to my receded hairline and I even like it. It is how it is, nature gave it to me. I will just want to make it a bit more dense - I like the shape, but shedding not so much. But from what I see all people end up having really dense and sometimes even too perfect hairline in my opinion. Is it that all clinics make it like that?I mean, it would be easier to maintain receded hairline in the future than perfect hairline. I don't want any fin or other dht blockers - risking pfs is not worth it in my opinion, so hair will probably keep falling.Edit. And if you know any good clinic in Europe or Turkey I would be greatfull. Hi guys. I was stupid enough to take ssri prescribed by doctor for what was actually just stressful period in life. This drugs destroyed my life. Made me suicidal, caused hairloss and excessive hair growth on the body, gave me tinnitus, made my overall mood and health much worse, destroyed my physical performance, my emotions, my cognition... The list goes on and on. And my libido and sex life as well. I've taken those for 3,5 months, now I'm off for 4 months but I can barely leave my bed, I have such low motivation and basically no drive for any of my previous hobbys. They also gave me prolactin 3 times above upper limit (it was totally fine in march).Can anyone have a knowledge what could have happened? How to fix it? How to reverse the damage? How to get my life back? I would appreciate any tips. I can't get any help from medical system - once you taken psychiatric drugs it turns out you are not normal person anymore and all you have experienced because of their posions are just your "illness" and psychosomatic issues and hypochondria...Are there any supplements/herbs to reduce serotonin?. After ssris fucked me, all I feel is suffering. It's just constant suffering - I don't have any positive emotions, just the negative ones like grief, frustration and sadness and this terrible dpdr experience which makes my anxiety unbearable. Is there anything to make me complete vegetable? Like not feeling anything at all? I don't want to feel this suffering anymore. Psychiatry has won. I'm gonna go and beg them to give me something that will make my brain completely dead and not feel anything at all.But it's impossible. When every other doctor would cause worsening of your health you could at least try to fight for some money. When psychiatrist harm you, there is nothing you can do. They will tell that everything is the result of you worsening mental state or your mental illness and there is no way, no test that will prove the damages. That's fucking sick...I haven't been depressed, I was living my best life. Just mildly anxious and stressed because of work. I went to psychiatrist which was the worst decision of my life. SSRIs destroyed my health, my sexual life, my emotions, my feelings, gave me permanent tinnitus, destroyed my cognition, made me stupid, destroyed my eyesight, my family relations, made me alone with no friends, destroyed my reward system, destroyed my physical health, messed badly with my hormones. I don't want to live like that anymore. I've been trying everything in last couple of months to get better, nothing seems to work.I'm really alone right now, I'm loosing all people that I loved and cared about, cause I can't be a human anymore... Fuck psychiatristsFor those concerned - yes I'm alive but it's not living - it vegetation. I mean, I feel that I gave up. I have no drive to do anything, I don't see a purpose in trying anything anymore. I've been fighting for a few months, trying different things to get better. But nothing seems to work, I just gave up and lie in bed all day barely even doing anything cause what's the purpose. I may or may not feel better, no one has a clue how to help me, I feel no motivation to anything. My body is damaged, I'm ten times more stupid, I became terribly ugly. I mean, I have nothing left that was making me feel good about myself and confident. So how to live like that. I feel like I will leave this world and hope for second chance in different life maybe.Do you think that hell can be worse than this psych drugs damage? I don't think so...I mean, even hormonal panel that was perfectly fine before taking meds, and is fucked up few months later with endocrinologist's opinion that drugs caused it can't convince anyone. Even audiologist's opinion that drugs are the one's that caused my tinnitus can't convince anyone. Even ECG that was fine and after meds is not anymore can't convince anyone (I'm 26, no smoking, no alcohol, very active lifestyle). Is there any test that will be able to convince my family that I'm not mental and hypochondriac? Some brain imaging or anything?. Hi everyone. Unfortunately I've been put on SSRI for work stress and it almost killed me. I'm suffering a lot, my whole body, mind and CNS seems to be damaged cause I can't think, my emotions are dead, my body is weak and damaged in may areas. Do you think that keto can help me in any way? Right now I'm so sick that I'm bedbound...I was so retarded. I had a perfect life, only concern was work related stress... I went to psychiatrist and drugs destroyed me. They made me so retarded, gave me terrible dpdr, massive hairloss, terribly suicidal. They destroyed my mental health and my physical health. I have terrible tinnitus I can't stand, I have terrible weakness in my body, terrible anxiety and panic attacks, deep depression. I feel like I'm stuck in some parallel reality. It feels like a nightmare that I can't wake up from. My body is damaged, I can't run or go to the gym anymore, I don't care about anything or anyone, I just want to die in peace. There is no help, no one knows what this drugs did to my body and mind, no one knows how to fix it, everyone keeps saying it's my mental illness and psychosomatic. I can't work because I'm so stupid right now. I used to be data analyst, musician, sailor. Now I'm just some bedbound looser who can't even take a walk without getting exhausted. Why have I did such thing to myself? I could have just change my job, take a break, go to some therapy. Why the hell have I gone to psychiatrist... One decision that destroyed my life... I'm suffering everyday 24/7, I don't know how long will I be able to fight...I have terrible excercise intolerance, even faster walk leaves me with difficulty to breath and chest pain. I'm sick of living like that. Is there any chance to improve this?. Anyone tried?. I don't know whether it's natural, or supplements helped, but my dpdr is somehow lifted today and in general I feel more like my old self a bit. I'm having acupuncture right now and also cycling NAC, started rhodiola and emoxypine recently. I only hope I won't crash myself.At this point I somehow feel like I'm not sure if I want to recover. I mean it all feels like a bad dream. I also feel like deep down I'm not sure if I want to recover. Cause I know I would never be the same and I'm scared of myself going back to world after all this. I think I somehow feel safe here where I am, in this strange not real experience. Normal world and normal life scares me even more than this suffering. How can someone with this bad experience from pssd and withdrawal go back to real world? Everyday I feel like someday I will wake up from this terrible nightmare and everything will be the same as it was before taking meds... But I know it's not gonna happen.I'm in a group therapy. It's terrible honestly. They are treating us like children. Childish therapeutic classes - we are drawing cats and stuff like that. When you feel bad on therapy you can't even go out to breathe some fresh air and you are forced to talk about feelings that made you feel this way in front of other people you barely know... I mean, I'm an adult person who has been fucked by dangerous drugs and the way you are helping me is treating me like a child in kindergarten, who can't even go out without approval or be dismissed? I mean I can leave, but they will not let me go back, and my family forces me to be there or they will not support me. And I'm unable to live on my own so I have to go there. But how this opression and treating me like a chils is supposed to help me? It makes me even more hopeless...At this point I somehow feel like I'm not sure if I want to recover. I mean it all feels like a bad dream. I also feel like deep down I'm not sure if I want to recover. Cause I know I would never be the same and I'm scared of myself going back to world after all this.

But how this opression and treating me like a chils is supposed to help me? It makes me even more hopeless...I have high prolactin, maybe due to stress, maybe due to ssri I've stupidly taken for 3 months. I want to take some Mucuna pruriens to lower prolactin and hopefully help myself recover emotional blunting and anhedonia that this wonderful drugs gave me. My question is, how to do it safe? Could it be taken daily, for how long, what dosage? I want to lower prolactin cause I think it could be causing me sexual and mental issues, that further leads to huge stress and probably increased prolactin and the circle is closing. I'm really afraid that I have pssd, but since high prolactin can give such problems I want to resolve this and hope that's my only problem.I heard about cabergoline and bromocriptine, but I kinda don't want to touch any artificial drugs after I've stupidly done it once.Any advice?. I mean, I don't care about sexual functioning anymore I think. I just want this inner terror, dpdr, jaw clenching and unbearable anxiety to stop. I'm taking like every supplement under the sun I think just to find a bit of relief.I'm in a group therapy now. There is a girl who suffers so much, because she can't get access to her emotions. She says that she is struggling for such a long time with lack of some positive emotions and can't find out what is blocking her. I think she is just not aware that this is probably due to the meds she is taking. And she is suffering and blaiming herself that she is doing bad on the therapy because she can't find out why she is not allowing herself to feel emotions. That's so cruel, she thinks that there is something wrong with her and everyone reinforce this belief in her - Psychologists, psychiatrists, even other group members. I can't stand it. I don't know whether I should tell her or not - I don't want to because she might decide to come off her meds abruptly or freak out. But I can't just watch her blaiming herself for something that might not be her fault.I feel so sick. I'm stuck in some dpdr experience with long list of terrible symptoms and my family, my girlfriend keeps telling me that it's not connected to ssri or that they are just psychosomatic issues. I know my body, I used to practice yoga and mindfulness so I'm pretty aware in terms of what is normal for my body, what is stress response etc. but they all know everything better. There is no fucking way to convince them how harmful this drugs are. I'm hopeless. I was speaking with psychologist that works with trauma. I told him that SSRIs destroyed my mind and body and I have terrible trauma that is still going on, and she said "impossible, these are such a gentle meds". Ffs. Now I can't even get any psychological support after what happened to me. Now I see why People kill themselves after a this hellish drugs.Anyone has an idea why is that happening? I'm loosing lot of hair from my head but in the same time they start to grow all around my body in places they haven't done before. I mean, they end up in psych ward, are forced on harmful meds that make them suffer even more and destroy their live and health even more. They can't even die in peace and end their suffering.I've stupidly taken ssri for my "anxiety" which now I see was just really stressful period in work. This drugs destroyed me on so many levels. Gave me deep depression, dpdr, anhedonia, ruined my cognition, dry skin, hairloss, destroyed my motivation and libido and gave some other disturbing symptoms in the body including tinnitus. Right now I'm pretty much bedbound with terrible anxiety, PTSD and panic attacks. Are there any supplements that can help me go back to normal? I'm taking right now:- Gingko biloba 240 mg daily- vit b6 p5p 50mg- vit b12 hydroxocobalamin- fish collagen 460mg - l theanine 200 mg before sleep - taurine 3g in the morning - omega 3 1000 mg epa 500 my DHA - vit D 12000 Also going to try emoxypine, rhodiola rosea. Also considering NALT. Any thoughts or suggestions?I just want my old life back 😭😭😭. Ok so maybe I can have an erection, orgasm. But so what if everything feels flat. There is no passion in it, no fast heartbeat when thinking about girls. When I'm watching porn it feels no different than watching some YouTube video. That's sick. I feel like I'm going to start drinking, cause I can't stand this ruminations and mental suffering. I don't know if that is due to PTSD after what drugs did to me or they just fucked my brain, but all day my whole life is running in my head. Anyone know how to stop it?. I really can't see any future for me, even if I could recover. I would be ashamed to meet my old friends. I would not feel comfortable meeting new people cause I feel so bad with my appearance - my face became really ugly (skin, hairloss, even my cheekbones changed, not to mention dark circles around eyes like some panda). I don't know what I would do, cause my mind is too foggy to go on with my data scientist career. That's what leads me towards suicide like everyday. Thank you psychiatry for helping me with my mild anxiety. I won't have any when I'll be dead.Has anyone supplemented collagen? Is it safe? I hope it can help with my skin and joints but don't want to crash.Only thought that provides me some relief and allows me to sleep is the thought of suicide. Thought that I can kill myself and the suffering will finally stop. That's what drug damage did to me. Please God, at least provide some justice to all this. Don't let our tortures get away with murder like that. I hope they will get what they deserve.I'm dreaming about time machine everyday. So I can go back in time and change this one and only thing and not take this terrible pills.After prescribing me ssri for GAD i ended up suicidal in psych ward. I left prescribing doctor negative review online for such risky treatment, and he sued me for hate and slander. Now I not only have psychiatric hospitalisation in my papers but also problems with law. That's how psychiatrists help people. Not only I have terrible physical, cognitive and mental problems that I have never had before, but also I would have a criminal history... Perfect. Has anyone's withdrawal tinnitus eventually went away? Any way to ease it? I can't stand this constant ringing...I'm so tired of this blind searching on my own. I don't know what is going on with me, whether it's really weakness due to depression or actuall shit going on inside me. I don't know whether to go to neurologist, orthopaedist, rheumatologist, ENT, cardiologist or endocrinologist. I'm tired of going to all this doctors, doing all tests they recommend that show something or doesn't show anything. I have issues with all my body basically. I think I'm gonna kill myself. I can't stand this suffering and there is no one to help. No one to guide me. I'm sick of researching forums, going from one doctor to another, my abusive family that forces me to take psychiatric meds because "it's all depression and psychosomatic issues". Why there is no one to help us? No one to guide us? I would like to go to hospital, but when I did I ended up in a psych ward because I was so suicidal because of this. Yes they have done some tests, head CT, basic bloodwork. All fine except the higher prolactin. And something minor in ecg. I don't know whether it's actually psychosomatic or some really bad shit going on inside me. I'm sick and confused. That's why ppl after this drugs commit suicide. Now I understand. I was perfectly fine after stopping my previous ADs treatment (it was trintellix with bupropion). At least I thought so. I was experiencing PE, weakening of the immune system and some cognitive issues. At some point my anxiety started to raise due to stressful period and some depressive thoughts and anhedonia appeared. And at that point I was believing in psychiatry and thought I am having some kind of relapse. So i went to the doc, started ADs again... And I'm done. Destroyed on every field. Only thing I want now is to die. My body is so damaged. So much of little symptoms that are really annoying like dry skin, dry nose and lot of really big ones like akathisia, libido almost none existent, weak erections, anhedonia, blank mind, deep depression, crazy anxiety, tinnitus, vision problems, hairloss, total body weakness. I'm just ruminating all day everyday how great my life was and how stupid I was that I destroyed all this. And it's getting worse and worse everyday. Terrible sleeping problems. I just want to die. My family abuses me, keep forcing me to take meds. I'm trying to explain them what has happened, what's the problem and they keep parroting doctors "you have depression, anxiety and psychosomatic issues". I'm unable to work, unable to take care of myself at all. And they are forcing me to take meds because I'm fully dependent on their financial and housing support. My mom called 911 on me when I had an anger attack when I was trying to explain what's going on and she was talking same bullshit about depression. She even wants to make a family abuser from me and keeps telling whole family that I'm mental and psychopath. So at this point I don't even want to recover, cause I would be the black sheep of the family. Thank you psychiatry. I took sertraline as 15yo. No pssd no major issues. Then took acutane for acne. No issues. Then escitalopram, switched to vortioxetine and bupropion due to covid pandemic, ended was fine still no pssd. And I was retared enough to start sertraline in the beginning of this year, cause I was getting anxious, I was afraid about mystic depression rebound or something and I took it. Now I'm fucked, bedbound, lost everything, my body is destroyed on so many levels. I don't want to live. I haven't known about pssd until I started researching while sertraline made me sick. F*ck me. Has anyone had joint problems and fixed it?. I'm taking Wellbutrin for about a week, but I'm really scared of further damaging my body. Here where I live we have only 150 XL. How to stop? Can I stop cold turkey or should I somehow tapper cutting the pills?. No one to support me in pssd and drug damage. Everyone just keep saying about depression and anxiousness, and denying any possibility of drug damage. Where to fucking seek for help?. I started bupropion cause I'm depressed and barely functioning, but it gives me crazy anxiety and increase my tinnitus. Should I continue or stop? But I don't know what would be the alternative.
    Even on antidepressants, this is how I feel. Last year I ran away on the day before my birthday, I camped alone on the mountains. This time I don't even feel like doing that. Everything is so pointless. I'm so lonely but at the same time I couldn't bear anybody's presence.I have completely lost my way.Ciao r/Italia, vorrei farvi una domanda, così a bruciapelo: cosa fareste nella vita se sentiste di non avere più nulla da perdere?Do un po' di contesto. È da tempo che soffro di una forma depressiva, ultimamente peggiorata per via di fattori esterni, per la quale sono già in cura sia psicologica che farmacologica. Il punto è che al momento nonostante io abbia raggiunto un certo grado di serenità, la questione si è fatta diciamo esistenziale.Cioè, posso anche sentire di stare bene, uscire dal letto, uscire di casa, fare cose e incontrare amici, ma di base mi sembra che tutto sia arrivato al capolinea per me, intendo proprio come risorse e progetto di vita. Lucidamente considero che non abbia senso impegnarsi in qualcosa, che tanto non arriverò mai oltre la sopravvivenza, il tutto in un mondo che sta andando a sfascio e in cui non mi fido più di nessuno.Quindi, se da una parte mi sto impegnando in terapia a vedere se riesco a cambiare punti di vista, dall'altra ho pensato che non è comune trovarsi in una situazione del genere, in cui non me ne frega più niente di niente e in cui appunto, non mi importa di perdere nulla. Sono una potenziale mina vagante. Quindi perché non sfruttare il momento?Voi cosa fareste?. ....it was cancer instead. I only wanted to get rid of that ugly thing on my foot since I've had it for more than five years. At first I thought it was just a corn, but my family doctor said it was a wart, so he referred me to a dermatologist. I had surgery in May. Today me and my dad went to the hospital to collect the results of the histology and we got the shocking news. The grotesque side of the story is that I'm on antidepressants at the moment, and while my dad turned pale and almost fainted I just couldn't stop laughing! I can't fully explain my reaction, maybe after all the shit I've been through in the last 4 years this cancer thing was really way too much to stomach. However the good news is, looks like the cancer has been 100% removed. Miraculously, In all those years it never made to infiltrate the neighboring tissues. &#x200B;The weirdest laugh of my life. I'll just have my check-ups. Peace.Ciao a tutti, ho davvero bisogno di un parere di tutti voi redditors. Cercherò di essere il più sintetico possibile.C'è una persona che da tempo ha preso di mira la mia famiglia e cerca di farci ogni danno immaginabile appena se ne presenta l'occasione. Parliamo di stalking e vandalismo, purtroppo in un condominio piccolissimo senza testimoni in giro. Nel tempo ci siamo tutelati varie volte con esposti e denunce, c'è anche un processo in corso, ma la situazione non migliora, anzi.Visto che questa persona non riesce più a trovare appigli per danneggiarci, ho sentito con le mie orecchie che ha intenzione di simulare dei reati di furto nei nostri confronti. Del tipo che farà sparire delle cose per poi accusarci di avergliele rubate. A questo punto cosa possiamo fare, noi, ora, concretamente, e magari in anticipo? **SE** possiamo fare qualcosa. Non possiamo accettare di dover vivere nell'angoscia dell'attesa di ricevere una denuncia del genere per poi spendere migliaia di euro in avvocati per difenderci. Qualcuno di voi ha avuto esperienze in merito, o ne sa qualcosa di più? Grazie.Buonasera. Sapete tutti della tragedia che è avvenuta e continua a protrarsi a sud della Turchia. Personalmente è un avvenimento che mi addolora nel profondo, sono molto legato al popolo turco e sto pianificando da tempo di trasferirmi là in pianta stabile, oltre a provenire dal cosiddetto "cratere sismico" delle Marche, e dal '97 in poi ne ho viste di tutti i colori in fatto di terremoti.Insomma, stavolta vorrei proprio partire e dare una mano, se possibile. So che la Protezione Civile ha già inviato le prime squadre specializzate, e finora ho trovato possibilità di aiutare sul sito della Caritas, ma solo con contributi economici. Ovviamente per questo periodo iniziale è giusto che soltanto medici e altro personale altamente qualificato possa raggiungere i luoghi terremotati e aiutare la gente, ma appena si muoverà qualche altra associazione/organizzazione che impieghi volontari semplici senza competenze specifiche vorrei riuscire a farne parte...Chi di voi ne sa di più? Chi altri vorrebbero partire a dare materialmente una mano?Grazie mille.I'm sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language.My (36M) 2nd degree uncle (76M) has been diagnosed with terminal cancer a couple of weeks ago. His cancer has already spread through his abdomen and it's crushing his bowels and bladder. Surgery can't be performed. To this day, all we know is he may not be alive by the end of the year.He used to be my hero during my childhood, he lived in the capital city and he run a monthly magazine for teenagers entirely drawn by him. I still have lots of his drawings somewhere in my attic. I was constantly looking forward to receiving his visit during holidays.That's why when I was 17 and I came out as gay to my family, one of the many attempts by my father to "turn me back to normal" was to take me to him. He was supposed to give me a deep talk on how being gay is morally and biologically wrong. My uncle has always been very close to the Vatican and used to work there, and comes from the deeply catholic side of my family.So, taking a trip to Rome as an excuse, my father actually brought me to his studio. My uncle had accepted to talk to me, and that's what he did for about three hours. At that point I had nobody on my side, my parents wouldn't accept me and even tried to contact my friends (by stealing their numbers on my phone while I was asleep) to turn them away from me. Suddenly I was sitting in front of my former hero, who was bitterly commenting about my "choice" and how I was wrong just being myself. In the end I could just cry and told him that maybe being gay was the only thing I knew for certain in my fucked up life and I couldn't understand what he wanted from me. The talk ended there, we went back home and I didn't want to hear about him since.Now, while I reunited with my parents 6 years ago and forgave them for all that mess, I don't know if I'll be able to do the same with him. Even if he's hurting, or sick, or dying. Yet, I'm asking myself if it would be right to reconnect one last time. But I fear I could only scream all my pain and disappointment to him, and I think it would be no use.I'm confused and really don't know what to do.Ciao a tutti, vorrei sottoporvi una situazione scomoda che più di un guasto tecnico sta diventando un problema umano...Ho un furgone Opel Combo 1.4 turbo a metano ( = Doblò Maxi) che ha meno di 10 anni e 90.000km. A gennaio si è accesa la spia del motore e ha iniziato a dare dei sintomi di "carburazione problematica", l'ho portato dal meccanico di famiglia, uno di fiducia, ha trovato che la sonda lambda a valle era bruciata e l'ha sostituita. Problema risolto, speso meno di 200€.Qualche giorno fa, ci risiamo: di nuovo spia accesa e stessi sintomi. Mi innervosisco, provo a leggere gli errori col lettore OBD: ce ne sono due, "Potenziometro valvola a farfalla pista A" e "pista B". Siccome mi sono trasferito in un'altra città ho dovuto cercare un altro meccanico, e qui viene il bello. Tre meccanici diversi mi hanno fatto tre diagnosi diverse con tre preventivi diversi. Ovvero:\- Meccanico 1 della casa madre: c'è una perdita chissà dove nel circuito di raffreddamento che va a cortocircuitare i cablaggi delle sonde lambda, ci vorranno circa 2000€ perché bisognerà cercare sta falla tipo Sherlock Holmes, oppure meglio buttare il furgone. Intanto 90€ di diagnostica.\- Meccanico 2, brava persona, mi è stato consigliato. Diagnostica gratis, secondo lui c'è da sostituire l'intero corpo farfallato, costo: 6-700€.\- Meccanico 3, sempre quello di famiglia, interpellato al telefono: forse è sempre lo stesso problema dell'altra volta, ma ovviamente senza metterci le mani non si sbilancia più di tanto. Ipoteticamente quindi è di nuovo una sonda bruciata e altri 200€.\- BONUS Meccanico 4, quello che mi ha fatto la revisione settimana scorsa. Revisione perfettamente passata, nonostante il minimo instabile e altre amenità. Faccio qualche domanda anche a lui, e mi risponde che: 1-le sonde stanno benissimo visto che i valori in revisione erano perfetti 2-la sonda lambda a valle NON influisce sulla carburazione 3- quel ticchettio che si sente non viene dal corpo farfallato, sono gli iniettori del metano che sono rumorosi ed è normale così 4- la cosa del liquido di raffreddamento che fa corto circuito è una supercazzola totale.&#x200B;Ora io..... che dovrei fare? Voi che fareste?Sto odiando il fatto di essere molto ignorante in materia. Ma di chi mi dovrei fidare? Se dovessi portare il furgone in altre dieci officine come potrei capire chi è che mi sta prendendo per il culo e chi no???Vi prego, fatemi sentire meno scemo di così (nonché sfigato)Grazie!. Been with my ex for 4 years, broke up in March 2020, went no contact in August 2020, been checking his socials until January 2022, strict/absolute no contact since then. Despite this, the pain is still all over the place.&#x200B;So today at work I was given a big box full of gaskets, my job in the next days will be to clean them, one by one, by hand. There's a code on every gasket that for a weird coincidence reminds me about his name every time I look at it.The amount of gaskets in that box equals to 20800 pieces.&#x200B;In the next working days, Mon-Fri 8am-5pm, I'll be thinking about him twenty thousands eight hundreds times.&#x200B;Grotesque.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead\_Masks\_Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_Masks_Case)Have you ever heard about this story? Reading through this I can only find a lot of correlations with the events regarding Ruth Davenport and William Hastings as they were depicted in Twin Peaks S3. It almost looks like they were inspired by this sad and creepy story.The English Wikipedia version of this is quite short, but in other languages way more details are described. Here's a translation of the most interesting parts:&#x200B;>Each of the two corpses wore, still resting on his face, a bizarre lead mask, shaped like a visor to shield the eyes; from the position in which these masks were found, it was evident that they were worn by the victims as glasses at the time of death. > >The scene, as it appeared to the investigators, did not provide any clue as to the causes of the death of the two technicians, nor did the use of the two lead masks appear in some way. No traces of struggle or violence were detected, but on the contrary, everything suggested that the two were lying on the leaves, after which they were peacefully dead, in the exact position in which they were. > >Through the investigations conducted by Commissioner Oscar Nunes of the 2nd Delegacia de Policia of Niterói, a rough chronology of the movements of the victims was reconstructed, both the causes of death and the function of the two masks still remain a mystery today. To make the case even more complicated, the discovery, in the same scene, of some sheets of notepads containing, in addition to lists of electronic components, a series of instructions probably linked to the reasons that led to the death of the two men. These instructions, despite being perfectly intelligible as they are written with clear and orderly handwriting, and in correct Portuguese, are particularly cryptic from the point of view of meaning. > >\[...\] > >Both married, they turned out to be passionate about technology and spiritism; from the statements made by their acquaintances, it was learned that they were affiliated with secret esoteric circles, and that both claimed to be in contact with beings from another planet. In particular Miguel, like many Brazilians, was a staunch follower of spiritism, and his influence was certainly decisive in the conversion to the spiritualist doctrines of Manoel himself. The two were seen participating in all the sessions of the Centro Espìrita Bom Jesus in Campos which were held in the months of June and July 1966. As emerged from the investigation, virtually all tech buffs in the Campos area were also enthusiastic spiritists, and a large proportion of them were affiliated with one - or more than one - of Brazil's many secret spiritistic associations. > >\[...\] > >Apart from the disturbing masks worn by the two corpses (not counting the causes of death, never explained in a satisfactory way), the case was made even more mysterious by the presence, among the objects found on the scene, of some sheets of notepads; in particular on one of them was transcribed what is still a puzzle that challenges any attempt at understanding. > >The first ticket had a list of electronic materials and spare parts (tubes and valves), and an equation concerning the application of Ohm's law; such details do not appear strange, when placed in relation to the profession of electronic technicians who practiced the victims. > >The second sheet showed a sequence of prescriptions, similar to the one that might accompany a medical prescription: > >"Sunday, one tablet after the meal;Monday, one tablet in the morning on an empty stomach;Tuesday one tablet after a meal;Wednesday one tablet before bedtime "(death occurred on Wednesday 17 August) > >Leaving aside the first two manuscripts, which in any case would have deserved more attention than the one dedicated to them, the page that immediately captured the general interest contained the following information, also written in a handwriting that would later turn out to be that of Miguel José Viana: > >"At 16:30 to be in the agreed place.At 6:30 pm swallow the capsule after the effect,protect metals wait for mask signal. ". This famous Latin sentence translates to "he who excuses himself, accuses himself". This means that pre-emptive, unsolicited excuses from someone are usually a sign that something wrong has happened, but they're poorly trying to hide it.I've been thinking about this. It often happened with my exwBPD during our fights. If I was asking him about his actions/reasons for A+B+C, he would justify himself for A+B+C+**D**, where D was something unexpected and unsolicited, and always turned out to be the real underlying reason behind his behavior. It was like a subtle self-sabotage of his own lies.I thought this could be a common behavior for them. Is that so? What are your experiences with this? Please share your stories :). Hello everybody. I really need to hear from you about this topic.Has anybody of you ever felt ashamed for your exWBPD's actions after breakup? I'm talking about all the things I've read so often in this sub, like them starting another (or multiple) new relationships the day after breakup, or flirting/getting together with the wrongest people ever, watching them getting lost in new self-destructive behavior, realizing that their actions imply that it's like you've never existed for them.I went through various phases since breakup (almost 4 months ago), now that's how I'm feeling about it. Ashamed. I feel pity for my ex, but I'm also scared of what people can think about me, especially his friends or our mutual friends. I came to know that the smearing campaign is on, and I can't bear the thought of them seeing me as a hopeless loser who let all those bad things happen. Is it wrong to feel like this? Please, share your stories. Thank you.Hello everybody!I really need to share this moment with you, since this sub is playing such a big role in healing after breakup with my exWPBD.I left him in the first days of March, I couldn't take it anymore. Even if I went Very Low Contact, I got to know he started hooking up random people from the very next day. That was expected, yet it hurt.But my biggest concern was about something else, or SOMEONE else. Before meeting him I dated a guy, five years ago, who later turned out to be a very dangerous sadistic narcissist. I fell so hard for him and I was so naive. He literally broke me into pieces, then discarded me, then started hovering every once in a while just to enjoy my painful reactions. At one point I managed to go NC and started healing. I think he's the person who's hurt me the most since I was born.Then I met my exWPBD and we got together. After a couple of years mr Narc comes back, this time targeting my exWPBD using business as an excuse. I explained everything to my exWPBD and told him to keep a huge distance from mr Narc. Of course mr Narc tried everything to break into our relationship, but my exWPBD kept blocking his attacks. It seemed to work, but...So after another couple of years, we broke up in March. I feared that my exWPBD would be capable to hook up with mr Narc. I just had this gut feeling. And that's exactly what I discovered just two days ago! They only waited for the quarantine to be partially lifted in our country.That was it. I NEEDED to know if the person I've loved for 4 years would be capable to do something like that. I felt disgusted, totally betrayed. His behavior is less than an animal's. No respect, no moral, no care, nothing. I sent him a harsh message and then proceeded to block him (let's say them) on all social networks, phone, email, everything! So **real full lifetime NC** started two days ago, and I'm really feeling better! I'm so happy to feel better! I just want to hug every of you. Together, we can do it!\^\_\_\_\_\_\^. So 5+ years ago I (33m) dated this guy, F (33m), who later revealed himself as a highly sadistic narcissist. I fell for him so bad and I was so naive, but after 9 months he dumped me in a horrible way, and started hurting me on purpose (by hovering at random moments) and enjoying my painful reactions. I had to go strict NC to stop that and get over him. I think he's the person who has hurt me the most since I was born.After some months I met S (27m), who has been my partner for 4 years. Later in our relationship S started to show many BPD related traits. We were constantly fighting, alternating pure love moments with pure hatred ones. I was insulted, disrespected and cheated on in many ways. Some time ago, F got to know I was dating S, so he contacted S through his job's webpage. I was fuming, so I explained everything to S and told him to be very careful of that person. He said ok no problem, and they started to meet for business every once in a while. Of course F soon started to flirt with S. S was blocking his attacks, and would tell me about that everytime it happened. I was proud of S's behavior, even if I was so angry about F coming back to our lives like that.So in the first week of March 2020 me and S broke up. I caught him cheating for the n-th time and I couldn't take it anymore. I moved out and then quarantine started. I went VLC because he started hovering heavily trying to convince me to get back together, but he still had some of my stuff and I owed him some money. But then, I got to know that just few days after our breakup, S started flirting with F. I was shocked, I couldn't even believe it. I had never felt so betrayed before. I went even more VVVVLLLLC and hoped not to know anything further about them, at least until I could get my stuff back and give him the money I owed.But I was wrong. Yesterday they officially hooked up. After a 4 year long relationship, after we broke up barely 2 months ago, S has chosen the one who managed to hurt me so much, who tried to break into our relationship like that, he only waited for the quarantine to be partially lifted in our country. I feel disgusted. This morning I sent him a harsh message and just told him to fuck off forever. I set a date when he will have to leave my stuff somewhere and I'll leave his money there. Then I blocked him EVERYWHERE. He won't be able to contact me through any means as long as I live.So I guess real and irreversible NC is starting from today. I'm already feeling relieved!I apologize for any mistake, English is not my native language. Thanks. Hello everybody,More than 2 months after breakup, I'm still not in control of my emotions. Some days I feel just average, some days I go back deep into pain. It's not my first breakup of my life, I know how it works, but this time it feels different.I can't tell if it's the normal cycle of elaborating a loss, or it's like my brain is so used to experience violent ups and downs in the past 4 years that now it just keeps going that way.Is anybody experiencing this? What do you think about it?. Hello everybody,Music is a powerful thing, and many of us find relief and company into songs that perfectly fit the mood and the events we're going through. What are the songs that are helping you during or after a hopeless (or abusive) relationship?I'd like to propose three songs. Meet Aimee Mann, she's not very well known outside USA but you may have heard her songs if you watched Magnolia the movie. She's a very talented songwriter and often sings about breakup and addiction. Her music supports me so much in these moments.**Phoenix** I don't want to abandon you / But baby I've had my fill / You love me like a dollar bill / You roll me up and trade me in / And if you had the chance you will / And if you get the chance again / It's hard to know when to cut and run / You balance heartache with your fun / And when the scales tip you know you're done / 'Cause I know love doesn't change anything at all / I know love doesn't change a thing [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vn39ZLU9B4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vn39ZLU9B4) **It's not** So here I'm sitting in my car at the same old stop light / I keep waiting for a change, but I don't know what / So red turns into green, turning into yellow / But I'm just frozen here on the same old spot / And all I have to do is press the pedal / But I'm not.

Hello everybody, this is my first post ever on Reddit! I wish I'd found this sub earlier, really...Also, English is not my primary language, so please bear with me.Five years ago I had a super toxic relationship with a guy, F. , that in the end revealed himself as a highly sadistic narcissist. Suffered like hell, and I think he's the one that hurt me the most in my whole life, but in some way I managed to end it "clean", establishing a full no-contact with him. Some months later, I met my loved S. My now ex S. He was like a glowing ball of energy. His mind, his heart, his humor, his interests, his smile, his eyes, his smell, handsome and sexy as hell. I did very little to build up the relationship as I was still somewhat recovering from the previous one, and felt a bit suspicious. But he wanted me so badly, that succeeded to win all my doubts.It was June 2016. In August we decided to take a camping trip of two weeks in the south of Italy. Everything had been perfect since the beginning, until... that very first thing happened. We were traveling and meeting people, and suddenly he got furious with me because I tend to be introverted with people I don't know, and that TOTALLY SUCKED, and he HATED that part of me. I couldn't believe my ears, and I decided to pack my things and go back home, alone and shocked. He immediately tried to excuse himself and to make things up, explaining that he can get a little harsh sometimes but he doesn't mean it, and that things that suck aren't necessarily so bad. He said it's like a poorly cooked food: it sucks, but he still can eat it and enjoy it.I don't know why, but I ended up staying. I couldn't imagine that one event was going to be just one of the many.Some months later we were already living together. I developed a severe depression, for personal/family/job reasons. I almost got suicidal and I started a therapy. For two months I couldn't even go out from our bed or our room. He kept saying that seeing me depressed absolutely sucked, that I looked like a dead worm. Didn't listen to him, I already had my own problems. Finally I started taking antidepressants, everything got back to normal, and I could happily go on with my therapy.Until I caught him using dating apps for the first time. I was furious, but he got even more furious saying that it was my fault if he was looking for someone else. Because of my antidepressants' side effects, which included low sex drive and erectile dysfunction, he said that having sex with me felt like fucking a Barbie doll. Literally.Arguments started to intensify in time and strength. In October I traveled to Turkey for my birthday to meet my friends. After a week abroad I came back, he wanted to talk. He had thought about it and he didn't love me anymore. I was destroyed. We split the beds and I told him to start looking for another house. 24 hours later he was already having sex in gay saunas or with random people hooked up on dating apps. I immediately kicked him out.Two months later he tried everything to come back with me, and I was stupid enough to allow it.I set my conditions: he needed to take a new STD blood test, and needed to start a therapy to learn how to manage his destructiveness. He agreed and he moved back in. He did had his blood tested, but of course no therapy was done, because I'M the crazy one, not him.In the last two years many things happened. Do you remember F.? They eventually met, because of S's job. F started trying to flirt with him, but at least S was blocking his attacks.During last summer we took a 1.5 months road trip from Italy to Turkey. On the fifth day of travel we had an argument because he didn't want to follow the route we had previously planned together, he just wanted to go to the seaside and not stop through all the "gray boring and stupid" capital cities. I told him he couldn't say those things about places he never visited, so he bursted, got up and left. Couldn't find him for hours, he came back to sleep at 4am, heavily drunk. Of course the rest of the trip was a torture. Months later I discovered that on that night he hooked up someone at a party and spent the night with him.We were planning to move abroad together, so we decided to leave our expensive house in the capital city to be back at our hometowns and save money for our project. From the first day after moving back he started using dating apps again. At that point I was feeling miserable and suspicious, so I broke into all of his online accounts to understand what was going on. That's how I discovered everything I know now, including all the times he got interested in gay cruising places and also visited them. I left him on 2nd of March 2020, this time for good. He couldn't accept it. He tried to fill me with lies but this time it didn't work. So, on 3rd of March he was already having sex in saunas, again. And, HE STARTED DATING F.I'm totally destroyed. I feel broken and dirty. On 11th of March the entire country was locked down for the quarantine, this means that I've been alone for the whole grieving process, couldn't even reach a single friend if just online.So, it's been almost 2 months of strict no-contact, even if he tried sometimes to send me messages using with poor excuses. I just told him to stop that.Writing this message made me think how all this story had really no meaning. I told you about the major events that happened between us, the remaining time was split between 50% total love and 50% hate. I've been so blind and stupid all the time. And yes, I think I'm co-dependent. Still grieving, and I can't even get my job done since two months. I'm only waiting for the quarantine to be partially lifted, so I'll be able to go for walks in the woods, at least. Thank you for your time, this was a really long post.Leo.
    Seriously, it's just so...dull, I want to die, but dying has to wait because I need to commute to school, or work, or the store. I'm EXTREMELY depressed, but I still have motivation to get out of my bed for my dog, I rarely eat, but if my stomach is screaming at me might as well make a sandwich. It's just so maddening, I see no way out of this torment. Sometimes I wake up and I realize: this is ALL life will ever fucking be, boring, dull, I haven't felt a singe of happiness in decades, I just want to die already. But I can't die because I have a dentist appointment tomorrow and my corpse can't afford the 200 fee for missing it. When will it end?. Nothing specific, just noticed that most minimalistic images I see online are always white, but I was wondering if black minimalism was a thing.FYI, I'm kind of a goth, I don't MIND the color white, but I definitely prefer black. Thoughts?. Hi, I was just wondering if anyone else empathizes.I consider myself a minimalist, but mostly because I find that owning too many things, or having a room with more than usual amount of objects in it stresses me out beyond relief, and the only relief is owning the bare minimum for things.I don't really know why I'm this way, but still I love the whole aesthetic to it all anyway, plus owning things is stressful too. I even consider getting rid of my phone and getting a flip phone because smartphone's are stressful, too...
    basically it means only people with perfect mental health and no confidence issues due to trauma are worthy of love or appreciation. what a f’d up thing to say to anyone who is already isolated and insecure and feels not good enough.not only do they make me anxious and insecure but our lives are completely opposite. they have fun things they do and friends and successful careers. and they actually enjoy being alive. i cannot relate to any of that. i’ve pretty much only had toxic relationships/friendships where i am abused and/or abandoned and have been socially rejected and ridiculed since i was a kid. add on chronic isolation from birth and i’ve gotten so incredibly anxious and afraid to interact with anyone or just go outside to events. perpetual exposure to social media due to loneliness has exacerbated this and i genuinely believe all humans are evil and cruel beings. i’m constantly waiting for someone to hurt me at all times. my past trauma and inability to form any healthy bonds makes this feel more like a fact than a maladaptive belief. i have an emotionally immature and mentally ill immigrant father who is sometimes emotionally abusive to my mother and i. his irrational behavior came from a serious injury and severe trauma so i try not to blame him but it’s hard not to bc of the cptsd i got from witnessing things. one second he is nasty and rageful and the next (especially in public or to other people) he is jovial and overly nice. i think this is where my disorganized attachment style stems from. he is emotionally unavailable and worked abroad for 90% of my life. the few times he is home he locks himself in his office n rarely ever comes out to interact with anyone. we are poor so i know he has had to work extremely hard which i am grateful for but he also rarely calls or texts me when he’s away. i feel like i barely had a dad especially growing up. i was extremely isolated and controlled as a kid and am still dealing with severe mental health issues due to my upbringinghe’s now terminally ill and still working abroad. i feel guilt about our lack of relationship and communication, but im accepting that it is/was his responsibility to initiate reaching out and staying in contact in order to form some type of bond. he calls his siblings who live abroad all the time so why not me. a lot of my feelings of abandonment and feeling unwanted by everyone stems from this. i feel like i should try more bc of his illness n bc time is running out but all of our conversations r extremely surface level and short and make me upset wishing things were different. i cry a lot thinking he will pass and i would’ve only been around him for like 5% or less of my life. no one talks about how sad and emotionally confusing it is having a dad who supports u but is chronically physically and emotionally absent. i wouldn’t wish being a first generation immigrant on my worst enemy tbh. i also have a lot of trauma mostly from bullying n lifelong isolation and social anxiety caused by being ugly. every time i see my face or think about how disgusting i look i want to keep drinking myself to death. the only way i can interact with other ppl without constantly being anxious about my appearance is when i’m on something. it’s pathetic but my ugliness is probably going to be the reason i end my life. i am also anemic which is a big contributor but chewing on non food items like rubber bands brought me sm comfort even in public. i see sm ppl posting about feeling sad n nostalgic about their fun childhood or teenage years n feeling like their life went downhill. meanwhile i’ve been alone isolated and depressed since I was a child and still am. so at least i don’t ever feel like i’m missing the past bc my entire life has been sh!t. i hate the narrative forced down my throat of “they everything sacrificed for you! u owe them a retirement! they abused u bc they didn’t know any better!!” like ok? then they shouldn’t have had kids?? there’s no point in having kids somewhere with more “opportunities” if you raise them in such a traumatic household that they’re too f*cked up to take any of them. no one asked them to bring children into a tumultuous life then guilt trip them forever. im just losing any care, they should have know at their big age to not have kids u can’t afford to financially or emotionally support, or at the very least, don’t abuse n neglect them. i’ve been pretty much abused or tossed aside like trash/abandoned by every human i’ve ever tried to bond with. i have no friends this has made me see everyone in a negative critical way and to never believe that anyone (even my partner) isn’t using me and/or planning to leave me. has anyone experienced this or been able to heal their abandonment trauma?. because of lack of experience in one aspect of the job.. the fact that they couldn’t realize that from my initial resume and made me do all that is ridiculous. i’m taking a pre job excel assessment for an hr analyst role soon. it’s on isograd . com. the job description says expert in excel. anyone have any experience with isograd excel tests and what was on it? or, have a list of things i should definitely brush up on for the role?. any tips resources or materials that you guys think would help me pass it would be very much appreciated 😭. i hate how so many ppl complain abt it online just for sympathy or attention from their friends. some of us are actually totally isolated and not just seeking attention. i’ve heard that skin discoloration is a side effect of prozac. it was for me. the top half of my forehead turned a significantly darker shade than the rest of my face and made me even more insecure n depressed. i have brown skin for reference. i’m almost certain it was the med. i stopped and it has only kind of faded almost a year later. has anyone else had something similar happen?. i saw that the resources recommended from the org are expensive and not too helpful. would be super grateful if anyone who took the exam could share how they prepared🙏🏾. i read that ppl with SA have higher suicide rates than most other mental disorders. i am really struggling so much and see no hope for me. does anyone else get these? it’s almost non stop. and i wake up feeling awful. i wish i didn’t have any people in my dreams because i don’t have any in my life anymore and it just reminds me. nice to know i can’t even escape social anxiety when i’m asleep. or maybe that’s just me. pity compliments make my skin crawl like i’m really down so bad that people feel the need to lie to try and make me feel better. self explanatory. i’m in my early 20s and realized it’ll almost be 10 years since i was diagnosed. the times of my life supposed to filled with fun memories have been nothing but pain. i don’t intend on living another decade like this. she was the only thing making me feel guilt or sadness at the thought but now knowing she won’t care i think i’m ready :). honestly think surgery might be my only option to ever not wanting to die constantly. i don’t want to live in this body. it rlly sucks knowing that even if i did somehow meet someone who’s interested in getting to know me, my mental illnesses will inevitably push them away just like everyone else :’(. i trap myself in my room as much as possible to stop constant reminders of how much of a failure and fuck up i am. it makes it worse but once ur at this level there’s no point anymore. pretty sick and twisted how telling/indirectly showing some people that u have no friends makes them deem u as not worth getting to know. seems like how many people ur close to = ur worth as a human. it’s just a vicious cycle that makes me want to isolate myself more. i feel like i’m the only person in the world who doesn’t have 3rd person pics of them out and about. only selfies (mostly filtered because of dysmorphia and self hate) it really embarrasses me but i’m also in awe of normal peoples ability to have both people who are happy to photograph them repeatedly until they get a nice shot and don’t feel like they’re gonna die of shame when a camera is pointed at them. i’m so jealous of ppl who grew up around an abundance of grandparents, uncles/aunts, cousins, and extended family. i’ve never had a big family gathering in my life. i’ve never even spoke to most of my family because of a language barrier and distance (they all speak the language and are pretty close with each other excluding me) especially around christmas time the emptiness feels unbearable. i don’t think my existence ever crosses the minds of the majority of my family. to top it off, growing up without that social support gave me severe anxiety/depression and has ruined my ability to interact/connect with people. i’ve always heard family is a stronger bond than friendships. i wish i could experience either.other than hermits and anti social people? i can’t see a reason in living without having others to make it more bearable. i imagine it’s easier to be alone when you aren’t constantly dealing with self-loathing like i am. i don’t even like myself so i kinda understand why others don’t. idk when it’ll be but what’s the point of participating in this fucked up game when u plan to game over urself anyway. if i didn’t had so much anxiety of failure and being perceived as one, i don’t think i’d ever leave my bed. like god…i’m so ugly. jealous of guys who can strike up a friendship with another guy just bc they like the same sports or video games. a lot of women need to make sure their friends are beneficial to their image/not pretty enough to be threatening to them. then, they have to be matching at all times to look good for the gram. can’t forget making a separate group chat without the friend they like least (usually me). girl friend groups seem to operate in a hive mind and i hate it. and it’s not like i can have a group of guy friends bc the overwhelming majority of men can only tolerate being around a women when they’re actively trying to sleep with them. if someone is physically paralyzed they get sympathy and understanding. people understand why they can’t just go out and live life like everyone else. it’s visually obvious that they’re different. but if ur socially paralyzed you’re a labeled a loser, a bitch, full of yourself, stuck up, and a weirdo. you’re told to “just join a club and out yourself out there!!” you’re denied opportunities and jobs because you’re nervous ur viewed as weaker and less valuable than extroverts. there is no understanding for us. well that’s it. i’m officially leaving the stage of life where meeting new people was somewhat encouraged and a small percentage of people were still open to making friends with people that they didn’t know since infancy. i feel like i signed my death certificate. i go to a very prestigious school and being surrounded by people who r way richer, prettier, smarter, and friendlier than me every day has made my crippling insecurities worse. i never left my room to interact with another student once this entire semester. it was just class and room everyday. i wasted all chances to “network” with the privileged kids. however i was completely expecting this. college life is one big clique and ppl decide quickly whether ur in or out. i swear people could smell the anxiety and self doubt from me a mile away. i never had a chance. i knew i would never fit in but looking back at the downward spiral of my mental health and self esteem over the past 4 years still hurts. i’ve heard that it gets even harder to make friends in ur mid 20s/at work so i’ve conceded that i’ll be alone for the rest of my life (until i end it, that is). that’s been basically the story of my whole life. that is when i haven’t been dropped like a piece of garbage. i’m so jealous of people who have so many connection and aren’t alone when their (1) acquaintance is busy. honestly i think being completely alone is better than feeling like this much of a burden. literally no one has ever wanted to be around me. so i know i’m only useful for sex. romantic relationships can’t fill that empty hole of having a friend u can tell anything to without fear of judgement or getting dumped. why does my own mind keep hurting me. everyone’s obsessed with shoving it down ur throat but i’ve yet to see a genuine friendship in years. it’s all about people hanging around who makes them look good or is beneficial to them at the moment, but they’ll backstab/drop them in a heartbeat. i’m tired of the theatrics. he has a white belly but the fur/skin surrounding one nipple is pink colored, which i am a guessing is due to inflammation? the actual nipple has a red spot on it and feels almost crusty. should i go to the vet? what could this be?. i can’t describe how disgusted and depressed i am when i’m reminded of it or even worse someone mentions it. surgery is intense but maybe it’s worth it to not hate my face for the rest of my life. when it came to socializing me. i try not to blame myself for being so awkward n unlikeable bc its not my fault i was isolated during a crucial time of my mental/social development. it’s called social skills bc u get better as u practice, and i was actively discouraged from doing so. i’m so jealous of people who were put in so many clubs and camps and teams as a kid and learned how to interact with their peers and met lifelong friends. it’s too late for me. sometimes i feel like i’m suffocating or the whole world is abt to crash down on me, esp when i think the sad future i’ll have.
    Why do I have to work so hard to just feel okay? Why do so many people walk around without a fucking worry in the word but I have to make it a full time career trying to just get to a state that's considered "okay"? It's fucked and I'm just worn out. I've been really depressed and I've been letting myself go, I've been doing nothing more before work than a spot shave and quick rinse under the arm pits when they got stinky. I've finally wore and rewore and rewore all the same clothes until all the clothes left were noticeably dirty or smelly. I woke up early this morning and I had a small burst of motivation for the first time in months and decided to do a load of laundry and take a shower this morning, I want to keep the momentum going but it already feels like it's fading away. I think subconsciously it was more to prevent people from noticing me more than me just wanting to be clean, i don't know....I wish I was able to be there for people, but I'm far from a good place myself so it feels hypocritical. I'm sure I'm not the only person out there with this problem, so just know that there are people out there who empathise but have just as much trouble reaching out to help as they do reaching out for help.I'm almost 40 years old and I have done so little with my time on this earth, I'm pretty convinced based on research I have done that I have aspergers (now it's referred to under the blanket term Autism Spectrum Disorder), I've been depressed the vast majority of my life, 2 failed suicide attempts about 15 years apart, had terrible anxiety causing me to be too scared to the simplest things like make doctors appointments to where I have to be pushed and pushed to do so or have someone else make the appointments. I've pretty much been scared to do so much throughout my life and have nothing to show for my time on this earth. So few people care I even exist.I've tried different types of therepy including CBT and various medications but I am always miserable. I'm getting to the point to where I am completely convinced it can not and will not ever get better. When I made my suicide attempts before they were a fight or flight response to escape my racing mind at times of extreme anxiety and panic, but now I want to plan my escape from life because I don't want to get better anymore, I just want to stop being. I have no immediate plans on doing anything to myself, but I've come to the conclusion that it's my only option and is the correct decision. There isn't a path forward for me.It just seems like the point of life is to pursue happiness or whatever. Why? It's such a struggle to reach a baseline level of being content that achieving happiness just seems too far away and not worth the effort. Whenever I ask anyone they typically find some way of squirming out of a direct answer because nobody seems to have one. So, for some people happiness is just unachievable, so what's the point?. It seems like any help with depression only focuses on the treatment of symptoms and moving forward. Is it normal to be frustrated that it's not often focused on what the cause of the problem is? It just feels like you're being trained to how to react to things rather than figuring out why you react in certain ways.....I've had pretty heavy depression for many years, I'm so worn out putting in so much effort just to get to a state that most normal people are at by default. All interest in getting better anymore is lost because it's just so exhausting and everything seems pointless anyway. What's the point in getting therapy if I don't want to be in a relationship, I don't want any friends, I can't stand interacting with anyone anymore, I don't want a purpose and I simply don't care about living anymore. I wish euthanasia was an option for untreatable depression because the point of life is just finding ways to pass time until you die......I don't want to achieve anything, I don't have or want goals, I don't want to interact with people anymore, I just want to not exist anymore. I don't want help, I have no interest in getting better for a pointless life.I feel like a shell of a person just going through the motions. I can't handle a social life lately because of anxiety so I keep to myself, but I'm also painfully lonely so I'm stuck in a holding pattern and I just want it to stop, I want it to be over. I really don't have anything to look forward to. Please let me stop existing, my essence died years ago.One thing I use to keep myself from doing anything is my cat..... not knowing what would happen to him.....Tonight I asked my ex-wife if she would take care of him if anything happened to me, I feel like my subconscious is trying to ease that thought.The moment I had the epiphany that I'm on the spectrum, a lot of the 'why does this affect me this way?!? Why do I react this way?!?' Questions were answered and for a moment I felt like Neo in the first Matrix movie when he started to see the code in everything. The only difference is I can't make it do what it want the way he does :-(. I'm sick of going to doctors who don't really give a fuck that just try a different prescription whenever the one they wrote last time doesn't fucking work. I'm sick of this fucking cat and mouse game with happiness, I'm going to feel like she had at least I'm going to do it without a bunch of chemicals making me feel loopy at the same time. .... I can handle myself in public better now. But I'm still miserable, still unable to enjoy anything anymore. I have trouble making it through a movie without completely losing interest watching anything, I can't even make it through an episode of a TV show. I Can't make it through a level in a video game before wanting to turn it off due to complete loss of interest. I can't finish ANYTHING. This is frustrating.....I'm done trying to look forward to being happy one day, but I can't do it..... fuck I hate this. I've suffered with deep depression since childhood and honestly feel I've stuck it out this long just to not upset the few people who've been in my life to some capacity up until this point. I'm definitely not sticking around because I want to be here and all but given up on trying to identify why I'm sad and have just accepted that this is how I am built. Living your life shouldn't feel like you're trying to drive 40 miles in the wrong direction during gridlock traffic but here I am. After countless therapists and medications, I'm no better off than the start. Going to an inpatient facility is useless because our Healthcare system in the US is a joke so they take a 1 size fits all approach that doesn't help at all. I JUST WANT TO NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT DYING.What do you do when you have no hope, no desire, no goals, nothing to look forward to? What do you do if you've lost interest in all of those things?I can learn how to handle myself and my emotions in a specific situation, but that's only good for the here and now, I don't really see anything for me in my future and feel like I'm just killing time until my life ends.....That moment when you realize that you aren't living the story of the main character, but the one of an inconsequential character early in the story and your part has long been finished leaving you in the world to exist directionless with no reason to exist any longer, you just want the story to end but it has no end in sight.I really wish I didn't care about making anyone sad by dying. I've decided that my current job is my last job. I will do what it takes to get by, but if I lose it or choose to quit, I'm done with everything. I stay working simply to make my existence tolerable by affording food and utilities until I actually end it.... I nearly quit today because I've been over worked and under appreciated and am very close to ending it. I'm tired, very tired, mentally, physically any other way a person can be. I just want to lay down and sleep for the last time. I've been secretly hoping that I'll get fired so that I'll have an excuse to be upset enough to kill myself, I've been doing just enough to get by but not intentionally doing bad at my job..... I don't have any Hope's or dreams for the future nor do I want them or care that I don't, I'm just done with it all. I don't want to be around people, I'm annoyed that I have to wake up every morning, I don't want to deal with anything anymore, I just want to stop.......I feel at this point every day for me boils down to struggling to convince myself that I should tolerate having to exist regardless of how miserable I am. I try to smile and act like nothing is wrong but I continue to rot inside and it's increasingly more difficult to keep the performance up. I'm slowly forgetting how to be a person and am just hollow inside. I try to fill the void with useless shit as a distraction but it's effectiveness is starting to have diminishing returns. I'm told I should want to get better for myself and no one / noththing else but the concept of "me" doesn't even make sense anymore. I'm nobody and don't want to carry on.....If everyone is so hands off, uninterested, uninvolved, unconcerned about you or any part of your existence until there is an existential crisis, do they even care in the first place? When you're not even a background thought in anyone's mind, to where if you were to vanish without notice, there would be absolutely no impact. If no one cares until they are made aware you're almost gone, even at that point it's not about you it's general human concern and about their conscience of 'doing nothing' and general concern for life but not that it's YOUR life. What's the point? Why fucking bother?. Not ironically, not hyperbole, I regularly genuinely in most situations think to myself "What's the worst that could happen? If it goes too bad you can always end it and it won't be a problem anymore" I often have anxiety about what could go wrong in most situations and the depressed part of me touches on the sentiment I just mentioned quite often in a way to put the anxiety to ease.... Does this make sense to anyone?. It's not a life or death problem, but it is something super grating on my nerves....... The head of HR is frequently on the department close to mine at my office and they speak very loudly and has the most obnoxious laugh that can literally be heard throughout the entire floor (I could even hear it in a closed room, down a hall and around the corner from where they were) Any standard staff member would have probably been reported for being so obnoxious, but I'm assuming since this is the head of HR that everyone is scared to say something. It's kinda getting on my last nerve so I have to say something to someone..... I've considered an anonymous report to the CEO, but I feel like that would get brushed off and I wouldn't really be able to follow it up. I also don't want to complain to the CEO directly and have them tell the HR person I complained and have them be sour towards me (I know retaliation is against the rules, but there are some spiteful people at my company)Any thoughts?. I wish I could exchange my health with someone with a grim prognosis who actually wants to stick around. That way my existence could at least serve a purpose....Seriously, what's the fucking point? I just want to be gone, I don't want to exist anymore. I have such a little impact on anyone's life that if I just disappeared that most wouldn't even notice. Sure some will be sad, but not much if any more than general human empathy for loss. Some say ending it is selfish, but isn't it selfish wanting someone who's suffering to continue doing so just so they themselves won't be sad?Why keep going on, though? Other than making a very small handful of people sad, there really isn't anything keeping me here. Honestly I feel their concern is holding me hostage....I don't care about my future, I just want to be gone......
    Longest onboarding process of my LIFE. During the onboarding process I’m starting to see a lot of red flags (namely that the hospital is closing before the end of my contract and no one told me! I googled it!). I’m hoping some of you guys can share what it’s like to work there. I’ll be in the ED but anything would be great! Just want to make sure I’m not getting myself into a mess.Edit: it is definitely a dumpster fire but the pay is so good. Songs that sound like:Antichrist - the 1975Innerbloom - Rufus Du SolBreathe (in the air) - Pink Floyd. Absolutely horrible, I’m sick to my stomach. Even when I have good periods I know I’m going to be like this forever, I’m fucking sick. Whatever I did in a past life must have been terrible because I’m paying for it now. I knew I was going to get queer-baited but not this badly. I’m going with the book ending mentally. Made no sense, so many plot holes just to end so tragically.I started crocheting about a month ago and I think I’m ready to do slightly more intermediate projects with yarn that isn’t $3/skein. The problem I’m running into is that doing the same stitch over and over gets pretty boring — I’ve completely ended a few projects because I get so bored of doing 70+ rows of 56 slip stitch hdcs with no other stitches like in beanies and baby blankets. I’ve been considering the classic granny squares blanket but am wondering if anyone out there has cool recommendations to start becoming more skilled!. I think I took on a project that I’m not skilled enough to do yet but I made it all the way to the very end!!!! So frustrating. For now I have a stitch marker in it and am just going to start something new in the meantime. As a beginner, did you give up on any pieces or just push through?Worst part — the project is socks. Even if I figure it out once I have to do it all over again on the second sock!!!!!. I’m actually fine. I have a decent routine, I don’t spend my days wishing I was dead like I used to. But the hardest part of the day everyday is waking up. If I died in my sleep I’d be so fucking fine with it. I’m not actively seeking life ending measures anymore (thank god because I was SO down bad but it’s only a matter of time before it happens again!! Anyways) but I’d still be fine to die. It’s fine. I don’t care. Watch out world 😎. I don’t mean some of what I’m about to say, even though there is also much truth to it. It just seems as though this is my brain’s way of expelling negative and overwhelming thoughts and feelings. I want to kill myself. I know my death will likely be by my own hand and I’ve come to terms with that. I have struggled with suicidal ideation for years and years and no matter what I do it never leaves me alone for good. I’ll have good weeks, hell sometimes even good months, but eventually the nagging thought comes back. I wish I was just done with all of this. I don’t care to ponder what comes next anymore, I don’t even fucking care. I just know it’s not this. It could be a fresh start as a baby. It could be eternity of nothingness. It could be the continuation of this life without a body to occupy. But it is different, and that’s what matters. Life is roadblock after roadblock. Props to those who see the challenges as opportunity for growth. To me, unrest never ceases to creep back in and haunt my being. I wish I was stronger. I could handle more adversity and move on. And truth be told, I have overcome everything that has come my way thus far, evidence being that I’m still alive.I have come so close in the past that I’m now traumatized by my own mind. Every time I meet adversity I fear for my own safety, even when I don’t necessarily have to. I get an action plan ready to go, get ready to call on my supports. Which is logically a good thing. Regardless, I trick myself into believing it is pathetic. That I’m babied by myself, and my precautions are unnecessary, and I’m bringing on my on wrath. But isn’t that the issue itself? The constant self-torture that leads one to suicidal thoughts? And so the action plan never becomes, the reaching out never comes to fruition. And the suffering that many endure alone prospers until one day…It happens. The people around me are shattered. What could I have done, they’ll say. They had no idea I was feeling this way. Grief will ensue. Self blame will eventually turn into “there was nothing I could have done.” Who was once a vivid, lively, fiery presence turns to a missing piece turns to an afterthought. While it may be selfish to hope for continuation after life, life for others will continue. (At least I think it will. It could also cease. There is no real proof that life existed before or after me.) I have become nothing but a deep scar to those that cared for me in life, nothing but an instagram post to those that once knew me, and the truest form of nothing to those who are none the wiser. I would do it, I think, once all of my options have been exercised. Have I tried therapy? Have I tried the new experimental drug? Have I wasted all of my life’s savings in an effort to save me? Until then, suicide is completely unjustified. It is only fair to myself and to the people I care about (more honestly, the people that care about me) to do these things. Have I reached out to every last resource? Have I tried smoking a cigarette and waiting five minutes?But until that day comes, thoughts and impulses are just thoughts and impulses. And I think that may be okay. Because I have lived to see every day that comes after every single bad one. So I try to let myself be in peace, with as much grace as I have to offer. Depression and suicidal ideation has become a chronic and grueling illness for me. I am truly sick sometimes, not all the time, but enough. Enough where the need to make accommodations in my life is real, and it’s something I have to take into serious consideration whenever I make a big life decision. Even a small life decision. So for now, I’m just going to roll with it as much as I can. This is not one of those posts where I’m calling for help. I’m just calling for an ear to hear my daily and lifelong truth. Depression is often undermined for a multitude of reasons, but I am living proof that it shouldn’t be. I’m fucking lucky to be here. Every day is only a matter of time. Thank you for reading, if you did.I spend most months of the year depressed, and at least a few of those are severe. Every year. Time keeps going by and no matter what I do nothing is changing. I’m just tired. I want a normal life.I have been diagnosed with MDD in the past and have been known to suffer some serious episodes, a couple months at a time where it’s constantly a life or death battle. But there’s also some in between moments where I don’t feel “good” by any means (but there are times when i do feel good!!!). I think a lot of it has to do with physical symptoms and I’m curious if any of you have experienced this as well. These can be with or without low mood but it can definitely cause low mood too. Severe fatigue, generally feeling sick or feverish, stomach problems, random pains, and lack of executive functioning (this one is BAD). I’ll notice that I start skipping my skincare routine at night and my clothes start to pile up in my room. But during all of this it’s completely possible that the headspace that I’m in isn’t actually bad yet. I don’t even know why I start to let things slip, I just have such low energy and ability to start the tasks. I’ll also start chasing dopamine from smoking or drinking, sex/masturbation, self harm, literally anything that I know is a quick hit to the dome. Anyone else? I’ve noticed that Abilify really helps with the executive functioning, impulse control, and dopamine chasing, but it’s supposed to be a short term therapy in depression treatment and I’m trying to not be on medication.Hi internet parents, I’m 22F and am getting ready to take a job and move to a city where I know only one person. I’m worried that this move might be drastic, lonely, and isolating. But, it’s New York City, there is always something to do and new people to meet. Everyone keeps telling me I’m crazy and for a while I was like “haha, yep!” But now that it’s getting closer I’m starting to listen to them more.My friend was SA’d pretty traumatically earlier this year and she rarely talks about it, but I seriously worry about her coping often. I know she’s not opening up to anyone about it and I want to know if it’s appropriate to check in on her and if so how. We are very very close and even though she knows she can come to me with anything (and likely will in due time) but it’s been about 7 months and I’m worried that lack of coping will catch up with her one day. Is it okay that she doesn’t even think about it, much less talk? Is there anything I should do in the meantime? This is something that truly eats me up inside and (selfishly) I feel like I need to talk to her about it for my own sanity as well. Any advice would be appreciated.they’re not posted online i’m trying to live my best. literally got up, went to the bathroom, cut, went back.recently it’s been a lot more than usual and i’m curious about you and your story.i’m deeply suffering. i would really appreciate someone to talk to right now, i’m 22f and in need of a friend that could understand what i’m experiencing.i feel so crazy right now but i am ITCHING to run to the bathroom at work and cut a little bit. i work in a hospital so there’s bandages and stuff and i brought materials. how crazy on a scale of 1-10 would that be. i just don’t feel good. sometimes that’s the only way i can describe it.besides making other people uncomfortable and potentially cutting too deep or getting infected, what’s the big deal? it’s stress relief like a beer after work or smoking weed or going for a run… i don’t understand why it’s considered socially unacceptable even though the consequences (on a regular basis) are scars and open wounds. i wish it was easier to get away with. recently i have been cutting myself more and deeper than i ever have in my life. i started at 11, picked it up again at 21, and now at 22 i can’t stop thinking about it, craving it, it ruins my day and it wouldn’t if we could just be okay with it. i know i sound delusional. but i want to do it so badly that i would say anything to make it okay.i have gone through phases of cutting/recovery for like 7 years at least but recently it’s been more intense than ever. i’m cutting deeper and being less safe about where. for the past week or so i’ve been looking at pictures of other people’s cuts for like 20 mins before i go to bed. i scour the internet for anything that has to do with it. i don’t know why i’m so obsessed. i used to touch cuts and bandaids through my clothes during the day and feel terrible, now it feels like a little secret and kind of satisfying. i was thinking about it so much today that i almost quite literally, to my own embarrassment, replaced a word in my sentence with “cutting”. what??? i feel too old to be doing this but i have control over who can see it which is no one. i feel crazy when i take a step back for doing this especially at my age but ¯\_(ツ)_/. Friends and I got some molly, I did it not too long ago and was kinda depressed for like a week after but I’m also depressed at baseline so idk if it was the molly or just me.also…. we snorted it last time, would it feel different if we ingested it?. I'm wondering if there's any medications or something that can alleviate a depressive episode or suicidal thoughts quickly. I'm starting to get depressed on my current meds (lamotrigine and bupropion) and I think I'm deteriorating too fast to wait the weeks that new meds usually take.I’m panicking!!! Last night I went to change a pt before I left that wouldn’t really wake up. Myself and another CNA decided to just continue changing her because she has a leaking rectal tube, unexplained vaginal bleeding, and a stage 4 pressure ulcer on her sacrum on a wound vac. She fully woke up halfway through and started screaming in pain. I know the wound hurts, but I couldn’t let her sit like that for another 12 hours! (It was 10:30 pm and I was leaving at 11). She reported me this morning on my one day off and the cna I was with just called me and told me that the pt told her about reporting me. I’m scared. I don’t want to lose my job. I’ve been working a lot recently and haven’t been giving my all, so I’m scared that management isn’t going to side with me…Does anyone have any experiences like this and can ease my mind a little bit? I’ve been a CNA for 5 years, I’m a senior in my BSN program, and I’m terrified that this will fuck me up for a long time. Not to mention I might’ve just lost my only reference for other jobs.Update: I got her on my assignment and went to apologize — she actually apologized to me and it was just fine. Thank you all for your kind words!!!. For a while I’ve been pretty dead set on starting as a new grad in the ED, but a nurse I spoke with recently told me that it’s a must to start in medsurg. Most of my profs and other nurses have said there’s no need and people like that are the type to eat their young, but she was very convincing and I’m second guessing my decision. I graduate in May and have been considering an ED residency program (but have heard the pay is shit) or just jumping right into it. What do you think?. I’ve discovered I’m really into reads that take a strong emotional toll on the reader. The kind that you can’t put down because it’s so good, but the content is off-putting almost in a sickly way. I’m thinking along the lines of A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara or The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. Deeply painful to read, but impossible to put down. Hi everyone… i need help. first of all, im 21 and absolutely hate myself for my actions. it is my first dui and i don’t know how to describe what i feel besides shattered. i need my car to finish nursing school. i got a dui in new hampshire and should be cleared in 3 months, but I just got word from massachusetts that they imposed it for a year. i have no idea what to do about this. i would rather die than drop out of school. i want a hardship license but there’s some other things going against me. i got pulled over for my inspection sticker, the dui, and a car accident (or something — but it wasn’t me! i have proof that i wasn’t in that town at all that day!) and im scared that i wont be able to get it. please, any advice about any of it, i need to know im going to make it out of this. it feels like the end of the world.I don’t know what took me so long to realize that ‘clove’ (as in the shoes) means with love… I love it. the past 2 months of my life have been easily the worst i’ve ever experienced. i’m the most depressed i have ever been, to the point of hospitalization. i’m a nursing student, 21f, don’t have time for that shit. things finally start looking up — i don’t want to kill myself every second of the day, i love spending time with my friends, school is finally getting back on track. i got a fucking dui on friday. how badly i wish i could go back in time. i’m not sure if ill ever get a job. quick rant, but i feel like i’m already dead. i’m a shell of who i once was.i’m 21, a nursing student, it feels like my life is completely over. i was detained 2 days ago and have court in a month. i agreed to every test they asked for on the side of the road, including a breathalyzer. The batteries were dead/dying in both breathalyzers they used. i refused a breathalyzer at the station. am i fucked? do i have any chance of not guilty? it’s a class B misdemeanor (no accident or anything like that). i can’t afford to have my license suspended. i don’t know how im going to get a job now. it feels like my life is over.I have my first real OB clinical tomorrow! I'm so excited but I really want to impress and be able to do cool things. I was told that nurses tend to ask questions and if you get them right you can do the procedure. So, what are some things I should know before I walk in tomorrow morning? I'm going to review meds, decels, and assessments, but I'd love some input. Thanks!!. got back to school and the roomies and I are making a Euphoria drinking game!! here’s what we have, help us add in the comments:drink when…-anyone swears-rue does drugs-maddie rolls her eyes-(x2) if you see a duck-Fez yells, tells someone to shut up, or says “shit”-nate has sex with cassie -jules cries-ashtray does something unhingedshots when… (we put our predictions/hope to see here)-rue is manic-rue, jules, elliott threesome-you see cassie’s boobs-maddie has her lesbian mother-of-kid-she-babysits moment-maddie finds out about cassie and nate-fez and lexi kiss. I’m working a double right now (3p-7a) and am honestly shocked at the state of healthcare. I work at a rehabilitation hospital and the staffing ratios are insane. I only work on breaks from school now so I haven’t been here in a month or so. We typically have 5-6 pts each on a good day. The 3-11 was okay, 3 aides each with 9 pts, nothing too crazy. The overnight comes and we have a 1:1 and there’s 2 aides total. I’m currently in the 1:1 while one aide is busting her ass for 18 people. The supervisor had the nerve to tell me to stop helping her. People are screaming from their rooms. I can’t believe this. I had to make an unfortunate decision — do I stay in the 1:1 to ensure the safety of one person, or do I help a coworker to ensure the safety of 18 others? I’m in nursing school and this is my 4th year of being a CNA. This year alone has made me question my career more than I ever have before. Disregard burnout and exhaustion and being underpaid. I never thought I would have to make decisions like that.thinking of other people going through sadness and pain breaks my heart. the thought of someone, anyone laying in bed at night feeling sad or lonely makes me feel so angry, frustrated, upset, i don’t even know what words to put to it. i just don’t know why people have to experience negativity. there’s a post on this sub from yesterday about someone losing their partner much sooner than they expected to. it brings me to tears to think of a fellow human being in that kind of state. ugh, if any of you are on this sub because your soul is in pain, know that it hasn’t gone unnoticed. feel free to let it go in the comments. <3. Has anyone ever done a travel contract as a cna? I’m a nursing student with 4 years of experience and I want to go out of state on a contract over the summer, but I’m not sure how to find them. I want to go somewhere fun where I can make some friends but also make some money and hopefully have housing and travel covered too. Kind of like a nursing travel contract but as a cna. I’m not even sure if this exists but it would be amazing if it did!If you’ve done this before, how did you find the job and how was your experience? Looking for any possible information I can get. Thanks :-)Edit: In case anyone is interested, fusion med staff is a website with a multitude of CNA travel options! I applied for a ton of them about 10 minutes ago (lol). Reviews are pretty legit and seems like a great opportunity. i went out last night and got drunk obviously and did some coke too. i’ve been drinking 2+ days a week recently with some coke sprinkled in there sometimes (college am i right) but this week i was already feeling a little sick. woke up this morning pretty fine considering the circumstances but now tonight i have a fever and generally feel like shit. is this from the hangover (i.e. i can still drink tonight)? has anyone else felt like this the day after or am i probably actually sick. advice needed my major is having a party tonight and if it’s not part of the hangover im gonna skip but otherwise im pushing thru. I’m a college student and I live in a house with 3 roommates (I’m 20F and the roommate in question is 21F). This is the first time any of us have lived somewhere that’s not a dorm or a family house, so roommate decided to adopt a kitten. She asked us beforehand if we were okay with it and we definitely were. I have a friend studying abroad and she asked me to take in her cat (she’s 12 ish years old) while she’s gone for the school year, and after checking with roomies it seemed like a great option. We all love cats and this cat was miserable living at home with 2 dogs and only socialized with my friend, no one else in the house.We all moved in and everything was smooth, the kitten stayed in roomie’s room for the first week or so because she’s young and getting used to a new home. But once they met each other hell broke loose. The cat hates the kitten, more so hates having her personal space threatened, and any time the kitten tries to even walk by her the cat tries to attack. We decided to keep them separated for as long as this goes on, and at this point it’s been about 2 months and a few more tries at getting them to be friendly, to no avail. We usually rotate which cat roams the house so they both get social time and they both stay in the rooms for a little bit, and it was working out pretty decently until the past week or so. My roommate has been pretty adamant about keeping her cat out most of the time, and she’s home a lot so she’ll keep her cat out when she’s home. Fine. In the past 3 days the cat I’ve taken in has probably left my room for 10-12 hours total, the rest is her kitten. I was fine with it at first because the other cat is older and the kitten needs to burn off steam, but now roomie doesn’t want the other cat out at night even though her kitten is in bed with her. She the cat scratches at her door. It usually wakes me up and i’ve started to notice that it’s not my cat that’s been starting it, but the kitten has been meowing loudly from the room so the other cat joins in. Understandably annoying regardless of which cat starts it, but I know she’s started to resent having the other cat here because she thinks it’s her causing all of the problems. Yeah, she is the one that isn’t okay with the other cat, but it’s getting to a point where my cat is barely getting out of the room. I want to talk to her about being better with cat rotations but she gets very defensive. She says that since we agreed to her kitten first, and because the other cat isn’t technically mine, that worst case scenario my cat would have to leave. At this point this cat feels like my own and myself along with the other roommates want the cat to stay, even if we have to put in extra work to make sure they’re both safe and happy. I don’t know how to approach this, but part of me feels like she’s right; the kitten did come (timeline wise) first, but things have changed since then. I want to open this discussion even if she gets defensive, but I want to make sure i’m not in the wrong before I open the can of worms. So reddit, WIBTA if I asked her to work with me a little better on this, even though she’s angry and possibly has the right to be so? How can I open this conversation without potentially ruining a friendship?.
    Hey, I hope y’all are doing well, I’m looking for other depressed, neurodiverse souls who need a kind friend. Although anyone is welcome to reach out as well. Ideally I hope to develop long term connections. Though if you just want to vent or a quick chat. I’m alright with that. I am interested in geopolitics, psychology, hiking, baking, etc..I offer as much empathy as I can because I’ve struggled for most of my life so I can understand when others are also falling behind. I don’t judge or offer too much advice. I am struggling with keeping friends and rejection sensitivity. Also lost 2 close people in my life (I was ghosted). So I’ve been dealing with the fallout for a while now. Forgive me if I need to vent a lot since it’s honestly a coping mechanism of mine. I’m trying my best to heal and meet new people so I can rebuild my psyche and find happiness again.Hope your day is good and know that I do care for your wellbeing. You deserve love, affection and happiness. I hope your doing much better than I.Over the years, I’ve noticed that I am no longer as sharp as I used to be. I find myself forgetting basic information and losing spatial awareness.Like I can barely walk sometimes and find myself stumbling at times. I don’t remember my balance being this bad.Not to mention I’ve been dealing with speech issues and am struggling more and more in conversations because my memory is so bad nowadays. As a result I’ve been struggling to keep friends and close relationships with family. I’ve also find myself getting distracted very easily and spacing out more often. Its gotten so bad that I had to quit driving and now I need my family to help me out with a lot of tasks that I didn’t have issues with till recently. I am becoming more disabled as I age. I already struggle with adhd and autism. I didn’t think things would get worse than they already are.I am scared of my future.I can understand if we don’t click after a few texts or chats and we move on. I can understand when things come up and you can’t reply or talk for a while. I’m cool with that.I don’t understand when someone ghosts after we’ve been close for months or even years. Like… we’ve been talking everyday, doing activities, hanging out, FaceTiming, etc…Just this year, i was ghosted by my best friend of 6 years, someone so close that we considered each other family. We were so comfortable and vulnerable with each other that we could chat just about anything, but our trust was so deep that we were comfortable talking about almost anything.She ghosted me after I told her about a dream where I was looking back at my old photos. We had no drama, problems or anything going on prior to this. She legit promised me she would spend a lot of time with me this past summer.She never texted me again. UghThen a few weeks later, my close cousin ghosted me after she told me she would work on staying in touch with me as she left for college. That was our last conversation.I was okay and understood, but then I saw that she viewed my stories on instagram and she was writing posts and stories on instagram.Okay I wasn’t bothered by this, I dismissed this thinking that she is just quickly updating her social media and stuff and was very busy otherwise. Turns out this was a red flag.Because when I FaceTimed my aunt, my close cousin was visiting her.She didn’t even say hi, she was walking around doing stuff. She did see me but she didn’t wave or anything. Instead she looked like she didn’t care to see me in the call.I was so devastated afterwards, I promptly deleted my instagram account. Why do people just drop close ones like that. What is wrong with people? It hurts me deeply every time it happens and I’m getting sick and tired of it. I’m mentally hurt deeply right now.Sorry for the long post. TLDR: im sick of being ghosted by close friends and loved ones.Back then I still had irl friends, had best friends, was doing okay in school. I was heartbroken after I was ghosted by a very close friend after I did my best to keep her around. This almost led to me ending my life.Since then life has gotten far worse. - I lost my friends, including my last close friends. - My disabilities (Autism, ADHD, Insomnia disorder) have gotten noticeably worse and unbearable. - I find myself burning out too often to the point that I can’t hold any job. - I am judged for my struggles and my quirks to the point that I’m too anxious to go outside anymore. - I mostly exist in a state of complete misery. It’s very hard to feel happy anymore.I could’ve ended all this, but I chose to stick around and continue deteriorating. I regret my decision and now I’m too anxious and depressed to even try anymore.I had this happen during a Christmas family gathering where I was close with a cousin and we spent a lot of it together.Long story short, she distanced herself from me and spent more time with my siblings and others while completely ignoring me. I figured I messed up somewhere and she was upset at me.I experienced really intense anxiety and depression to the point that I tried pacing myself, fiddling around just trying to relax myself and rationalize. I kept trying to tone out the thoughts but the anxiety and depression was just soo overwhelming.I then lock myself in the bathroom and break down crying. I was curled up sobbing for over an hour before my family got me out.Throughout the rest of the gathering, I desensitized myself and limited my interactions from then on, fearing that I’m just going to be heartbroken again.Has anyone experienced Rejection sensitivity related meltdowns. To the point that it overwhelms you entirely and causes you to meltdown?This sucks to be honest.Lonely because of social disability and emotional dysfunction. I am unable to keep friends due to poor social capabilities.I struggle with poor eye contact, difficulty understanding people’s intentions, impulsivity, inattentiveness and executive dysfunction.I am often treated as an outcast, often times I’m ignored, judged, teased or bullied. I just want to be normal, I don’t want to have such issues relating to people. I want to spend one day where I’m not living like an alien unable to understand people.I met someone here, we had a lot in common. We texted every night. Our conversations were long and we both replied in paragraph responses and at least I felt like we were becoming close. We even talked about FaceTiming soonish!Then out of nowhere, she stopped replying. I haven’t heard from her in a month. I am trying to remain optimistic and assume that she will eventually come back, but I’m slowly coming to the conclusion that she might have lost interest and ghosted me.I admit I am a bit hurt from this and I am feeling quite lonely over this. I have spent some time scrolling on our discord chats and seeing if I said something wrong. I don’t know what I did wrong or what. I also try to assume she got busy or something. I’m dealing with a flood of guesses and emotions over this.Sorry for the vent, I’m hurting.Is this common? Have you had this happen a lot?. After many years I saw my old friend group. They’ve grown a lot but I recognized them.They notice me and give me the biggest hugs. I was so happy that I was driven to tears.I held on to each one of them tightly, letting them know how much I missed them and how long it’s been. It was a long process giving each one a greeting hug. We then hung out for a while, talking about our different lives.Then I woke up………. I am at a place where I am suffering from crippling loneliness and isolation. My mental health has slowly been deteriorating as I have less and less people to talk to. Yet I have been trying to figure out how to chat with people and socialize. It’s been extremely difficult as I am awkward and uncomfortable talking to strangers and most of my attempts at conversation end up in an awkward place. This is made me quite self conscious.I don’t go out since I cannot drive and I live in a car centric rural area and my neighbors are far away.I haven’t seen a irl friend in years now. My family rarely talks to me at all.I have a few online friends but it just feels so distant and i haven’t heard from most of them in a while. They always seem to fade away.I do not want to be completely alone. I just want someone to hangout with and be wholesome and loving.How do you escape this.When I’m very excited about an event coming up. Bam insomnia.Or when I have a depressive/grieving episode due to social isolation, I get insomniac.It feels like something is just stuck in your head and your thoughts are just spinning around.I feel so hopeless and trapped because I’ve lost so many hours of sleep from heavy emotions.Anyone deal with this? How do you cope?. I have lost all contact with my best and only friend soon after I had to move away. The last time I saw her was on the day I left. She helped us pack up to move, then we hung out for the rest of the evening.Shortly after I moved, something came up and she promptly changed her number without warning me.We’ve lost touch. Just like that, my best and only friend had vanished from my life.We used to spend so much time together. We would watch shows, chat about random things nonstop, watch prison related YouTube videos and share memes.She used to always give me hugs when I was down or when we greeted each other. She absolutely loved my hugs and complimented me on them. She would hold me tight for a minute or longer. We were so blessed to have each other in our lives. She was my brightest memory from 2020 as quarantine struck us all. I can’t help but look back and associate that year with her. I don’t have any other way to contact her. Its been 3 years since we lost touch. I haven’t had a real life friend since.I depend on online friendships. They help a little, but don’t fill that void left in my heart. I wished I had a real life friend. I wish I still had my best friend around.I love you gabby! Thank you so much for being with me. I’ll always remember you.It really hurts to exist as an anomaly. I have Autism, ADHD, MDD, insomnia disorder, a deformity, and panic disorder. Don’t want to leave the house, don’t want to exist. Just want to vanish from everyone’s memory. I often hate being seen. I want peace.I promise I am trying, i understand I have issues trying to engage with friends. It is really hard living with autism, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and chronic insomnia. I don't often have a lot of energy but I do my absolute best to do activities, chill, text, all kinds of stuff. Its hard to meet people irl because I am extremely socially awkward and have speech issues that cause easy misunderstandings. They usually end up backing off from me and joining another conversation or do something else to get distracted. It crushes my confidence and self-esteem every time this happens. Sometimes I meet someone and we connect for a bit, we bond and talk about topics of interest. Then I will start to get happy and start trusting this new friend. I then start info-dumping on this person on random topics, this understandably annoys him/her and I end up unwittingly pushing that potential friend away because I info-dumped too much. Online I have met more people that were liked-minded, I ended up meeting someone who was also autistic and we became very close friends over a few months. We would facetime every other day for hours and hours on end. Everything was going great but just like all good things, it had to run its course. She ended up distancing herself from me suddenly. Her reasoning is that she is very tired and exhausted. I understand and have waited on her for a while. Though I hear back from her once every 10 days now. Still holding hope that we can catch up again so I am not moving on yet. Often times I will meet friends and we will connect and do a lot of chatting and other activities, but the friendships will always fizzle out and end with me being ghosted. One time last month i chatted with a person for a few weeks. We had fun and everything was going alright until one day out of the blue he accused me of "not caring about my messages and being boring". He wants a friend that will actually "listen" to him and reply better. I tried to explain that I do care and I just didn't know what much more that I needed to say. He blocked me in response. I am losing hope and losing confidence bit by bit. I just keep on boring or annoying people and losing out on friendships over misunderstandings and info-dumping. Only remedy I have found is masking, which only drains me more and leaves me feeling even more lonely and unlikable. TLDR: Struggling to make friends due to disabilities, awkwardness, and being annoying. Close relationships keep on fizzling out over a short period of time and don't know how to keep on living like this.I just want to hide myself in a forest and never be heard from again.I hate having to talk to people either on the phone or irl because my speech is so bad and I struggle with articulation. I always find myself slurring my words, subconsciously repeating words and tones rapidly, using monotone, brain glitches, etc… People will either get frustrated and angry at me, switch to an awkward tone, or just distance themselves from me. I have a hard time making friends or dating as a result. Sometimes I get teased for this too.I always feel so awful and awkward around people nowadays. I often just avoid social situations like the plague because I don’t want my speech problems to be exposed. Existing with people is just painful for me at this point.But I am feeling completely lonely and hopeless because of this. I don’t know what I can do to cope and I just don’t want to go outside anymore.Help?. Is it possible to improve your speech capabilities, if not, how do you cope with this?I have been having issues with stuttering, tics, monotone and subconsciously repeating words or tones.I usually end up creating a lot of socially awkward moments. I sometimes get judged or teased about my speech. Social anxiety and stress will exacerbate these symptoms. It’s humiliating and I am socially withdrawing as a result.Having selective memory makes it hard enough for me to articulate. I just feel so anxious and mute when I am out in social settings or needing to interact with unfamiliar people.I feel absolutely terrible for everyone else that has to live like this. This is a very painful and tedious experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I am happy that I can text decently. My writing can be inconsistent at times but I am okay at getting my point across.Anyway I suffer from a combination of neurological disabilities that completely alter my thinking and processing abilities. This leads to my speech stuttering often times and other tics. My articulation is inconsistent at best and my motor capabilities are turbulent.Stress and anxiety will exacerbate these problems, sometimes to the point that I have to mute myself to avoid melting down. If I talk, my speech will be incoherent. Of course my terrible speech has led to a lot of moments of awkwardness. I have had people judge me or back off from our interaction.I have had friends distance and then ghost me in the past over this. As I have gotten older, I have closed myself off from most of society. I have a few online friendships where we only text and don’t FaceTime often or meetup. I am starting to accept that there is a great possibility that I will die alone. I am trying to work on loving myself and not letting the circumstances crush me. It’s not my fault. I didn’t choose to be this way. I still have a lot to offer and at least I can function to some extent. I do believe I can be loved for who I am. I just have a ton to work on.Anybody else lonely due to similar issues. I hope you all have been handling yourself okay.Idk where to begin. Recently I was prescribed 10 mg Ritalin ER. I was warned that this could exacerbate my psychiatric symptoms, especially anxiety, paranoia and depression. Every time I attempt to take the medication, I get intense anxiety. Like when I have it on hand, I just get an intense rush of anxiety and paranoia to the point that I will melt down and cry. I am so afraid of the side effects and how it will impact the autism side of me.Idk where to begin but I am now assuming it’s probably unsafe for me to take it considering my extremely intense anxiety. I don’t know where to go from here.It’s one thing to have to life with Autism, ADHD, and insomnia disorder. To be disabled enough that I cannot drive. Holding a job is difficult to impossible considering my sleep disorder throws me off and causes me to burnout faster since I will often experience insomniac attacks.But living in a very rural area that’s distant from civilization. Nothing but farmland and shitty suburbs. No sidewalks, shitty weather, horseflies mosquitoes and ticks, grocery store is 30 minutes away and inaccessible by bikes or public transport.I used to hike and explore places when I was still living in a suburban area that at least had sidewalks and places to visit. My special interest is to explore places and stuff. But I don’t often get any of those opportunities anymore unless my family decides to take me to a place where I could.It feels like I am stuck on an island. Anyone else have this issue being disabled in a rural area?. Whenever it’s above 85 degrees with 50% humidity, I experience sensory overload the moment I walk outside on a sunny day.I will start to experience sensory overload as I lose executive functioning and experience sensory illness. This is regardless to how much water I drink and I tend to feel drained and mentally tired after an hour outside. This occurs no matter how I dress outside or how much water I drink. It feels like sensory overload.I get similar feelings when it’s cold as well but at least I can layer up. Fuck summers.I hope to meet people with similar struggles so we can overshare about our special interests and we can won’t have to mask. I am trying to learn to love myself in spite of my flaws and trying to improve slowly over time.I am straightforward and honest when I am chatting with people, plus I am very loyal to my loved ones. I like to listen to music, talk about psychology explore places. I am willing to do activities with friends I am close to so I am open to trying new friends.I do take things slowly, so no rush on anything. All I ask is to be patient and stick with me since closeness is built over time. No minors plz.Its so easy for me to forget things due to distractions or awful short memory and it’s getting to a point where I am exhausting myself always trying to remember things. I find it so hard to forgive myself and understand this part of me since I am ashamed to have short-term memory loss.It’s very challenging for me to study or learn new things as I have to frequently reread, rewrite or rewatch whole videos/lectures since I will always forget a lot of important information by the end of the lecture/read.I will always place a belonging of mine somewhere odd when I get highly distracted or end up hyper focused on an activity. After a while I will suddenly forget where I placed it and end up losing it for a while as it’s suddenly somewhere I am not familiar with. There have been times were I almost lost important papers or cards because of this and it happens quite often.I hate having such terrible short-term memory.
    Can anyone help me with food for my kids?. I've set a plan in motion and soon after today I will no longer be here. I've tried my best but as always I have failed in being a mother and they deserve better. I'd rather it be my choice than the big C taking me out. I'm done I have no fight left in me. I'm ready to be gone. So I suppose this is my goodbye. Farewell friends stay well.Hello reddit users! I am a 25f as my title states.

Also please no minors Have a wonderful day ❤️. I 25f have two children and on a daily basis I struggle to feed them. I work full time and am putting myself thru college. I have tried every side hustle/food pantry i can think of and yet I still don't get to eat and some days they dont either. Anyone have any advice I'm lost and feeling like a failure. I just feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I have no one to talk to and I wish one person gave a fck about me. I feel completely alone. Trying to get food and need money any apps anyone knows?. I really hate my life. I'm stuck in a rut. I'm slowly starving to death cuz life is too expensive. Haven't eaten in days. Really what's the point to keep going?Is there a point?Would anyone miss me?😔 Sincerely a depressed single mother. I am a 25f single mother to a 5m and 1f my ex and their dad is in prison for attempted murder so child support is a no go.I work full time and am putting myself through college, I have been contemplating giving my children up for adoption as I can not financially support them and have done everything I can think of too. I.e churches/pantries/ gov assistance (don't qualify) 211 asking friends and relatives for help. And nothing has helped at all. I don't know what to do anymore they don't deserve this. I haven't eaten in three days so they can eat but I need help. Please some one help me 😭🙏.
    TW: childhood sexual assaultThis post is going to be fucked, but I don't know how else to ask this. Does anyone feel pain and internalized homophobia from being molested?Even though I believe sexuality is not a choice, it's something we're born with, I regularly think about my molestation and my bisexuality. Anytime I have thoughts of men (I'm male) it can be very triggering to the time I was abused as a young child and I wonder if that experience played a part in my sexuality. I hate the thought not of being bisexual but of my abuser having that big an impact on me and I don't know I don't think I'm explaining it the best. Does anyone else get feelings like this?. TW: abuse, childhood sexual assault, suicidal ideationI'm almost 23. I've been such a bad friend. I let my abuse and cptsd consume me to the point of avoiding everything and feeling overwhelmed by any changes. I feel like I've been floating in place since I was 17 and I keep telling people I can change but I never do. I don't know where to go from here. I'm so far behind everyone, ice severed so many relationships. I feel like my mind will never be controlled, like I will forever live in a state of overwhelmed, afraid, nervous, lonely, angry. I don't know how to get past this. There are so many bad thoughts in my head. That I was destined to be this way. That I'm weak and that's why I was targetted for molestation, that's why I was abuse by my parents.All I feel is hate. Any love I receive is drowned out from all the people that aare always angry and disappointed in me. The voices never stop. How easy would it be to end it all. Not easy in the sense of mustering the strength to do it, but if I did then theres nothing left. I don't have to live this pain another second, and I don't have to burden the people I love with my negativity and emotional instability. People talk shit about me on Twitch saying mean stuff and that they don't care about my feelings but when I go into their stream and call them out for being a jerk, I'm the one who's in the wrong. I'm the one who's being inappropriate and going into their space and causing a scene. I'm the one that gets called out for it. I don't fucking understand.

I am not a twitch streamer, I am seeing these TTVs in my games, listening to their stream back and hearing the insults, then going into their chat after and confronting them about it.

Over the past few years I've come to realize that I have no value. Everything that I thought I was good at, my friends are all better. I'm pathetic, worthless, I literally have nothing I'm good at. My friends joke all the time about how I'm the worst at everything and even stuff I put more time into I'm worse at.I am extremely unhappy with this, but I can't argue any of it. I often lash out in self hate and yell at myself and belittle myself. It's starting to affect me socially. I don't know how to stop because I'm so terrible at everything it's like why can't I just say the truth. I don't know how to fix this problem. It gets to me so much. Every decision I make is through the lens of social anxiety. If I walk to the cafeteria and there are too many people at a good counter, I'll go until I find one that isn't crowded. I order the most basic thing to avoid judgement. I wear the most plain clothes and keep my head down to not see anyone. I feel so worthless and pathetic all the time. I hate living with this condition and I hate living in myseld. I feel so fucking worthless all the time. I bring no value to anyone's life I bring no value to the world it feels so shitty no matter what activity I'm always the worst at it, even shit that I put more hours into people always become better at it than me and it's like I have fucking nothing. "Comparison is the thief of joy" sure but when. You're literally no good at fucking anything it doesn't fucking feel good I just want to fucking die I want to die I fucking hate life so much. I find if I'm making out with a guy and he's on top of me, I get extremely overwhelmed by the sensations. Feeling his weight on me, his massive body with my hands, constantly losing breath kissing him, hearing his voice. It gets to be so much and my legs start shaking uncontrollably, I start getting really hot all over, and sometimes I can't help but throwing my head back and saying a bunch of dirty words.I hope I explained it well, it's like all that happens without me controlling it, I get so overwhelmed by the moment. Is it annoying when bottoms are like this?. I thought this might be good to post here. This is from a male perspective, not to stereotype but it's just with toxic masculinity and all that it's a mixed bag whether men will be thoughtful and tapped into their emotions or not.That's why I find my one friend really sweet. I'm 22, he's 24. We've been friends for a couple years. I've never directly told him I'm sensitive but he definitely picked up on it because in our friend group, he almost never jokes about me and he's quick to reassure me if he does. He's very quick to check in on me if I seem shaken up, and he's receptive to my rants I guess, or like little sentiments I give friends sometimes. I do it to practice gratefulness but he likes to hear what I've written down.Idk bros a fucking beauty, (TW: abuse) after growing up abused by male relatives I'm super thankful to have met a man so masculine yet in tune with his emotions and aware of the power his words have. And he does this without people talking to him, like he just has that strong emotional intelligence. I want to give him a big hug next time I see him 😭 do you have any friends that are understanding of sensitivity?. I'm 22m, a little old to be going through my straight crush phase but man it's been hard to help. Met my buddy early last year, he's a couple years older than me. There is so much about him that I'm into. We both act really masculine, but he looks the part a lot more. I can barely grow facial hair and have none on my body besides armpits and crotch, he has a full beard and hairy body. We're both 6'4, I'm really skinny and he's bully muscular. He has the cutest smile and laugh ever. Even the way he dresses is cute to me. He's the guy who wears cargo shorts and calf high socks in the summer, with a visor hat.His personality is so sweet too. He's very funny, jokes around like a typical bro, he's super passionate about sports and betting/gambling games. He's good at it though so it's not like a sad addiction to watch, it's interesting hearing his strategy and tips. And he's super soft to me. I don't know why but I guess he picked up on me being a little more sensitive so he's really thoughtful not to joke too much and to reassure me how he sees me. I asked him about it one time and he said it's because I'm sensitive but he likes that about me. Ugh 😩 I'm going through it.Thanks for listening to my straight crush rant, I'm trying to slowly "get over him" in the romantic lense and view him as a friend because he's a very good one, and I don't want to lose that over some feelings. Have you ever fallen for a friend that wasn't into dudes?. TW: suicide, spiralingI am losing my mind. I think I understand what people mean when they say going off the deep end. One look at my post history will show you I've had a long history of depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal thoughts.This time feels realer than ever. I have purchased items to take my life with. I have planned out a time and place. I have written notes to people. I have sent money away. I stopped going to my job. I stopped working on my college classes. I've brought up to my friends and so many have been cold and unbothered. I feel like my end is coming. I'm scared and broken but also feel like it's what I need to do. I'm such a burden to everyone. I completely fucked up my life. I've tried so many medications and therapists and counsellors. People don't understand how long the waiting times are for these, how expensive they are, and how often they don't work. I've spent so much time and money on treatments that haven't helped me. I don't know where to turn anymore. I know I can't expect anyone else to help me but fucking hate when that's all people offer. I just want to be cared for but I have fucking no one. all everyone gives a fuck about is deleting my posts, reporting my account, blocking me, saying I bring down the mood, getting mad at me for hating life, making my suicidal thoughts seem like the biggest inconvenience in the fucking world to them. I want to kill myself to spite these motherfuckers. I hope my death weighs in their fucking conscious fuck these cunts I fucking hate them. Please someone end me. I hate it here so fucking much I've lost everything. I fucked up again TW: suicide I fucked it up again. Again. I've already ruined my family relationships, ruined so many friendships. I have no one. Now I ruined things with my favorite subreddit. I felt closer to the mods than anyone else in my life but I sent them a very inappropriate message that begged for them to end my life. Now they've blocked and banned me. I've lost everything. I ruined everything. How can I continue? How can things ever get better. I've literally ruined everything. I fucked it up again. Again. I've already ruined my family relationships, ruined so many friendships. I have no one. Now I ruined things with my favorite subreddit. I felt closer to the mods than anyone else in my life but I sent them a very inappropriate message that begged for them to end my life. Now they've blocked and banned me. I've lost everything. I ruined everything. How can I continue? How can things ever get better. I've literally ruined everything. I've ruined my life. There's no point to anything anymore. I just want it to end. I can't do this. TW: suicideIt's not worth it anymore. Every day I feel like a horrible person, completely unlovable and worthless. There's nothing that can save me. I've been a horrible person too, I've hurt so many people and burned so many relationships. I can't do it anymore. No therapy or medication helps. It's over. I just need to face that I will never have a purpose. It's so miserable. Every day thinking things could be different and they never are. I'm a lonely loser with no purpose here. I only fail and let people down. I can't do it anymore. I understand flashlight/flashbang even Sabo saves can be super satisfying to pull off, and they can change the tide of a match. I think during the main game it makes sense to stealthily follow the killer and try to save an injured survivor once they're down as it's easier to pull these off when healthy (not making noise).My pet peeve comes when these players make things more complicated than they need to in the end game. I've had numerous occasions where I'm running to the exit gate injured, a simple body block secures the escape for everyone, but instead flashlight people let me go down and then miss the save because the killer picks up facing away. Sure it's cool to hit an end game save, but why force the situation when you don't have to? I wish these players would let the opportunities come to them and not throw a match to try and get a save. How do you feel about this?. I don't know why, maybe it's comforting. I really enjoy sitting in guys' laps. I feel so warm and protected. However, I understand that most men are heavy (even skinny men weigh a lot compared to normal stuff you'd have on top of you) and it can be a lot to have someone on you. I guess I'm curious if you find this cute/comforting as well or if it's more clingy/annoying?. This isn't the case for every situation but for a good amount of people, when you're happy and feel good, you're emitting good vibes, super likeable and fun to be around, and even if you don't need it you're getting a ton of affirmation from others.When you're lonely, you can be bitter, grumpy, sad, depressed, irritated, hollow. None of these are enjoyable to be around. It takes a lot of energy to deal with these emotions for both the person feeling them and the person trying to help. I can't fault anyone for not wanting to be around me. It's a cruel snowball that hurts lonely people more, and boosts happy people more. I hate when people say this so fucking much. When would it ever be appropriate at all to say this to someone who is paralysed and in a wheelchair? Or someone who has a chronic illness that leaves them bedridden most of the day? Never. And these conditions are horrible, I'm not trying to be insensitive to those people I'm sure there are a lot of people who are subtly discriminating them as well.My point is people think because it's a mental illness that they can just say this shit and be unsympathetic. Oh everyone has problems so you can't be sad about yours and you need to stop talking and push on. It's so fucking tone deaf I hate people that say that as a way to dismiss my struggles. I hate my biological father. He has done irreversible damage to our relationship and doesn't care at all. He blames me for us not talking anymore and will never own up to his abuse. Verbal, physical, and sexual. I hate him.As unhealthy as my hatred is, it warms my heart when I see how some of my peers interact with their fathers. How they hug, joke around, genuinely seem happy together.Can I get a hug? :( I feel like I missed out on having a strong male in my youth. I'm 22 now and striving hard to not become an ounce of what my dad was. To be a strong man for others who need it. Thanks to anyone who read through this. Love for all the men in this world who do not abuse others. I got a mouth guard back in September but didn't start wearing it until 5 weeks later because I had to revisit the office. I think it fits, it feels like it covers my top teeth but it's uneven, like my bottom teeth on the one side touch the guard way before my right teeth. Did my teeth shift over these 5 weeks and cause the mold to be outdated? Or am I overthinking this?. This dude is the second coming of Barry Sanders. If not for the situations he finds himself in, he'd be a hall of fame Lock, no Drew.At 1-5, who cares anymore. Our defense has looked solid this year outside of the Miami disaster. I'm handing the ball to Perine every single down and letting this man carry us to the promise land. The path to another Super Bowl ring is through the talent of Samaje Perine.I mean I guess factors like gender, age, height might affect how much nutrients you require. I'm trying to be healthier. Or is this a normal occurence in the gay community? I'm not sure if it's because I'm tall or more masculine presenting, or could just be random. Almost every guy I approach or get approached by expects me to be the top and I don't understand why.I'm sure people here will know the difference, when someone is genuinely curious about your life and judgement free versus when someone presses you all the time about your life and insults you when the answer isn't good enough. My parents do this all the fucking time and I want to tell them to leave me the fuck alone and let me live. They feel the need to micromanage everything and it's so annoying.I love my friends, and they seem to enjoy my company as we hangout a lot but there are times where things are very hollow. I'm not good at conversation and the mood just kinda gets stale and tense and I feel like I have to overthink everything I say and say super generic hollow things idk. It's like I never feel secure in any relationship. It's fear they will leave if I say one wrong thing. Whenever my friends in the group chat ask people to hangout, it always pops off immediately or within 5 minutes. Whenever I ask if anyone wants to hangout it's like radio silence for hours, usually not even until the next day. Do people not fuck with me?. My back left molars usually have some sensitivity from grinding. My dentist made a mouthguard for me to wear at night, and it feels really tight which I guess it's supposed to. However these teeth are in pain when I wake up, despite wearing the guard. Is this normal?. I am a sensitive dude. I'm chill and laid back but I am easily hurt by banter and quick to be invested in a friend's sadness or misfortune.I think it's cool that men like us defy gender stereotypes, however those same roles can also lead to us being perceived as weak. I know I've had a ton of men annoyed at me for how sensitive I am, as it's not perceived as a masculine trait. How do you handle the disproving voices?. I don't know if I phrased the question the best, I don't mean like why does my group think like this but more so why does it happen to me? What breeds hypocrisy? Or am I worse than I realize?In my friend group, I was told that they don't like it when I'm quiet because it ruins the mood for people. I was also told they don't like it when I get frustrated at our games (when we play games together). However, almost all of them have times when they are quiet and when they get mad at the game. As often as I ever did, yet they only ever get mad at me about it.I swear I have journalled about this and kept a very keen eye in my head about this. I have challenged myself to change my behavior because regardless it was clearly bothering them, and I love them. But I'm curious why I have a shorter leash than anyone else. Is it because I'm delusional and I really am the worst? Is it because I bring less value to the group so they're willing to put up with less? Is it because I'm a passive person so I'm easier to criticize without fear of blowback?Genuinely curious the answer from people more attuned to social skills. I will be the first to admit I am behind in emotional maturity and social skills. Thanks!. I have trouble being completely transparent and honest with doctors/therapists about my mental health instinctively because I'm often afraid of judgement. I had a therapist say I did not have NPD or BPD, however they said it's hard to screen through only questions.I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but more so wondering if anyone else has this fear of abandonment, as I often see it associated with BPD. But I'm wondering if Narcissistic abuse can also create a fear of abandonment.This feeling is primarily in my friendships. After almost every hangout with my friends, I get scared after that they won't hangout with me again and I overthink and worry until we're together again. I try to hide it from them because I don't want to scare them away. But I'm so scared of losing them :( like it affects my mood so much. Does anyone else have unhealthy attachment from their childhood?. In two senses:1. They are treating me in a different way than they did in the past2. They are treating me different in a group setting than they are other friendsBoth of these scenarios drive me insane. I'm not angry at them I'm confused and spiraling at the situation. Why are they treating me differently? Did I do something? Am I not likeable? What is causing this? Etc. Etc. Question after question breaking down in my mind what is happening and wanting to cry all the while trying to act like I'm not bothered and like everything is okay. Because when I try to bring it up they call me emotional and are annoyed at it. It hurts so bad but I hold my tongue because I don't want to annoy them and ruin the friendship further, despite it driving me CRAZY that they are treating me different. Does anyone relate to this feeling?. If a familiar person uses a slightly different tone, different phrasing, even in texting if they don't use emojis when they normally do: I pick up on it. And them changing sends my mind in a spiral questioning why their different and if I did something to upset them, if they hate me. Does anyone else's mind get like this?. I have 2 fps, my 2 best friends (we're a group of three). Despite having other friends in my life, I'm not nervous at all talking to them. I feel like my relationships are much better with them because of it.While my FPs are the people I talk to the most, I feel like a very fake person around them. I don't change myself but I overthink what I say and don't want to show any part of myself that might make them think less of me or abandon me. It recently hit me that I was doing this and I found it interesting how I'm care free talking to other friends but with my FPs every sentence feels life or death. Is it all because of the fear of abandonment?It sucks because I love them so fucking much but I'm terrified of losing them.
    I’m at the point in my depression where I cry when I see people happy. Seeing anyone with loving and supportive families. Seeing kids having fun with their friends. Even seeing pet owners take such good care of their dogs and cats. I just get so choked up no matter where I am.I try to stay positive and loving to those I care about. I understand you get what you put out into the world - so I try to maintain that mindset. But when no love or care comes back in my direction, I just get so hurt, so devastated? It makes me feel so alone. It’s like there’s an abundance of love in the world, just not for me.I’ve been job hunting for the last few months and find myself in a limbo - I’m overqualified for my current role but don’t have the “minimum requirements” for the next step. I’m currently a coordinator and want to apply for manager roles but I keep facing this issue. I really don’t want to leave my job that treats me pretty well, just to be in a new place of employment with the same pay but shittier environment. But I know I won’t be promoted at my current shop, when going up a role somewhere else can quite literally double my income. (For context I’m in film advertising).How do you bridge the gap on your resume and cover letter when applying for roles that are (on paper) above your qualifications? How do you “stand out” when competing with people that DO have the qualifications?. I’ve been a print account coordinator for almost two years now. At my shop we have three account execs, three project managers, and three coordinators. I don’t believe I have any room to grow or be promoted (they hired two project managers shortly after I started. But I’ve been a coordinator the longest out of the three). My responsibilities aren’t stressful and are muscle memory at this point. I also take on some of the extra work the managers have since they’re swamped. I believe I have the skills but I’m lost on what to do next, especially since entertainment print feels super niche (compared to socials and AV). I know the job market is bad right now and I won’t leave unless I have another job secured but I was hoping for suggestions on next steps? People who started as account coordinators - what did you pursue afterwards?. 25, 4’11, 115lbsjust as the title says - my lower half is pretty muscular and toned. I take the stairs a lot during work and constantly wear heels/platforms. I also did a lot of long distance running in high school, and even if I wasn’t very active - it was always easy to go back to having strong legs. (think prominent calf muscles, strong thighs, slightly lifted butt) my upper half… definitely more fat than muscle. I started indoor bouldering last year to maybe even it out and feel a lot stronger, but it’s all covered by SO MUCH fat!!! and i feel like i just look more bulky. my upper back fat definitely looks like it weighs me down. it’s weird because when i’m wearing a sweater with a skirt / shorts, i look so fit lol. and then when i wear pants and a crop top, i look so heavy. the reason i also included bra size was to see if anyone with bigger boobs also has difficulty losing upper body fat? idkRn i’m going to the gym 3-5 times a week (depending if I work late) and I usually warm up on stair master, use the machines (changes depending if it’s push, pull, or leg day), and try to end on the treadmill for 15min. But i do the seated row for every gym session. i’m at the gym for like 2 hours each time i go. also try to do pilates once a week but it’s more like once every two weeks rn. i’m staying around 1200-1500 calories, focusing on eating as much protein as possible but usually only get around 60-70g a day. if anyone was in a similar situation or has any advice, please share! :( really hating how my upper body looksEDIT: took out my bra size because already got creepy DMs from old pervs lurking on this subreddit lmao men ruin everything man. 25 years old. I have $250,000 in private student loans and a $53,000 salary. First generation college grad in my family, the first to get my bachelors. But I got it in a useless degree. - college ave student servicing - multiple private loans (I didn’t understand fully how to take them out, it was just easy to do on College Ave website as a teenager. As first gen, didn’t have a lot of financial literacy or adults to help me understand the repercussions of student loans :/) - interest rates range from 8% - 11% - I’ve been on forbearance hardship for the last year - April 2023 was the first month where I was required make a full payment because it finally ran out- minimum monthly payment is $4100. was originally $3600 when i graduated in 2020, but then covid and payments pause and i was unemployed until 2022 so i was on hardship forbearance… yeah all bad choices ahhhhh - mom is my co-signer (she has around 180k salary) what’s going on in my head rn: - refinance the total amount (or at least the two biggest loans, which would be $178k combined) as soon as possible- i have 720 credit, but i’ve never made any full student loan payments until literally this month. how much will this effect my chances?- my mom will co-sign again (if possible with the lender, since she was co-signed to my original loans that had no payments made.) she does have better credit history and consistent payments in other things tho. will not be able to help make payments, she’s currently paying her mortgage at around $5000/month- i only have enough money for one more full monthly payment… and that’s including with the next two upcoming paychecks. after all my other expenses i’ll probably be left with… $150-200 in my account, assuming i don’t spend money on ANYTHING else)- applying for jobs with a higher salary (currently work as an account coordinator in an ad agency. i do love it and can see a lot growth/potential, but really need better pay NOW and all) paycheck amount after taxes- $1700ish, but i do a lot of OT so ranges from $1700-1900 (so from $3400-3800/month) my other monthly payments - $1000 for rent + utilities - $150 car insurance - $200 gas, food, my two cats really struggling here and just trying to figure out what all my options or what little things i can do to help :(. Hi everyone, I’m currently an account coordinator and have been at my agency for a year. I’ve come to really love and enjoy where I’m at, especially since my agency is very supporting in helping me develop new skills if I chose to grow into a different role. Unfortunately, very suddenly I was hit with some financial hardships. Will literally be pinching pennies for the next few months to years. Was wondering if anyone successfully transitioned from an accounts role to something outside of advertising - preferably one with a higher pay (tech? film studios? healthcare?) Would really love any insight if you have any! Thank you :). Hi guys, I’ve used a lot of different Korean skincare products over the last 3-4 years (shiseido, snail mucin, soon jung, etc) but found all these products stopped being effective after a few months. Currently, I’m using the Neutrogena water gel and hyalauronic acid serum - wanted to know if there were any Korean (or any Asian) alternatives similar to these Neutrogena ones? I’ve heard good things about Tatcha, but not 100% sure if I can justify that price.Hi everyone, would love some advice - I’ve been working at an ad agency/ trailer house as a coordinator since March. Love the people, great benefits and work environment etc. But I really want to explore my options more and try working for a studio and was thinking of applying now (not quitting my job of course). I graduated in 2020 and spent the duration of covid doing PA jobs and random gigs here and there. Where I’m at now is the first full time position I’ve had since I graduated college (yay for grownup jobs). I think I’m just a bit nervous because we’re approaching (or already in) a recession? It’s safe to stay at a job I’m comfortable in and know I can stay at for longterm / I’m scared of being let go at a major studio since I’d be a new hire and the first one dismissed in company budget cuts. Would love any insight or words of wisdom!!! Is the film industry stable enough for job changes right now??? AHHHH Thanks everyone :).
    TLDR I like Load but not Reload.I fucking love Load. I will, with absolutely no shame in my heart whatsoever, consider it a top 3 Metallica album. I'm not saying that in the shallow "HoT TAke: DaE UnPopULaR OpInIOn?" sense, it just works for me. Sure, its not as complex musically as their earlier stuff, but it still has some catchy-ass riffs, has some of James' most beautiful vocal work, and (barring a couple of songs) has some of the band's best lyrics. Now, when it comes to Reload... nah. I used to be obsessed with the album, but then I woke up one day and stopped caring for it. I do still like 4 songs from the album (Unforgiven II, Prince Charming, Where the Wild Things Are, and Fixxxer), but everything else sounds the way cardboard tastes. And its pretty obvious when you consider that the songs on the album are literally just the songs that didn't make it on Load (why would you make an entire album full of songs that you didn't even want on the first one?).Either way, I can understand why the Loads aren't considered to be Metallica's best work, as the albums simply didn't have the sound that made the band famous. Metallica was made famous for their dynamic, energetic, punk-like feel while the Loads had a slower, 70s-blues-rock type feel. Its perfectly okay for people to not like it, as it was written by a band called METALlica, not Bluestallica. But, like I said, it just works for me.Aaaand that's just my take :). In rap music, a diss track is a song written in order to make fun (or just straight up attack) another artist, whether as part of a feud or just for the sake of trash-talking another artist. I'm wondering if metal bands have any equivalents.I've tried the modern warfare pack for Flan's mod, but I gave up on it because it was too easy, so I'm looking for something else.In other words, I'm looking for a mod that does one or more of the following:1. Has a system built on progression so I'm not using the most powerful weapons in the mod on night one.2. Has drawbacks to using guns. The drawbacks can be something like innacuracy when compared to vanilla weapons or needing to dump a mag or two into a zombie before killing it.3. Spawns enemies with guns.4. Forbids guns from working on certain enemies. For example, the guns from the Flan's mod modern warfare weapons pack did not work on twilight forest bosses.Mine would have to be the Flak Cannon....But if we're including mods, it would be the flamethrower from UT2004's Ballistic Weapons mod.my fav subgenre is thrash metal but I'm also like doom/sludge/stoner metal.Selling exclusively as a bundle.

Per the title, I'm trying to build the balls-off-the-walls most powerful Linux gaming PC possible. What's a good CPU, GPU, and motherboard combination that will provide the best possible performance while also being linux-compatible?I'm planning on using either Linux Mint or Fedora. I'm already familiar with Mint but I'm considering switching to Fedora.Thinking about the future makes me want to puke. Why can't shit just make sense?. For me, its Lulu by Lou Reed and Metallica. I love it because its dark, abstract, and funny. It makes me laugh because of how hilariously bad it is while also making me feel vulnerable and uncomfortable. There aren't many works of art that can do that. Lou Reed used his dying breath to confuse Metallica fans, and I love him for it.I even like it more than St. Anger. Unlike St. Anger, which was an attempt to copy the sounds that were trendy at the time, Lulu was a legitimate attempt to create something new.All this being said, I don't blame people for hating it.I live in Florida and the only thing here that even comes close (as far as I know) is the monorail to Disney.I've gone to Minnesota for vacation a few times, and I remember taking a bus to the Mall of America and taking a train to and from a baseball stadium, but idk if that's "good" public transport or if that's just a tourist thing.Other than that... Idk. I hate living in Florida and I'm trying to find a place where a car-free lifestyle would be easier to live.A couple of months ago, my car was rear-ended by a commercial vehicle. Common sense would dictate that the company who hit my car (and probably has more money than I) would pay for the damages through their insurance, right?I took my car to the shop, and then my insurance company called and declared that my car was totaled. Now I have to choose between getting the car repaired out-of-pocket, buying a new one, or driving a car with a trunk busted open. All for an accident that wasn't my fault.The car industry is pure evil. Fuck this shit.Update (although idk if anyone gives a shit): I have to get a new car.Fav metal albums: Ride the Lightning by Metallica, Show No Mercy by Slayer, Crippled Lucifer by Burning Witch, Blood Lust by Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats, Houdini by Melvins, System of a Down's self-titled albumFav non-metal albums: Load by Metallica, The Mollusk by Ween, GodWeenSatan by Ween, A Saucerful Of Secrets by Pink Floyd, Social Distortion's self-titled album, Famous Monsters by Misfits, Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill by Grouper, Born in the U.S.A by Bruce Springsteen.What I mean by that is, if I haven't read the Jedi Academy books, will I still understand the story of the game? I haven't read any post-ROTJ EU story except for Heir to the Empire.I love the Clone Wars cartoon, but I've heard plenty of people say that the EU Clone Wars is better, so I want to see for myself if it's true.My laptop is dual-booted with windows 11 and Linux Mint CinnamonI first noticed the issue yesterday when using Windows 11. I was typing, and all of a sudden it stopped typing. Whenever I tried typing some more it would open random shortcuts. I tried seeing if sticky keys were on, and they weren't. I tried seeing if my keyboard's driver was up-to-date in device management, and sure enough it was. I tried using the on-screen keyboard and it did the same exact thing as my physical keyboard. I did have a notification telling me to restart because my firmware needed to be updated, but when I restarted, I would get the same issue!So at first I thought it was just a Windows 11 issue, but now Linux Mint is having the same problem!Keep in mind that this happens at random. It's working right now, but it wasn't working last night. Any help would be appreciated!. I've listened to everything by the Misfits at this point so don't recommend them.Hello everyone, I am currently a college student majoring in Biology. I've always thought that a job at sea would be something that would suit me, so I'm considering looking towards NOAA for a career after I get done with school.However, I am confused as to whether or not I must enlist in the NOAA corps in order to take up a research position on a NOAA ship. For personal reasons, I'm not interested in being in a uniformed service, and I've read conflicting information regarding this. I've read that the NOAA Corps ARE the researchers aboard NOAA ships, and I've read that they simply make sure that the research happens. Any clarification would be appreciated.I read Heir to the Empire - and some of y'all are going to want to kill me for saying this - and I didn't really care for it, and I'm not interested in reading the rest of the Thrawn trilogy. At a glance, the NJO books seem more like something I would be interested in.Basically, if I don't read the Thrawn trilogy, will I be able to "Understand" the NJO books?. Example songs[Lou Reed and Metallica - Pumping Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLQK1gjXWeQ&t=275s)[The entirety of Speak English or Die by S.O.D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhzLM_zR8Jo)[Misfits - Helena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0om_x-PpWqg) (I know Misfits aren't a metal band but this song is close enough IMO)As you can tell I'm more into the thrash metal side of things but I also like sludge and doom metal.By "Silver Surfer", I'm referring to the Earth-616 Norrin Radd Silver Surfer, so no Worthy Surfer or Rise of the Silver Surfer Silver Surfer. For Star Wars, Characters from either canon or the Star Wars EU count. Let's also say that Surfer is bloodlusted and determined to kill his opponent, and that the Star Wars character in question must fight alone. No weapons are allowed except for hand weapons (lightsabers, blasters, amphistaffs, etc. So basically, no ships or Death Stars allowed).Good afternoon everyone.I am currently a college student majoring in biology (regular biology, not marine biology), but i've always thought that a job aboard a ship would suit me well and I've been looking into the maritime industry a lot recently. Anybody know of any specific maritime jobs or companies that might be what I'm looking for?. I'm particularly looking for some in the thrash metal side of things but I also like sludge/doom/stoner metal.example songs:[Metal Storm/Face the Slayer - Slayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI7ElD61o68&t=63s)[The Four Horsemen - Metallica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKOhVSERS8)[Angel Witch - Angel Witch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oZpW3wyiWI). Asked the same question on the Metallica sub, so I thought I'd ask here. My favorite genres in order from favorite to least favorite are..Thrash MetalPunk RockStoner MetalPsychedelic classic rockClassical*Jazz90s rapReggae*by "classical", I'm also including the baroque and romantic eras. Some of you music theorists are probably gonna scream at me telling me there's a difference, but most people don't realize that.My favorite non-thrash metal genres, in order from favorite to least favorite (but still love, mind you), are...Punk rockStoner metalPsychedelic rockClassical*Jazz90s rapReggae*by "Classical", I also mean the baroque and romantic eras. I know there's a difference between the three, but most people don't.I downloaded both the [MMRT-v2.5.zip](https://MMRT-v2.5.zip) and the source code zip off of the MMRT releases page on github. I tried installing both as modules through the Magisk app, and in both instances I was met with the "! Unzip error" message.Next, I tried installing it through recovery mode by ADB sideloading it. First I tried sideloading the [MMRT-v2.5.zip](https://MMRT-v2.5.zip), and received the error message "Error: please install or upgrade Magisk". I very obviously DO have Magisk, and it is up to date. When I go back to the app, it says that the version installed is 26.1, and that the latest version available is 26.1, so I don't know why I received that message.I tried sideloading the source code zip, and received the error message "ERROR: recovery: Failed to find update binary META-INF/com/google/android/update-binary".Lastly, and even though I already knew it wasn't going to work, I tried sideloading the source code tar.gz, which just caused my phone to reboot into recovery.Any help would be appreciated.Just asking out of curiosity. It seems that in most interactions between Calvin and Hobbes, Calvin ends up learning a lesson.Just a quick thought.Not asking like its a bad thing, but I'm kinda curious to know how much star wars media out there has swearing in it.Reason I ask is because I was reading Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void and came across the line "Yeah, well, this bitch is a je'daii". Lowkey had to make sure I read that right.If "fuck" ever gets said in Star Wars, my life will be complete.Also, for those of you who say "bitch isn't a swear word, it means a female dog!" they knew what they were doing.Reason why I ask is because the intro to Fade to Black kinda sounds like Goodbye Blue Sky, the intro to Call of Ktulu kinda sounds like Hey You, and the riff to Thorn Within kinda sounds like Lucifer Sam.
    I really need to add some music to my playlist. Thank you. I have been told by both friends and family that they are afraid to approach me with anything serious because of how I react a lot. Apparently there have been times multiple people have kept me in the dark about certain things to prevent me from lashing out. They also said that they don’t like arguing with me because instead of disagreeing respectfully, I make it personal and try to hurt their feelings. I’ve had this issue ever since I was about 12, where when someone disagrees with me, I take it as a personal attack. I also feel like people are talking down to me or acting like I’m stupid when they don’t agree with what I’m saying. There have also been multiple instances where multiple people have had to tell me what I’m upset about is no big deal and I was extremely angry for nothing, even though it truly felt like I had been personally wronged or targeted in some way. I guess I just don’t see how certain people don’t see how what they said wouldn’t be taken as offensive or hurtful, and when I try to explain why I’m hurt it just comes out in explosions and rage.My partner is very depressed and I’m so worried for them. I want to be able to help them but I’m worried for their personal safety. They don’t want to go to a hospital, but I’m almost to the point of calling someone anyway. They have a history of pushing people away and self harming in various ways. They have an issue with drinking too much when they get like this. I just want advice on how I could possibly approach them and comfort them before jumping the gun and calling 911.If someone you know was diagnosed with BPD after you met them or way later in life, were there signs you noticed before?. Every time I feel better about something it seems like multiple new issues appear out of nowhere and it’s 10x worse. It’s almost like cutting a hydra’s head off and I’m so exhausted. Anything and everything triggers my obsessions and compulsions.I thought it was completely normal to feel extreme rage instead of just mild annoyance towards things. I would get into a slight disagreement with a friend or loved one and I would feel as though they insulted my entire being/character just by saying I was wrong. I would have intense mood swings within seconds or I would physically feel myself switch if a loved one had an off tone while speaking to me. I’ve been told by my friends that I get way too angry over mundane things but it’s also like I don’t see how no one else finds it that rage inducing? Why don’t you care that this person practically insulted your entire existence with their words? I also thought that being hyper sexual was just a part of being young, but I was extreme. I thought everything was sexual and I would turn anything and everything sexual because I was so desperate for physical closeness and intimacy with another person. I believed acting super sexually and just trying to hook up with people anytime something bad happened to me was just a normal coping mechanism. There were so many times in high school when a friend would tell me their parents were being annoying and I would immediately go to the extreme and curse their parents for “wronging” my dear friend.I really need some agonizing, depressing music. Thank you!. I can’t remember stuff that happened a day ago. During school, I pretty much block everything out until break and then I can’t remember what happened all school year. What is wrong with me?. I absolutely adore Diavolo as a villain. I love the whole Diavolo/Doppio dynamic and how eerie the telephone type communication they do is. It’s also like a demonic possession as well with all the creepy sounds and screeching. I just love JJBA’s take on multiple personalities/identities.I’ll be in class or at a football game and I’ll think wow this is super fun and interesting, if I didn’t have OCD I would be really enjoying myself and just having a normal fun time.I feel like every relationship I’ve had has been ruined by my own issues and disorder. It causes me to lash out and isolate myself. I hate living like this. It feels like I am my own prison.The fucking audacity. This is so incredibly frustrating. I know I shouldn’t be snooping at his page, but he posts stuff like “oh my ex fucked me up and now I can’t trust anyone who shows me interest” WHILE he’s fucking dating someone. He was always such a narcissist. He had sex with a 14 year old while he was 17 and when I disliked that, I was the crazy, abusive one. He goes around telling people I have BPD (which I don’t, I’ve never been diagnosed with it.) and now people I don’t even know have a vendetta against me. He says I took advantage of him for his money, BUT I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD ALL THE MONEY! HE USED MY MONEY AND BRAGGED TO OTHER GIRLS THAT HE SPENT 200 DOLLARS ON ME DURING A FANCY DATE BUT I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE HE BLEW ALL OF HIS FUCKING MONEY ON WEED! He would take all of my money from work and buy himself drugs. He also never hangs around people his own fucking age. He lives with a high schooler and he’s 19. The amount of times I was humiliated by him and it was all turned on me is insane. I fucking hate him.I feel unlovable now. I don’t know why any man in their right mind would want to be with me or touch me. I always wanted sex to be a private, intimate thing and now it’s all ruined. I feel so used up. I never should have trusted him.My first semester of college was a mess. My three year relationship ended and I was distraught. I met a guy at school and we ended up sleeping together and eventually dating. Over the course of a few months, he turned out to be extremely abusive and manipulative. I learned things about him through other people. He turned out to have a really bad history with relationships. He made me do so many humiliating things and if I didn’t, he would physically harm me or threaten me. He would drag me around by the hair and throat. He would force me to take his anxiety medication and get me drunk. There were times where we experimented sexually with things such as voyeurism and an attempt at a threesome that didn’t really go anywhere. I don’t judge anyone who enjoys those things, I just know they’re not for me. I feel so dirty and ashamed. There were many times I would tell him I was leaving him and he would rape me. He would break into my room and assault me. He would follow me in his car and threaten to kill himself. I know I can’t blame him for it all, but I just thought I was better than this. I never wanted to be someone who got drunk or high every day and just acted so gross. I just want to take it all back. I don’t want to be unlovable. I feel like no one is ever going to want to touch me.Did anyone else’s NParent do this 24/7? My NMom did this 24/7 while I was growing up when she would get unhappy with me (which was all the time). Now, she’s saying she’s going to cancel a surgery I’ve needed for years because she’s deemed me irresponsible due to the fact I couldn’t remember the doctor’s name at the top of my head.I know this has been posted a billion times but each time the comments are like, “Gallavich is the best couple!” Even though that’s an extremely popular opinion lol.Apologies if this has been posted before but I think it’s unfair that Fiona gets shat on immensely for being a “hoe” and cheating on someone but Lip has done pretty much the same thing. He had sex with Mandy while she had a boyfriend and fucked Tami’s sister. He also sleeps around. He had sex with Mandy in the hopes of getting her pregnant without telling her first and that’s fine? I just think it’s dumb. I know this has been asked a few times but I’m curious. I personally really relate to Ian.That’s all. I can’t fucking stand her. Especially with the whole “we will fuck you up” bullshit. Ughhh. Also, how come she gets to fire Lip for absolutely no reason other than Tami is upset? Lip never abused her or anything, he just didn’t want to move. How the fuck is that worthy of being fired? God. I’ve always struggled with weight loss and feeling insecure. Did getting a reduction help with exercise and losing weight on general?. I have sweatshirts I wear that are like 3XL just because it makes me feel safer and smaller and a tad bit more secure.I’m just wondering where this started for other people. I was 16.
    I know how it ends. Why am I even posting here? We are all in the same sinking boat.I can't tell the difference between the two from the website. Anyone have any personal experience?. I've got a solid winter bag (Outdoor Vitals 15° mummy bag, and a 40° Enlightened Equipment top quilt. I'm thinking that might be too much for mid summer and I'm considering getting a bag liner to use as a top sheet. Anyone have any experience doing that?Edit: it will probably be in the 60s overnight. How do you go about finding campsitess? I'm located in Virginia. Are there any websites you recommend? Where do you find information on the restrictions around campfires etc?I've only recently gotten into hammock camping and I'd like to try some local soloing before going to far afield.Thanks. So I'm new to kayaking and I'd like to extend my time on the water. What and how is everyone packing food for your time out paddling?. I am looking at getting my next kayak. I'm looking at the Pungo 120 or the Axis 12. Anyone have any experience with either or a different recommendation? It will be mostly on the Rappahannock and the local reservoirs. (This would be on the secondary market). I am looking to get some major work done on my house. I currently have a 30 year fixed with 20 years left. Interest rate of 4.25. Fairly limited overall debt.I'm curious to hear the arguments for either scenario.Thanks for your time. Are there any Danish speakers in the Fredericksburg area? I'm in the process of trying to learn and would enjoy a chance to learn/speak some Danish.Tak.
    *memory loss years of depression & anxiety have had such a detrimental impact on my brain that I struggle to recall even the simplest things. I no longer read books, as I tend to forget what I've just read as soon as I finish a page. traumatic experiences and the reasons for my tears are a blur in my memory. I can't seem to recall any happy memories that bring me joy, thus I often feel like I'm living in a simulation, leaving me numb. I am alive but it doesn't feel like im really living.(edit: thank you everyone for sharing your personal experiences. I appreciate y'all a lot :’) the memory loss from depression is not talked about enough. I hope this post can make you feel less alone, knowing that there are others who are experiencing the same things and can understand your feelings. you are not alone.). music is literally my lifesaver, but most of the time, I find myself skipping songs because I can't find peace… i can't do this anymore.
    I’ve been depressed forever it feels like. I can’t remember a time I was genuinely happy in my life. And it really is such a mindfuck to me that the majority of the people in the world will never feel this way. Yes, a lot of people deal with depression but just as many (more in reality) don’t deal with it and never will. The idea of waking up in the morning clear-headed, with energy, motivation, and dare I say excitement for the day ahead is unbelievable to me. And that’s just a normal experience for so many. They have no idea how lucky they are.Hi all, I’m a 22 year old female who is relatively new to the minimalist lifestyle. I was raised in a family with a very capitalist, wealth and item hoarding mindset so it’s taken years to undo a lot of that brainwashing and the damage it inflicted. My spending habits are still nowhere near what they should be, although they are much better than before. I am slowly working month by month to identify what is essential in my home, what possessions I truly need and couldn’t live without. I’ve been selling and donating a lot of the useless stuff I thought was essential that I accumulated over the years. But there’s just a few areas I’m struggling with…I’ve always been drawn to things that are pleasing to the eye. I have an affinity for art, not just paintings but sculptures, as well as natural art like crystals and geodes. I don’t have any collected currently because I only have the desire to collect pieces that are collectors pieces (many of which are not in my current budget). Not the typical crystal you can find in the spiritual store down the street. I feel the same way about jewelry and any art i buy. I’m not keen on purchasing prints (although I see their value and respect it). I would much rather save and buy an original piece that I know will not only last me and my future children for however long it’s cared for, but also will hopefully not decrease in value. I don’t have many originals as of right now, but it is something I long for in the future. The same goes for jewelry. I spend an embarrassing amount of time researching gems and precious metals and scrolling through countless jewelers catalogues dreaming about one day wearing such luscious rocks on my neck or my fingers. I currently have very little jewelry because I refuse to buy any that won’t last me a significant amount of time without tarnishing or decreasing in value rapidly which typically is fine jewelry. It’s hard for me to rationalize and understand why I still desire all these frivolous yet beautiful items even though in almost every other aspect of my life (my wardrobe, the food I eat, the possessions I own) I am pretty minimalistic and hate clutter and excess. Why are we as humans so drawn to glittery rocks and precious metals? And why is it so hard for me to stop wanting those things.Hi all! I am a 22 year old female who has had HS since I had puberty, which I got early around 10. My family was abusive and communication was unfortunately not safe so I couldn’t tell my parents about my flares, which ended up leaving me with some nasty scars :/. I’m stage 2 in my left groin/thighs, stage 1 on the right, and just recently got a super minor flare for the first time under my breast. It was so small it was almost unrecognizable as an HS flare, I thought it was an ingrown hair but over the course of a week or so it slowly grew and turned into one of those classic tender, warm HS lumps, and of course as soon as my Doc put me on Bactrim it almost immediately went away. Just leaving that trademark HS dark spot where it once was. I’m working super hard on fixing my diet and hygiene in order to stop this terrible disease from progressing.I’ve recently started using Hibiclens (an antiseptic skin cleanser) every day in the shower in my problem areas and am looking into other antibacterial cleansing washes like this. Does anyone have any suggestions? Also, has anyone noticed a big difference in their flares with increasing the number of showers you take per day? I mean anything more than one. I tend to sweat a lot, mainly under my underarms (so I find it weird I don’t flare here at all), but also in my groin area and I was wondering if taking a second shower at night might help kill even more bacteria and stop the chance of flares. Any thoughts, experiences, anecdotes are welcome! As well as any product or lifestyle changes that have helped you. Thanks for reading.My thought process: The further we develop technologies such as AI surveillance, police robo-dogs, and amazing forensic capabilities, the harder it will be for criminals to succeed. Think about it, it’s already happening before our very eyes. Before, you could drive around with a suspended license, have expired or stolen tags, and no insurance and the police wouldn’t know. Not only do they have computers and databases to run all that information now, they don’t even have to do it manually. They have a camera on their dashboard with AI technology that runs license plates as they pass, while cross referencing them to police and government databases. If a hit comes back for anything I mentioned above, it pops up. Easy as that. Another example is how cameras are literally everywhere. Not even just traffic cameras, police and government surveillance cameras, there is Ring doorbell cameras everywhere and the number of people putting cameras on their property is growing everyday. You can’t even speed in a work zone without getting detected, and not by a real live person, but by a camera. They send the ticket in the mail with a picture of you speeding. Think about the Idaho Four, Bryan Kohberger’s car was caught fleeing the scene on a convenience store’s camera. This video of the car helped them immensely in the search to catch him. Police are now rolling out robo-dogs in New York City that have GPS trackers for stolen cars. These “Digi-Dogs” will also be deployed in risky hostage situations. They are also rolling out a cone-shaped autonomous security robot that will be deployed in the Times Square Subway Station. And this is only the beginning. What are your thoughts? Are you for all of this surveillance technology, and police robotics? Do you think it is necessary and will benefit society or do you think the resources should be spent elsewhere?. Hi all, yesterday I bought a used 2020 Kia Optima (Certified pre owned) at a Kia dealership. It already comes with the remainder of the 3 other warranties (3 year/36,000, 5 year/50,000, 10 year/100,000) and the 3 year already passed so he offered to extend the full bumper to bumper coverage to the 10 year/100,000 miles for me at the price of 2,500$. It’s strange because this does not seem to be a set price based on my research online. People on this subreddit and others have been quoted more like 3-4,000$ for this same plan and then after rejecting it the manager tells them they can just pay 1500$. Has anyone had a different amount quoted to them and successfully negotiated it down? I’m a bit nervous to do that/ don’t know how to go about it. But the main topic of this post is to hear anyone’s experiences with not only this particular warranty but other Kia warranties. Also it would be great to hear how your experience with your Kia has been. Has it been reliable? Have you had to go in for repairs at all? Thanks for reading.I was just told this morning at the dosing window by the nurses that soon time slots will be implemented by the clinic (there were signs hanging on everywhere indicating the same as well). I asked what time slots were and they said they themselves had limited information but essentially everyone at the clinic will be assigned a time slot they can come in at. So no more being able to choose between 6 am and 10 am. It will most likely be a 10-15 min slot I’m guessing. I was shocked by this, it seems ludicrous to me that they will be able to successfully work around everyone’s schedules or maybe they just won’t give a shit. But does anyone else’s clinic have these and if so did they work successfully or did it reek chaos?. I’ll be turning 22 in a few days and I’ve been reflecting on how I’m growing into an “adult” and how I’m maturing and I realized how much better I’ve become at small talk and how much more willingly i engage in it. I think it’s because I’ve come to realize how important human connection is not only for health but just for life and moving about the world. You need other people. You can’t climb to the top by yourself. It’s crazy to me because I used to hate all small talk, I despised it. I’m pretty introverted and used to be very overprotective of my privacy, which I still am more than most, but now I don’t mind giving a little of myself to connect. I have come to believe that anyone in your life you see on a semi regular basis you should have some type of rapport with. An example could be the barista at your coffee shop you frequent, or a personal example is my maintenance man. I live in a huge apartment building and I started making small talk with this maintenance man and now he is like a Grandfather figure to me. He has helped me in some of the most difficult situations I’ve been in, when I’ve been sick, car issues and accidents, whatever I need he’s been there. And I would’ve missed out on such an amazing human in my life if I never said hello ya know? I’m not saying every time you make small talk will turn out like that but I think you may be able to hear my message. However I want to hear your thoughts now that you’ve read mine.I find myself thinking about this quite often and it makes me extremely sad. I feel like I would be thriving right now instead of drowning in my own mind.Hi all, I am a 21 year old woman who has never worn foundation, concealer, powder or any skin makeup. I only know how to really do eyeliner and mascara (nothing to brag about I know), but would like to start getting into a light foundation, learning how to contour & outline my face, as well as highlight my features. I’ve been watching lots of tutorials on YouTube and doing research online on different foundations but I’m going to be honest… there’s so many & it’s a bit overwhelming to know which one to choose! I was hoping I could ask one of the employees at a beauty store like Sephora for help because they are in person with me, can see my skin and hopefully have some knowledge about foundations. However my question is, are all the employees who work there knowledgeable about this type of thing and how do you know who to ask (if it even is acceptable)? I have slight social anxiety and tend to feel like I’m bothering employees in stores because they already have so much on their plate (unless I know this is a specific part of their job to help me). Also, I would love to hear everyone’s favorite foundations, concealers, powders etc & least favorites too. I am mixed, African American and Italian so I believe my skin is olive toned? I’ve tried to identify my undertones and all but I always seem to be so unsure. So if any mixed, light skin ladies have any good recommendations that would be cool too! Thanks everyone for reading.I have almost never had a dish at a fancy restaurant that I’ve enjoyed. Oftentimes too many clashing ingredients are used which ruins the underlying flavor of the dish for me. I have found that simple restaurants who serve simple foods have been consistently delicious. It’s a shame because I love the aura and vibe of most fancy restaurants and can really appreciate the beautiful plating of the food, but the taste always kills it for me.Hi all! I am adopting a wonderfully sweet 1 year old male shelter cat this week. He was just neutered a couple days ago so he will be almost a week into his neuter when I pick him up which is something to take into account. My resident kitten is a male 6 month old Persian/Munchkin mix who will not be neutered until the middle of next month. His disposition is extremely sweet, affectionate, he loves to play and is quite energetic. However he is terrified of anyone other than me (meaning strangers) he runs and hides until they leave (i’m trying to work on this). This makes me think he may be very scared with this new cat coming in the house and I want to make it as non stressful as possible for my baby and my new cat. The shelter cat is one of the calmest, sweetest cats i’ve ever met. He let me hold him and basically claimed me right away. Jumped up on my lap and wanted to snuggle right until I left, the ladies at the shelter said he is always super calm, they have never seen him get hyper or mean or anything, he’s the chillest cat. He has a brother who he came into the shelter with that he is friendly with but not bonded to, so his brother actually got adopted before him. But, I still was able to meet his brother and his brother was basically the more outgoing version of the cat I’m adopting. Where you have to pick up or coax the one i’m adopting, and then he’s friendly and cuddly, the brother just comes right up to you and tries to steal all the love and attention. This makes me think he might be okay around my boy kitten because he has had a brother and is used to cohabitation? Or is that not how it works. My plan is to keep the new cat in my bedroom with the door closed and do the whole introducing ritual. I’ve read online you keep them separated and feed them on opposite sides of the door, inching the bowls closer and closer so they associate each other with mealtimes (positive!). Online it says when they start showing interest in meeting each other, sniffing under the door, pawing under, meowing to get out then you can either let them out or put up a screen between them first so they can eye each other up for a day or two and sniff without any actual contact. My question is do you think the screen door/tall baby gate is necessary before real physical contact? Or if they’re showing interest behind closed doors in meeting one another can i skip that? I’m also a little worried about how I will be able to spend time with both of them without the other feeling lonely or jealous. I live in a decent sized one bedroom apartment but the way it is laid out is so the new cat will be in the bedroom with the door closed and my resident kitten will be out in the common area having access to the kitchen , living room and bathroom like he usually does. However online it says to eventually site swap them and I don’t think my resident kitten is going to like being shut in the bedroom without me in there with him at all. I can just tell he is going to cry and freak out the second i shut the door, especially if the new cat is out there with me. Right now I’m just planning on winging it and trying to switch from bedroom to common area as frequently as possible and try to give them as much equal attention as possible but i just know that every time i go in the bedroom to spend time with the new cat my resident kitten is going to cry for me. Anyways, thank you for reading this long ass post and any advice based on the information i gave above is so greatly appreciated. Also, any anecdotes you have about introducing your cats to one another would also be much appreciated thank you!. Hi all, I am on a methadone maintenance program where I dose every single day (been on for almost a year, sober from all else but marijuana). I was hoping to be able to take a trip in the coming weeks but the closer it gets to the date I set, the more anxious i am about the potential interactions with the daily methadone i take. I am a pretty experienced psychonaut, although I stopped taking any psychedelics 3 years ago (just wanted to let my mind have a break). Now I feel ready but just want to make sure I am being mindful and 100% safe. I can’t find much information online about LSD and Methadone interactions except for a study about rats that said that at low doses the Methadone lessened the effects of the LSD, and at higher doses increased the effects. I am on 80 mg daily of Methadone. Any advice or personal anecdotes you are able to give will be much appreciated, thank you.
    I hear people say to just live for yourself, do things that make you happy and to not rely on others for your worth. but what if you hate yourself completely? what if nothing makes you happy, what if your own company makes you sick and all you can do is stare in the mirror, picking apart all the physical reasons why no one will ever look at you with love in their eyes. at most, I am a passing glance, a scowl given only to be forgotten in 2 milliseconds.I've tried so hard to tell myself I'm okay with being alone, that living for family is enough but it's not. I need someone that isn't them, that isn't me, to hold me to tell me I'm not a monster, I'm not as hideous as I look and that I don't need to be anything more or less than I am.but that seems like it won't ever happen, not with the way depression has chipped away at my personality so I can't even make superficial friends let alone a romantic partner. I can't seem to hold onto people long enough before they slip away or I end up pushing them away.I hate being perceived yet I feel worthless without somebody to acknowledge my existence. I wish I meant something. I wish I was beautiful inside and out. I am filled with envy and I hate that part of me too.I just want to sleep and stay in my room until I starve. everyday I keep getting asked to come downstairs and I would honestly, but my brother and my mom are so damn hard to be around. they're both incredibly negative, self centered, and draining. my mom is worse though, she emotionally abused me during my childhood and even as she acts loving now, I can't be around her. I'm done giving her second chances.being around them always results in some argument of some kind. they don't care about what I have to say, yet they pretend to and wonder why I'm always gone. I don't want to be like them and lose my cool, but I don't know how to tell them to back off.I don't mind my dad, I love him, he's nice. but he doesn't understand. nobody truly understands so I just want to be left alone, as painful as it is.seriously, my mind is a mess. I just want to die so these thoughts of my body falling apart stop. oh, new lump? cancer. teeth hurt? possible future root canal. didn't shower right? boom, infections of all kinds just waiting to happen. the list goes on, and it's embarrassing and anxiety inducing because if one of these things happen, I will not go to the doctor because I am terrified of doctors seeing my hideous body, and I'm borderline agoraphobic. maybe full on, I haven't left my house by myself in so long I don't know.I can't do this man, I feel like I'm dying all the time already. If one more bad thing happens I'm done. shit, I've been done for a while now, I'm exhausted and my brain is filled up with anxious never-ending thoughts.my parents are home constantly. but I know, I know if they weren't here I would give in so easily to my mind. I want to destroy myself sometimes.lately, all the time.still too cowardly to directly kill myself, I'm hoping my habits do the job. If not, I'm saying fuck it and flinging myself off whatever I find. survival instincts be damned. god this is so bleak.my liver already seems messed up, so there's that. I'm scared but I can't stop. I feel conflicted. I'll starve myself, beat myself. when I'm not in bed I'm pacing around the house until my spine feels like it's going to crumble which it probably is. my body is ruined and covered in scars that'll never go away. I can never wear short sleeves or shorts again without shame.the one thing I managed to stop was cutting, but fuck do I miss it. I feel cringe saying this but the pain, the blood was such a nice distraction. the cleaning up process was therapeutic, shutting off my mind while bandaging myself with old towels because I was using up too many bandaids. I felt like I was floating outside of myself when I did it, and I'm just doing a task and that's all that mattered. everything goes quiet.the first thing my parents said when they found out this was"oh wow, so you're cutting yourself up now?""we should get scar cream to make them less noticeable." "I can tell you're right handed."I just wanted a fucking hug man. I had to stop after that, but it just meant I found other ways that were easier to hide.I hate myself so much. I want to escape all of this.and upset about the fact that I'm missing out. how do you stop sabotaging your own life? I KNOW going out would probably make me feel better, getting fresh air and all that crap.I'm just too tired. I feel like going out means I actually have to participate in life, that I have to be perceived and it's difficult because I feel like people can see through me. the ugliness, the fact that I feel like an alien to the rest of the world. and the energy it takes to make myself appear presentable, keep up conversation through brain frog and memory lossnot worth it.but god I am so lonely. so lonely I find myself rubbing my own back when I'm crying and wishing the person I hate the most wasn't comforting me. myself. I can't seem to let myself make real connections with people, so I just push them away but all I want is a hug now and I regret telling so many people no.if that makes sense? I planned yesterday to walk to this bridge near my house. I thought I'd be able to overcome walking outside since I'm able to go places with my dad, like that means I'm probably not agoraphobic right? then again, I keep my head held low and it's still an anxiety inducing experience. I don't think I've left the house by myself in over three years. I can't take public transit, I can't buy my own groceries, I can't even walk down THE GODDAMN BLOCK TO KILL MYSELF?! AAAGJSAHJDGSJSHSJSBI feel like a prey animal with a target on its head about to be fucking shot whenever I attempt to leave.anyways, how the hell do I get past this fear of being outside alone? I can't live like this forever.I think tomorrow I'm going. I'm in so much mental/physical pain and stress from so many things and the list just keeps growing. I can't do it.but now I'm worried if someone sees me or it fails and I end up in the hospital.what is that even like? the only thing similar I've dealt with was when I was a kid I stupidly took a bunch of pills, but they only gave me charcoal and let me go when I convinced them I was fine. I blocked out a lot. It was pretty humiliating though waiting in the hospital bed and having some doctor be like "congrats, you damaged yourself forever." I am not sure I can convince anybody I am fine this time but I really don't want to go to a hospital or talk to anyone like that doctor. I wish I could press a button and just opt out of this shit instantly.I feel like I am going to do something impulsive soon, even though I told myself I'd wait. wait for what? I don't know.doing the dishes leads to me holding a knife against my neck.brushing my teeth, which rarely happens, ends in me fantasizing about drowning myself in the sink.attempting to go for a walk brings me to the bridge outside my house.TV shows/movies/music/games/weed/art work for 20 minutes at most and even then all I can think about is how shitty I am and how shitty I feel. I can't enjoy anything as long as I am me.the guilt of hurting my dad is quickly being outweighed by my desire to leave this place.the world has gone downhill anyways. that's another thing, I can't stop thinking about all the horrible things going on, happening to people by other people.honestly why does anyone want to stay here? I just hope death is kind even to someone like me.every mirror I walk past I have to spend hours examining every flaw on my body, basically convincing and confirming with myself that I am as ugly as I seem. I've given myself eye-aches, like pain from craning my eyes back and forth to try and look at myself from every angle, if I even look fucked up from behind. what is wrong with me?because I must know how I look, even if it destroys me. If I don't, then it'd be horribly embarrassing going out and not knowing how others see me. what if I even walk ugly? that sounds ridiculous to think but it's a real thought.I can't go to the doctor/dentist/literally anywhere even if it's an emergency, because the thought of them seeing and judging my body, my face, is crippling. the biggest thing I'm ashamed of I can't even say. I'm too masculine looking, I have a chin dimple, my face is lopsided, my nose is long and has a horrible bump, my hair is a rats nest, my teeth are yellow from being too unmotivated to brush them. I mean, why bother when the rest of me sucks. who could love this?even when my parents compliment me I refuse to believe them. I had a tiny glow up I guess, but I still feel like a mutant and the way people treated me before still sticks. no matter what I do to myself, It'll never be enough and I'll always be envious of those who have it all.god, especially of those in relationships. I hate how bitter I am, but seeing couples makes my want to rip my eyes and hair out and roll around on the floor in a puddle of my own tears.I am touch starved beyond belief, like it's embarrassing to say but I fantasize about being held or having my head cradled like a baby. not even in a romantic sense, I just want to be cuddled, to have someone hold me together because I am falling apart.my dad is so nice to me and I don't deserve it. I dropped out of high school due to social anxiety and just, well bad mental health.he has let me stay inside, focus on myself, and he hasn't forced me to do anything. he doesn't berate me about getting a job like the rest of my family, doesn't say there's something wrong with me. all he wants is to help me start on little baby steps with just him, no teachers that ridicule me, no tests, just helping me learn stuff at my own pace.AND I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT. I feel so bad I feel SO BAD my throat feels like it's closing up.I don't know how to tell him that all that's going through my mind when he says those things is how I'm going to fail him and that I can't try because I don't think I'm going to be here long enough for those steps to matter.when I try to picture life after those baby steps, I just see a void of nothing.but I can't tell him this, I can't tell him his daughter doesn't want to live. my heart feels so heavy and the tears just won't stop please just make it stop I was supposed to relax after bawling my eyes out yesterday and I'm just repeating the day over and over and over again.I'm trying to stomach down a bowl of noodles right now since I haven't been eating much.every bite I have to put the bowl down and let my head hit the table.I can't stop crying I can't stop thinking about how I have nothing left how nothing makes me happy I have no one and I have to pretend and try so hard around my family and they think I'm not.my mom has said to my face multiple times "why don't you try?" I WAS trying but now it's just... I can't.I just wish things were okay I want to be okay but I never will be I can't do anything without crying. I am so weak.I know I want to kill myself, I know I'm going to in the future, whether that be in a week or months from now. but I just can't get over how terrifying it is, the finality of death. I keep going back and forth, it's torture.like, I don't want to live this life I fucking hate myself.but at the same time I'm incredibly upset and almost angry that I can't have a do-over,that my only option is ending my miserable life in favor of nothing. because I want to enjoy things still, even though I can't anymore with how messed up my brain is. there is no winning.this sucks man. I just wanted to hang myself and stupid survival instincts kicked in and now I'm sitting on the floor alone and I can't hear shit, my ears won't stop ringing. hopefully it doesn't last but ahthe consequences of my actions whoop dee doogod when will this end.
    29 (F). Mine started after a major job loss. My whole life changed in the blink of an eye.Clearly I’m gutted by the job loss but it’s to the point I don’t even care anymore - I just want to feel human again. To enjoy the taste of coffee and resonate with a song I love. To miss my friends and be excited to see them. To watch a god damn movie or TV show and laugh or cry, just actually enjoy it.Whenever I’m around people I put on a mask of faking humanity. Faking conversation. Because I can’t go around like “I actually feel nothing and don’t know how to connect.”And I used to feel so much. I loved movies and music and art.I just want to die. I can’t even watch TV and movies, I can’t focus on them and get no pleasure. How am I ever supposed to get better if I sleep the days away. But when I force myself to work out/cook/call a friend I still feel totally empty. What do I do.
    Since when I was 9. NINE years old. Not when I was a teenager. I’m 22 now.I was feeling shitty for the longest time, but didn’t know what that feeling’s called at the time. “I’m bored / tired” was what I’ve always said when someone occasionally checks on me. I’ve been bullied for a while, didn’t want to tell anyone anymore because they’ll (parents and teachers) laugh it off again. I had nobody to share my feelings to, and I’ve been to embarrassed to share it anyways. I’ve been hiding it for so long. Life at home was overall depressing too. I admit, there were some good days, but most of the time I’ve never looked forward to live another day. I guess I can put 13+ years of depressive experience in my LinkedIn profile haha. Sorry idk how to title this. I don’t remember the last time I’ve laughed the happiest laugh. I do laugh sometimes, but nothing and nobody’s made me REALLY laugh in the most carefree way. It’s been a while. I hope you guys know what I’m talking about.I didn’t do anything to them. I never gossip. I would never do anything to hurt people. But people would come from behind and stab me in the back. Why? I just wanted to be with someone I can count on. Have each other’s back. It’s so hard nowadays. Now I want to be left alone. I literally have nobody. I don’t want to be a nice person anymore 😢. Random vent of the day part 69Pretty much everyone I met irl are so fake like a black mirror episode. The most genuine people I find are the people on THIS subreddit. My town’s subreddit are riddled with fake people too. I can’t really click with anyone. I don’t care about finding a partner, I only care about finding someone who I can count on. In this day and age, finding a soulmate for me is just as possible as being able to run through a wall. And we can all collectively agree that this world is so fucked and out of control with everything. You feel like you’re on top of the world and the next minute you go back to where you came from.I’ve been hanging out with this group of people. They’re chill and all. But whenever a member is not in the room, the whole group starts talking smack about them. They were making fun of them and being a bit judgemental about what they do that’s out of the ordinary. Casually throwing in some jokes. They don’t always talk smack, just from time to time. Like whenever that missing member is mentioned in a random convo topic, they end up spending a few minutes talking about what they think about them in a not-so-nice way. Believe me, I’m the one who sits and listens. And I definitely believe that they were talking shit about me at some point. So is that the norm in a ‘true’ friendship group?. No. I’m not gonna delete myself. Instead, I’ll become this cold heartless person. I’m done with being taken advantage of. This is what happens for repeatedly fucking with a genuine human being. So goodbye forever to the old me. Congratulations bitches, well done 👏👏👏 Apologies as this is not a depression post, but idek where to put this.After all the shit I’ve been through, I somehow haven’t lost it… yet… I have no one to tell this to, so might as well share it here <3. I feel like shit every. single. day. because of how lonely I am and some other things that I won’t talk about here. When I do get to talk to someone or hang out with a group of people, I feel just as lonely as I did before. There’s literally nobody else who I can be on the same page with. It’s like I’m from a completely planet. How is it possible that I feel as lonely as hanging out with people? We both have a conversation here and there then the next minute they all disappear. I never had a close friend before. I don’t think I ever had any real friends before. Is it too much to ask to have someone irl to have a good connection with for once? ffs.And then wake up free as fuck. LinkedIn humbles me quick and hard. Knowing that I only have a fraction of experiences compared to my colleagues. I know comparison is a thief of joy, but I can’t help it ffs. I have other social media, but LinkedIn opened up a whole new door of feeling like shit 😭😭Some people could be 23 years old and have 90 years of work experience.Some people would describe me as a “chill” person and some other positive traits here and there. The thing is that I don’t believe that I’m chill. I just don’t feel anything at all. I don’t remember the last time I felt pure joy and excitement. When people would walk all over me, I don’t confront to it (bc idk how to). I’m just an emotionless type of guy. I guess I got so used to being yelled at, degraded, and excluded as a kid. Even when I showed a bit of excitement I was seen as annoying or I was told to ‘shut up’. Nothing like that, is new to me anymore.I can act as excited and happy as I can, but I don’t think I will ever feel these emotions. No kid deserves this.It’s reasonably hot and sunny today. I wish I have somebody to spend the day with. It’s really rare to come across a beautiful day like this. Sucks to be wasting it, being alone.I (20M) am in a shithole of a life right now. I can no longer keep a consistent self-care routine anymore because I don’t see a good reason to keep going. I rot in bed, waiting for each day to pass. I only get up to go to class and to my shitty minimum wage job. There is nobody to turn to, no achievements to show for. I’m literally not good at anything and I don’t have any more hobbies to enjoy. I’m not gifted in academics nor I am good with my hands. I perform a below average compared to my colleagues no matter what I do. Throughout my childhood, I was always degraded and picked on about my personality and how unfortunate I looked. It was hard for me to fit in anywhere. I kept on getting compared to the ‘better’ kids by my parents. Along with shattered optimism, this low self-esteem, socially inept era carried into my adulthood. There’s nothing in life that gives me any reason to keep going. No reason for me to be here. I’m just an extra in a movie, never the main character. I’m a bystander in my social circle. I just exist. I don’t believe I have any real friends. At everyday, things get stagnant or worse. So if my life is still gets worse in two years from now, then I’m ending it. I can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to suffer like this through to my 40s. It’s just torture at that point. Two years is generous, it’s tempting to wait until the new year. I’m surprised about how I managed to live through two decades.Thanks for reading my mindless ramblings. I’m anxious to give an update about this in two years time if I can make it for that long.I hate it when people tell me “things will get better, cheer up” when I know damn well that they’ve never hit rock bottom before. Never having to “climb up from the bottom”. Dude, you don’t deserve to say this. You don’t know what it’s like to wither in a hole of disparity. You don’t know what it’s like having nobody to turn to. Nobody to help you out of a hole you’ve fallen into. You don’t know what it’s like to be me (or the other people on here). So you should shut your privileged ass. It’s only better on your end. Am I overreacting?. I wish I could freeze time so I could take a step back and think about things. Everything’s so overwhelming. I hate it.I wish that I could go back in time and fix all of my mistakes. I’ve wasted so many years being a sad sack of potatoes because of those mistakes. Each year gets worser than the last.
    I don't know what's wrong with me, I suddenly feel the urge to jump off a building or crash my car at a high speed.I feel like I can't get high, I dont really smoke but when I do it doesnt go farther than a bit of dizzyness. Although smoking more might seem like the answer Im a bit scared of greening out if I go further. What should i do to get a nice high? 🫡. Como el titulo dice, tengo tarjeta sd de la cual intenté eliminar todos los archivos pero hubieron dos carpetas que no pude eliminar. Las dos carpetas en cuestión se crearon cuando usé la tarjeta como almacenamiento de mi celular, y son de archivos del sistema Android y la de Whatsapp. Tengo la sospecha de que la carpeta de whatsapp está corrupta ya que ni siquiera puedo abrirla para ver sus archivos, como puedo eliminarlas? o tendría que cambiar la tarjeta sd por completo?. In your opinion, what would you recommend to try weed for the first time (joint, edible, etc.)? and what should I do before, during, and after being high?. Hi everyone :) I'm trying to learn Chopin's Waltz in A minor but I can't seem to get the left hand jumps just right, I've been practicing for almost a week now and I'm feeling a little frustrated because I don't seem to have any progress at all. I'm lower-intermediate, should I choose an easier piece? or keep practicing this one?. I've been looking for a job during the later half of 2022 and all of 2023 and I finally got a call for an interview :) For context, I live in Mexico, which makes it nearly impossible to have a legal job while underage (which I am). Apart from that, I am currently studying so its important that I find a part-time job that has flexible work hours, and I finally found one at a DQ near my house.I feel so happy that I can earn some money since I'm not really wealthy, as a matter of fact my family is middle-class, but in the lower part of it. I'll be able to pay for things I need for school and will be able to pay for things I want for myself (instead of making my family buy them for me). Don't get me wrong, I love my family very much, and I am sure they love me back, my mom always tries to buy things for me with the little money she has to spare, it makes me feel kinda sad that maybe she could use that money to pay for more food or for things that'll make her job easier, but she always insists that she'll buy stuff for me and my brother. With the money from my job I will also be able to get her a present for mother's day and maybe buy some things for my gf (I like giving presents to her whenever I get money). I know that it's not sure that I'll get the job, but I'll try my best at my interview tomorrow and hopefully I can start working in these next 2 weeks.Anyways I just wanted to share that I feel very happy somewhere :D. My school's piano has the usual sustain pedal along with 2 others, one of them makes the piano a lower volume(?). I have no clue about what the third pedal does apart from moving the whole piano keys a little bit (like pressing them just enough so it doesn't sound).Any piece recommendations that you can give me? I can play beginner pieces like fur elise and moonlight sonata mvt. 1.Something that could help me practice my coordination between hands. Thank you 😁.
    I just need to vent to let this out because I’m losing it. If you’re reading this, I thank you so much. Please be kind because I’m on the edge.5 years of being very close with this person and they know so much about my struggles with depression. I got heavily triggered by something very bad that happened to me two days ago, which they know it happened. And I’m suicidal because of it. I trusted them enough to be this vulnerable about me being heavily suicidal.I was just straight up ignored for the past 24 hours.I waited several hours, tried reaching out again. More hours, again. More hours, again. Nothing.Literally said “please help, please reply, just talk to me for a few mins that’s all I’m asking, or at least tell me if there’s something going on. Just don’t ignore me, please. Anything”Not even a word back.The thing that hurts the most is that they actively chose to show me how they were ignoring me. Which my brain atm can only interpret this as “I’m reading you’re struggling and suicidal and begging for help and I’m actively choosing to show you I don’t care”.I would’ve understood a quick reply like “hey please take it easy, I’ll reach back to you when I can, okay?” we were close enough for that type of response. I can’t describe how many times my heart sank when I saw they read my messages and once again I got nothing back. I wish they wouldn’t have read my messages at all, at least don’t rub it in my face how much you’re ignoring me. This is so cruel I don’t even have the words to describe how I’m feeling.Thank for you for reading, truly.I'm forced to live with an abusive narcissist because I can't afford another place to live atm.I have a history of SH but I haven't done it for years now. They trigger me so much I drink vodka on empty stomach as fast as I can to deal with the urges of relapsing and self-harming again.Trigger me to the point of me having urges to unalive or SH. So I drink as a fucked up way of harm reduction (or to internally SH, invisible and no scars). I feel the urge to restrict even more, to feel that there is at least *one* thing left in my life that I have control of.I can't cut this person out of my life atm because I need this roof over my head (and that's part of the power they have over me).I really wasn't going to drink tonight. It would be me 2nd day without drinking. If I did, it would be 3 or 4 vodka shots max and taking it easy, not me drinking almost the entire vodka bottle to numb myself. I would have tried to eat a little something, because it would be the 1st time I would have eaten today.There's no more tears left tonight, I've cried them all for hours. Just anger left. Because it's not fair.I have a long history of abuse. My father, several men, many different types of abuse.But every time I think I'm starting to learn how to notice signs of someone who could be abusive to me (or is starting to behave this way and that person is really hurting me), I realize I don't know anything... but again, it's too late and I'm already badly hurt.People keep telling I'm the one who's wrong, blaming my disorders (not just BPD). Things like "you should've done this, you should've done that, you should've done better / be better, if your intentions are good then why didn't you do Y instead of X?" and I just feel so guilty, I feel like such a shit person, a truly bad personI'm so tired. Sometimes I feel like I know nothing, like I never learn nothing, like I'm emotionally stupid, like I keep falling into the same situations. Nothing I go through is valid. I keep getting hurt but somehow it always ends up as my fault. It makes want to withdraw for good and never meet anyone new again and just accept a lonely life once and for all.I've been trying to learn to be easier on myself, because despite my disorders I'm still a human being who might make mistakes and deals with trauma, but I don't do any mistakes or any bad shit on purpose and being blamed for that (as if it was on purpose) hurts so much.Explaining my feelings, my thoughts, my reasoning at that moment... only seems to make things worse.And the guilt I feel is so triggering it's dangerous, my default is to already guilt trip myself (this is why I'm trying to learn to be easier on myself). I can't take more people blaming me. I can't take it anymore.So tired and so hurt.Context: I had to go try get some help at the ER this weekend (not that it helped much, public health in my country is in shambles, I waited a lot of hours in a very cold place, all alone).Because I was afraid something serious was happening to my brain because the pain I felt in my head was not something I've felt before and it was unbearable, it made pass out and throw upAnd last week Monday to Friday, I went through this cycle of not eating for over 48 hours while binge drinking vodka, eating the smallest bit because I felt so weak and ill, again not eating for over 48 hours while binge drinking vodka again until I felt extremely weak and ill again. So I was truly not doing wellSo I was completely offline Saturday and Sunday, I didn't even take my phone. Monday I told him about being in the ER and the unbearable pain in my head, that I passed out and threw up from the pain, that I didn't take my phone. I hide my ED and alcohol issues from him because I do that to everyone in my life since forever.Today, he literally said "how do I even know you were really in the ER? How? If I don't even have a photo of you there?" What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What happened here? I'm so confused. I never lied to him or cheated or did anything to not be trusted.I literally only hide my ED and alcohol issues because I hide it from everyone my entire life, I don't hide anything else about myself / my life and I don't lie. I hide, I don't lie as in "no I haven't drunk, yes I've eaten" because he never asked me questions like this before, ever.That was so shocking to me that I got so confused and I can't think straight due feeling weak, crying a lot for hours, panicking for hours (I haven't had a drop of alcohol today yet). A photo? I don't know what's happening anymore and I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm all alone in this life. I'm starving and drinking myself to death and it became a lot worse after the end of March when my dog passed away in my lap.I'm worthless. In my life I keep being discarded by people so easily, like I'm worth nothing, not even the smallest amount on empathy.I fucking try my hardest to be best I can to people, I never hurt anyone on purpose, I only hurt myself. By starving and drinking. and when I do, it's all by myself so that I leave no mess to anybody, nobody even sees me drunk Why? Why am I so worthless to people. Staring at their online status.The "active now" Discord thing, rubbing in your face what they're currently doing *without you*. With a fucking TIMER showing how long! (And if you're unlucky enough, you have the other person added as a friend on Discord and realize they're with them, not you, because both their activities and timers are matching)(And yes, I realize I could just not look or simply unfriend/block them. But I'm not at that stage yet)Also, it's fucking surreal that the norm until 20ish years ago was not seeing someone for days and days... until you randomly saw them somewhere and could talk to them.I really think about how people with BPD lived and coped before internet and especially social media. I cannot begin to imagine.\*If there's anyone with BPD who's reading this and lived during those decades, I would love to read anything you have to say about your experiences!. Can't even bother with chasers / mixing the vodka with anything.There's literally nothing in my life that isn't falling apart. Surviving each day is becoming harder and harder.>Every chance, Every chance that I take I take it on the road Those kilometers and the red lights *I was always looking left and right* Oh, but *I'm always crashing* *In the same car*A song from 1977 that somehow describes how my life is doing during these last years.Here's to another fucking weekend, completely lonely and drunk. I genuinely just want out of being alive.I've became such a lonely drunk, all I do is drink by myself at home.And then I like to do this lonely party thing... I even put my phone in "do not disturb" because it's me time, not because I'm afraid I'll call or message people, I actually don't WANT to talk to people.The songs I listen sound better and I can *feel* them, the things I watch are more interesting, I dance in my room. Even if I cry (somehow I can only cry while drunk lately) while listening to old nostalgic songs that pulls me back to my shitty and traumatic childhood / teen years.I forget my worries, my anxieties, I don't think about people in my life. I'm finally in the fucking *present*. And finally enjoying myself a bit, not hating myself so much.But fuck, the things I've been doing while sober are so shitty and so stupid. My BPD is acting up like crazy and I'm playing with fire.Somehow drunk me became my safer version? The fuck.Unfortunately in my case I don't hide because they'll worry, I hide because they'll shame me and judge me and force me into recovery (without understanding the basics of it for my safety, like tapering). Because they think substance abuse is just a case of having no shame. "If you wanted to stop, you would Just stop cold turkey" kind of mentality.I feel like I'm carrying tons of weight on my shoulders all the time. But I'm a grown woman who turned 30 and I pay with my own earned money for my alcohol, my ocasional weed (I occasionally smoke in an attempt to drink less and/or feel less anxiety from withdraws), my benzos.Sneaking bottles in the house I live in, making stupid excuses as to why I bought so many, hiding bottles in my room, making an entire fucking plan to throw them out.I'm just tired. Exhausted. It's like nothing changed since I was a teen and I was starting to experiment alcohol without abusing it, but it was still wrong because I was under 18 (legal age in my country).I have nobody in my life that I can trust and admit things I go through and the things I feel, only you guys here in this sub. I wish I could talk about it in real life but it would backfire so badly I'd genuinely fear for my physical and mental health.I'm not proud of what I do and who I became. I'm fully aware of the damage I'm doing. But I'm also struggling with my ED, my chronic depression and anxiety I've had since I was a kid, PTSD, processing all the abuse I've gone through in my life (parents, men, even mental health professionals), burnout from working at least 6 days/week at least 12 hours each day for the past few years without having a full week as a work break since. I just need to able to breathe, I just need for my mind to stop for a few hours.Maybe it wouldn't feel so fucking heavy if I didn't have a history of hiding all my other issues since I was 11 every day. Nonstop for nearly 20 years. I remember early this year when my mother accused me of starting to SH when I was 11 because "I wanted attention" (that was the only moment we admitted to each other verbally what was going on with me back then. Nearly 20 years later. All this time, I never knew she knew). If I wanted attention then why did I use all my effort to hide my SH for over 8 years and then started to hurt myself in "invisible" ways. She would say the same thing now about my substance abuse. She's just an example because literally everyone in my life would judge me, shame me, and force me into recovery.I'm so exhausted.When I was a teen, I used to think that at my age now I would gain the ""right"" as a full grown human being to fail, to hurt, to do bad things because I'm in survival mode. I abuse shit because I'm in survival mode. I abuse substances to calm myself down and to not do much worse things to myself.But no... nope.I don't know where I'm going with this post and I apologize. This sub is the only place I can talk about this. I guess I just to try to express how exhausted I am.Hi, I need some advice on what do to about this. The majority of our mods had their accounts since around 2016 and we're all very upset over losing our old accounts.The server was created by a Twitch content creator we mod for, it was was shut down and every mod (including the creator, 9 people total) had accounts disabled all at the same time. We all received the same email by Discord, which claims "revenge porn":>Your account directly posted non-consensual intimate imagery (also known as revenge porn), or was involved in servers dedicated to such content. Some channels were NSFW and had VERY strict rules for those NSFW channels for the safety of our members, rules which we made very clear in the server. We even created a channel specifically to post a text listing those rules made for the NSFW channels and we were clear that breaking any of those rules would result in an instant ban.A few days prior, several mods were harassed and threatened on Twitch, Discord calls etc, by guys who were banned for breaking rules and were seriously mad about it.An important point: the mods were always available to talk (even via DMs, if needed) if a member had any kind of issue with someone, and we were always watching over the server, especially the NFSW ones. We never had anyone come to us to talk about revenge porn/non-consensual material happening or to report this issue to us. We banned many people for breaking several different rules (mostly trolling and disrespectful behavior), but never revenge porn/non-consensual material. And on our NSFW rules list, we had an item exclusively about non-consensual material, mentioning that it was strictly prohibited and how the user would be instantly banned + reported and the material instantly removed.We don't know what to do, we just want our accounts back because they're very old. We're not going to create another server after this because this made us all seriously upset and it's just not worth it.Any advice is very appreciated, thank you.I’m a 30 year old woman now.Fighting depression since 11. Trust me, I’ve tried every type of treatment and help. For many years. I tried so fucking hard to get help and to heal for several years.It only ended up with me getting to know that therapy abuse and psychiatric abuse exists. In the worst ways. Which is funny because I tried to get help in the first place to heal because everyone abused me since I was a kid, my parents, boys, men. Just to get more abuse and people abusing their power over me and my vulnerabilities.Every time I try to be kind and form a simple human connection (like just a fucking “hi! How are you?” or giving a genuine compliment or anything simple like that) just to be ignored as if I’m in invisible, like I can’t be seen or heard and I’m not there, I die more on the inside. More and more and more. It’s like people can smell the loneliness in me and everyone turns away instantly without a chance.Everybody seems to have someone. I don’t know what that feels like, at 30 years old. It never ever happened to me ever.In the back of my mind I always knew loneliness would be the thing that would end me. Even with all my other issues. Now I’m just a ghost abusing alcohol and other substances and never eating for days.Loneliness is killing me and I’m also killing myself. And to be honest I would be lying if I said I cared at this point.I’m tired of existing. It’s not like I’m worth anything or like anyone will miss me anyway. I never ever had any type of human connection, even though I always wanted it so bad since I was so young. I loathe myself. I blame myself and punish myself. I’m not a bad person. I have good things to give. Nobody gave me the chance to show it and I’m just fucking tired to the point I won’t be trying anymore and I’m accepting that loneliness will be the ultimate thing that kills me. We humans need connections to survive. We aren’t made so be alone and isolated. Yet I’ve lived this way my entire life.My soul is tired. And I’m so weak I can’t fight any battles anymore. I’m weak psychically, mentally, emotionally.I can't shake off the feeling that when someone knows about my diagnosis (not just my BPD because I have other diagnosis, but mainly my BPD diagnosis), they seem to use it as "get out of jail free" card when they do something that upsets me.And that keeps on happening with new/different people.I get very emotionally and mentally confused because I've been abused and gaslit all my life, to the point where I gaslight myself and convince myself I deserve it (and that my emotions are invalid and are an overreaction).I never know where I truly stand. I feel like walking on eggshells.How can I be overreacting and/or be wrong every single time something bothers me or upsets me when I try to talk about how I feel? Every time? Even when I'm trying my best to calmly explain what I'm feeling and why I'm feeling this way, and explain how my brain interpreted X as Y which caused me to feel even more upset.And even if it's really my BPD making me feel upset (for example, I wouldn't feel as upset if I didn't have BPD)... why does it instantly make my feelings invalid? Why does it instantly make me not have the right to feel upset and talk about how I'm feeling because I'm "wrong" and it's happening because of my BPD?I'm so exhausted of this. It makes me not want to open up when I'm upset ever again. It always ends up the same way when I try.I feel a bit sick atm because of my gastritis. Because I haven't anything at all so many hours ago, because I'm doing straight vodka shots (lost count, it's been hours).I took a shot and felt very nauseous a few moments after and I took my entire fucking power to not throw up because I couldn't waste/lose the alcohol I've drank.But if the same thing happened if I was sober and I had eaten even the tiniest bit (even if it's safe food), I'd just think it's fucking great that I feel nauseous bc I wouldn't struggle at all to purge, it would be so easy and quick.Like... this fact, this mindset... is so fucked. This is so so FUCKED!!!\*Edit: also just realized I'm stating the most obvious things because we are here and here we are. This sub. Fuck I hate so much that we're living this. 3 or 4 hours trying to hold on with my anxiety eating me alive, but I can't take it anymore.Ain't life just fucking great. I can't wait for this shit called life to be over. Been on this Earth far too long already.Good morning and I hope you guys have a good Sunday, everyone. Much love to you all.Hi everyone ❤️ Hope you're... idk, alright? Coping? Surviving? I don't know...Anyway... Tell me your favorite character who struggles with alcohol / substance abuse and why? Mine is Jessica Jones in season 1. When it came out on Netflix, I used to joke she even dressed so similar to me (that never changed to this day lmao). But back then I didn't know the alcohol part would become so similar as well. Just change the whisky 🥃 to vodka.Like even the small details during the scenes where's she's drinking or waking up hungover after blacking out are the same as mine. To the point where I have a hard time re-watching the show because you know... I'm living the same shit. It's too real. Makes me feel like forcing me to face my own reality in a way? Something I definitely don't want to do because I just... I can't do it.Anyway. Tell me what's yours and why?. He was my first and only pet. I've never gone through this pain before.We adopted him when I was 13. I lived all my teen years and my entire first decade as an adult with him. We used to joke we didn't adopt him, that he adopted us, that he chose us. He was a little pup, as soon as he saw me he set eyes on me and instantly walked towards me to sit on my lap, walking a bit clumsy (in the cutest way, because he was so little).He always showed so much love, even when he was a baby and we were strangers to each other.All I can do is cry and drink. I'm dissociating very badly. None of this feels real, I feel like it's a nightmare I'm gonna wake up from. I cannot believe I'm never gonna see him again around the house. I'm dissociating so bad. None of this feels real. I don't really have anyone (people) in my life.Please raise your glass for Joey and give a toast. Or if you're not drinking, please send positive thoughts. And if you have a pet, give them a big snuggle for me please. Pets are blessings.He also was born in March. He passed away exactly 7 days before my grandma's birthday (the woman who raised me, the only person who took care of me. She also passed away a few years ago). It does not feel like a coincidence... I don't know.I want to post a pic of him to show you guys how beautiful he was but I don't think I can handle seeing a picture of him right now.Thank you for reading. Like… all the fucking time? Every day?I’ve thinking this nonstop for 2 hours straight. 2/3am at the moment. Thinking about this for 2 hours straight while I keep drinking my lukewarm vodka sprite and taking a few weed hits. (A normal person would stop at least for this night)Doing this on purpose to not to panic about how in the fuck I’m going to pay my bills this month. I feel like a rat on a spinning wheel.For fucks sake. I just spent the entire holiday season completely alone. Completely isolated.And I was alone in a very bad and dangerous state, the “she can’t be alone because it’s dangerous and something could happen to get at any moment” kind of state. But I survived all by myself somehow (and honestly, I really didn’t want to. But I did, so here I am writing this post)Every single holiday. Not a soul. (And it’s been this way every year for a few years now)And when I start to “recover” from the emotional and psychological hell the holiday season was, here comes Valentine’s Day.Life comes once again throwing in my face “you’re completely alone! You have nobody!”Fuck this, this is hell.I wish we could get drunk together and talk shit and laugh. It would be so awesome and so funny. Anyway. You guys are my Valentine. I love this sub so fucking much and I love you all. This is the only place I can be fully open and truly talk about the reality I’m going through.This is the place I come every single day because I want to see how you guys are doing and what’s going on. Even if we’ve never talked to each other directly here, I feel like you’re a friend.I’m sorry we’re going through this shit, it’s so hard. I mean not just today because of Valentine’s Day, but because of what we’re going through every day. But we’re in this together. Much love to you reading this right now. Yeah, YOU! ❤️🌹. I want to d*ie from being so fucking stupid. I got nothing that I desperately needed (it’s been a few days) and now I have no money at all.I am so fucking embarrassed and I feel like the dumbest bitch on earth and I feel so guilty. I don’t even have anything to numb these feelings now. And to shut the intrusive thoughts about SH telling me to do it because I deserve it. I’m not even a ghost of who I used to be anymore.(Please don’t ask for details on how it happened. It’s very hard just to think about it and I’m seriously losing my shit thinking nonstop)When did I get so fucking STUPID, GOD. It was so easy for them. I made it so easy. Someone this stupid shouldn’t even be alive.Hi mom! How are you today? I hope you are well! ❤️Tomorrow is my boyfriend's mom birthday, we're in a LDR. 4 years ago, she lost her husband (my bf's dad) to an illness after being with him her entire life (my bf's dad). He mentioned that, since then, she's changed and doesn't celebrate anything, she always says she doesn't want to leave the house or do anything to celebrate any dates (her birthday, Christmas, New Years). He will however buy her one of her favorite meals so that they can eat together (his brother too).I've never met her in person yet (because so far my boyfriend comes to my city but I haven't been able to travel to his and visit her), but she knows about me. She knows things about me that he tells her, they talk about me, etc. She is very sweet to me and always tells her son to send me hello and kisses from her when we're having "date nights".All of our contact so far has been through him, never directly. She doesn't like phones at all and doesn't have one. I thought about writing a birthday message to her, send it to him and he can show her. I told him my idea today and he said she will love getting a birthday message from me and that she'll feel happy. Unfortunately I can't send her a gift, I would have loved that.I've never done this sort of thing before so I'm very nervous!!! In a way, it's the first time I'm "directly" talking to her. That makes me very nervous because it's a big deal! I'd like to make her feel special and make her smile, but I don't want to sound too... fake or over the top, I guess? Sound like I'm forcing it. Also because it's not really a happy day for her. I do feel like she's depressed because of grief. She's in her early 60s.Can you help me with ideas of things to say, please? Or things not to do? Thank you, mom! ❤️. He yelled at me again talking to me like I was trash treating me with hate because I annoyed him. because we were arguing. I got so fucking scaredI started having flashbacks of everything other people have done to me in the past. I relived everything again. I got so close to SH after years not doing ittonight I will drink all the vodka I have. I will not stop until I physically can't continue anymorehe is not the first. I mean it fucking started with abusive parents when I was a kid. but he's not even the first man I met to treat me like this. they all do the same to methey will never destroy me more thn I destroy myself. nobody hates me more than I doI'm not good for anything but this. I'm crying writing this. I keep failing. I keep trying but I keep failing. I've been failing for so long and now I'm failing harder and harder.I don't know how long my attempts to try again will be enough. Even if I do again and again. I don't even know if my attempts to keep trying again and again are worth anything at this point. It's the same shit happening over and over and over again in my life. I am so tired. My soul is tired.
    They've been gone for 19 years, but I always feel like it happened just recently. People say you get used to the pain and sadness as time passes; I don't think that applies to me. And I wonder why fate decided to take them both at the same time?I'm a single parent with no friends or family. Currently jobless, penniless. Every time depression kicks in, I talk to myself as if I'm talking to them, asking for advice. I don't know what to do in life; I'm still lost without you two. How do I get past this situation? I miss you both terribly. I never got to tell you, but I love you so much. I hope you forgive me, for I was an angry teenager with so many questions in life. Never in my life have I regretted not tagging along with you two when you left. I could've saved you both. I think about dying everyday but I can't let the same thing happen to my daughter as she'll be alone as I am if I were to die soon. I don't want her to hate the world like do.Hello! I need help pls! Non techie here. I have 2 tforce 8gb ddr4 and they're starting to fail. as in araw araw may issues na ako sa pc. my ex used to help me since he was the one who built the pc but I don't speak to him anymore. I'm just wondering what would be the cheapest ram out there that I can buy so pwede ko na syang palitan? meron bang 16gb na around 2k lang? Thank you!edit: grammar. This kitty Pumpkin (we named her) comes in and out of our home like she lives in here and I've fallen in love with her. I've had cats before and am very familiar if a cat is sick but it's my first time encountering her situation. She started looking really sick about two weeks ago and I am financially not in the position to help her as much as I want, I'm kind of in a job limbo situation since my client hasn't responded to my messages, I'm sort of unemployed and have currently no money but I digress. Pumpkin looks like a normal pregnant cat from a distance, but then if I tap her tummy very slighty it kinda bounces back. Her fur is soft and intact, her eyes doesn't show the third eyelids and doesn't water. I haven't checked her gums though, I'm actually allergic to cats and she gives me hives. If I slightly poke her stomach, it feels airy and hollow on the inside. She's so thin her spine and hipbones (?) are protruding. She's a very very lovely cat, very sweet and meek. She doesn't seem to be in any kind of pain but she literally slept all day, still sleeping as I type this. She stayed in our house since yesterday night, asked for food this morning (it's alreday 8 p.m. where I live) and hasn't gone out to pee/poop or hasn't gone back to their house. All she did was sleep in her makeshift box. I love her and I am worried for her. What could be the cause of her belly being so round and aside from bringing her to the vet, how can I help her?. So I've been Googling answers to my dilemma. I was able to find the exact way to unhide them years ago but I never bothered saving it, thinking the solution is permanent. I plugged in my external hard drive and it's gone again. I've wasted a good 3 hours trying to find a solution and I'm at wits end. Typing attrib -h -r -s /s /d e:\*.* does nothing but make a $RECYCLE.BIN folder that unsurprisingly has nothing in it. I've also downloaded R-undelete which shows all the photos I'm to access but what I want to do is just simply make them appear as they appeared before. I'm still using win10 desktop. Please help! T_T. Hello, paano po ba kumuha ng passport? Single parent ako and 7 yrs old po ang anak ko. I was informed we can still walk in to get a passport pero sa kakahanap ko ng updated info, nahihilo na ako. Since may free time ako this coming Monday, naisipan ko na baka pwede ko na lakarin to, if iaallow kami na makapagprocess in one day. Can someone guide me on what to do? Hindi ko talaga alam saan magsa-start since first time ko/naming kukuha ng passport. Pangdagdag ID lang sana. Salamat!. I am a single parent with very few friends and no family. Unfortunately, I can't leave my child behind bc she's too young to be left alone. My friends have declined in helping me saying they've done their part, which i totally understand. I've been unemployed for an embarrassingly long time and I really need all help I can get. We're out of food, we're behind rent and utilities. My child is attending school and I am behind 2 months of payment. I am willing to do any job online although I am not in the US. I've worked in call centers for over 8 years, I've also gotten a job on upwork once but can't find a similar job i was hired for. Willing to be trained as well. I'm sorry I can't think straight because I haven't eaten anything and I'm so hungry. Thank you.You were right. I should've listened to you. I know you just wanna help me out but you want to me to make a decision right away, and everything that's happening was to much for me to bear. I was emotionally unstable that day, even worse nowadays. You were like a sister to me, in my head you we're my best friend. It's been 4 years since we spoke. You live a different life now and you're not the girl I used to know. You don't need another toxic person in your life. I miss you Julie Ann, but I will never get in touch with you anymore.You have been wonderful to a lot of people in need. Once again, thank you so much for your help. /u/derekjadams. Sorry kung dito ko to ipopost, wala akong mapagtanungan e. Binigyan kasi ako ng friend ko ng code for free Jolibee spaghetti galing sa globeone account nya, pang handa daw namin kasi wala akong trabaho. Paano iredeem ito? Thank you! [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/h8idSFA.jpg). It's still the same all these years, but at least I don't wanna kill myself anymore, I'm gonna die anytime anyway. I also have a very painful ear infection and my kid's been coughing on and off for a month now, I can't even afford to get us checked and buy medicine. This is a newest low it's so funny.It's just me and my imagination; he doesn't care about what I think because it is what it is—that he wanted space. Oh my fucking god, I'm such an idiot. Welp, I only have myself to blame. It's a 12-year relationship that is still in my baggage, and I want to get rid of it. It's 10 p.m. where I am, and the realization came to me. I'm supposed to be finding a way how my child and I will eat tomorrow, but instead I'm crying about my wasted decade with him. I wish I can take back my youth.I accidentally watched a facebook reel about christmas and having a big family and it broke me. After weeks of not crying, I broke down sobbing while saying "I hate christmas". I know it's a little childish. I wish my daughter and I belong in a big family. I feel such a loser not being able to give her a gift this christmas. Hurry up holidays and be over.I have used up 3 full asthma inhalers within a month. I realized I need to up my dosage but I have no money. Looks like I'm gonna die soon because I can't afford to buy medicine. Happy Birthday to me.3 months na akong unemployed. Ubos na ang savings ko kaya kung kani-kanino ako lumalapit, kung ano-ano na ang binenta, kung saan-saan na nagapply. Lately ko lang narealize na shit yung resume ko kaya walang nage-entertain sa aking employer. Tas 1 bwan na akong hinihika, 1 month namang inuubo anak ko. Dasal ko lang kahit di na ako naniniwala sa diyos e wag maging hika yung sa anak ko. Naalala ko grade 2 ako nun, walang pera ang papa ko kaya magdamag akong gising, ang hirap magkahika tangina. Gusto ko magpagamot kaso wala akong trabaho. Tanginang buhay to. edit: naalala ko birthday ko nga. happy birthday self. Sana makahanap ka na ng trabaho T\_T &#x200B;. It's been about twenty years since I felt incredibly happy; it's Groundhog Day for me every day. Now that the holidays are fast approaching, it's worse this time. I'm broke, and worse, I'm unemployed. I'm unemployed for the first time and I have a hard time coping and finding money for our daily consumption. I have been a single parent for over a year now, and I feel bad for my kid every day. I'm scared I won't have anything to give her on Christmas Day. I hope one of the companies I applied for will hire me already. I'm so lonely.Hello, I need help trying to figure out removing the urine scent from our concrete floor but I don't have money. Will vinegar and water do the job? We have this linoleum floor like this (tinyurl.com/linoleum4) but it got holes from moving things around and eventually I had to replace it because of the quality of the linoleum was kind of falling apart.Also I had an elderly dog who peed all over the house, I was able to clean it but since the floor got holes, some urine seeped through. I replaced the flooring and oh my god, the smell was terrible. I scrubbed the floor with water, bleach and detergent and hoped for the better but the smell has gotten a lot worse. I am asking for help because the smell activated my asthma and I can barely sleep at night. Please help. English is not my main language so I'm sorry if I can't explain it well.We are out of food because I don't have a job. I've been so stressed out within the last 3 month. I was let go from my job and I've having a hard time ever since. My depression is back and it's worse than before coz I can't find a job. I've sent my resume a hundred of times, been interviewed over 30 times and received a shit ton of rejection emails and I don't know what am I doing wrong.My kid and I have been eating eggs for over a month now — fried egg, boiled egg, scrambled egg and if I see another egg, I will throw up. Bills are piling up and I don't know what to do and if I don't get a job this month (which happens to be my birth month, yay) we'll get kick out of the house. We have nowhere to go. The thought scares me so much. Please I beg you please help me.Species: Dog Age: 14Sex/Neuter status: FBreed: MuttBody weight: ?History: ?Clinical signs: cannot standDuration: 1 monthYour general location: PhilippinesLinks to test results, X-rays, vet reports etc: noneHi. Long story short I am a single unemployed parent with a dog. Got laid off Aug 31st and have been struggling to find a job, hence I can't bring my dog to the vet, can't even buy food. PLEASE DO NOT JUDGE ME. What is the most humane way of helping my elderly dog pass away? I love her and I can't take it anymore. She's blind, can no longer hear me, can't hardly walk, hardly drinks water and in an awful lot of pain, had extreme weight loss for w/e reason and smells like death. My daughter and I live in a small house and we've gotten sick because of her smell. I've been crying a lot because today's the worst I've seen her. Again I can't bring her to the vet, I have no money, no ways of doing it. How do I do it? Please help. Appreciate it a lot.So yeah, I just got out of the bathroom a few minutes ago and that was my fourth bathroom visit today and I'm scared I might have caught the virus. I'm a single mom, my daughter and I live in a studio-type apartment. I'm crossing my fingers that I don't have it but if I do, one of us has to go somewhere else. I wear my mask properly whenever I go out; I do not wear my mask under my chin nor take off my mask while outside. I'm also fully vaccinated (Moderna). What do I do to get tested? God I'm fckin scared.Ever since falling down the BTS rabbit hole, I've liked meme and ship pages and even joined a local BTS group which satiated my Bangtan needs. I was in cloud 9, waking up day after day daydreaming about them boys is such a delight. But after binging on their content consistently for over two months, my depression is back. Lol I thought the high feeling they brought me is gonna stay for good, unfortunately I was wrong. And now I'm actively avoiding FB and Twitter, but FB in particular. I usually am chatty in the KakaoTalk chat group but I stopped visiting, and I was actively posting memes and stuff in the local group and I did the same. When I feel like I being ignored, I shut down like how I'm feeling right now. I feel like shit.I'm so lonely. I wish I can hire someone to kill me.So early today I decided to transfer files from from phone to the computer. I transferred them files as normal, selected cut then paste them to the computer, and dumbass me decided to hit ctrl+z several times while on the process of transferring, now both files in my phone and in the computer ARE GONE. I'm not a computer geek, I only know the basics. So I googled what to do, and I tried to download and use a bunch of recovery apps and software but I don't think I really know what I'm doing. And as far as checking all the recovered files, none of them has the same file names as the ones missing. Should I give up or keep trying to recover them? Please help :(. I stepped on the chair in a wrong way and slipped. Now my neck is red and it hurts, I broke a plastic chair and sprained my fucking ankle. All I wanna do is die, why do I have to deal with unnecessary pain?? Am I this messed up to even fuck up trying to kill myself??? Fuuuckk.I'm not sure if I'm going to post in the right sub. I've been planning to kill myself all night, thinking of what kind of procedure I am going to do and what time I'll be doing it. The love of my live decided we're over and I can't wrap my mind around the reality. We've been together for 11 years and we have 1 child. I've packed my stuff last night and I'm suppose to leave today to find a place to stay but I'm still here at home and I'm very afraid of the thought of living alone, away from my little girl. Plus the fact that I have no idea where to go with little money and no job scares me so much. I have no family or friends to ask help from, I am totally alone. I said I don't have a job, I have a free training (not paid) where I applied for a job and there's no guarantee that they will hire me, so I'm not quite sure about it. If I fail, jesus christ I don't know what I will do. One thing that's holding me back from killing myself is my daughter. I'm wondering how she's going to grow up without me in her life. Her father is still around, but he's extremely busy and I'm afraid he'll leave her to the wrong people and she won't get attention and care like I give her. I'm not a good mother, but I do what I can do. There are times that I've hit her and I feel guilty with all that I've done to her. My mind is so clouded right now I can't think straight. I only got myself and nobody else to talk to so I keep going back and forth with my decision. I can't guarantee to get a job and provide for her because if I get the job and earn well, i will take her with me and everything will be ok. But I don't know, I don't know what to do. Im not from the US so suggesting to get help from the government is not an option. Fuck my life. I only have today to decide, I'm most probably going to chicken out but I am a little determined. But still, i don't know what to do. That is all, thanks for reading. Edit:added a few words.
    Im 23 and in the past 2 years I’ve had to be at 3 different friends funerals and the first one I had to watch them die as I helped take care of them at their families in home hospice set up. I know as you get older friends pass but I didn’t expect it so soon I just feel numb. I want a break where I don’t feel like I have to be a shoulder to cry on and I don’t feel comfortable confiding in anyone because the ones I was comfortable with have all passed. Anyways I appreciate you letting me vent.I’m able to track back some of this but not all so I’m not sure where it’s true origin came from yet. I remember developing the skill at least as far back as high school when teachers would ask me 20 questions just so I could go work on something else in my free period. I garnish my reasoning of why I need to leave to make them less likely to say no. I grew up with a not great step dad and a mom who didn’t stick up for me so I would tell not total truths and answer bare minimum questions just to avoid the wrath of being berated/talked down to instead of being offered help. So now it’s turned into whenever a family member asks where I’m going and I’m going to see someone they don’t know or wanna do something without having to hear what they think I just say I’m with someone they know to avoid all the question surrounding who the new person is. Or if I want to go camping with a friend I don’t feel like being told all the reasons why it’s not a good idea. I just don’t like giving anyone 24/7 access to everything I’m doing and I don’t want to get wrapped up in meaningless conversations so I tell small lies even when I don’t need to I still do it because that’s how deep the habit is rooted.I’m able to track back some of this but not all so I’m not sure where it’s true origin came from yet.

My thought process gets stuck in something heavy and philosophical. I think I know how I and but then begin wondering do I know who I am? Am I who I think I am? Am I my own person or just a copy of different traits I liked in other people? Is who I am right now who I really am? Or is trying to “find yourself” futile because I am always changing and chasing the thought that I am this one person and here are the boxes I check off to make me that way. So does the person I am today cease to exist tomorrow? Maybe I should just live who I am day by day? Idk I’ve been stuck in this spot for over a week now and I think I stumped my therapist a little last session but I can’t blame her because there’s no right or wrong answer so what do you say? My head hurts and I’m tired, I just needed an outlet to try and clear my mind a little. This is something I’ve struggled with for a while without even realizing it. Spending so much time trying to get from point A to point B that I’m never present during or in between my journey. Which is a big bummer because it can really close me off and cause me to miss out on new experiences. So today I finally feel like I understand what showing up for yourself means and I’m going to pull my mind from it’s tiny little office where it sits doing all these unnecessary calculations on the inside. To instead start really taking in everything day to day. Sometimes I swear I’ve just been on auto pilot haha but now I’m finally back in the driver seat(mentally anyway, physically I just had a blowout on the highway😅😂)Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.~Albert Schweitzer~. Anytime I’m going to do something new I will google anything I think might happen and pick responses/interactions I deem as “normal” I probably should definitely talk to my therapist about it but I was just wondering if anyone else experienced this?. Right now I am struggling... and I hate it, I don’t even know why I feel the way I feel. I like to over analyze everything but there’s nothing to analyze I have extreme highs and extreme lows for no apparent reason. Today it made me call into work... again.My therapist says I fall under HSP Highly Sensitive Person, and that I require more meaningful connections and authenticity. The people I want to open up to(my roommates who have been my best friends) aren’t good at listening. I can tell they don’t want to hear it because me talking about my problems stirs up some of their problems. I’m also a people pleaser so of course I listen to their problems and help them but never get the same in return. It’s made me resent them at times, and I hate that I feel that way.I’ve also informed them of my triggers that cause sensory problems but they are back to doing those things again and it really hurts but also drives my anxiety so high. It’s so hard managing both depression and anxiety. After leaving the mental health hospital I was doing really good, but now I’m just existing and I feel like I am losing myself really fast. I don’t know what make me, me anymore. I miss the hospital, it’s the only place that I felt safe and heard.I showered and did laundry today so that’s a positive and I made myself some food finally. Be good to your bodies, love y’all.My managers are very understanding of my situation while I get my medicines straightened out, but I feel like I’m a failure and like there is no getting better. I’m just in a really down spot at the moment and I really miss the mental hospital sometimes.One of my friends from the Mental Health Hospital jumped off a bridge the yesterday after he was discharged. I thought I was fine but it really set me back, I called into work today. I just wanted to get it out there so I wasn’t holding it in on my own.
    I have no interest in anything anymore. I used to love video games but now I will log onto my PC for a maximum of 5 minutes and then get off. Same thing applies to everything else. I just get high and sleep all day. I miss having fun and getting excited over things :(. Anyone else struggle with perfectionism in PZ? I've had this game since the day it launched and I have yet to finish a single zoo because I always end up scrapping or restarting. It's frustrating and I have a hard time enjoying the game when I'm so hypercritical of my builds. Just looking for ways to combat this but this might just be a me problem haha. Someone dumped a skinny little kitten in my driveway a few days ago. I'm guessing she's a few months old. I've kept her in my garage while I try to figure out what to do... She was very shy the first day I had her. Now she will run up to me (especially when I have food) purring and asking for pets. I'll rub her neck and cheek for a few seconds and it seems like she enjoys it but then she'll hiss, growl, and swipe at me. Why does she do this and how do I make her stop? I can't pick her up either. I don't know if she came from a traumatic situation or what (she is underweight and was very dirty when she arrived) but I just want her to trust me. Does anyone have the content warnings for misvil? does it have any r*pe scenes? Been looking for transmigration danmeis but I dont want anything too heavy... I barely even made it through 2ha for this reason. Thanks. 18F, started lexapro a little over a year ago. I was at a constant 105-110lb (5'8) until about 3 months ago and now I'm at around 125lb and having trouble losing the weight. Is this normal? Does it cause appetite changes or does it slow down metabolism?. favorite quotes from my Q today:"have you ever noticed how the sun isn't yellow anymore, but white? It used to be golden-yellow during our childhoods.""joe biden has a body double, look at his earlobes." "the vaccine you got as a toddler is what gave you autism." "oh my god, they got you guys so brainwashed! it's insane!""what, you want me to be all sweet and talk nice like all the pedophile elites everybody listens to?" (when asked to stop yelling) "remember when the sky was blue? before they dumped all the chemicals in it? it's white now." "why do you think your grandmother fell and broke her hip? the vaccine, it's so obvious"hoped to get some humor out of this but typing it out just made me kinda depressed. I'm not going to pretend like I know what this stuff is but my Qmom ordered it and intends to drink it. Reading the label, it says to avoid contact with skin, eyes, and mouth... I don't know who or what convinced her to try this but I don't want her harmed. Is this a new Q fad?. My Q thinks staring directly at the sun for fifteen minutes every sunrise/sunset will help her eyesight. Is anyone else familiar with this? She's getting into other alternative medicine as well such as crystals and incense burning. My mother is far gone. Her beliefs are so beyond outrageous I can only imagine they were conjured from some sick fever dream. What happened to her??There is no room for negotiation. Everyone else is a zombie, going about their day-to-day life with their eyes closed, but my mother is, of course, an enlightened individual who is blessed with the gift of extraordinary intelligence! Everyone who opposes her is a brainwashed idiot, obviously! I'm so so angry at what Qanon has done to her, but I cannot bring myself to feel bad anymore. I give up!! I'm so tired!!!! Nothing, NOTHING I say will ever help, because she's gotten it into her head that this is some great battle between good and evil, and she is on the right side of history. I'm done.
    I’ve had depression nearly my entire life and the only way I got care (as a minor) and emotional support as an adult is when I’m very clearly angry, upset, begging for someone in my family to help me, sobbing and screaming. It feels like once your family or friends accept your depression, they leave you to it until it gets bad bad or YOU reach out. And I hate that bc then I get treated like a stressor or nuisance. I want people to care because they love me, not out of obligation.Sending you all love. 23F considering moving back home. I currently live alone and the only way I can afford it is financial support from my mother whose the main reason I moved out. She’s trying to make up for essentially neglecting me my entire life.I grew up around a lot of toxicity despite having a somewhat loving father. My mom gave me an out to spite my father since they’re separated and she had to move out. But living alone is lonely and I already struggle w mental health issues. I feel lost at this age, no real career, friends but nobody I trust, no close family.It has its pros like privacy, freedom to express myself, no tip-toeing, nobody touching my stuff, nobody monitoring me. I love it but I’m not even the one paying rent fully, I wake up everyday alone and stumped. I feel spoiled but also like I’m not getting the one thing I need:Emotional support. I work a lot just to stay busy but I don’t really know what I’m doing here or if I even need to be living alone. I don’t REALLY want to go back to the house that stores all my traumas but I’ve seem to totally isolate myself in this apartment. I could move in with roommates elsewhere but I think I’m just lost in general. Please be kind. Any advice?. My ex and I have been on and off since we were 15 years old. We’re both adults now with jobs and our own lives. They’ve done me dirty over and over again due to their own issues but I stayed bc of my issues. Im over the relationship, our dynamic, their friends, their behaviors, who I am when im with them but I am absolutely haunted by this breakup to this day. We were suppose to be in an apartment by now with a cat, rolling up after work and making breakfast w Saturday morning cartoons. Why can’t I let that go? It’s not even something I really want deep down inside. I’m dating, having sex, making new friends left and right, less stressed but I weep instantly remembering the good times. I know I know. I’m mourning potential. I need to learn to love myself. Ya ya. Shit still hurts. I spent years motivating myself with this person and now I have to do everything for the sake of loving myself and securing my future. Rough.I’m furious. I’m delivering in West Hollywood to a gigantic complex with no parking for visitors. Find a spot put on my blinkers I’m running for my life and come back to an EIGHTY THREE (83) DOLLAR TICKET. I just start crying bc I’ve made $20 today. I’m on the phone with support but damn. I even chased down the parking officer and pleaded with him and he was like not my problem. Yes in the end I left my car where I shouldn’t have but I have always popped on my hazards and came back fast. We are in LOS ANGELES, ppl who live here can’t even find parking on the streets like be so fucking Fr Need another job man, it’s good when it’s good then shit like this happens.EDIT: Support gave me $20, which is I think more than we were all expecting😆. I’ve calmed down now, just a lesson I didn’t want to learn today. Hey y’all, I was wondering if anyone gets the health stipend quarterly/monthly? I haven’t put in my documents yet, I would def qualify but what’s the catch? Is it going to fuck up my taxes? Does it count as income? Should I do it? I could use the extra money but not if it’s gonna come back to bite me. What’s your experience? Also, worried I might owe hella taxes this year bc I’ve never filed w a 1099/ Uber. Any advice appreciate. Thanks!. Preface: I read Eddie Huang’s interview about how the network essentially turned his hard-hitting book about Asian Americans into a sitcom palatable for white people. Agreed. It was extremely palatable and lost its umph once it became about the daily runnings of a family rather than the unique stories of an Asian American family. I enjoyed it nevertheless as it gave me that sentimental family narrative I was looking for. That being said, here are my thoughts on the show. 1. Jessica is simply a bad person. Toxic, controlling, dare I say abusive? Called ICE on Hector (my jaw dropped, crazy thing to add then never speak of again), horrible friend to Honey, sabotaging her kids (Evan mainly + Eddie’s interview with Harvard) , etc. You get it. A lot of people on here have said the same thing. Kind of made her character one-dimensional. At some points I couldn’t stand Jessica centered plots because she was just so repetitive and predictable. She had admirable moments here and there. I would say she IS who she thinks Eddie is. (In reality, Eddie is better than her.) 2. Not nearly enough mandarin spoken, almost 0 by the last 2 seasons. Although I’m not Chinese, I also have immigrant parents + grandparents I have a language barrier with so I was stoked to see this dynamic on TV. I knew I was getting a stereotypical representation of a Chinese family (duh it’s American TV) but I liked it better when they added cultural aspects, mandarin words, relatives, traditions etc. I think they could’ve done A LOT especially with acknowledging the LOSS of culture (ex: Eddie not knowing “pass those dumps” in Mandarin). That’s funny and relatable as someone who can’t fluently speak their first language because English is now my primary through school and socialization. I enjoyed when they tackled anti-Asian/racist rhetoric in a couple episodes, but honestly thought it would come up more considering the premise of the show and their extremely white neighborhood.3. Love Eddie’s character. He’s flawed but consistently grew through out the show. I like how they made him a “wanna-be rapper” aka a young ethnic kid interested in Black culture. I also grew up first-gen in an American suburb and while my entire world felt like it was white, my biggest idols were Black. I loved Kobe Bryant, Michael Jackson, listened to a lot of rap in my pre-early teens. More often than not, it’s expressed in “acting Black” as we see Eddie try to be like Biggie or dress rapper-esque. I almost thought the show would have an episode about Eddie learning about the N-word/have a lesson about the use of it but as he got older they slowly geared away from that narrative as his only one. It’s cute he ended up in restaurants like his dad + the 1500 SAT score was a fun twist because Jessica (and the family) spent the entire show undermining him. Eddie didn’t give a f*ck, he just wanted to listen to his music and express himself. Also, loved his friendship with Nicole. I think the moments with Nicole, with her coming out and them becoming real friends was the start of Eddie’s maturing. He seemed genuinely happy with her! Sad she never returned. 4. Emery got the typical middle child treatment by the show. He was only important if they needed him. Evan got so much more plot! Both interesting characters but Emery lacked depth. Maybe that’s exactly how it was suppose to feel since he was the middle child. Evan was annoying at times but he was raised by Jessica so…. (Evan is who Jessica wanted to be, but she destroyed him trying to live through him.) 5. Louis is cute, funny, sensitive and a good father and husband. I think I have a crush on him. He was always balancing out Jessica’s annoying irrational meltdowns. At least when he went overboard he apologized and learned from it. His character felt deeper than Jessicas. Plus, it felt like he was more romantic and affectionate in general. 6. Last but certainly not least, Grandma is gold. Always wanted to hear what she had to say and I LOVED hearing it in Mandarin. If I was watching the show in the background while I did something, I would give full attention to read the subtitles when she spoke. That added the cultural umph I expected from the show! She was funny, rude, and real. I wish I could buy her a Garfield plushy. Let me know what you guys think :))) I know I added a lot of complaints but I did really enjoy the show overall. Not sure what to watch next. I’ve seen Modern Family, New Girl, B99, and so much more but maybe I should get out of the habit of binge watching TV (but it’s so fun).
    I'm done, therapy doesn't work, I'm tired of going to every therapy possible and wasting money, I will die tomorrow. Fuck it, the world doesn't want me here, so I'm out. No more trying. it's over. Fuck you all.Yes, I can somewhat cook (basic stuff, nothing fancy) , clean and be in a 9-5 job, but then I'm boring, no hobbies, or having something that can attract someone.I literally left everything that supposed to destroy my mental health (competitive games), but still ugly, boring, unappealing, useless, late at everything, unable of learning, stupid, lazy. I should better be dead. Noone will ever truly love me, noone wants to spend his life with a pathetic human being, and neither with someone with 0 mental health.I never try hard enough, everyone is better always, everyone works harder than me, everyone is smarter than me, everyone is more disciplined than me, everyone is more passionate than me, everyone gets awarded from their achievements but I don't (cause I don't have achieved anything). And you may say: don't compare yourself with others but with your past self. Emm no, welcome to the real world, nobody cares about your past self, you have to be good now, life won't wait for you.Title.Just that, my brain malfunctions and dont want to live anymore. I cant be good at anything no matter how hard i try cause im not smart. A little bit of context: I (27M) have been following a girl (around my age, maybe she's a bit older) in Twitter (yes, fuck X I still call it Twitter, fuck u Elon) that does some good illustrations, and after some time, we met at some local events (we live on the same city) and I bought her some of his merchandise as well some of her prints. She was pretty nice with me but guess it was just because of the sells she made. After that events, we followed eachother in Twitter (as well as some of her friends that were with her), and starting sharing some twitts about our common likes, but Im starting to see that now I like and comment a LOT of her posts way more than before we met IRL, and the worse part (I think) I'm liking ALL of her posts. And I'm staring to think like I'm harassing her or faking to be a good guy just to be with her... But I'm really a good guy (or at least trying everyday to be a better person) and because I mostly have been surrounded by male friends since childhood and have little to none experience with girls it's hard for me to deal with them cause I don't want to be a creep that wants to date any women on sight, I just prefer have a long term friendship that MAYBE becomes something else, but even if that never come and we are just friends I'm all for it. I prefer dying virgin with lots of good friends rather than seeking desperately some girl to be with. Well, now I post here because maybe a little perspective on the girl side could enlighten me in all of this sea of insecurity. Or maybe I should seek therapy, I don't know. (Already tried to post this on r/relationship_advice, but automod deleted it cause they don't give advice to this lol). Already give all my money to my dad. I'm complete waste of human being. I'm done with my life. I give up. There's no good ending. 26M here, bad at my job, no hobbies (even gaming feels like a chore to do daily missions to get cosmetics/progression after constant loses and no improvement) and after that only eat, cleaning myself and go sleep. That's it, just a constant loser that can't do anything in my life worth it to be proud. And every try to deviate from that losers path, trying to learn drawing / go to gym / go to therapy, I just can't do it. Is my life doomed to fail? Why I should keep being alive? I'm stuck in this shit. The only solution to this to instantly heal and get better, patience don't work.I dont know what is happening to me, mentaly speaking Im so fucked up, but i just cant go to therapy cause i always get "better" just in time to cancel the appointment, but then boom, bad again.My life is doomed and i cant do nothing about, i dont even have enough guts to even kill myself, cause the stupid survival instinct.Got "all" of the Dva Cosmetics (aside from some Overwatch League team Skins and All Stars skin) and my game tells me that I have 150/151. https://imgur.com/a/Wt0FAmH. "Everyone is better than me, why would even try to do something with my life? I'm destined to have a poor life, make poor decisions, being dumb stupid lazy fuck who have a shitty job just to keep a place to live. "These were all my thoughts that passed through my mind that make me cry for a while, not cause they are hard, but truth af.I can't do anything to fix my life, and I just simply won't do anything more than crying and wasting time until I die. I give up, that's it. I can't learn, I don't have motivation, even though I have time for learning, I just can't sit and learn. Everything is boring and even if I try hard on something, 1 little guy will come and steal it in front of me cause he/she is smarter and younger than me.I mean, if i break a bone, any ER or orthopedic surgeon can heal me. Why this is not the same with depression? Same with paying for both treatments, the first one you have to pay AFTER you healed most of the injure, but with depression yo have to pay in advance.....for a try to heal, or not even that, just talk with someone that tell you that you have to heal by yourself and he/she wont do anything. Alright, when a break i bone, i want to get told that i have to heal myself too... Im starting to think that psicology is a scam like homeopathy...So, the thing maybe is simple but i have this problem: I feel happy at other's success always, but when the success is something that i tried to achieve before them still makes me happy for them, but extremely makes me sad and angry for me that i couldnt achieve it. Its like envy but i dont want to others to not succeed. I dont know what to do to stop that feeling...Fuck it, remove walking animation, and make rengar jump on every AA./s. No i havent. I just dont care anymore about anything, how im supposed to magically change or begin to change something, even the tiniest thing, step by step. Thats just plain bullshit. Once you are like me, you are permanently trapped and theres no escape, just wait to death.I just dont care anymore about everything, im ugly, im fat and dont want to eat healthy cause i dont care a damn shit, i cant learn to draw cause im impatient and piece of shit, i dont care about phisical training, i just want to sit on a sofa watching twitch streams and die alone. No motivation, will to live, or anything. Theres no therapy that can heal me, nothing works on me, just let me die in agony. I have a childish attitude, fine, i dont care, i still dont care, i wont do anything about that. Dont care.DONT CARE. I DONT FUCKING CARE.Like i dont like anything, but i want to force myself into liking something. How can i do that?. I give up with my life. I lost so many years of my life thinking I can be successful, but I can't. I'm unable to learn, I'm unable to get good at something. I'm unable to be happy. I'm unable to have fun doing something. I don't like anything. I'm not someone who can be happy. My destiny is to live in a permanent state of suffering or just killing myself asap. I'm just at 1 bad thing to occur me and going to the first bridge in my town and just jump. I don't give a shit. I'm tired. I don't want to live anymore.Everything I do i wrong, i can't learn to do it well. I can't fix my mistakes. Everything goes bad alwqys. I can't exit this permanent state of complete failure. I just want to end this misserable life.I give up, there's no need no extend this shit any longer. I'm cursed. I should die asap. I'm just a waste of resources, food, clothes, money,...I just can't learn how to draw. I seek info and try to start some tutorials like the ones on Ctrl+Paint or Drawabox.Whenever I try to start, I get angry, frustrated, bored, i can't even draw guidelines, and I don't want to spend 90 years trying to do the first lesson/tutorial/whatever. And then I just go away from paper or the tablet. And the thoughts of giving up just make it worse. My head starts to ache so fucking hard, an then the rest of the day I'm a complete zombie who just eats, and go to "sleep" (cause I really can't).And worse than that, I can't go to a therapist right now or tomorrow cause COVID make every appointment goes from 1 or 2 months to get a single one (I mean, I have to wait minimum 1 month to talk to a therapist I the disease is not Covid). Would be too much OP that Rengar could jump from side bushes in mid if they were closer? Now we can, but there's too many factors outside rengar to do it: tickrate, enemy minion pathing, enemy midlaner being a dogshit player and getting close to a not warded bush where you are waiting...Sometimes, when I play rengar top, and crush the enemy laner in early, i fuck up lane minions by pushing trying to crash them under turret, but then enemy just freeze the wave under turret for so long that I lose the early lead that I have and then the game is impossible (for me) to came back.I was thinking if diving is a good idea if you can outplay like Jax's E or Urgot's E with EmpW but if I die that would end the game for me. Other thing is to play around enemy jungle and try to kill or steal camps, but when I do that, I feel like losing lots of exp and gold... Maybe I'm just overthinking...Once you lose 1 single game, no matter your loses, you're instantly on consolation rounds. Not like a real tournament, not even like a real losers bracket. Even if you win the first game....I'll be 24 on September 2 and I don't want to live anymore. There's nothing I can do in this world. I'm useless, I can't learn nothing, I can't sleep, I can't do exercise, I can't live happily, I don't have nothing to be proud, I have lost interest in all my hobbies. I just feel I need to end my life now. This has to end now. This is impossible to get better. There's no salvation. I'm dead inside. I'm empty.Jesus fucking christ. I fucking can't. Stop telling me I can do it, that I can improve, that I can be better by practicing, no. NO. It's imposible, I can't get better at anything in this stupid life. Any help given to me is useless, cause I can't use it wisely, all I can do is wrong every single time. Stop saying it's OK to lose, to fail at something. It's not OK. I CAN'T LEARN FROM MISTAKES. WHENEVER I LEARN FROM THAT MISTAKE, ON THE FUCKING SAME THING, ANOTHER FAIL COMES RIGHT BEHIND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AND IT NEVER STOPS APPEARING.It's incredible how trash I'm. Should i consider delete this game, go to a mcdonalds to apply to dishwasher or floorlicker?. I mean, I get that learning this skill is primarily by practicing a lot, but the thing is what practice you do and what's the best order to learn step by step. I don't think starting with complex forms or perspectives are the best way to start and then follow with some other things like drawing from imagination.There should be something like 1-Fundamentals, 2-X thing, 3-Y, and so on, right?Edit:Sry if this is hard to understand, English is not my first language and probably I made some mistakes writting this post XD.Unluckily, in Spain we can't get the prescription for the antidepressants without therapy, so I'm kinda fucked. Is there a general prescription out there?. I can't learn nothing new, the things I know are basic that everyone knows, I have no skills at all, I lost my motivation in life, well if I did have someday. I'm literally doing the same everyday and can't change that no matter how hard I try. Video games were my way to relax until few years ago. Now it's a constant pain cause I'm not good enough to win games, everyone is better than me and now I'm trying to stop gaming by trying to learn drawing, but I can't learn that, and from what I'm reading in other sites, drawing needs too much time to get good at, like any other skill, but I don't have that time, I need to get good NOW, not after 2/5 years. The more time I lose, the worse it gets so I need something NOW.Why I have to be ugly and unsuccesful and then there's people gorgeous and fucking godlike at everything. And mostly they got that without effort. Fuck this fucking world, if you're ugly your life is doomed, you better die and let other be better.I'm 24 near 25. I was in a "job" for 9 months, now I'm unemployed cause I can't do that job well. The thing is, that job is something I was studying for, but I can't do it well no matter how hard I try. And now, I try to learn other things and can't do nothing well. I'm trapped in this shitty life, I want to end it now.I don't want to learn something that needs 20 or 30 years to get good at. I need something now. Or else I can't live.I'm ugly, my brain does not work well. All my grades were gifted by mercy. I just can't feel motivated to do anything. Everything in my life is result of all my past failures that can't be solved. I'm starting to feel I should end my life asap.I can't even win to Jax..... I'm a fucking disgrace of human being. All my wins are totally random and lucky.

I am a little worried about the sandbox flagging it as suspicious.Hey, I've been aggressively balding on my crown for the last month. I've basically gone from cowlick to super thin, and I have a visible bald spot on my head now(pics on post history if interested, I can't post them here). &#x200B;The only person who is bald in my family is my mom's dad and he starting receding from the hairline at \~40 and went bald at 50(no crown loss). My dad has a full head of hair with a ronald reagan hairline and he is 55. Meanwhile I am balding at the crown at fucking 17. (This is the genetic equivalent of having a dad who is 6'0 and a grandpa who is 5'9 and being 5'5 lol)&#x200B;Which is why I'm asking whether dutasteride is safe. From my age of onset and aggressiveness(I can't even grow a beard or a mustache yet lol, my scalp follicles must be super sensitive to DHT), it feels like dut is basically a necessity, and it should work to great effectiveness since my hairline is basically nw0. But it might stop future maturation. I am essentially caught between a rock and a hard place, what should I do?. When will pyrilutamide phase 3 results come out and what is the estimated time for it to hit the shelves?Also, does it even work? People on this forum have taken pyrilutamide that has been chemically verified by labs and they have gotten almost no results, while multiple highly regulated studies have shown that it is equal to fin. What is going on?. Pictures are in post history if interested.At this point I'm looking for any other possible explanation besides aga.17m, mom's dad went bald at 45, dad is nw0 at 50 and Dad's brother is nw3 at 55. No other family history of hair loss. I am currently nw0 but am noticing hair of different thicknesses/lengths falling out,I have a history of Seb derm and it got real bad so I went to a derm and got prescribed ciclopirox. I use nizoral + ciclopirox+ pyrithione zinc conditioner in rotation.Can nizoral cause this or is it just miniaturization?(I have heard it can be drying and curly hair is prone to frizzing but I also use conditioner every day so) Also, for the last 2 months I have been eating ~1000-1500 calories a day due to not being used to ADHD meds so I am wondering whether that can cause what I am mentioning too.Wtf is happening. TW: Depression, suicidal thoughts**TLDR: (Possibly? Could be/I hope I'm just psyching myself out) Balding at 17/18, feeling like I'm never going to achieve anything and that self improvement is a sham**I've always wanted to be successful but I kept having trouble building a routine and trying to get myself to do things. Typical self improvement advice literally physically did not work for me(don't want to explain rn). It became 10x better when I got diagnosed with ADHD at 17 tho, and after taking Vyvanse, I can genuinely keep a routine and **do shit** now.I had hope that maybe one day, things would work out, and I would escape being a fucking loser and actually add value to the world. But then, hair loss struck, only 3 months later.And the worst part is, I don't even know whether I'm actually balding or not, as getting a dermatologist appointment takes so much time. My hair looks fine rn, just shedding a lot of hair in shower/bed and some of it looks miniaturized, and no one in my family has had hair loss before the age of 40-45. But still, I can't risk anything.Because of this, I feel crippled with anxiety. Every day, I take 10 pictures of my crown and measure the length of every single hair on my bed and in the shower to see whether they are miniaturized telogen vellus hairs or not. My hair is the only thing that's good about my appearance, so even if it thins slightly I'm screwed, and because of this I'm scared out of my mind.Why did I have to have undiagnosed ADHD and a bald maternal grandfather? Why couldn't I have had time to figure myself out and not get screwed over with MPB while I'm still a fucking child. Now I'm going to be the ugliest person on the planet while everyone makes fun of me and rejects me for something I literally have no control over(and ik finasteride exists, the only problem is I'm not fully mature and I can't even grow facial hair yet so if I take fin I feel like I will stunt my growth massively)I'm never going to achieve my goals.

Like equivalent of Norwood except for crown instead of hairline.Also, I've heard people online say "maturing hairline" quite a bit. Why does the hairline mature but not the crown?. Like equivalent of Norwood except for crown instead of hairline.Also, I've heard people online say "maturing hairline" quite a bit. Why does the hairline mature but not the crown?. I hear this being referenced a lot on r/tressless. I thought fin only inhibited 5AR type 2, while neurosteroid synthesis uses 5AR type 1?. Experiencing changes in hair cycle/shedding but thinning on crown isn't really too visible yet(pics on profile if interested). Considering my strong family history of hair loss (mom's dad is bald), is it safe for me to take fin rn(I am almost 18)? I started puberty pretty late(14) so ik it will affect development but I also don't want to lose my hair. What do I do?. No heaven, hell, reincarnation bullshit. Life is so fucking tiring and exhausting and it's just constant CONSTANT struggle and pain(and I'm only 18 lol I can't even imagine what I will feel like at 30 if I live that long).I just want to cease to exist. Eternal rest -- honestly the best thing I could hope for.I am depressed and lonely af due to a lot of factors and mental complexes which I simply do not have the energy to describe rn. The gist of it however is that I have very low self esteem and have been bullied for my looks throughout my childhood, and this led me to a dark place.However, I thought recently things were looking up. My mental state improved significantly after going to a psychiatrist and I was starting to look up to life again. I regained hope that things would work out eventually and started "working on myself".Until.... BOOMI'M FUCKING BALDING AT 17. WHY IS GOD/THE UNIVERSE/WHATEVER ACTING LIKE AN 8 YEAR OLD CHILD TRYING TO SEE JUST HOW MUCH HE CAN DESTROY HIS MINECRAFT WORLD WITH TNT?!?!I don't know if a higher power exists or not, but I do know that if one does, I can imagine it trying to bet on seeing whether I kill myself at 18 or 22.Edit: Thank you guys so much for the support. I'm def way more chill now.Let me just clarify a couple things:-It's def not at a bad stage rn, I would go so far as to say it's not visible at all. I've just been noticing more hair falling out and my mind freaked and went straight to balding. God willing, maybe I can take finasteride and it'll stabilize.-I can't grow a beard or any facial hair yet :(-Even if fin doesn't work, the comments here were really useful in helping me accept going bald. Hopefully when I get jacked, even if I have to shave I'll look ok. -Also for any of my fellow bald brothers who are losing hope: just look at Freddie Ljungberg, Jeremy Meeks(he's a piece of shit but still), Zidane, Jesse from breaking bad, 2pac(so attractive he cucked will Smith 23 years after his death), Jason statham, Ricky whittle, Harry Roselmack, ZAYN MALIK with a buzz cut etc(tried to include lots of POC)I'm a lot more chill now thank y'all so much. I think I'm going to get jacked first and then shave it off so that even if fin doesn't work and it gets real bad real quick, ik what to expect. If fin works/I'm just balding from sebderm or stress/I'm imagining it(lol I think the last one is just me coping), good. If not, I am prepared. At least I am 5'11 so I don't have to worry about being short, I can pull off the bald + jacked monster lookI was also thinking of all of the shit that I am insecure about my face and I realized a lot of them will kinda help me(kinda) if I go bald lol, like my dark skin, wide face(more masculine + will turn into God tier cheekbones once I cut), wide nose(more masculine), etc. TW: AbuseMy maternal grandfather represents everything that I hate about humanity for the following reasons:1) **He used to abuse and beat my grandma and would abuse my mother too.** My mom constantly used to shout and scream and do the most paranoid and neurotic shit to me and it's because she's passing on the abusive behavior that she received from her dad to her only male child.\n2) **He used his good looks to get away with his shitty behavior.** My grandma wouldn't divorce my grandpa for the following reasons: 1 - Divorce was not socially acceptable back then, especially in the country where my grandparents are from, and 2 - *My grandma believed she was so ugly she could never find a good man again, and that my grandpa was like a blessing from God even though he would abuse her*.\n3) **Because of his genes, I'm balding.** He went bald at the age of 40, and I heard that balding is from your mom's dad, so I thought I would go bald around then too.I was half correct.

For context, I've struggled to make friends in high school for a long time. I've also been bullied before for my looks. So it wasn't hard for me to believe my only friend when he said this to me as I was crying to him on a discord call about how I don't have any friends:"People don't want to be friends with you because of how you look. There's a certain looks level you need to meet to become a part of a friend group and you just don't meet that."He said it with no ill will, just pure sincerity. And it's mostly held true. I'm in my first year of college and I have no friends, and every time I try to talk to someone ik they are judging me and my face in the back of their mind.Said to me around 6 months ago by who I thought was my only friend.

There's a certain looks level you need to meet to become a part of a friend group and you just don't meet that."He said it with no ill will, just pure sincerity. And it's mostly held true. I'm in my first year of college and I have no friends, and every time I try to talk to someone ik they are judging me and my face in the back of their mind.Good ThinkPad for CS Major -- needs to be good for gaming, AI/ML and Assembly as well**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE** * **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase.

It feels like ordinary hobbies -- fantasy football, gardening, reading, etc -- don't interest me at all. The only thing I'm attracted to is worrying about the most emotionally devastating thing that can happen and then spending all of my time on it and obsessing over it for a short period of time.For instance, the last couple of weeks, I've been worrying about my hair which makes sense -- my mom's dad is fully bald so there's a high chance I will go bald as well. However, I've been worrying about it to the point where I've been scrolling through r/tressless 3 hours a day for the last 2 weeks.And the worst part is, I'm not even balding at all yet. I just have problems with my appearance and self image(I have really bad body dysmorphia) and think that if I go bald, it will be so depressing that I will kill myself. I don't know why I keep worrying and worrying. Maybe it's that messed up rush of adrenaline/dopamine whenever I stress myself out. Maybe it's the fact that I am highly drawn to learning about new things and this in combination with the rush of stress makes me seek negative obsessions.It's gotten so bad to the point where I've forgotten how to have fun. The last time I had true, positive fun was around 4 years ago, before I even started high school.It feels like ordinary hobbies -- fantasy football, gardening, reading, etc -- don't interest me at all.

    I’ll never have a normal life. I’ll never be able to function the same way the majority of earth’s population does. I’ll always be seen by others as a weird, off-putting freak. I’ll never have good social skills. I’ll never be able to form normal relationships. My time has already passed for developing these skills, and it’s naturally fucking baked into my brain since birth to behave and think differently from everyone else. Why should I even try? What makes a life like this even worth it?. I’ll never have a normal life. I’ll never be able to function the same way the majority of earth’s population does. I’ll always be seen by others as a weird, off-putting freak. I’ll never have good social skills. I’ll never be able to form normal relationships. My time has already passed for developing these skills, and it’s naturally fucking baked into my brain since birth to behave and think differently from everyone else. Why should I even try? What makes a life like this even worth it?. I’ve observed that this “advice” *always* comes from people who are never alone for more than a couple weeks at a time, and then it’s suddenly earth-shattering when they are alone for this short time.Non-FA’ers really like to spew the idea that love does not equal true happiness, and then their whole world collapses when they don’t have constant love and validation. It’s like Jeff Bezos lecturing you on how meaningless money is.Practice what you preach.Heads up, I’m not censoring potential trigger words.I just had a nosebleed while also having a mental breakdown and crying hysterically, and my idiot self tilted my head back to avoid getting blood on my carpet. I swallowed what I believe to be a large amount of blood, and now I am terrified I’m going to throw up. My EMT friend told me swallowing blood makes you sick. I have swallowed blood in the past during nosebleeds (in fact when I was younger I did it every time I had one), but this time felt like a lot more. I am so scared and I don’t want to throw up.So last month (first of August), I matched with this girl on a dating app. First match I’ve ever gotten after almost two years of use. We immediately started talking and hit it off pretty much immediately. I thought things were going really well, so I got her snap. We snapped back and forth for almost a month. During that period, we had to reschedule a date twice, apparently because stuff came up on her end. Normally I’d take this as a red flag, but both times it happened she apologized profusely and practically begged me not to unadd her.During the time we continued talking, she seemed to get more and more attached and was making it obvious. She told me I treated her better than any guy ever did, that I meant a lot to her, she never wanted to leave, etc. For me, this was great, and it was the happiest I’d felt in about eight years.Well, on Monday of the last week, we were texting and started talking about sex. She said she was so attracted to me being a virgin, and later that night we exchanged pictures and talked about what we wanted to do. She decided she wanted me to spend the night with her on our upcoming first date (that Friday). I told her that to be quite honest, I didn’t want to sleep with a girl I hadn’t even met in person yet on the first date. She seemed disappointed right off the bat and I immediately started rethinking like an idiot and telling her I would. She came back with “well we can just wait on that then”.From that point on, she started talking to me less and less, and I could sense she was becoming disinterested. The Thursday of that week, I asked her what time she wanted me to come pick her up for our date the next day. We were talking about it and all of a sudden she stopped answering. I thought “okay, she must be busy at work, so I’ll wait”. An hour passes. Five hours pass. Ten hours pass. No response, not even an opened message. During this time, I start checking her snap score to see it steadily going up, meaning she was active with somebody, just not me. The next morning, at about the 20 hour mark, I realize she has blocked me everywhere. All social media platforms, my number, everything. Just dropped me like I was nothing, after all the shit she told me.Before anyone says this sounds like a catfish or scam, I facetimed her on several occasions and snapped every day. I know she was a real person.I have been a wreck since. Everyone tells me I dodged a bullet and need to move on, but all of those words come from people who can have relationships whenever they went and don’t understand the feelings I am dealing with. This was my first true taste of what a relationship is like. I put all my trust in this girl, gave everything I possibly could to keep her happy (minus that one fucking thing), and it still wasn’t enough. I’ve lost faith in people.Popular music, movies, TV shows, everything. It’s all about being in love and how great it is. I’m getting to the point where I can’t enjoy my favorite bands anymore, because they just sing about lovey sappy shit. It’s triggering.I am a 19 year old who was diagnosed with Asperger’s at 5 years old. I have grown up in a Christian household my entire life. I have been raised by good, God-loving people.However, faith is something that I find very difficult. Reasonably, I do believe it’s impossible (or at least extremely improbable) that a universe as complex as ours came from nothing. Logically, in my mind there has to be a Creator of some sort. As an autistic person, however, I am naturally a very literal and technical thinker. I don’t do well with understanding abstract ideas that can’t be 100% factually proven. The whole idea of religion is based on believing in that which you cannot see.As a result, I’m caught in a terrifying dilemma. I **want** to believe in God, and I **want** to make Him Lord of my life. When I have doubts, however, it makes it very difficult. On top of this, there are so many belief systems in the world that it makes me afraid to pick just one. How can we possibly know 100% that Christianity is the *one true religion*? All of these things are holding me back from a good, healthy relationship with Christ.Can anyone offer some help/guidance/words of reassurance?. I’m a 19 year old guy with what I would call a fairly successful life, but porn has really been contributing to my downfall lately. I have struggled with moderate depression for about six years straight now. I’m an autistic guy with severe social deficits and have been introverted my entire life. The one thing I crave in my life more than anything is companionship (a future wife). However, I think the odds of me ever getting there are slim to none. I have never had a true girlfriend, and most guys my age have had at least a couple by now. My Christian friends always tell me that “God has someone for me” and that “God will give you someone”, but nowhere in the Bible is there a passage I’m aware of that promises an earthly partner. My understanding is that it says Jesus is our true spouse. This is where it gets difficult. I believe in God and know I need God, but I want an earthly partner and feel that “marriage” with Jesus alone will not be enough to heal me.Tying this into the purpose of this sub, I PMO daily (sometimes more than once in one day) as an escape from all of this negativity. I know it’s not healthy, and there are better ways, but it’s so difficult to stop once you’ve started. It’s especially difficult when it’s the one thing that numbs me.I feel so broken.My only friends and family are non-FA, and none of them understand me or the mess I am. I can’t talk to anybody about my feelings and struggles without being invalidated and told stupid shit (“you’ll find someone, I promise”). It’s a pretty miserable existence when literally fucking nobody in your life can relate to the struggles that are ruining your life.That’s all.According to the Wikipedia article for 802.1X, it is a protocol that “provides an authentication mechanism to devices wishing to attach to a LAN or WLAN.” Immediately after this, however, it goes on to say that 802.1X is responsible for encapsulating EAP traffic, making it seem like it doesn’t actually do the authentication itself; it just carries the traffic. Upon reading about EAP, several places I look state that 802.1X “uses” EAP, but wouldn’t it be the other way around if EAP actually does the authentication? I often see people refer to 802.1X as an “authentication protocol”, but it seems like this would be EAP. Then people say EAP isn’t a “protocol”, it’s a framework. I guess I’m just having a difficult time understanding the two, their differences, and how they relate to each other. Can someone explain to me what I’m missing please?. Maybe it’s just me, or maybe it’s common. I have the worst time when it comes to people giving me any kind of instructions/directions. Unless they give me very detailed, step-by-step instructions, I’ll fuck up somehow or misunderstand. Sometimes I’ll also wait for further instruction when it’s implied that I do something, only out of fear of doing something wrong. My boss seemed to be getting noticeably frustrated with me today for this reason. It makes me feel so stupid when I can’t complete a simple task with instructions any neurotypical would see as perfectly clear.I have been playing this game a lot lately and am loving it. However, seven gyms in I am starting to see a steady increase in difficulty. I’d rather just have fun with the game than fight the same leader 100 times with 5 different team combinations. I don’t want it to be so easy that I can wipe absolutely anything and everything effortlessly, though. I know what the password does, but my question is will the game still be enjoyable to a casual player? I read somewhere that even on litemode it’s still harder than any of the official games, which is good if it’s true. I just don’t want it to be too easy.I already know that programs are loaded into RAM before they are executed. What I’m not understanding is that when I double-click an executable, what exactly happens? How does the CPU know which area of the storage device stores that program so it can load it into memory?. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, please point me in the right direction if so.Throughout studying MBR partitioning and the FAT file systems, I’ve read everywhere that the file allocation table is stored in the first sector of the disk. However, I’ve also read everywhere that the MBR takes up the entire 512 bytes of the first sector, and the MBR only consists of three parts:Boot code (446 bytes)Partition table (64 bytes)MBR signature (2 bytes)If all of this is true, how can the MBR share a sector with the file allocation table on a non-Advanced Format disk? Is the FAT stored on the first sector of the volume rather than the first sector of the disk? Everywhere I have read says disk, but it just isn’t adding up for me.I have already purchased the adapter for the CPU cooler to fit the LGA1700 socket.* CPU: Intel i9-13900K (24 core, up to 5.8 GHz)* CPU Cooler: Corsair iCUE H150i ELITE CAPELLIX 75 CFM Liquid Cooler* Motherboard: Gigabyte Z790 AORUS ELITE AX ATX LGA1700* RAM: G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32 GB (16x2) DDR5-6000 CL36* Storage: 2TB Samsung 980 Pro, 4TB Seagate Barracuda Compute* GPU: EVGA FTW3 ULTRA GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24GB* Case: Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO ATX Mid Tower* PSU: Corsair HX1000 Platinum* Case fans: 10 including the three on the radiatorPCPartPicker points out no compatibility errors besides the previously mentioned issue with the cooler, as well as the following:* “The video card PCIe 16-pin power connector adapter is being supplied by three 6+2-pin connectors.

Should a mid ATX case be enough?. I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub, please redirect me if it is.I understand the concept of the HAL, and that it provides an interface between software and hardware so the software doesn’t have to know every little detail about every little piece of hardware from every manufacturer. However, I’ve read that in systems such as Windows, it’s implemented as a generic “driver” for things such as keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, etc. What about devices that use their own manufacturer supplied drivers, such as graphics cards? Do these devices have direct communication with the software, or do they still utilize HAL? I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around all the little details.I am currently a senior about to graduate high school. I wanted to share my story and ask for any advice.I live in a rural area and go to a small school (around 500 kids in the elementary and HS). Since our school is small, we don’t have a lot of money to budget towards the technology department. My school prioritizes athletics and other “non-essential” things more than the functions of the school itself, so we only have one person on our IT staff. That’s all they’re willing to pay.More to the point, the school recognized my abilities and asked me if I wanted to assist our one tech person. Of course I said yes, and I built a great bond working with him. He informed me of his old job at another nearby school district, where he was one of two IT employees. He said he could get me an interview with his boss, and almost instantly I submitted an application, resume, and cover letter. I was hired at the end of the interview.The job consists of spending the summer reimaging all school devices and setting everything up for the upcoming school year. When the school year starts, I’m essentially Level 1 helpdesk for all staff and students. On top of this, I’ll be assisting with system repairs and any projects my boss wants to get done.My question is, is there anything I need to know about starting out in the field? Also, does this sound like a good starting point to get into a better position at another company later? I am going to school for information technology as well as working full time, so will that schooling and experience be enough to get me into a sysadmin role when I graduate college?Any other advice is greatly appreciated. :). **EDIT: Since I can’t edit titles of a post, I’ll just put this here. I’m taking augmentin, not amoxicillin. It’s two drugs in one.**I have strep throat and was diagnosed augmentin (875mg amoxicillin with 125mg clavulanate potassium.) I just took my first pill with water and then ate yogurt and cereal. I don’t want to overeat but I also don’t want to take it on an empty stomach. Anyone ever had any issues with it?. My PC is fairly dated (my CPU is from 2008,) but for the most part it can run Minecraft decently. I started a Roguelike Adventures and Dungeons server with friends a while back, and for a while it was playable. However, the more we did in the world, the more load my computer was under, because I was running both a client and a server on the same machine, with each of those having around 4 gigabytes of RAM allocated to them. It got to a point where my CPU usage kept spiking up to 100% every few seconds, causing very annoying drops in FPS. My question is, are there any lighter packs that I can play with friends and still have a fun experience?Intel i7-920 Quad Core @ 2.6GHzGeForce GTX 77012 GB of RAM. I’ve been having this issue for a long time on my machine, and it’s really beginning to get on my nerves. Nearly every time I log onto my computer for the first time of the day, every few seconds my computer audio stutters, my screen locks up, and the screen flickers off and then back on. When it comes back on, I get a “Display driver stopped responding and has recovered” pop up balloon in the bottom left corner. This repeatedly happens every few seconds, and sometimes it even ends in my computer just crashing and my TV showing “no signal” (I use my TV as a monitor.) The computer does not reboot after that, and since I only get a “no signal” screen from my TV, I can’t give any kind of BSOD code. Here are my system specs:Windows 7 Pro 64-bitIntel Core i7-920 Quad Core @ 2.6GHzNVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 (don’t know how much VRAM but assuming that isn’t important here)12 gigs of DDR3 RAM (don’t know clock speed)This is a fairly old custom system I bought from a friend a while back. It’s been great for me until it started doing this, and I’ve looked all over for a solution, even went as far as making some changes to the registry, and nothing.Before anyone asks, yes, I have already tried updating the driver. No luck.
    I would love to be outgoing, but i don't go outside. I have anxiety and i feel judged a lot by my family. Whenever i have a free weekend i would love to do something, go to the movies or go drink something. I'm tired of gaming all the time or hang around in the supermarket just to be around people. I missed out on so many movies, stores that had great sales but were too far away for me to go alone to. I haven't even left my home country ever in my life. I would love to leave with a plane for once or just go to neighbouring countries. I can't help but look back on my life and think about the things i missed out on.They both used to hit me. My dad when i stepped out the car from behind on my ass and my sister when i stepped into her room slapping my face. My parents divorced when i was 9 and my dad had to pick me up once a week by courts orders. When i wasn't a minor anymore he slowly stopped picking me up. I just see him like maybe 4 times a year. My sister just openly dislikes me, we are complete oppisites and she hates that. She says my depression is fake and treats me like a stranger. I only get invited to her house at birthdays and newyears. I never see them, they ignore me and are just never there for me. It's the same as them being dead as they are never there for me anyways. I can never count on them, i feel no attachment to them at all.This is a genuine question, is it because i want their approval? Mostly with my sister, she doesn't want anything to do with me but i still want to do things with her. I don't have any friends and she's the only choice of company i have. I loathe her but i still want her love. She used to abuse me and constantly mock me, but everyday i wake up wanting to do something with her. She always does things with the people at her work or her boyfriend and i get so jealous.Just tried to make cookies and it's going wrong, i try to draw and it's going wrong. And the feeling there's always someone that's better than me. I never excel in anything, people can never brag about anything when they talk about me. Don't go to school and at work there's people doing nothing that get a lot of praise. The slightest thing goes wrong and i have a breakdown. A line gets drawn wrong and i can't draw for weeks, a batch of cookies or a cake fails and i can't look at the baking products in a store.Tomorrow i have a day off from work and i offered we should go then, my mother says she has to get some 'groceries' and my sister simply didn't want to go on friday, because why?? No reason. I've been complaining i have been doing nothing all year and the second time this year, they go without me. I had to work today and they go by train so i had no idea if i would make it. That's why friday would be a better option. The only good thing is i woke up home alone and never felt more peaceful. Having no mother home today was such a blessing. Could eat what i want without any remarks and could do what i want without feeling i was being watched 24/7.And i'm so sick of her telling me this. Every time i tell her i'm sad or not feeling too good, she says to just get over it. My mother says to just 'smile' to get over it. If it was that easy, i would just do it. But that's not how it works. They don't understand, that everytime i see a car, i want to get hit by it so i don't have to feel burdened anymore. I find it so ignorant that my sister who works with people that cannot live on their own, because of their mental health, say that depression is just not real.He always does everything for her. He always rides her wherever she wants to go, he goes to her house to drink with her, he always talks about her achievements and he only calls her. I once asked him to drive me home in a code red storm where i saw people fall of their bikes, and he said he didn't want to lose his parking spot in front of his house. He once let me walk home alone when i was a minor after midnight in the dark. But when my sister needs a ride for her nail appointment 5 minutes away, he will drive her without question. He has 2 children, but he will always prefer her. I wouldn't care less if he passed away right now. He already acts like he doesn't exist in my life so it wouldn't make a lot of difference.It's been 535 days and she has not gotten a skin since her battle cat skin. It's been over a year and i would have expected a bit more since she's gotten really popular after arcane. Also only 2 of her skins have been on sale this year. I would have liked to see her have a skin in the street demon or soul fighter skinline, maybe even a coven skin would be kind of cool.I work 9 hours a week and that's the only time i'm outside. The people at my job don't talk to me, even though i try to make contact. I haven't been to school for 1,5 years now. My family is very distant with me. Saturday i went to the same supermarket 3 minutes from my house, 3 different times that day, just to be around people. I live in a very small town with minimal options for jobs/activities. I try to make friends but then i ask them to do something and they ghost me. I feel no point in being alive if i can't even leave the house.I'm crying over the fact that my mom is cycling through the rain right now, i don't even think about that shit all the time, but now it just started raining and i just could not stop crying. I started thinking about the people working outside and it got even worse. I feel like i'm going crazy right now. Usually i don't even think about it but it just started pouring and so did my eyes. I feel like i'm genuinely losing it.Just slept my whole day away, insanely depressed right now. There goes another sunday, can't even go to the supermarket anymore because i can't go to fucking sleep at night. Because i never do shit and i'm never tired. Missed 3 entire meals today.They send me a message and they were clear in what they wanted. I was just trying to give some advice, but from what they told me they went through horrible things. I hoped to offer soms help or relieve so they wouldn't do this. They deleted all of their messages on reddit and profile picture. At the end of the conversation she thanked me for all the messages and said this was their last conversation. Reddit did not send me a notification on time so i had no time to reply before they did it. I feel a bit conflicted and idk how to feel rn.I never really leave the house and i have a tremendous amount of anxiety. I only leave the house for some hours of work and i don't go to school. I think i may be bisexual, because whenever i think about being with another woman i don't really mind it in my head. The problem for me is i never really have had the chance to experiment with other people. I'm about to turn 22 and i know people can discover their sexuality on all kind of ages, but for me personally i would love to find out what it would be for myself. Whenever i watch a tv show or in public i usually notice the woman first, but i also look at the men accompanying that woman. i just don't know if it's a phase, or if i'm in my head too much. I live in quite the small town with not a lot of ways to go out. The nearest McDonald's is a 25 minutes cycling away to just give an example. I have been thinking about these things to way too long and it's just driving me crazy.Every time i simply complain she's always there to remind me she's there to cook me dinner or that she has given me a roof above my head. It's literally the most minimal thing a parent has to do for their child. I know people have it worse than me, i know that. But it's always her saying 'be happy i cook you dinner and you're living under my roof.' She herself decided to have me and now years later, she just loves to complaint about it. The thing is she does nothing more than that. She cooks and cleans the house, but that's it. For the rest she just sits next to the tv and dares to call me a phone addict, while she is unable to put the remote down. After i turned around 12/13 we stopped doing things. I would love to move out but i only have 2 euro to my name.. That's it. No happy memories. I haven't had a day in my life where everything went well. I don't really have any context or something, my life has just always been shitty.When i say i didn't like my youth, she starts saying how terrible hers was. I was sick last week and she kept talking about the times she was sick. I don't like my job and she starts to talk about her own job experiences. I don't have a good relationship with my sister and she begins about her relationship with her brothers. Why is it so hard for her to have some empathy for me? She never listens to me and she just doesn't care. My parent never saw potential in me, they didn't care enough about me to put me on any sports or something else. I never even left the country i live in. By always keeping me inside i started to grow anxiety, afraid to even go to the store alone and not being able to maintain a proper friendship. My sister and i have a dysfunctional relationship, she doesn't love me and never will. If we weren't born in the same family we would probably have never spoken a single word to each other. Friendships usually lasts only a year and they all leave me. They think i'm too introverted and quiet and would rather spend time with other people.This has stopped me from opening up to people. I stopped going to school and i have a simple job in retail. I sleep through the day and i'm awake at night. I have no talent because i never had the chance to develop myself. I'm just rotting away in my room. Just had to vent, for anyone reading, ty for listening! ♡. Anyone else too anxious to go to a doctor? It's a 3 minute bike ride from my house and i can even make an appointment online, but still i'm too afraid to go. How can i fix this??. And i hate it. Sometimes i just numb all my feelings, no sadness, no happiness and just nothing. Recently i've been starting to hate everything again. I hate my life and how i'm doing nothing so there's no progress in my life. I hate my empty bank account and my shitty retail job. I hate my family and that they put no effort in me. I thought i could hide away the depression by just not feeling anything, but nothing just helps. I'm too anxious to go to a doctor for any therapy.I never get sick and i'm still not rid of it, it's a cold but it was so bad friday, that it felt like the entire house was spinning. Saturday i had a massive fever, i kept saying to my mom how i didn't want to work and i felt like i had fever of 40 degrees celsius. It was just ignored and i felt terrible the whole day. Sunday it was just coughing the whole day and i could barely swallow and i was out of breath after taking 2 steps. I saw my sister and father monday and also mentioned this, my sister just said to get out of her way with all this sickness and my dad did not even react. Still coughing like crazy today and nobody is taking the effort to ask how i am. This just makes me wonder how it would be if something even worse would happen. I just wish for some empathy from them. I have no friends, so i've just been really sad this whole weekend.I do this shit because i'm never tired, so i lay in bed and sleep my whole day away. I have no friends so i just lay in bed all day. It's not me trying to be lazy, i would love to be outgoing and spending my day outside. It's terrible, having my window open while i hear people and i'm almost stuck to my bed. Instagram is my only source of collecting photocards and the recent button for the hashtags was a blessing in disguise. The new update however, removed it and i am still seeing posts from juni. I used to have an apk but even those are updated now. I'm so desperate.I know those tag account exist but not for every group i follow so it's harder to find these posts.I always thought that when people were talking about a depression room it meant not putting away a couple of cups and a pile of clothes.I think it's been 2 years of me living in a gigantic mess. I just can't do it. I have no parental support or any friends. I have 0 motivation to clean. My desk is starting to break and my desk chair has been broken.My schedules are f*cked up. I fell asleep at 12, woke up at 1 again, fell asleep again and now i've been awake since 4 in the morning. It's almost 6 and everything is just shit. I'm just staring at the wall being wide awake for the past hours. I miss socializing with people even though i was being bullied at the time. People always have these stores to tell about things that happened in their life but i just don't. It makes me feel like i've missed out on this gigantic part in my life. I missed a whole part of my youth and that just makes me insanely depressed. I wish i had a better relationship with my father and sister. I think a group of friends would have helped so much. It would have not made me suicidal and depressed and want to hurt myself or cry myself to sleep when i was only 14 years old. Looking at a group of friends just makes me instantly jealous, why do i have to be the one that's been alone for years. I want to explore my sexuality, but i can't do that if i never leave the house.The front door has like a gigantic wall in front of it making it impossible to leave the house, it's because of my anxiety. I'm just at a loss and i don't know what to do.My sister got everything handed to her and is still complaining about the smallest things. Bank account is loaded and still talking about affording the cheapest stuff. She used to hit me until i was 14 and is still emotionally abusing me, while she's almost 30. She bought a house around the corner on purpose to live close by my mother and she keeps visiting every other day just boasting about her life. She just keeps neglecting my issues and saying my depression is fake and my own fault.With albums coming out with a lot of pobs, i cannot afford to collect every member anymore and every group getting an individual album cover, it's sometimes hard to choose for me which version to get. Sometimes when i think i have chosen my bias i see a video of another member and i start doubting it again. The only bias that has never changed for me is Ateez Hongjoong.I used to go to sleep at 11 in the morning and wake up at 6 around dinnertime. Already terrible. Now i have a new job which is so mentally draining, whenever i come home i'm exhausted even though i barely do something there. It's just filling the shelves for 3 hours and go home. There is no music or anything and the staff barely talks, so i'm alone with my thoughts all the time. I'm already stressen about things like my bank account and the future which is adding up to my mental exhaustion. Now whenever i'm tired i'm just exhausted. I take naps at night and wake up around the middle of night, then i eat something and i go to sleep again. There are also moments i'm suddenly wide awake. Right now i went to sleep at 3 because i could barely stand anymore, woke up at 5 again by my mom going to the bathroom, woke up at 10 and now going back again to wake up at 3. This is how most of my nights are and it's just making me very sad.I have no school, a 12 hour job, no friends and family that are there for me, i live in a small town, fucked up sleep schedule and too anxious to go to the doctor. I come awake at night and i sleep through the day. I only work 3 evenings and a saturday morning and that's everything i do in a week. I would love to do things but for one i'm broke and i have nobody to do things with me. I have a lot of anxiety and i have some health issues that i would like to get diagnosed. I am too afraid to go to the doctor alone but i have no one to come with me. I have no idea what to do.I've just started a new job last evening at a retail store and it started out fine. I have 5 years of prior experience in jobs in different fields. I worked at a movie theater for one year and 2 different supermarkets one for 3 years and one for one year. I have learned that every store has a different approach of managing their staff. I had to work a 6-9 evening shift and i had to wait 1,5 hour to actually start working without any explanation of what i actually had to do. Part of the problem is that the manager just kept talking without end with other staff. She assigned a worker to train me but he just walked away and didn't say a word. I tried asking questions but i just got some half assed answers. The whole evening i just felt like some shadow standing there. I tried doing things but i had no idea if what i was doing was right. I have no idea how to continue with this job the next few weeks.I can't do it. I've been crying for an hour. I'm too scared to do it i just can't walk in there im terrified . Also just had an anxiety attack with shortness of breath and i've been sweating like crazy. I'm so scared i'm stuck to my bed. The moment the person said i had to start today i have been thinking about this exact moment. My head has been filled with anxiety and i just want to stay home. I even cried a couple days ago because my head was filled with dozen of thoughts of me starting there. No one is supporting me which adds to all the nervousness. I just want to stay home, play some games and draw a bit. I know i have to earn money but it's just too nerve wrecking right now. I have had a bad feeling about today before i even had to start. People around me think i'm just exaggerating and whiny when i say this to them but my head has been overflowing with thoughts, stress and nervousness. I am just not in the right mental state at the moment to start a new job, but i'm also down to my last couple of money which just adds to the stress that i cannot fuck up there.Even when listening to the most upbeat music i get teary eyed. I was just thinking about the upcoming week and i got tears in my eyes, even just writing this i get tears. I was just eating dinner with my mom and i suddenly get tears in my eyes. I just can't stop it. They have these polo t-shirts and i was already like fuck me, can't do anything now to relieve stress 🫡. I live in a constant panic attack. I want to go to a doctor but nor alone. I haven't gone in 10 years but i desperatly need it. I have a constant fear of people leaving me and shutting me out. I feel so lost. I start a new job in a couple days but i don't wanna go because i feel so overwhelmed. I usually take a nap around 7, but with the hot weather and it cooling down at night, i can only take a nap around that time. So i suddenly fall asleep at 8/9 in the morning and wake up around 4 in the afternoon. I have undiagnosed depression and maybe it has something to do with that. I had a regular sleep schedule a year ago, but i quit going to school and i only had work in the evening hours (7 to 11). That resulted in me basically never being really tired. And if i'm bored i just decide to take a nap for 30/45 minutes, but always feel really drowsy after those naps. Could someone give me some advice with what i should do?. For my ult group, i would give Everglow a song with a strong dance break and a rap that's around 2 verses long for both Aisha and E:U. I give them a mini album followed up by a single and their first full album to give them back their rightful place in fourth gen. Since they already did a pirate concept, i would give them something with robots/futuristic like a mix between Alexa - bomb and Aespa girls. Their pre-release would be something like Taylor Swift - LWYMMD to show everyone that they didn't come to mess around now that they would be having a cb and Yiren would be the center in that song after all the hate she got.Give me your ideas for the groups or soloist you miss!. I have no one and it has been like that for my entire life. I have been to 7 different schools and 6 different jobs and not one place where someone actually liked me. I really tried at my last school, i stepped out of my comfort zone and i tried to talk to everyone. Nobody cared and after 1 month i got sick and i never went again. At the job i just got fired, i had people i really liked, but it turned out they all have been going out without me. Family doesn't care and just blames me for the depression. I wish someone would just run me over with a car and drive away.I'm just in shock right now and i don't know what to do. Apparently they are going shopping, going to the movies and having picknicks. They also have been talking in a group chat without me. They have been making all these plans without me. I have no other friends and i genuinely thought these people were becoming my friends. I'm at a loss for words right now. My family dislikes me, my dog died 2 years ago and i have no friends. I have no one and this just proves i don't belong anywhere once again. Does anyone know where i could buy the old bd merchandise? I started collecting their bd md when the hj earrings came out, but i would loveee to buy the order ones (for a normal price ofcourse).This week has been one of the worst for my mental state. I keep waking up at 6 at the start of the evening and my whole day is gone, which causes me to fall back into a terrible depression. I am never tired. I'm legit saying that i am never tired. I never step out of the house so i am never tired. I need to see a therapist but due to severe anxiety i can't go alone. My mom treates this like a joke or just doesn't react. Usually she thinks i blame her for all this, when i haven't even said a word to her. She just wants all the attention. My dad and i aren't speaking and my sister used to hit me until i was 13 and now just does verbally. I have no friends and i don't go to school, i also got fired a couple days ago and my bank account is almost empty. I used to get bullied until i was 19 and that was a big reason of me quitting school. Because i never left the house, i never got to find out what i want to do in life. I sleep all my days away. Now i'm just about to cry again, because i missed the damn rain. I'm so sick of everything. Can a car just take my life.
    I haven't been okay in a long time. But it's just so much easier to say "I'm okay" instead of the truth: the world feels too heavy to bear, my mind is tangled in a veil of negativity, and I feel like I'm at my best hiding away and being asleep. Sometimes I don't know which emotions are from the real me or if it's my depression raging. I guess I told myself the lie of being okay so much that I don't really know what's true anymore.
    I'm quitting caffeine, I'm quiting junk food, I'm working out, I'm quitting pills that I shouldn't take. I'm quitting porn, and random sexting and sex that keeps me empty, I'm quitting bad friendships that just drain me.I have an objective, I have a dream, I'm going back to college for my second degree, I'm hoping I can leave my country to find a new life in a better one. I have a dream, and I'm going to make it true, I'm alive, I won't give up, I'll win my own war against myself. It's been like... 2 or 3 months? I get this weird pressure in my neck, my eyes gets tears, and the feelings gets harder to contain, my voice break down, and I can't breath. But I remember my mom voice telling me that I can't cry, my dad angry cuz I cried too much when I was a kid. And then suddenly everything stops, my feeling turn to stone and my eyes gets dry. I guess that boys don't cry. It was my mom favorite time of the year, and it's the first Halloween that I won't watch my favorites movies because we used to watch them together. I set up a date to, un alive myself, and for some time, that helped me. But Halloween is coming, and the void, is calling me. I got some time to kill. I always thought that dates like this were stupid. But I lost my North that day, so I guess it's the perfect day. December 10, that's it. I'm about to go hollow. My pass is: helpme. Everyday I think about killing myself. And everyday, I text random people here, talking and hearing their problems. It's draining, helping people when in reality you want to die too...I keep having these nightmares, about something I want to forget, I got fever (again) I don't have anyone to call.My therapist say I have to start working on it, or he will place me on a mental hospital, jokes on him, I can't pay it. I always end up venting here in reddit. I want to talk, I really want to, but I can't. I feel like I'm wearing an armor, but the second that I take it out I'll fall apart. Honestly I don't know what to think. I forgave her, for everything, but I still feel like.... I don't know. It's so draining, but the void and loneliness push me to keep trying, but... The void just get bigger. Why, why can't I just end it ??. But I can't let my mom go. Before my mom died, she told me that I could have inherited her borderline personality. I've been running from this for a long time, but I guess I have to face it. If I have it, I'll fucking end myself. I snapped at the big boss of my company in the middle of a meeting. I just couldn't keep my mouth shut. So... I guess I'll say it here. Saturday, I mastered a call of Cthulhu campaign, and well, it was great, I had the fun that I was craving for months. I even found my longboard, that I haven't used in years, so I went for a ride Sunday morning, I don't know how, but I made a 3km ride.Yesterday I worked out, and I manage to raise my record, I made my full routine with 26 kg.Somehow, the void is still here. But well, I guess I'll have to keep fighting. Ok, I have to say it, I don't know if I want to keep on fightingI've been trying to help people here, talk and chatting. I've been working out, Ive been trying to reconnect with my old friends. I decided that I want to live, and I got rid of my plans to end myself. But the void is still here.Ok, I have to say it, I don't know if I want to keep on fightingI've been trying to help people here, talk and chatting.

I decided that I want to live, and I got rid of my plans to end myself. But the void is still here.And after weeks of trying, I finally got rid of the pills and insuline pens I was planning to use to end myself. I feel free. I remember that sunny day, at my mom funeral, I saw him again. After more than 10 years. Smiling, making everything about himself. Knife in my pocket, I wanted to kill him. Instead I holded the blade in my hand, I cuted deep. I still remember the pain in my hand, I wanted to kill him. And I still want to.I don't want to heal from this rage. I was molested by my step dad when I was a kid, and we'll, I got some anger issues. How you do deal with this?.
    The PhoenixShe shines so bright there will never be another night.Feathers blaze so wildly she brings the sun to envy. Her warmth without equal. Her wings unbound. Beauty unparalleled. Simply the best creature to ever exist it would be a crime against the whole humanity, for her to be temporary. She is the human condition, incarnate. She must never disappear.I dont deserve to do anything, and I don't deserve help.Not in the way you might think, I don't feel small. I don't feel meaningless, I don't feel inconsequential. I relate to these creatures so beyond human comprehension. That their mirror presence drives other creatures to madness. I was born in the far plains, outside of this universe. No care or ability to understand any other form of life, for any other purpose than tools. Unfeeling, without rationality or reason. My life feels infinite, I wish only to return to nothingness. Where ever I go is followed by chaos and ruin. Goals and plans unknown to all including myself. The mortals of this plain hate me, and I hate them. Why do they get to laugh don't they understand I'm incapable of it. Why do they get to smile, when I only have a beek? Why do they get to know warmth, when all I've ever felt is the vast cold desolate of space. Why is it okay to ruin me, why do I have to feel empathy for any of you? None of you ever tried to look through my eyes.This door is always open for you, If you ever wanted to. I would reach out to you, but I only know your one reddit account.It's okay I understand. I knew I would do this, I told you from day one I would fuck this up. Well i just want you to know. I have only kind things to say about you. Whenever someone asks about that plush. I'll say that's from the kind, smart, funny, cute, and absolutely gorgeous German girl. That tried her absolute best to help me. I told you once I will always champion you and I intend to uphold that, sorry again. (This is just a goodbye, I'll be okay). Can't we just talk like we used to, can't we complain about loneliness together. Cant we go back to escaping into each other's fantasies. Yes I lied to you, but it was all real to me. I couldn't have been as bad as you say. You liked me once.I deleted everything that wasn't true. That was wrong I am sad, but I shouldn't use that against you. I know you have other ways to view my account. I really will be thinking about that dock in my final moments. I really do want to have a happy memory on that dock. It wasn't all lies it was like 60% truthful. When I talked over the phone that was all truthful.I don't know what those things are, I know I felt something. I don't know what being a friend is like I've never had a real one till now. I don't know what love is, I thought I felt it but I guess I never did. How am I supposed to know what I don't experience. I tried i really did. I lied to you at first, cause at first I assumed you were fake and lying too, cause this is the Internet. Then I assumed you had some kind of alternative motive, cause no has ever offered me that before. When the package came, I was filled with guilt cause I realized it was all real. I just felt a lot of things for the first time, that I've never felt before. I don't know any of the rules that go along with it. I know for sure that I fucked up. I know now I shouldn't have ever lied to you.If that's what you need after what I did to you, I understand. It wasn't an entire lie, there was truth through out this as well. You're right I should have came clean, when you told me I was having a negative impact on you. The lies went on for way too long, I never liked doing that to you. When you went quiet I didn't think you ever coming back, I needed to tell you. Thank you for your kindness, I dont deserve it. Thank you for the moments of tenderness we shared, those were real. Thank you for my first date, even if it was imaginary. Thank you for the gifts. Thank you for post card. Thank you for these tears. For what its worth I wish I didn't fuck it all up, and hurt you.I was never doing this out of spite, it just snow balled to a point where I lost control. I was feeling a lot of emotions for the first time in my life. Though I've always been depressed, and thought life was pointless. I still wouldn't take my life. I just thought it was the way to keep you in my life. I thought all I could offer you was a victim. You became a victim of me, that wasn't what I wanted. That is what I did though and I have to live with that. I apologize for lying and manipulating you. I'm sorry for making you mourn me multiple times. You did not deserve this, and I did not deserve your friendship. I wish I was just honest with you from the start after getting to know you, I know you would have stayed. You went above and beyond for me, every day you were my shining sun to look forward to.I'm starting to panic that you aren't coming back, I'm afraid I ruined my only friendship. I'm sorry please comeback whatever it was it was my fault. Just please comeback. Im so fuckin lost and scared without you. I don't have any idea what I'm even doing, Please be okay. Sorry if I freak you out by freaking out. I just want to talk to you again, talking to you is so nice. You're the only one left.I can't help myself. I can't even help you to help me. Professionals couldn't do anything for me. I'm at a loss.Have you ever heard the tale of the pig and the swan? There was a buietful and elegant swan that was the pride of the swamp. She would sit in the center of the clearest pond. There was a fat hairy pig, that would roll in the mud of the ponds. One day the pig laid eyes on the beautiful swan. For the first time in his life he had a strong desire to swim, just to be in her presence. So each day he would waid into the pond deeper and deeper. Building his stamina for the trip, to the heart of the clearest pond. He was prepared, he began to swim, short pleasant kicks. Mid way the pig realizes the pond is a lot deeper, and the swan is a lot further. Calm tired strokes (he's almost there), neck is tired from holding his snout out of the water. (He's so close he can see the gentle ripples of her wake) excitedly he kicks a little faster, his neck gives out, with one exhilarated inhale water flows in. His excited kicks turn to paniced thrashing, his tired body screams and rages against the pond. The swan was never aware of the pig. His lungs full, he lays at the bottom of the pond just as dead as his dreams.Ive lost my reasons to live, I've lost the things I enjoyed doing, I feel like I'm on my way to losing my only friend. I feel entirely powerless to change any of it. My days feel like weeks, I can hardly even sleep. I'm terrified constantly, I think of escape constantly. You told me I had the power to make good things happen. I have no such power, the power I have is to ruin. My only reprieves from my mind, is when I think of you but you don't want to hear about that. I'm not even worthy of thinking of you. Letting go would feel so good it would change everything for the better.I haven't been able to sleep for two days because of a combination of overwhelming guilt and anxiety from various things. Mostly because a close friend wants me to be better, and I just don't feel like I can improve right now. I broke a promise to her, and I feel absolutely miserable.This is all I'll ever know, there was never reason to think otherwise. I was born to entertain others with suffering. I do not get to have anything I want out of life. I am a play thing of agony, a voodoo doll for others to stick pins in. That laughter you barrow from me, was hammered and forged in sarrow. I am not allowed to free myself from this hell. I will never find any good in this world. Eat of my intrails for I am immortal.I lose thats all I do, I will never win im clearly the villain. Why would I ever think any otherwise, why want for anything. My life still hasn't taught me this lesson, I guess it has to stab it into to my mind. Well I get it now I wish I didn't have hope. All it does is prod me up the same mountain, I've fallen from time and time again just so I can fall from it again. I am wrong to want for anything.My life is still empty, I am without purpose. I have hobbies and interests. I care for my pets though I love them and they help. They do not make a full life, it's all just so dam boring. Seems like my days last forever, filled with trivial activities. I've never felt so dam alone. I walk in the door and the emptiness is overburdening, it's presence never leaves me. A full day, isn't a good day.I have nothing to look forward to, the people who used to be my reason for living no longer are, no one's is sexually or romantically interested in me. I don't see a reason to keep forcing myself though a life where there's nothing positive in it. A promise I guess, but I'd rather just be done with it all. I'm alone, my needs unsatisfied, no one talks to me. I sit in an empty house with my pets being my only company for sometimes days.What if there really isn't anyone else for me? I don't want live a life on my own. I'm sick of being alone, you're the only person in a year in a half that cared. You made me feel attractive, you made me feel good. I felt like I was worth something again. No one else sees me like you do. I understand, and accept it can't be you. I don't blame you this is my own responsibility. What if there isn't anyone else though, I don't want to go back to how I used to feel.They tell me I'm attractive, they say I have desirable qualitys, they say I'm sweet. So then why am I alone, why can't I find anyone that sees what they do. I've been actively trying for a year and half. I understand I have my flaws but are they really so bad to scare everyone away. I have realistic standards, I'm not expecting a supermodel. I've seen men far worse off than me do far better. So what the fuck is so wrong with me?. First time I'm feeling these feelings in my life, and I don't know how to verbalize or express them. I'm not like that, I wouldn't do that. I didn't know I was seeming like that kind of person. That one night I knew I went too far though. I regreted, and apologized imedently after I said it. This isn't ruined doesn't need repair, I'm just hurt. You were right to voice it. Though the times you voice things makes them extremely cutting. Sometimes it's like you get my hopes up, just to dash them back down with the next thing you say. You're still my friend.I'm not good enough to keep, hardly good enough to even be played with. A loose playing card, no deck in sight. They pick me up flip me front to back, then fling me aside. I don't even get the satisfaction of being someone else's satisfaction. Not even a toy, just a trivial curiosity. Just interesting enough to catch your eye, and make you think only to be discarded.I've never felt like this in my life, generally I'm so wholesome. Lately though all my thoughts are lewd, I'm sorry but when we talk. I just think how it would feel to squeeze you, how your breasts would feel in my hands. How soft your ass would feel in my palm, I just want to grab your hips. I want to kiss you long and hard. I want to hug you nice and tight. I want to feel you on it. I've tried to shake it, but it won't leave me.You talk to me when you're down which I appreciate. I don't know what I'm supposed to do though. I understand you can't tell me everything, and I respect that. I try to tell you the bright side you just double down. I try to laugh with you but you aren't laughing. I try to distract you, you want no part in it. It hurts to hear you're sad (please don't stop telling me though) and to know I can't do anything to pick you up. I'll always champion you, I know whatever it is you can handle it. I just wish I could do anything, to help you.I really enjoyed our talk, though I have always struggled with talking. You made me feel more comfortable, than most people do. Which might not sound like a lot but it is. I live my entire life in fear, I am nervous almost constantly. I'm constantly anticipating rejection. For once I felt accepted and it felt so good. I can't wait for the day, when we can both say that we're good, and genuinely mean it.I don't think this is curable, I don't think I'm coming out of this. I was born to be what I am now, and that's how I'll die. Nothing meaningful what so ever completely pointless. I've had so much time to correct this, I'm not sure I want to. Seems a whole lot easier to just give, and accept who I am now. I used to think there was a void inside. All I am is a void, I am just a collection of everything I lack. I lack everything.I'm going to, unless you tell me not to. Just seems like Ive hurt you a lot, in the short time I've known you. I don't want to stick to you like a leach, I want to nourish you. When I try the things you try for me, they do not work. I think we both need very different things. I would love if I could give you whatever it is, that you need. So should I really stay? It seems like all I do is ruin your day, I don't like that I'm doing that to you.You don't have to be this perfect paragon of a person, to deserve someone that appreciates you. You're already such a great person, even though I don't think you like when I tell you that. Don't give up on finding someone that loves you, someone that nurtures you in a time of need. It's okay to depend on people, we all do sometimes, I depend on you sometimes. You cant be strong and independent every waking moment. Adults like to think we're all grown up, but in reality we're just taller children. We still throw tantrums, cry, scream, belittle, ignore, and run when stressed. Though I wish it was more likely to be me, who ever your partner turns out to be will also depend on you. So don't let this stop you from dating. Nothing would make me happier than if you found someone you can depend on. Though it would hurt at first cause I do love you, I still want to see you happy even if it's not with me.No one looks at me, the way I look at them. No one cares about my day, no one wants to know. I can write a book on a few people, I doubt they could even write a sentence on me. Everyone looks like they have so much fun playing with one another, why will no one play with me? I know I'm not the hottest, smartest, strongest, or most humours. I'm not worthless at least I don't think so, why doesn't any one value me? "Why do you need someone, focus on self love." Is it so bad to need to be wanted? Do I not get to feel wanted? Sure I'm not great, but I'm not that bad either. I have value, I'm not worthless am I? What the fuck is so dam wrong with me, that none of you want me. I just want to feel wanted.
    Okay, so I struggle with this internal dialogue a lot and I haven't been able to find much to help me through my thinking, so I was wondering if anyone might be able to offer their thoughts. I am not sure how to articulate this, but I want to be clear I am in no way trying to dismiss the very real, very painful, and very lived experience that having depression is. However, I find myself berrating myself and going around in circles in my mind when it feels that I cannot get out of bed to drink water because everything feels awful in my mind, and there are millions of people around the world without drinking water. When I think of the horrific inter ational disasters happening around the world, how am I convinced my life is not worth living, when I am safe and warm with plenty of food around me? I am a regular person, but with many luxuries in comparison to so many else. I feel so guilty for having the thoughts that I do, when I know there is so much serious harm going on in the world. I understand this is something to discuss with a therapist, probably, but I do not have that access at the moment.Does anyone else have these sort of thoughts or feel their depression is such a 'first world problem'? I would be grateful to hear what you think. Thank you.Would it be Bleib hydratisiert ? Google translate came up with ‘trinke genug’ so I was wondering if there was a more idiomatic way of saying this? Thank you for your help in advance!. Look I have no idea if this the right place to post this and there might be better places to let this out but internet, I don’t know what else to do. I feel like I’m screaming and asking my friends for help when I am at a really low point in my life and everyone tells me I am strong and capable and I feel fucking weak right now. I don’t know what to do, where to turn to, or how to keep on going like this. I feel fucking burnt out and I want to give up and let go and even when I talk to people about this, it’s like they don’t really understand. I want someone to sit with me and hold my hand and tell me it’s going to be okay, that I am doing enough and they’re proud of me and I just don’t know how the fuck I’m going to keep on going like this just constantly feeling so low and upset and angry but no one is really listening. I swear as a child I heard a version of "Insomnia" by Faithless (1995) which included the word "egg" in the lyrics, an egg in the fridge? Now, this may be a mishearing of "potato" in the fridge... but then a friend confirmed the same thing insisting there was another version of the song with the word "egg" in the lyrics. Okay so I have tried to look this up online already but keep coming up short! If anyone can help me with this I'd appreciate not thinking I'm going crazy lol. Hi everyone! I'm looking for recommendations for any books on Japanese culture and philosophy. I picked up "Japonisme" by Erin Longhurst on a whim (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39890430-japonisme)...and although the book itself is quite a nice object and gives a good flavour for Japanese philosophy and lifestyle, I was underwhelmed by the level of sophistication in it. It touches on many different aspects such as ikigai, wabi-sabi, kintsugi, shinrin-yoku, calligraphy and shukanka. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated thank you!. To MumI wish I could be there with you today mum. I know that it’s been really hard for you. I can’t imagine what it must have been like to turn 25 without your mum, and now your daughter is turning 25 and you can’t be the mum to her either. Maybe this year was the year you were hoping you could be there. You tried with meI am special because I am the child that you could actually be there forBut you are still so emotionally distant and I don’t blame you But I miss you mama I am your baby screaming and crying and I want you and I wish you could be there to wipe away my tears. When the nurse looked at me and told me that you are my mum so of course you want to know what’s wrong with your baby. Your other girls weren’t there And you tried so hard with the othersYou loved as much as you were able And accepted any love This isn’t about dadFor once this isn’t about him I love my dad but what I would write to him so a different letter And maybe there is a third letter addressed to both of you. Your baby is crying and she needs it’s mama’s love So badly And I can’t imagine the pain you must feel if I am feeling like this.Hey everyone so I've played a couple of Zelda games in the past on my Nintendo DS and I was really excited to start playing BOTW. I'm really not 'fluent' in video games and I'm finding this game really really challenging. I'm about to start from the beginning again having learned a lot from my first try but what help or advice can anyone give to help me feel like I'm better at this game! Thank you so much 🌈. Heyy, just wondering what other's experiences of washing their merch is like... wanna make sure I'm keeping my FBZ jumper as fresh as possible and not accidentally ruin it or sth! Anyone just thrown it in with their normal wash or does it need extra care?. Könnte jemand mir die Bedeutung dieser beiden Sätze erklären? Englisch oder Deutsch geht :). Have been feeling pretty low today and something that makes me feel better is looking into new music. Have heard a couple earthgang songs before but listened properly today to more and I fucking love the music they're making - just wanted to share the love.What's your favourite song?Edit: thanks everyone for your suggestions - looking forward to diving deeper 🔥. I can't stop thinking about my dachshund baby, Hercules, who died last October. I really miss him so much and keep wondering when it will feel better. He was my absolute best friend and always was there to comfort me; honestly this dog meant so f**King much to me. I'm sometimes wonder how a dog could have had so much impact on me. Yeah, sorry I just needed to get that off my chest ✌️ (edit spelling). Hey everyone ✌️ getting high this evening listening to some deep House and came here looking for some recommendations. Can't wait to see what gems I find 💎 🔥 is there anyone else who finds deep house really relaxing? I listen to it a lot when I want to chill out or calm my nerves. No one I've met feels this so I was just wondering if anyone else gets that 🌿. 'Das muss eine Demokratie aushalten können'The sentence is the title of a song by a German group called Waving the Guns ([https://genius.com/Waving-the-guns-das-muss-eine-demokratie-aushalten-konnen-lyrics](https://genius.com/Waving-the-guns-das-muss-eine-demokratie-aushalten-konnen-lyrics))I was confused why there is the extra 'können' at the end, and how this would translate into English.Answers in German or English are great :) danke im Voraus!. Also, ich schreib' auf Deutsch weil ich mein Deutsch verbessern will... ich bin Engländerin und heiße Victoria 😊 ich weiß nicht, ob hier der richtige Ort ist aber ... ich möchte einen Sprechpartner/in! Ich habe Deutsch an der Uni in Grossbritannien studiert und für fast 2 Jahren in Berlin gewohnt. Ich liebe die Deutsche Sprache und Deutsch Kultur und wie die Junge Leute, die ich erkennen habe, wann ich in Deutschland war, sind. Ich wohne seit Januar in London und das bedeutet, leider habe ich für meine deutsche Sprache keine Möglichkeit mehr zu üben. Wenn du Lust hast, mit mir sprechen zu sprechen, kannst du mir schrieben. Wäre cool :) Als ich junger war, hatte ich Brieffreunde und ich habe mich es immer gefreut von ihnen zu lernen! Vielleicht kennen wir uns 😊. I lived abroad for the past two years and my parents looked after my dog whilst I was away. I'm now living in London and unfortunately can't have my dog back yet. My parents love him and he's very happy there I just miss my baby so much!! Looking at all the happy photos of everyone's dogs on here helps me miss him less ❤ hope everyone's having a great day and give your puppy extra love from me today !!.
    Hey, I hope y’all are doing well, I’m looking for other depressed, neurodiverse souls who need a kind friend. Although anyone is welcome to reach out as well. Ideally I hope to develop long term connections. Though if you just want to vent or a quick chat. I’m alright with that. I am interested in geopolitics, psychology, hiking, baking, etc..I offer as much empathy as I can because I’ve struggled for most of my life so I can understand when others are also falling behind. I don’t judge or offer too much advice. I am struggling with keeping friends and rejection sensitivity. Also lost 2 close people in my life (I was ghosted). So I’ve been dealing with the fallout for a while now. Forgive me if I need to vent a lot since it’s honestly a coping mechanism of mine. I’m trying my best to heal and meet new people so I can rebuild my psyche and find happiness again.Hope your day is good and know that I do care for your wellbeing. You deserve love, affection and happiness. I hope your doing much better than I.Over the years, I’ve noticed that I am no longer as sharp as I used to be. I find myself forgetting basic information and losing spatial awareness.Like I can barely walk sometimes and find myself stumbling at times. I don’t remember my balance being this bad.Not to mention I’ve been dealing with speech issues and am struggling more and more in conversations because my memory is so bad nowadays. As a result I’ve been struggling to keep friends and close relationships with family. I’ve also find myself getting distracted very easily and spacing out more often. Its gotten so bad that I had to quit driving and now I need my family to help me out with a lot of tasks that I didn’t have issues with till recently. I am becoming more disabled as I age. I already struggle with adhd and autism. I didn’t think things would get worse than they already are.I am scared of my future.I can understand if we don’t click after a few texts or chats and we move on. I can understand when things come up and you can’t reply or talk for a while. I’m cool with that.I don’t understand when someone ghosts after we’ve been close for months or even years. Like… we’ve been talking everyday, doing activities, hanging out, FaceTiming, etc…Just this year, i was ghosted by my best friend of 6 years, someone so close that we considered each other family. We were so comfortable and vulnerable with each other that we could chat just about anything, but our trust was so deep that we were comfortable talking about almost anything.She ghosted me after I told her about a dream where I was looking back at my old photos. We had no drama, problems or anything going on prior to this. She legit promised me she would spend a lot of time with me this past summer.She never texted me again. UghThen a few weeks later, my close cousin ghosted me after she told me she would work on staying in touch with me as she left for college. That was our last conversation.I was okay and understood, but then I saw that she viewed my stories on instagram and she was writing posts and stories on instagram.Okay I wasn’t bothered by this, I dismissed this thinking that she is just quickly updating her social media and stuff and was very busy otherwise. Turns out this was a red flag.Because when I FaceTimed my aunt, my close cousin was visiting her.She didn’t even say hi, she was walking around doing stuff. She did see me but she didn’t wave or anything. Instead she looked like she didn’t care to see me in the call.I was so devastated afterwards, I promptly deleted my instagram account. Why do people just drop close ones like that. What is wrong with people? It hurts me deeply every time it happens and I’m getting sick and tired of it. I’m mentally hurt deeply right now.Sorry for the long post. TLDR: im sick of being ghosted by close friends and loved ones.Back then I still had irl friends, had best friends, was doing okay in school. I was heartbroken after I was ghosted by a very close friend after I did my best to keep her around. This almost led to me ending my life.Since then life has gotten far worse. - I lost my friends, including my last close friends. - My disabilities (Autism, ADHD, Insomnia disorder) have gotten noticeably worse and unbearable. - I find myself burning out too often to the point that I can’t hold any job. - I am judged for my struggles and my quirks to the point that I’m too anxious to go outside anymore. - I mostly exist in a state of complete misery. It’s very hard to feel happy anymore.I could’ve ended all this, but I chose to stick around and continue deteriorating. I regret my decision and now I’m too anxious and depressed to even try anymore.I had this happen during a Christmas family gathering where I was close with a cousin and we spent a lot of it together.Long story short, she distanced herself from me and spent more time with my siblings and others while completely ignoring me. I figured I messed up somewhere and she was upset at me.I experienced really intense anxiety and depression to the point that I tried pacing myself, fiddling around just trying to relax myself and rationalize. I kept trying to tone out the thoughts but the anxiety and depression was just soo overwhelming.I then lock myself in the bathroom and break down crying. I was curled up sobbing for over an hour before my family got me out.Throughout the rest of the gathering, I desensitized myself and limited my interactions from then on, fearing that I’m just going to be heartbroken again.Has anyone experienced Rejection sensitivity related meltdowns. To the point that it overwhelms you entirely and causes you to meltdown?This sucks to be honest.Lonely because of social disability and emotional dysfunction. I am unable to keep friends due to poor social capabilities.I struggle with poor eye contact, difficulty understanding people’s intentions, impulsivity, inattentiveness and executive dysfunction.I am often treated as an outcast, often times I’m ignored, judged, teased or bullied. I just want to be normal, I don’t want to have such issues relating to people. I want to spend one day where I’m not living like an alien unable to understand people.I met someone here, we had a lot in common. We texted every night. Our conversations were long and we both replied in paragraph responses and at least I felt like we were becoming close. We even talked about FaceTiming soonish!Then out of nowhere, she stopped replying. I haven’t heard from her in a month. I am trying to remain optimistic and assume that she will eventually come back, but I’m slowly coming to the conclusion that she might have lost interest and ghosted me.I admit I am a bit hurt from this and I am feeling quite lonely over this. I have spent some time scrolling on our discord chats and seeing if I said something wrong. I don’t know what I did wrong or what. I also try to assume she got busy or something. I’m dealing with a flood of guesses and emotions over this.Sorry for the vent, I’m hurting.Is this common? Have you had this happen a lot?. After many years I saw my old friend group. They’ve grown a lot but I recognized them.They notice me and give me the biggest hugs. I was so happy that I was driven to tears.I held on to each one of them tightly, letting them know how much I missed them and how long it’s been. It was a long process giving each one a greeting hug. We then hung out for a while, talking about our different lives.Then I woke up………. I am at a place where I am suffering from crippling loneliness and isolation. My mental health has slowly been deteriorating as I have less and less people to talk to. Yet I have been trying to figure out how to chat with people and socialize. It’s been extremely difficult as I am awkward and uncomfortable talking to strangers and most of my attempts at conversation end up in an awkward place. This is made me quite self conscious.I don’t go out since I cannot drive and I live in a car centric rural area and my neighbors are far away.I haven’t seen a irl friend in years now. My family rarely talks to me at all.I have a few online friends but it just feels so distant and i haven’t heard from most of them in a while. They always seem to fade away.I do not want to be completely alone. I just want someone to hangout with and be wholesome and loving.How do you escape this.When I’m very excited about an event coming up. Bam insomnia.Or when I have a depressive/grieving episode due to social isolation, I get insomniac.It feels like something is just stuck in your head and your thoughts are just spinning around.I feel so hopeless and trapped because I’ve lost so many hours of sleep from heavy emotions.Anyone deal with this? How do you cope?. I have lost all contact with my best and only friend soon after I had to move away. The last time I saw her was on the day I left. She helped us pack up to move, then we hung out for the rest of the evening.Shortly after I moved, something came up and she promptly changed her number without warning me.We’ve lost touch. Just like that, my best and only friend had vanished from my life.We used to spend so much time together. We would watch shows, chat about random things nonstop, watch prison related YouTube videos and share memes.She used to always give me hugs when I was down or when we greeted each other. She absolutely loved my hugs and complimented me on them. She would hold me tight for a minute or longer. We were so blessed to have each other in our lives. She was my brightest memory from 2020 as quarantine struck us all. I can’t help but look back and associate that year with her. I don’t have any other way to contact her. Its been 3 years since we lost touch. I haven’t had a real life friend since.I depend on online friendships. They help a little, but don’t fill that void left in my heart. I wished I had a real life friend. I wish I still had my best friend around.I love you gabby! Thank you so much for being with me. I’ll always remember you.It really hurts to exist as an anomaly. I have Autism, ADHD, MDD, insomnia disorder, a deformity, and panic disorder. Don’t want to leave the house, don’t want to exist. Just want to vanish from everyone’s memory. I often hate being seen. I want peace.I promise I am trying, i understand I have issues trying to engage with friends. It is really hard living with autism, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and chronic insomnia. I don't often have a lot of energy but I do my absolute best to do activities, chill, text, all kinds of stuff. Its hard to meet people irl because I am extremely socially awkward and have speech issues that cause easy misunderstandings. They usually end up backing off from me and joining another conversation or do something else to get distracted. It crushes my confidence and self-esteem every time this happens. Sometimes I meet someone and we connect for a bit, we bond and talk about topics of interest. Then I will start to get happy and start trusting this new friend. I then start info-dumping on this person on random topics, this understandably annoys him/her and I end up unwittingly pushing that potential friend away because I info-dumped too much. Online I have met more people that were liked-minded, I ended up meeting someone who was also autistic and we became very close friends over a few months. We would facetime every other day for hours and hours on end. Everything was going great but just like all good things, it had to run its course. She ended up distancing herself from me suddenly. Her reasoning is that she is very tired and exhausted. I understand and have waited on her for a while. Though I hear back from her once every 10 days now. Still holding hope that we can catch up again so I am not moving on yet. Often times I will meet friends and we will connect and do a lot of chatting and other activities, but the friendships will always fizzle out and end with me being ghosted. One time last month i chatted with a person for a few weeks. We had fun and everything was going alright until one day out of the blue he accused me of "not caring about my messages and being boring". He wants a friend that will actually "listen" to him and reply better. I tried to explain that I do care and I just didn't know what much more that I needed to say. He blocked me in response. I am losing hope and losing confidence bit by bit. I just keep on boring or annoying people and losing out on friendships over misunderstandings and info-dumping. Only remedy I have found is masking, which only drains me more and leaves me feeling even more lonely and unlikable. TLDR: Struggling to make friends due to disabilities, awkwardness, and being annoying. Close relationships keep on fizzling out over a short period of time and don't know how to keep on living like this.I just want to hide myself in a forest and never be heard from again.I hate having to talk to people either on the phone or irl because my speech is so bad and I struggle with articulation. I always find myself slurring my words, subconsciously repeating words and tones rapidly, using monotone, brain glitches, etc… People will either get frustrated and angry at me, switch to an awkward tone, or just distance themselves from me. I have a hard time making friends or dating as a result. Sometimes I get teased for this too.I always feel so awful and awkward around people nowadays. I often just avoid social situations like the plague because I don’t want my speech problems to be exposed. Existing with people is just painful for me at this point.But I am feeling completely lonely and hopeless because of this. I don’t know what I can do to cope and I just don’t want to go outside anymore.Help?. Is it possible to improve your speech capabilities, if not, how do you cope with this?I have been having issues with stuttering, tics, monotone and subconsciously repeating words or tones.I usually end up creating a lot of socially awkward moments. I sometimes get judged or teased about my speech. Social anxiety and stress will exacerbate these symptoms. It’s humiliating and I am socially withdrawing as a result.Having selective memory makes it hard enough for me to articulate. I just feel so anxious and mute when I am out in social settings or needing to interact with unfamiliar people.I feel absolutely terrible for everyone else that has to live like this. This is a very painful and tedious experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I am happy that I can text decently. My writing can be inconsistent at times but I am okay at getting my point across.Anyway I suffer from a combination of neurological disabilities that completely alter my thinking and processing abilities. This leads to my speech stuttering often times and other tics. My articulation is inconsistent at best and my motor capabilities are turbulent.Stress and anxiety will exacerbate these problems, sometimes to the point that I have to mute myself to avoid melting down. If I talk, my speech will be incoherent. Of course my terrible speech has led to a lot of moments of awkwardness. I have had people judge me or back off from our interaction.I have had friends distance and then ghost me in the past over this. As I have gotten older, I have closed myself off from most of society. I have a few online friendships where we only text and don’t FaceTime often or meetup. I am starting to accept that there is a great possibility that I will die alone. I am trying to work on loving myself and not letting the circumstances crush me. It’s not my fault. I didn’t choose to be this way. I still have a lot to offer and at least I can function to some extent. I do believe I can be loved for who I am. I just have a ton to work on.Anybody else lonely due to similar issues. I hope you all have been handling yourself okay.Idk where to begin. Recently I was prescribed 10 mg Ritalin ER. I was warned that this could exacerbate my psychiatric symptoms, especially anxiety, paranoia and depression. Every time I attempt to take the medication, I get intense anxiety. Like when I have it on hand, I just get an intense rush of anxiety and paranoia to the point that I will melt down and cry. I am so afraid of the side effects and how it will impact the autism side of me.Idk where to begin but I am now assuming it’s probably unsafe for me to take it considering my extremely intense anxiety. I don’t know where to go from here.It’s one thing to have to life with Autism, ADHD, and insomnia disorder. To be disabled enough that I cannot drive. Holding a job is difficult to impossible considering my sleep disorder throws me off and causes me to burnout faster since I will often experience insomniac attacks.But living in a very rural area that’s distant from civilization. Nothing but farmland and shitty suburbs. No sidewalks, shitty weather, horseflies mosquitoes and ticks, grocery store is 30 minutes away and inaccessible by bikes or public transport.I used to hike and explore places when I was still living in a suburban area that at least had sidewalks and places to visit. My special interest is to explore places and stuff. But I don’t often get any of those opportunities anymore unless my family decides to take me to a place where I could.It feels like I am stuck on an island. Anyone else have this issue being disabled in a rural area?. Whenever it’s above 85 degrees with 50% humidity, I experience sensory overload the moment I walk outside on a sunny day.I will start to experience sensory overload as I lose executive functioning and experience sensory illness. This is regardless to how much water I drink and I tend to feel drained and mentally tired after an hour outside. This occurs no matter how I dress outside or how much water I drink. It feels like sensory overload.I get similar feelings when it’s cold as well but at least I can layer up. Fuck summers.I hope to meet people with similar struggles so we can overshare about our special interests and we can won’t have to mask. I am trying to learn to love myself in spite of my flaws and trying to improve slowly over time.I am straightforward and honest when I am chatting with people, plus I am very loyal to my loved ones. I like to listen to music, talk about psychology explore places. I am willing to do activities with friends I am close to so I am open to trying new friends.I do take things slowly, so no rush on anything. All I ask is to be patient and stick with me since closeness is built over time. No minors plz.Its so easy for me to forget things due to distractions or awful short memory and it’s getting to a point where I am exhausting myself always trying to remember things. I find it so hard to forgive myself and understand this part of me since I am ashamed to have short-term memory loss.It’s very challenging for me to study or learn new things as I have to frequently reread, rewrite or rewatch whole videos/lectures since I will always forget a lot of important information by the end of the lecture/read.I will always place a belonging of mine somewhere odd when I get highly distracted or end up hyper focused on an activity. After a while I will suddenly forget where I placed it and end up losing it for a while as it’s suddenly somewhere I am not familiar with. There have been times were I almost lost important papers or cards because of this and it happens quite often.I hate having such terrible short-term memory.
    21 years old. Didn't think i'd make it to 16 let alone 21. But unfortunately i've hit rock bottom, i'm thousands in debt, can't get a job, stuck at university on a course i dont like (also severely behind with that university work) and i self harm & get high to cope.I'm high af rn and i'm done. I've decided it's gonna happen today. It's 2am, 20 hours from now in the evening I plan to end it all. ...Did you know 66% of autistic adults consider suicide?Update: I've read all of your comments and i'm overwhelmed, I didn't know so many people cared. I'm outside at the place right now but reading these comments is getting me emotional (in a good way)Update 2: Hey everyone, i'm alive. My cousin was at the right place at the right time and bumped into me at the park where I was gonna take my life. I just got my phone back and had to update you all, I read all of your dms and messages and each of you also saved my life. Thank you.After Sarah chooses to do her residency somewhere else because of that whole thing with her father & Dr Charles, does she ever come back? I don't need details just a yes or no answer pls 🥲. I'm a second year university student and I have no friends. It's been depressing me a lot but recently it really started to affect me because for one of my modules we had to get into groups for an assessment, and nobody picked me. I felt so humiliated sitting on the table alone whilst watching everyone else get picked. That was when I decided to do something about it. I decided to join a society (club) and I went to the society's opening day alone. It was a HUGE step for me because I also have agoraphobia and social anxiety. I felt like I was doing really well and I was talking to different people and felt like I was actually getting to know people when a girl stopped me mid convo to point out how shy I looked. In that moment I felt like all my work was immediately erased. I hate feeling like an outsider. My autism makes me, me but a huge part of me wishes I wasn't autistic.GCSEs are the equivalent of GEDs. I began university late last year at 20, the rest of my friends & family members started at 18. Now they’ve all graduated and secured corporate jobs and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I call myself a career hopper because since 2018 i’ve studied 5 different subjects; Drama, Production & Technology, Health & Social Care, Midwifery and now i’m onto Criminology. I’m in my second year of my University Criminology course and to be honest I lost interest a month into my first year. If I make it to graduation I have no idea what i’ll do with my degree. Forensics sounds interesting but realistically I don’t think I have the stomach for attending crime scenes. So idk. My current interest is Aviation, and I plan to apply for an apprenticeship next month but deep down I fear this current interest is just the same as my previous interests, and I fear i’ll fall out of love with it soon. As you can see this has been an ongoing cycle for the past 5 years and i’m lost in life. The thought of being in a job I don’t enjoy genuinely brings me to suicide. I already struggle to wake up everyday due to my depression but knowing there’s a possibility that i’ll have to attend a job that I hate just to be able to survive is what terrifies me. I graduate in 2025 and i’m running out of time.(18F) I’ve had strawberry legs since I was 11 and i don’t know how to get rid of them. I’ve exfoliated using Sanctuary spa’s hot sugar scrub and it made my legs feel smooth but it’s pricey and only lasts for 2/3 uses (£13 for 550g). If it helps, I don’t grow leg hairs rapidly and when there are hairs, it’s really short.Is there anyone who’s had or currently has strawberry legs and found something that works for them? I appreciate any advice as this is something I want to get rid of :). I had a bursary that only gave me £3.10 a day for lunch, but the food at school was expensive. A 500ml bottle of water was £2?? A bowl of macaroni was £3.05??My mum was a university student as well as a mum to 4 kids so I wasn’t mad at her in any way for not being able to provide food every day but i felt like i had no other choice but to steal food.I used to grab something like a chicken wrap, slip it into the inside pocket of my blazer whilst facing away from the cashiers then walk out as if i didn’t buy anything. I did this for about 3 weeks straight and they didn’t realise until the last day. The cashier didn’t say much and let me go. I didn’t do it again after that day because the guilt made me lose my appetite. Its been 4 years and I still feel bad about it to this day. I screenshotted a picture of the jewellery policy in mcdonalds [here](https://imgur.com/a/i6evyQF) I know i’m not allowed my piercing, but it’s kinda annoying cause i got it pierced back in march, but complications stopped it from healing like how it should.I even offered to cover it up with a plaster whilst i work even though it’s already covered with my mask :/ but she said no and sent me home. Double standards? Should i mention this to a higher authority or just leave it, because i’m the only one who’s been sent home for my nose piercing when i can easily name 5 other girls with the same piercing who haven’t been sent home. I know i’m in the wrong, I know you’re not allowed nose piercings, but i’m not the only one with their nose pierced in my branch. And the manager who sent me home wasn’t even wearing a hairnet?? And the manager next to her literally has jewels on her teeth, doesn’t that still count as jewellery?My piercing was covered with my mask anyway and all the other managers know about it, but trust it to be the new manager who sends me home :(I’ve seen so many girls with plasters on their new piercings, no problems. But when I offer to cover it up she says no? I don’t understand...Title is basically tl;dr but...I’m an 18 year old girl. Ever since I turned 13 my mum has been very strict on me, about where I go, what time I get back and so on. She even made me download an app that tracks where i am at all times (i still have this app).I’m due to go to uni next year and wanted to talk to her about moving elsewhere, but I was scared for her response because i was 100% certain it would end in an argument of her telling me to stay at home.But it didn’t. She paused, and told me I’m free to go wherever I please. Then she even recommended Unis in other countries. I’m stunned. I’m scared. And I don’t know why. It makes me feel like i’ve done something wrong for her to let go like that and I don’t know how to respond?? Part of me is so thankful and happy that she’s finally letting me go but the other part of me is worried that i (broke) her?I don’t know how to feel, one thing I know, I’ll listen to her. Ill take advantage. But i feel like what i’m doing is somewhat wrong?. I got my nose pierced on the 12th August, with a steel L post stud. It’s fallen out once before but I sanitised it and put it back in before it had a chance to close upBut today I wiped my nose and felt my stud come out, and because I couldn’t find it I used a clean spare (never used) and inserted it. But the spare is a bone, and I can barely feel it going through my nose, i’m worried it’s going to fall out again as it doesn’t feel sturdy at all, Should I contact my piercer?.
    What causes a depressed man to ghost the woman he loves for a month? Does depression lead to this kind of action?. What do you think about AI?. It started 2 months ago when my boyfriend who takes Cipralex for his anxiety (he is introverted with ADHD), stopped answering my calls or texts. We are in long distance relationship. He replied to me almost 1 time per week by texts, saying that he is not been happy for long time and it is not me what bothering and that he is very sorry about the way he is treating me and he doesn't deserve forgiveness because he is being very selfish. The last message was also that there is nothing I did to him and that he is not a happy person. He said that he feels awful about the way he is treating me, I deserve to be upset with him. He mentioned also that the reason why he hasn't been in touch with me, is: he realized that he is not in a position to be in a relationship and he is been holding on and hoping to figure this out. During this time I always show him my love, care, support and that I'm ready whenever he wants to talk or if I can help. I send text from time to time so I don't put him under pressure, I send small gifts, I send some of the funny videos on Insta. Last thing I Did after his message was a love letter with all the support. I love him a lot and It feels sucks being distant from him. I read a lot on how to deal with this situation, that is why I'm trying to understand a little bit. I don't know why he is being distant like that and why he doesn't know that I'm not upset with him but I'm upset without him! Sometimes I feel what if he doesn't want me anymore?! Can anyone help me and tell me what can I do? Do I keep sending texts from time to time? Does he even care or it puts pressure on him? I even made a plan so I can move sooner to live with him (we were planing to do this in feb after I find a job in his country) but I'm afraid to mention this and get rejected.
    I’m in my last year of high school and I’m terrified of the future. I don’t know what I want to do and my parents are on my butt about every single little goddamn thing about my career and all that shit. I have no clue what to do for a career, they shot down all my ideas and I’m not good at ANYTHING. I’m looking back into my past and I didn’t know how good I had it, all I worried about was school. Right now I'd given up, it's all I could take my hands are shaking, my body could break. Every hour it seems like I dream about offing myself. I’m basically blind about the future, I have literally no clue how to do anything, I don’t know how to get a job, a car, a house, pay bills, I don’t know how banking and credit and taxes work, nobody has fucking taught me in school.I’ve been clean from my PMO addiction for a while now and not a day goes by or at least a week when I don’t hear it calling me, talking to me and telling me to watch porn and masturbate and that’s just the PMO addiction that’s what it does. It’s always telling me to think of sexual things and saying things like “it’s not worth it” or “how will you benefit from not doing what I’m telling you?” I feel like I’m losing my mind.Like I said in my last “Am I Addicted to Depression!?” post, I feel like I suffer and go through a lot more pain and bad things than the normal person. I find serenity in it, because if I’m not suffering or feeling bad, then I don’t feel like myself, I guess, if that makes sense. But something very strange I noticed recently was that I ABSOLUTELY CRAVE depression and pain, it got so bad where I wanted do something so horrible just to make myself feel that depressing and hopelessness feeling. I feel like I need to try to stop all of this before I actually do something stupid and get caught in the pit of no return and screw mystery forever. Please Help Me!!!. This rant is about my depression and how I wish for people to see that I’m in pain and for them to come talk to me and “save” me. Also it’s it’s about bad thoughts that come with depression, you can probably guess what they are.I feel like I suffer and go through a lot more pain and bad things than the normal person. I find serenity in it, because if I’m not suffering or feeling bad, then I don’t feel like myself, I guess, if that makes sense. Am I addicted to depression? I’ve been questioning myself for weeks now and I’m losing my mind.
    How do you overcome the autumn depression, getting cold outside and and stuff. I’m literally loosing it.Heyy i just wanted to briefly text that you will make it and it will be ok! Coming from someone who lost a lot of weight, stopped eating, had to be prescribed pills. You will be ok. Sit with the pain, it will eventually get better. I was completely ok 2 months after the BU. Lot of friends, even though i had none before. Lot of work on yourself and your career, lot of new things.Hey, im only 21 but don’t know where to ask. :( For the last few months i started bleeding during sex. Nothing hurts me, i just bleed a little. When it happened for the first time, it was a lot of blood but it gets better i assume. My doctor ran a lot of tests and everything seems fine. It started happenning after i stopped using valium which i had prescribed for 2 months prior. I didn’t find any answer in benzo recovery subreddit. But getting off valium resulted in worse libido too, and that’s why i thought it might be somehow connected. It kinda makes me sad everytime i have sex. :(. came out of nowhere. My last unprotected sex was a week ago. Im really anxious rn :(https://ibb.co/x1qxBJHhttps://ibb.co/nQRD2V2. Hi, i’ve been off valium for 2 months. I was on a really low dose (10mg a day) for like 3 months. My heart palpilations and panic attacks and basically all of the wd sympthoms dissapeared after the 1st month but this still persits and maybe i feel like its getting worse. Suddenly my body gets extremely tired, i think its the muscles. I can feel it strong especially in my arms. Its like my muscles there are slowly shutting down feeling. Its really uncomfortable and after few hours it gets kinda painful. Has anyone experienced this?Before prescribed valium, i was addicted to kratom…. Has anyone experienced decreased libido after stopping benzos? I was on valium and it still persits for 2 months.Hii, i take lyrica (pregabalin) and tritticco (trazodone) regulary every day before sleep - i got it prescribed from my doctor and i take it like that every day for months. The thing is i had cocaine for the first time today - like 4 lines. And i can’t find if there are any contraindications with my medication.. and u know, kinda afraid of dying in my sleep. Please someone tell me that she doesn’t know shit about kratom and this is complete BS. Fun thing is that she actually works with addicts (not kratom ones). A week and a half ago i tapered from 3gpd to 2.7gpd and started having pretty bad dissociations that last like 12 hours. Few days ago was the biggest one and i also had partial hallucinations. So i got fucking scared and called her, cause i don’t want to keep tapering like that and be in this psychic pain for the next weeks. Like those dissociations are so bad that i literally think i might end up in psychosis and hurt myself. She told me this and prescribed diazepam that i should take everyday cause appereantly, dissociation is just hidden anxiety? I’m already on pregabalin for different reasons and hell no, i won’t take benzos everyday.Hi, last week i tapered from 3g/day to 2,7g/day and i struggle with long periods of dissociation throughout the day, it usually starts at noon and it lasts until 12pm with small breaks when i feel normal.I drink 1,7g during the day and 1g before sleep. In January i tried taper to 2g/day but it was too much. What helped you with this? Thank you in advance.Anyone experienced the same? Did it get better when you pushed through it?. Hi, i broke up with my bpd ex in november and even though i kinda iniciated it, i wasn’t able to sleep for 3 weeks. I have been prescribed some antidepressants fot sleep. The whole 3 weeks were masive panic attack. My heart beating all the time really fast, they also prescribed me some benzos. Then we got back together but now he broke up with me. Funny thing is that after 4 years together, he was on dates in november, and yesterday (the next day after blindsiding me) he was on a date too. So i also want to say - never take an ex back.The problem is that the anxieties and panicking and not being able to sleep happened again. Did anyone experience this? Some advice?. Hi, is there anyone who experienced similar situation? how did you deal with it? Did it get better after some time? I can’t get the girl out of my head, im scared that he will sleep with her again even though he told me that it was truly traumatic experience for him and he stopped in the middle. But my head can’t stop overthinking about him cheating on me with her in the future.For the context: we were eachothers first, 3,5 years together, we are 20 and 21. Hi, is there anyone who experienced similar situation? how did you deal with it? Did it get better after some time? I can’t get the girl out of my head, im scared that he will sleep with her again even though he told me that it was truly traumatic experience for him and he stopped in the middle. But my head can’t stop overthinking about him cheating on me with her in the future.Hi, is there anyone who experienced similar situation? how did you deal with it? Did it get better after some time?

But my head can’t stop overthinking about him cheating on me with her in the future.Hi to everyone! This is gonna be long, so if someone reads the whole thing, i really appreciate you and thank you in advance. Long story short. A little bit over a month ago, i iniciated the discussion about breaking up with my partner of 3,5 years. After days of disscusing it, we decided to go on a break. I regretted it immediately but gave him time since i hurt him by wanting to break up in the first place. 3 weeks into the break i reached out and wanted to talk. I told him i regret it and stuff and he told me he can’t trust me anymore and called us definitively over. Until that time, i was really suffering. I lost 3kgs, couldn’t sleep cause i was overthinking about what he’s doing (i knew he was on dating apps a week into the break), i had anxiety non stop - basically everyday was just about trying to keep myself alive. I was ready to check myself into mental hospital everyday but i just kept going. When he said its definitively over, i didn’t lose that hope. Since then i still missed him, but i was able to be happy and didn’t have those crippling anxieties anymore. I missed him really badly, wanted him back, but i knew that the pain i’ve experienced was so bad, that i couldn’t imagine a scenario of us getting back together. I just wish that this never happened. Last week he reached out to me and asked me if we can try things again. I love him, so i said yes. He said that he tried to keep himself busy, lied to himself for the whole month, unsuccessfuly trying to get over it. The thing is, that when i was crying at home, unable to eat, he was going on dates. He also slept with one girl, but stopped in the beggining, cause that kinda “woke” him and in that moment he told himself “wtf am i doing, i love _myname_” I wasn’t interested in more details and he also said that this experience was really traumatic for him. He told me that he wasn’t interested in those girls, but hoped that seeing someone will help him to get over me. Since i was suffering and grieving differently, its hard for me to understand this kind of coping mechanisms. I thought that when you love someone, you wait for them. But at the same time, i kinda fucked up with the break up talk and was really harsh on him. He has BPD, idk if its important for this story.I still love and loved him, want to be with him, see the future. But now, when we decided to try it again, im suddenly not able to procces it, feel anything. When i reached out to him, he told me no. Now, when he reached out, i said yes. I was pretty excited to see him. He is really affectionate, 24/7 tells me how happy he is to be with me again. He asked me multiple times before the date if i didn’t change my mind, cause he is scared. It also took him like 2 hours until he told me if we can try things again. But now when i am with him, I can’t be that affectionate anymore. I feel totaly paralysed, anxious. He has always been loyal, but the fact he slept with this girl. I try to not be bothered by it, we were broken up at that point. And i would probably feel the same if he didn’t sleep with anyone. I am just so afraid of putting myself back to that pain. But i love him and want us to work out, but i don’t know what to do. Can you guys share your stories of getting back together? Its like - the past month was a lot of damage and i dont know how to repair us. Do you have any tactics how to do it? What to do when you try to build that trust again?. Its like mania or total depression. It changes througout the day, mania mostly in the morning and evening… i’m 1 month post BU. Hi, during the day i’m either extremely manic and motivated to win him back or completely depressed and extremely sad. He made it clear that it’s definitely over.It’s hard, because every previous argument between us we solved. I can’t accept the fact, that after 3 years, this is happening. :(. A month and i didn’t do anything. Wasn’t able. I all was able to do was to survive. I did, but … god, i can’t keep living like this.Hi, months before BU I felt like I’ve lost feelings for him, felt like i was already over. I was also laughing at memes like “when failed situationship with person you knew for a month hurts 10 times more than a BU from 3 year relationship.” I could relate to those kind of memes. And when I separated us, i immediately felt regret. Since I hurt him, i wanted to wait to be sure that its not just some attachment issues. But it’s been a month and i’m still haring myself for doing it, in pain, deep regret.Can anyone explain this to me or relate?. Every day is like i won’t survive another. He won’t take me back, he is doing fine. I broke up because of imcompatibility, love was still there. But the important thing im asking anout is my mental health. Please, i really don’t think i will survive this.We recently broke up (the situation was complicated so i cant tell how long it exactly is - lets say something between 2-3 weeks). Yesterday i deleted my social media, because he kept sending me memes and posting songs with lyrics like “i don’t want you back” at the same time. Deleting it kinda helped, i wasn’t feeling any anxiety, was just sad and drained, but it helped. And now, day after, i just got a massive fear and anxiety of him sleeping with other girls.It was first love and first relationship for both of us. I know that sex does not invalidate love that was between us, but… idk It’s hard for me, when the only thing i know is sleeping with your partner you love. Any reassurance that sex isn’t a big deal? Im just new to this.Because your partner was was always the only person there for you.The pain is unbearable oh god. The pressure on my chest, do experience this too? Everyday I think I won’t make it to another day. Im really scared about myself.It’s like the worst anxiety. Makes me forget everything about the day. I only remember the pain, even though I try to do things, have to be at school. My memory is not working.I also didn’t sleep the night when i was at (now his) place and we broke up definitely, i think. And next day I fell asleep at 9pm and woke up at 6. I took some pills for anxiety we had at home and went to bed for another 3 hours. Its really draining.
    I rarely cry. I wish I could. So I took a shower... staying under the water and imagining the water drops are my tears... well it is painful. Maybe I will cry one day to feel free again. It's gonna be ok. This is not the end. I'm sorry. I just want a hug. I'm not hopeless, well sometimes I am but in general I am stuck. I have different fears inside me, forcing me to not function. I know what to do but the depression and fear stops me every time. Fear of being alone, no job, no life, things I planned and I can't do them. Everything just makes me feel stressed out.Sometimes it's just really hard to be optimistic. I am in general but it's hard to be. I believe I need a more structured plan to get out of this loop before it consumes again. A plan doing things step by step from easy to hard so I can get back on track. Easy to say though. All I know is that I need to hold my life before it collapses. I don't want it to collapse again. I must be careful. I need to find a way to build this from zero again.I feel better these days, I'm sure meds helped but I think I am getting somewhere positive and it's not walking backwards anymore.I'm starting to find joy in my life, small things that makes me feel satisfied. I believe I won't feel better if I don't feel the love within me, and that's the thing I remind myself every day. There are still many things I can't find within and around me but I'm optimistic for finding them.I still suffer during the day, but I know my illusions, and I learned that many things in my mind are not true.Sometimes when I do something for myself, if I say "I'm proud of myself", makes me feel I'm selfish, but if I talk to myself like the second person telling myself motivating words in my mind, that works better.My psychologist believes that I don't have some of the hurtful traits that they thought I had before, I'm happy for that. I smile better, started crocheting, continuing sketching, walking every day in another city, and I want do more positive things to help me feel better. I am helping myself in a good way I believe.At the end of the day, this is one life I have and I want to feel better. One day in future I will look at myself in past and realising how much I did improve. One day I will get there.The title may seem unhealthy but I really need to rely on something in my life keep me feel alive. The more days that passes by, my situation gets worse and I don't want that. I don't want to feel worse than this.I think it was yesterday, and I could feel one moment of joy while doing something. I forced myself to do it because I didn't want to feel down, I'm already exhausted of feeling depressed. I have to force myself to find something to feel anything beside sadness, if picking up a stick and just simply shape it with a knife while listening to my favourite playlist... I want that. I want to feel that knife and that wood in my hands, the smell of the wood I'm shaping... I just want to feel it. I came to a conclusion to my situation at this moment of my life, is just to feel objects, tools, the beauty of small things that I want to learn, because that's what I need. I know I really can't love myself, I know I have lots of inner issues, I know many of my dark side but I really have to get away from it, somehow, in a way, that my instincts telling me... I feel something inside me telling what it wants. I don't want to dwell in my dark thoughts anymore... I'm so tired of that. That's just enough.I want to feel the colours, sounds I like, shape of objects, the trees in the jungle, the candles that I didn't buy them, the colour pencils that I didn't use them, the cold shower that makes me feel better, the specific foods that I want to make but I never did...I just want these things, not my depression. I'm not ignoring my sadness, I just don't want it define me. I want to feel it again like I was 7 years old.
    i’m 21f and i never got to experience love, relationships or any kind of romantic attention. it didn’t bother me at first but now as i grow older it’s really taken a toll on me. the fact that i don’t get to experience some things which are so common for everyone else kills me inside. i get scared that i’ve missed out on such a huge part of life and i’ll just never be that person who gets all this. i don’t know how to move on from this i feel like nothing will make not having it ok. i know im not that old but i genuinely don’t think i have a chance, i just want to not feel sad about this, i can’t help it.i’m 21f and i never got to experience love, relationships or any kind of romantic attention. it didn’t bother me at first but now as i grow older it’s really taken a toll on me. the fact that i don’t get to experience some things which are so common for everyone else kills me inside. i get scared that i’ve missed out on such a huge part of life and i’ll just never be that person who gets all this. i don’t know how to move on from this i feel like nothing will make not having it ok. i know im not that old but i genuinely don’t think i have a chance, i just want to not feel sad about this, i can’t help it.i see so many people say that comparison is the thief of joy and while i agree, i think it’s easier said than done. comparison does make me a very insecure and even a jealous person, but how do i stop doing that?. i see others getting love and relationships so easily whereas i’m just so alone. im just 21 but i feel like i’ve missed my chance for love and i’ve given up. but then i see others get it so easily and i don’t know what ive done to be so unlovable. people tell me that there’s nothing wrong me, the way i look or the way i behave. i don’t know how this is going to sound but i do get compliments about my looks a lot, i do get appreciated for my attitude and personality. why am i so unlucky? why am i the only person who doesn’t get even the slightest bit of romantic attention? how can i deal with these feelings of jealousy? i don’t know how to be happy for people when im so unhappy. do you ever get over the sinking heartbreaking feeling you get when everyone’s living the life you want and you can’t do anything but just sit and feel pathetic? i know i can’t find love but i just need that feeling to go away im so tired of feeling so sad all the time.
    Hey, so i was in a conversation with a friend and tried to explain to her, what an edgelord is. What would be an easy example/definition of an edgelord? I tried to look it up, but the example/definitions i've found didn't really match.Yesterday my tounge started to hurt and i have no idea why, it feels kinda swollen on the right side and is kinda painful. First i thought i mighr bite my tounge by accident or somehting but it still hurts and i noticed it when i eat anything. So my feed is full of random subs like r/kidsarefuckingstupid for example and i don't know why. I mean on both ways, it doesn't hast to mean that you a bad person or something. I in general don't show my real emptions because i don't know how to handle them. So what was something that made you realzie: hey, that person isn't being true/showing his realface or hiding something?. So basically i'm a bit under shock. A friend of mine just wrote me via discord "wtf" without knowing what's wrong. I replyed but she didn't respond since a few hours and normally she's online to this time. I checked if i'm still in her friendlist in discord and the games we played together but her insta profile is gone (at least i can't find it anymore but our chat, stille exists). Somehow and i don't know why but i'm worried about her that might anything happen. I can't remember doing/saying anything wrong. I was simply afk sometime after she wasn't in the lobby and closed the game and sleeped. Normally i wouldn't react so strangely but both, the message and her deleted insta profile makes me worry.Hi so i can barely remember anything. I dreamed about a girl i was in love once but i never told her that i love her, even when i knew she was in love with me. I just had a dream about her, how she was r*ped by 3 guys and i can't explain why.I was r*ped when i was younger but i never really dreamed about it. Idk tbh, i really have stranges dreams lately with alot of horrible things in it like death and this example but i just can't tell why. The only thing i could think of is because i'm severe depressive? But that's just a guess.Hey, so while browsering a bit trough reddit, i think i have found a really disgusting page but sincd this is the internet there are probally, much more cursed, disgusting pages that wanna makes you destroy your router. So what's the worst you have find here? I only saw r/plushophile and i want to puke. (Basically a page about people having sex with stuffed animals, teddybears etc.). So i'm myself was r*ped a couple of years ago but i haven't seen that person in ages, what's the meaning behind this? It really makes me sad and i can't stop thinking about it.I was in a voice chat in discord, while i has a discussion with my family. So i should probally make a few explanations first. We are in a horrinble situation, because are apartment is really small, my mother has a hoarding dissorder and because of that, everything is full. It's so full that she's sleeping right next to me, our beds are 30cm appart, if i stand up, i touch her bed literally. Besides that, in the past, my mother stole money of me, around 5k. So not so long ago i had a little bit money on my table, (a few hundreds, not that much but still) it took 2 days that the whole thing dissappeared, she said she "put it away", somewhere and can't remember where.Because of what happened in the past, i don't believe her. Also i have sleep problems and can barely sleep at night, m mother screams literally like a child that i have to take care about, open windows, her cat, light, and also screams at me, when she's thirsty, hungry anything. So i barely sleep at night, i'm currently jobless and almost sleep all day, not because i want, simply because i can't. On top of that i already feel horrible because of my depression but my family simply don't care about me.Tl;drI told my mother how mad i am, that my stuff vanish, i barely sleep at night, she treats me horrible and steals money of me.I told her that i feel horrible, had a panic-attacks while i was in a voice chat and i forgot my microphone was still on. I want to sink in the ground. I never told my friends about my living situation or my mental problems because i'm so afraid and now i kinda exposed myself, i want to sleep in and never wake up again. I'm feeling so shameful i think i can never look theae people in the eyes again.I just want to lay in someones arms, being hugged and loved, nothing more.Hey, so basically i'm really afraid about streaming, i don't know why but i always was so afraid i couldn't just start. I always looked for excuses and changed alot of stuff before even starting with it. I don't know why to be honest. I wanted to stream with a face mask so nobody could see that "it's me" aynway. So what is my problem? I love talking with friends, being a jerk and just being strange but somehow, doing it while filming myself kinda makes me feel uncomfortable.So i know this might sound a bit unrealistic but if get a partner one day, how am i a good one?. Hey, i often do make stuff like memes or post about my mental health and my depression. Somtimes the reactions are different, which i can understand, i mean i don't do this stuff for anyone besides me and because we are in the internet, people write what ever they want. So someone just told me, i should stop to post about my depression or mental health because nobody cares even if i would kill myself. Not sure how to feel about...Hey, so for some reasons, my friends always tell me how good my life is. They don't even think about, that i'm not doing so well. I currently don't have a job, i lost my last one because of an anxiety dissorder and panicattacks, i was r*ped when i was a kid, that's why have a horrible fear of dating, kissing, sex and the whole stuff. If i get asked i simply tell them i'm a virgin. I'm also diagnosed with ocd and severe depression i often feel so horrible i can't describe it. I'm ust laying in my bed thinking about how much i hate my life and crying while writing this.So what's my issue. So basically, i do feel horrible and there happened quiet some stuff in the time of my life. I never was really comfortable to speak about it but i kinda did (at least virtual) but these post about my rough childhood and my mental problems are now one of these things that makes me sad to have talked about it. So normally, i believed that it would help me and it did at some point but till i made the last posts which i talked about my trauma people just started to say "there is so much, it's not possible" or "it's so fishy" that it hurted me really bad and i thought i can deal with it but i can't. Under hundreds of bad jokes about my username, perverts in my dms, and other weirdos of the internet, they never hurted me so much as the other posts. I know that i have a really darkhumor and i enjoy alot of cursed stuff but never would i ever make jokes about the topics i posted about my abuser, my mentalhealth or any of my traumas. Even when i have a crazy, f*cked up post history, i would never make jokes about these topics. I also know that i do have posts about erotica on my profile and when people started to see that also did some "chat-fun" i think that's when it really escalated. I really don't know what elese i should tell, if there are any questions, about me, my mental health or anything else, just ask, i try to awnser everything.But the nights are still horrible and i dream alot of garbage, related to suicide and selfharm. Yea but atleast the days feel "kinda" similiar, just feeling a bit misunderstood. This is something i likely will delete later because it still messes me up. It happened some years ago, i actually can't even remember how long ago. My big brother, literally, pissed and shit on me, while some friends was over. They literally saw everything, never in my life have i felt more humiliated. I remember how i almost threw up while that happened. I felt so dirty and disgusting but this isn't just enough this is the same person who raped me. I wrote something before already and just called him "a relative" but that was actually him, my big brother. I hate him, i fucking hate him so much. I don't care if he has some physical problems with his body or something. My virginty lost on this way, i fucking hate it. I still have problems to meet new people, find a partner, kiss someone all that stuff, i fucking don't trust anyone anymore. No one knows this, i don't have this friends anymore i had back in the day. But some how, actually one friend knows about it, since how ever on earth someone knew me, and knew this happened to me. I fucking hate my life so bad, even when it was so many years ago, i hope no one else will remember this. I suffer so much of this bullshit and my severe depression and no one knows about it.Hey, out of the blue my left lower arm started to hurt without a reason. All i did was basically me trying to slesp.Hey, so since quiet some while i simply don't laugh about memes anymore, each time, watching them, making them or what ever, i'm just not happy about it. I used to enjoy making memes alot, but sometimes, even when people laugh about them, i still can't find joy. Is this because of depression?. Hey, so it has been a few years and while it still hurts i'm kinda afraid that i will never experience normal sex. I'm afraid of dating/meeting new people. I wouldn't find it horrible if i would die without ever having sex in my life, but i find it awfully horrible to die with these thoughts, knowing that the only time i had sexual intercourse was being raped. I would consider myself a virgin even when it's (probally) by definiton not the truth, sadly.
    for whatever reason, i woke up today with this horrible underlying sense of dread. cant think of anything in particular that could be setting me off, but it’s strong enough that i haven’t been able to get anything done today. it’s kind of like that feeling you get when you know you’ve forgotten to do something really important but can’t remember the thing, except i know for a fact i haven’t forgotten anything. i combed through all of my due dates for school, double triple checked that my rent payment is secure, checked for any important missed texts or emails, checked that i’m not working tonight, everything is in order. guess i’m just having a silly little anxiety day ); i have a lot of studying to get done today but can’t even sort of focus, so if you have ANY tips on how to centre your mind and shut down the anxious feeling, even just for like an hour, it would be soooo appreciated. you don't want to eat the same thing every night, so you buy enough groceries for at least 3 distinct meals each week but then you had to buy so many different things that you can't possibly finish all of any one item (seriously, why is chicken sold in such large quantities??) so you freeze the leftover ingredients, except you were stupidly craving cabbage salad on Sunday and now you have half a cabbage left and how the fuck do you freeze cabbage so i guess you'll just let it rot in the fridge until you throw it out and feel horrible about yourself. later on, you decide to try that fettuccine alfredo recipe you saw on tiktok as a way of using up the leftover chicken that you froze in the first paragraph but by the time you go to the grocery store to buy the other ingredients, you'll have forgotten that you already have the chicken for it so you'll buy more chicken and then realize your mistake and panic-search chicken recipes, deep down knowing that you actually only really crave chicken once every few weeks so you're just gonna freeze the rest again and the cycle will continue. and then oh don't forget that you bought a block of parmesan that you only used an 8th of and you aren't really craving italian anymore so i guess we'll just let that go moldy too but make sure to let it sit in the fridge for a couple weeks to avoid the guilt of throwing it out. oh also you wanted to make burgers but you can only buy buns in a pack of 8 and you can't freeze the extras because your freezer is full of chicken breasts so you have to commit to eating 2 burgers per day for 4 days straight. oh also you bought 1L of milk last month but it wasn't enough, so this month you bought 2L but now you're forcing yourself to drink a glass of milk with each burger like a rich pinot noir because 2L is just way too much and you have 3 days until the carton expires and almost a full litre of milk to get through.and finally, shout out to all those stupid recipes that call for that one super specific ingredient that you'll use one single serving of and then never find another use for ever again so it'll sit in the door of your fridge for 6 months straight. i'm looking at you, pickled ginger.anyway yeah, pretty sure this whole cooking-meals-to-stay-alive thing is a conspiracy pushed by Big Perishable targeting 21 year olds with poor meal planning skills. she was such a happy girl, ya know? she had so many hobbies and passions, so much love and curiosity and joy. she loved colouring. her sister taught her how to use different colours to add depth to her barbie colouring pages, but secretly she didn’t care much for the lessons. she just liked playing with her big sister. she loved the outdoors, but hated spiders, so she’d have her dad walk ahead of her on the hiking trail to clear any spider webs. and of course, every hike would involve a break to pick wild raspberries. she loved fresh berries. she liked to sing, especially while she learned her favourite songs on piano (not that she was necessarily any good. she didn’t care about that though). she had aspirations, and spent every second of every day searching for new ways to fill her mind and heart. and i feel like at some point, not sure when, i robbed her of that. i beat every ounce of joy out of her young heart, stripped her of everything that made her truly happy. i know she’d hate what her life has turned into. she’d be so disappointed to know that i don’t let her colour anymore, or that her piano has gone untouched for years. to know that i never take her hiking anymore, it takes too much energy to leave the house. to know that i closed her off from everybody, that i stupidly couldn’t make relationships work. i wish she could know now how sorry i am, and how much i wish she could take over the controls again.i used to go on this particular day hike with my dad a lot as a kid. i’ve been trying to remember the name of it for years now, but can’t for the life of me figure it out. also can’t ask my dad because we’re estranged now, so really hoping somebody here can help place the name. i want to say it was in kananaskis (maybe off of highway 40??? that’s a total guess though) and it was a relatively short hike. from the parking lot, you go up a series of steep switchbacks and it opens into like something of a basin-y moraine looking area. there’s rocky slopes all around and you can hike through an area of huge boulders and a ton of rock debris. the place was known for having a big marmot population, and we’d often set up a place to sit on top of a boulder and wait around quietly to see if any marmots would show up. i know this isn’t a lot to go off of, but pleaseeee if it sounds at all like a day hike you know of, let me know. i’m desperate ):. looking for music that has that super immersive space-y almost ethereal vibe like Kid A. im obsessed with the echoey instrumental calming chords and filters in that song and its been almost impossible to find the same vibes in any other music. closest i can get is five hundred miles by mamman sani and like the music from the underwater episode of bojack horseman lol. i know this is like super vague but idk how else to describe the vibe i’m looking for other than like imagine you’re like floating through the atmosphere of an alien planet???? idk man i’m desperate. i’ve watched the full series from beginning to (almost) end at LEAST 6 times at this point, and this will forever be my favourite show. but! i’d always skipped watching the last couple episodes (specifically the view from halfway down and nice while it lasted) during every single binge because idk i just have this thing about finishing a good tv series. watching finales makes me sad for some reason, like it ruins the magic. but i broke my rules on a whim and finally finished the series and all i can say is holy. shit. i’ve never had a finale affect me so much, like it’s genuinely all i’ve been able to think about (especially those last few minutes of the view from halfway down - OOF.) my only issue now is that the earlier seasons feel so…empty? in comparison. like a few days after i finished the episodes, i decided to just put on season 2 in the background while i did some work and it’s just not giving me the same feelings that it did before. now that i’ve felt the depth and (i don’t know…profoundness??) of the finale, the rest of the show’s plots just don’t hit me as hard. i dunno. regardless, it was nice while it lasted.i’m almost finished the song of achilles and ohhhh my god i can already tell it’s gonna be all i can think about (i.e. it’s already taking over every waking thought i have .) anyway, i know that once i finish it i’ll need to have another novel lined up as a distraction, and would prefer to keep with an lgbt theme for a bit. i’m totally happy with young-adult novels for the sake of nostalgia, but am always open to expanding my horizons as an adult reader too (: the only real lgbt books i’ve read so far are history is all you left me, they both die at the end, and aristotle & dante, so anything other than those novels are new and 100% welcome territory for me (:. recently my coworker and i expressed some mutual (nearly purely physical) feelings, and now he’s wanting to become friends with benefits. he’s asked to meet up a couple times now, but as much as i want to i just can’t help but feel way too uncomfortable with the thought of him seeing me naked. i’m not overly unfit or anything, and my weight is only just above where i’d want it to be, but i don’t know man. my proportions feel off and my figure and bone structure and muscle mass is just…gross to me. he’s only ever really seen me either at work or at bars where my outfit is specifically tailored to flatter my best parts and hide the worst ones. i feel like once he actually sees me, he’s gonna be over me in a heartbeat. i’ve wanted this since i met him, like it’s been YEARS. and now that i finally have a shot, my stupid insecurities are getting in the way. i’ve tried working out, dieting, all that good shit, but i just can’t get my body to a point that i’m comfortable with. someone recently told me they think i might have body dysmorphia, and i’ve considered the same but i’ve never really worried about it before. but idk now that it’s completely halting my sex life? and my love life in general? shit kinda sucks. idk man. i just feel gross.i’m in a weird and overall less-than-ideal place mentally right now, and i feel like a disgustingly heart wrenching novel might be just what i need to kickstart processing some emotions. think like the type of book that you know you’ll never be able to read again because it just hurt THAT much, and you walked away a different person than how you were when you started (but in a good way). could be about love, mental health, loneliness, loss, overall tragedy, im not too picky as long as it will make me cry like a baby (:.
    absolutely bloody beautiful but i can’t seem to figure it out. it’s on Yodel and it says it’s going to be delivered on nov 1st when before it said it would be delivered between 1-2 working days. is there a chance it could come earlier? i need it for monday but it’s not looking like that’s ever going to happen 😭. i got hook things behind my bottom teeth at the front bc i have to put elastics in from top to behind the bottom ones. problem is i literally cannot use my tongue to eat properly bc it gets hooked to them and it hurts and it’s really uncomfortable, does anyone know like a technique to eat properly with these bc i can’t survive like this for 3 weeks lol. i haven’t brushed my teeth well enough because i can’t bring myself to do so or to remember. my electric toothbrush broke so i’ve got to use my manual one with doesn’t brush nearly as well and i’m scared about going to my dentist appointment because i can’t mentally handle my dentist telling me i’m doing badly and i’m not brushing well enough and that he’s dissapointed. it’s stupid i know but i can’t have someone tell me i’m not doing well enough when i’m trying to just to be alive.UPDATE- i went and it went well! i’ve got braces in and sadly i got added some hooks which hurt a bit but no bad comments on my teeth. thanks so much for the encouragement and your stories and i’m proud of you all 🫶. Felt the same way a year ago, thought i’d get better and a year later i’ve gotten worse. ‘What’s the point’ is the only thought I can muster just rotting away in bed during my week break. Life’s so beautiful but I can’t enjoy it and i’m not even an adult yet it hurts too much. It just doesn’t get better and worse thing is I didn’t even get a chance to enjoy it while it lasted. Whole childhood was just parents arguing non stop, their very messy breakup in court where my depression started and it’s just been downhill from there. Sometimes I think it might be better to end it early since it never even started. Fuck me.You always hear people out on things that interest them and encourage them to talk about it, since it’s something you know you would have loved to have. They never ask you about your interests back- but sometimes you’re really interested and excited about something new you’ve watched or done and you start ranting to friends about it may that be over text or face to face. however later you come back to it and feel guilt and embarrassment. they obviously didn’t care and you were just really annoying! does this happen to anyone else?. I have the luck to be able to afford to buy things for hobbies- like wood for whittling and I recently bought fabric and thread for embroidery. I love these things so much, but I physically cannot bring myself to start on a project for longer than 10 minutes without me becoming depressed and disinterested and going back to rotting away in bed, with an exception of a few times. I hate this so much because I want to be able to do all those things I enjoy but I literally cannot and it’s ruining me, what should I do?. So i get into phases but like really strongly- like i find a tv show or a musical i love and i can’t do anything but think, look and do things related to the media. it’s great and all, but when it comes to school work it literally consumes my mind and i can’t focus on anything because this specific thing brings me so much happiness and joy that my brain decides that it’s not worth thinking about anything i learn because i don’t enjoy it. my grades are average at best rn no matter how hard i work so this is genuinely really bad for me bc i’ve just gotten into something. what should i do?. so i started using a sharpener blade not long ago when it started smelling rly strong of metal and apparently that meant it was in the oxidation process, so i binned it and bought a brand new, proper brand sharpener to make sure it was good quality and it was. it smelled perfectly fine and was safe (well as safe as sh goes) so i kept it for a week and now it smells rly strong of metal like horrible again! i keep it behind my phone case so i’m thinking if that has smt to do with it? it’s just weird like it’s been less than a week wtf what can i do?? (i want to know so that i can do this safely without risk of infection until i find a way to stop, please don’t feel guilty or as if you are helping me sh) thanks. I want to bring my CDs and player about when i go out, but i’m not sure how to carry them around without the CDs getting damaged. I know there are things and bags specifically for this but i’m not sure where to start, so any ideas/recommendations?. like idek. TW!! DESCRIPTION like cuts which bleed and leave big drops of blood on the line of the cut and when you touch it it spreads out and then the blood comes back again for a few mins? not really deep tho. i don’t even know if need anything, but id like some advice if i should get anything. for context, my cuts are relatively shallow, they bleed and i can like spread the blood about to make my forearm really red - almost all aren’t runny but get like quite big drops along on it and keep being bloody for a few minutes and i have dozens of them. my blade is like probably not clean i’m gonna be real but i’m getting a new one tmrw anyway. just wondering if i should get anything at all or if rinsing it w water was enough and i’m just overreacting even tho my sh isn’t bad at all. sorry for wasting ur guys’ time but thanks for the help lol. used a blade from a sharpener that even tho i ‘cleaned’ it w soap an water imma be real that blade was not clean. i didn’t expect it to bleed bc i’d always been using a needle and dragging it rly hard but it didn’t really bleed and here it did. idk any of the medical shit i’m meant to do if any, like how and what to clean etc. i don’t have any disenfectant in the house and i can’t really go out of my room bc it’s late and i’ll wake my mother and she’ll ask what i’m doing and idk what to tell her. thanks. i’m genuinely terrible and was wondering if anyone had tips to improve 😭. mine is to complete don’t fight the music on expert :)I play at 10.3 so not very fast but i still want to do it 💪💪. So i finally properly opened up to my therapist for the first time ever, and it basically ended in me telling her that i want to tell her something, but if i do she will have to (legally) tell my parents and i’m not ready for them to know. i need to tell her, both because now she knows i cant just leave it out there, and i have to tell someone about what is going on since i can’t bottle it up or hide it anymore- it hurts too much. from what i did tell her she told me i should visit my GP but both my parents are against like mental diagnosis (mother) and meds (both parents) and stuff. but i’m not, and will never be, ready for my parents to know and the consequences that will bring. i’m already borderline wanting to leave my homes (they aren’t together anymore) and just go on a train and leave, which legally i cant do anyway, so wtf should i do 😭. does anyone know where i can get a trick CD? i’ve been looking everywhere but only the vinyl is to be found. i’ve only really listened to trick and i love it, so if it doesn’t exist any recommendations for albums to listen to and get CDs of?. at this point i want to walk into school with short sleeves on. don’t get me wrong my sh isn’t nearly as bad as everyone else’s- shallow cuts no bleeding, but i know my parents would still be really worried and/or shout at me. hence why i’d rather it be seen in school, where i’d be able to talk to the counsellor even if my parents still get called after. i’ve had really good luck where neither of my parents have seen my sh but i know it cant last forever and sometimes i want to someone to see or someone to know (horribly selfish i know). only thing is i don’t want to traumatise my friends, as once one of our friends showed my close friend their sh and it really hurt my friend and really hit them hard and i don’t want them going through that again. i just don’t think i’d be able to deal with my parents finding out. (i wouldn’t show my sh purposefully but i just wouldn’t go out of my way to hide it) my sh really isn’t bad at all but it still leaves scabs and marks which r visible, and i know my friends would care and tell the counsellor but i don’t want to be selfish and have it go through them. i want to OD, but i honestly don’t reckon i’m going to succeed. maybe i will which would be great but i was wondering if i don’t (as a minor) would i be sent to a mental hospital?. it’s so weird i just want to OD and hurt and faint and get taken to hospital. it feels like i want to do this for attention and i hate myself for it, i can’t tell if i want to do it for that or not?? but also bc i cant cut deep enough to bleed but at least this will feel validating that my mental struggles have manifested into something people actually find bad, not just brush off. and it’ll hurt without me being able to be incompetent, i’ll just have to swallow this time.In a fragile, borderline apocalyptic world, a new, terrifying illness has emerged. *insert name bc my name for it is awful* causes workers everywhere to become unable to do anything but their job, and despite government’s best efforts to hide and dispose of the contaminated individuals, it has caused workers to stop going to work in fear of catching this commonly deadly disease, causing economies to collapse, crime levels becoming dramatically large even in safest of cities and everyone for themselves in these horrible times. Our main character, a psycology and natural medicine student, is determined to save these shamed individuals as much as she can. Alongside her travels Mr.A-Z, a previously famed game show host fallen victim to the disease she saved from being captured as well as an orange tabby (bc cats). she is willing to potentially sacrifice herself to the disease by working hard to find a cure in exchange to save as many lives as she can manage. I am yet to decide wether the disease is a result of an overworked underpaid society, or a government experiment gone wrong in an attempt to get people to work harder and more efficiently. the disease in more detail:symptoms: - distancing from loved ones- getting periods of only being able to repeat the same actions or words, related to their work, often broken by fainting and waking up again unaware of previous events- is eventually unable to consume food or water unless fed - voices in patient’s head repeating instructions, often comes alongside hallucinations of being watched - gets periods of time where their eyes change colour completely (all the eye) and repeat a sentance of their work indefinitely, often accompanied with uncontrollable crying. (for eg, Mr.A-Z sometimes has this in which he repeats ‘hello lovely audience, tonight i present to you’) sometimes patients are stuck in this state permanently.- eventually is unable to do anything but their job- eventually eyes become completely two colours- the more the patient works, the worse this gets until they cannot do anything but work until they die.- patients are often found as skeletons stuck in positions of their work. in her travels on her cool ah motorbike our mc often sees farmers’ skeletons stuck standing in the midst of their cattle or sheep. - their skin and flesh deteriorates extremely fast and gets blown off as dust when they are stuck in the working state for over a yearIt isn’t contagious, but most people think it is due to conspiracies. no cure is yet found.Mr A-Z can only speak like a show host, and presents everything as a game show. He sometimes gets short phases where he understands things happening in reality, and says a word, or does an action in response to him being addressed. this gives our main character hope. any ideas are greatly appreciated! i came up with this today, so improvements and developments will definitely happen, but i’m happy with the idea!!. i’m thinking a bag of 100 plastic babies, but if anyone has any ideas please lmk plspls. like no bleeding more than drops of blood on it a bit. YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYA. like wtf is wrong w me. i’m such a fucking pussy that i cant even cut deep enough to bleed. even when i do there is barely any blood at all idk why i’m even on this subreddit. ik ‘all sh is sh’ but mine just isn’t bad just at all i don’t get the point. why tf am i such a pussy like all my scars r cat scratches no matter wtf i do i physically cannot go deeper (i use a needle lol) they bleed v little sometimes but i can’t keep trying to go deeper bc it’ll make it harder to hide the scars but i just want to bleed at least my sh doesn’t even fucking count. so he’s already seen my sh from half a year ago and i reassured him they weren’t but ik he knew it was but he dropped it. i was clean for 6 months and i’ve just done it again and ik he looks at my wrists just in case and idk what to do bc unless i’m lucky he will definitely see again and idk how he will react. i’ve covered them w plasters but like he’ll know. also my sh isn’t bad at all it’s all surface cuts with a needle which rarely bleed at all but they scab quite visibly. what do i do? i’ve got a good excuse for the plasters in general but i know he won’t believe it.prolly gonna stop tomorrow but this evening is pretty okayhow’s your days going out of 10. i’ll do as many as i can if i end up getting a lot <3. fml. and sh again after being clean for 6 months. i’ve been clean for 6 months, and the way i cut didn’t make me bleed but still left scabs and scars. i want to do it again, but i don’t even feel like it counts as worth all that shit in my head like it’s not fucking bad, some people have it real bad and i’m out here like even just saying ‘clean’ wtf is wrong with me it barely even counted so even if i did it again it wouldn’t change shit. idek. used to use a seam ripper or a needle dig it a bit into my skin and drag it across slowly, it would leave scars and scabs but almost never bleed and when it did it was really really little. i’ve always been scared to go fast in one go and enjoy the pain of slowly digging in. i’ve been clean for 6 months, but rn struggling bc i want to do it again. now i feel even worse because i’m struggling sm over this but it’s not even fucking bad like i never bled out properly some ppl have it so bad and i’m out here crying over some fucking scabs who cares if i do it again it doesn’t even count i’ve been ‘clean’ like wtf is wrong with me. ‼️TW SH‼️so i used to ‘sh’, which consisted of using either scissors or a seam ripper on my forearm and like slowly drag it in. problem w it though is that i very rarely bled, it did leave scars for a week or two but then it faded. i’m in a better place now, and i’ve been sh free for 6 months now, and idk if i should be proud. i didn’t cut properly, i didn’t bleed very often or very much and it isn’t as bad as so many others. i see other people celebrating it and i feel amazing for them, but i just don’t feel like it was bad enough for me to celebrate it. idk.
    Someone (who’s not you) that is not having a good time at the moment, so they’ll take it out on you and make their problem, your problem. That if you are happy but they are not, you cannot be happy.Both looks and personality wise?. Could God cure someone with dementia right now if he wanted to? When I say if he wanted to, I mean that the human would get cured on it’s own with God’s help, unless other humans intervened as well. Has anyone ever actually been cured of dementia or any incurable disease nowadays and been able to tell about it?. Why even get it, what would someone learn if they know the reason for why they are the way they are?. I have an aunt that does this for me. I feel like I do want to get close to God and be a part of Christianity but my aunt makes the experience horrible for me. Makes me not want to know none about God or Christianity, when that’s never my intention. Everything just seems forced with her. Asking God for guidance doesn’t seem to work for me. When I ask him for stuff, I don’t see it happening most of the time, only when I don’t seek it from him that it happens most of the time. What else can I do?. Why doesn’t it work for me?. Like, you would be taken more seriously that how you are in your adulthood.. Apart from having a somewhat stable life, why go to work almost everyday for years, decades if you’ll only be able to free yourself from that when your in old age, not being able to appreciate it all to the fullest?. Can you genuinely ask a question and people just not care or take you seriously?. For instance, taking care of someone for a long time and them doing different wrong things in a repetitive way, that it makes you hear it or see it at times when they’re not even doing it?

The problem is that the mail from previous people that lived here won’t stop coming.I know that him playing as a female may have raised some thoughts but many guys have acted like that before without any rumors being highlighted about them.I never thought about it in the moment but after the finals I noticed how Max missing all those shots was something similar how as last year in the 2022 he missed a lot of shots vs. the Celtics before making some.Like, you are getting to know someone (with the intent of a relationship) and the both of you expressed mutual feelings for each other but you are told that throughout it all that if you don’t seal it or act fast, someone else will steal her/him from you that fast. How can you look for a relationship with someone but if they don’t act fast (in weeks), you’ll just move on to the next one?.

If you delete your cookies after every session or just have your cookies completely turned off, does it mean that most fingerprinting won’t be allowed?. If you’re just using a VPN, how can your real identity/location be discovered (apart from you blatantly revealing it)?. What’s so special about it, why do people still upload files in that format?. Or vegetable broth as well. Is it some type of liquid you can just buy? Or is it the liquid that’s left over after cooking chicken?. Why is it used a lot, by different people for different occasions even when it’s not their actual name?. Not saying trying to be the center of attention but just wanting someone to care about you. As if the point that you became an introvert was because you didn’t feel the love that you wanted/needed.Only adding water, no milk.Edit: Y’all just gave me answers that I would never thought of. The different things y’all add to it, caught me by surprise. But thanks anyway. Appreciate it.I don’t know much about these type of people, only know that they typically live a life that is different from some others.From what i’ve felt, when there’s a lot of heat outside in the day and you leave the windows closed, the inside will be cooler than the outside. But if you leave them opened with a heatwave, it’ll bring the hotness inside the house.Is being in a lot of situations that you don’t want most of your life be a contributing factor?. I’ve seen many people look at different types of food, like inspecting them before buying at like a grocery store. Like, they would look at a fruit or vegetable and inspect it for something.Is there things that you should look out for when buying food?. Where they we’re before the fruit was eaten. I‘ve always envisioned a cloudy space where we wouldn’t have control of what we want to do but another redditor mentioned (in another post of mine) how heaven could be like how Adam and Eve had it, with free will to be happy. Just want to know, I guess.Why?. Even if you and the younger you are dealing with the same thing?. Why the 21 age limit? I’ve dranked liquor when I was like 10 even though I didn’t get drunk. Apart from getting drunk, if a 8 year old and a 20 year old are drinking beer together, is it going to affect them differently?. Would they?.
    Having gas,bloating,constipation during depression 😔. I have a squint eye not severe but it's bothering me my biggest problem is I don't go out...
    hiii (19f) bc Canada, im looking for a genuine friend who’s interested in a variety of things and is willing to introduce new things to me :) I’m at a point in my life where I want to experience things, be adventurous, spontaneous and just kinda have fun and find out what I like because life has been kinda boring for while lol I like different kinds of people: I like outgoing people, people who Idek like the outdoors, know a lot of cool spots or ski or snowboard or camp, or shy people who like to be indoors and read and acquire knowledge of some sort or know a lot or play video games. I really like gamers tbh and if you’d introduce me to a new game or something you like or play one I already like with me that would be cool tbh im super open minded. If you want to be friends or know more about me (if you live in bc Canada preferably that would be nice) I want someone I can have genuine conversations with and give my loyalty to and just chill with tbh. I’ve been with my partner for 2 years and his family is just a mess… for starters, the environment is toxic for my bf and he always feels depressed, which in turn always changes how he treats me and he shuts down and he won’t talk to me, or he’s distant and this lasts for a couple days but it’s very often… and his brothers are entitled and needy… every time I’m with him (which isn’t a lot) they call him multiple times, they ask for stuff from him, and it pisses me off because this is my time with him and they always somehow ruin it or get in the middle of it or my boyfriends dealing with his brothers shit or his family’s shit and he’s constantly overwhelmed. I don’t understand why you would answer spam calls from people you live with when you basically just arrived at my house.. and I feel terrible about it. he also feels d3pressed often and feels like he has no control of his life because of his family.t he way he treats me depends on how his family treats him or makes him feel… he’ll shut down and not really wanna see me or not really talk to me for a few days. But this happens a lot. also just don’t like his younger brothers as people and they make me uncomfortable because I didn’t grow up entitled or arrogant and they don’t seem to have much respect. I don’t like how having siblings takes away a lot from your life… or how he seems to ALWAYS be doing something for his family and doesn’t seem to have as much time as me as I’d like… as an only child with not a lot of family and I don’t understand.

If she has like a sports car or something? Or does it not matter and it doesn’t change how you view her/ how much you find her attractive?. Not harmful like slashing someone’s tires but Yk something like idk someone getting your dream car like a bmw or something lmao. So when I’m depressed I literally can’t sleep, but my friend sleeps like 18 hours a day when they’re depressed, why can’t I do that?. Especially during an argument where I was like, “this happened, it made me upset” I can never remember what they said or what I said but I can remember exactly how I felt, the room I was in, the circumstances, the sensations, the smell of the air but not words??? or even over text I can’t remember the words??. It can be anything like idk cooking knitting etc but state your age. I preface by saying that this isn’t a joke and it took a lot of confident to post this because I know someone will make fun of me…A bit ago I had a (idk what you call it) meltdown. It was because I lost my favourite sweater and I know I wouldn’t be able to find it anywhere else ever again and I’ve had it for like 4 years. When I realized I couldn’t find it and searched everywhere multiple times I started getting more and more upset (crying, throwing things around, tearing the house apart) looking for it more, and eventually I got so overwhelmed I started hyperventilating and I couldn’t feel my whole body, everything went numb, I couldn’t feel my lips and I couldn’t keep my eyes open. Before this I started screaming and beating myself up in the head and rocking back and forth and like slamming my feet on the ground rocking on my bed, I kept repeating stuff like I couldn’t find it, I couldn’t mentally look for it anymore because I was so frustrated and overwhelmed… I couldn’t really talk during this or I’d just repeat myself this hasn’t been the first time there’s been many and it’s almost always over not being able to find something, or not understanding something.

This is really personal… but I didn’t know where else to take itIn my relationship, my partner uses the excuse of “I wasn’t feeling well mentally” or “struggling” all the time to excuse themselves from ever listening to me, or really showing any genuine care.I understand and it’s a valid excuse and I have empathy for that which is why I always put my needs aside. I bring this up because they sleep a lot, when I text or talk about my problems it’s like they won’t really stay in the conversation very long or come back every like 20-40 mins like it doesn’t even really seem genuine, or like they barely come to see me or really ask to see me or really do anything when I’m upset, or they’re just doing something and this is like a side thing.“busy” or I feel like there isn’t any space for me or my problems in their life. I don’t feel listened to because it seems like his struggle or their feelings or discomfort os anything is above mine and I try to deal with everything alone and it’s lonely. I’m not sure at this point if I’m being a burden for dealing with life stuff as well and wanting to talk about it like a real conversation as if it’s over the phone. They weren’t really there when my mom was in the hospital, or when I was stressed about career stuff and wanted to talk about it, I have to beg them to stay in the conversation.They always use this struggling reason and I tell them that they aren’t the only one struggling? The only thing they want from me is to leave them alone and sleep for hours and hours. So I ask when is this a reason and when is it ok to put your foot down and say it’s enough? But it sounds so mean.

My friend is a sentinel main and I’m an initiator main. He bottom frags or goes negative almost every single game and I have to carry (with the duelist) every game and he uses excuses such as “I’m a sentinel not a duelist I’m not supposed to get as many kills” or “it’s attack I’m not supposed to get kills” but then with that logic he doesn’t get kills on defense he just gives them site and apparently he can use his own excuses to defend himself for doing that. Is it true sentinels aren’t supposed to get kills and bottom frag or is my friend just bad?. As a Jett player, if omen or something smokes your entrance, do you rotate and entry somewhere where there isn’t a smoke, or do you entry through anyway and how do you do that because I keep getting killed lol. Ok so for 2 months now my skin has been really itchy, it started on my scalp and neck and it’s gone everywhere on my body now. When I scratch, little red or skin coloured “hives” come up but they go away after like an hour or 2, it feels like it burns after a while but I scratch so hard I’ve given myself petechiae. I got a blood test and they’re checking for hypothyroid and I’m really worried. I don’t have any other symptoms, but does anyone with a thyroid issue relate to this at all?.
    I don’t want to work, I don’t want love, I don’t want to learn anything, I don’t want to pursue creative endeavors, I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to sleep. Even if I had everything handed to me and I didn’t have to work to survive I think I’d still want to die. The benefits don’t seem worth the struggle to me, so why should I continue to waste resources other people can use? Why not end it so I don’t continue to pollute the earth with my existence? I can’t imagine being here for another 60 years. I don’t see why I shouldn’t die.I hate having adhd and shit memory and feeling like an imbecile everytime I open my mouth. If I could at least be beautiful it would make up for the fact that I am a moron but I am also cursed in the looks department and would have to pay tens of thousands of dollars on risky plastic surgery to look even half decent. The only thing I can do at this point is be a kind person (And I don’t do a great job at that) but even then I am too hollow for anyone to willingly spend more than a few months around me before they conclude that I am disposable and that they could easily find someone better off the street. I hate myself for being self-centered and overly concerned with trivial matters that are tied to my ego as opposed to worrying about actual problems that need to be solved.I want to die but I won’t kill myself (for now) because I don’t want to further upset the people around me (I’ve already upset them by being a failure of a human being). I feel like I’m being held hostage by the duty I have to stay alive so I don’t traumatize my family/friends by killing myself. As I fall asleep at night I’ve started to pray to god or the universe or whatever may be out there that I don’t wake up the next morning . I wish I had never existed in the first place. I don’t want to be remembered or thought about, I don’t want a funeral…I just want to be gone. I know it will happen eventually and I’m trying to be patient but that patience is wearing thin these days and I don’t know how much longer I can stand this life shit.I wish that I was competent. I wish people wouldn’t give me a look of pity or disbelief. I wish I wasn’t here. I’ve just been continuously experiencing depressive symptoms since about the age of 10, I’ve never experienced a real lift but there are periods when the depression is less severe. I really wonder if this is just my personality at this point and I have some sort of personality disorder that is being missed somehow by therapists. It really doesn’t feel like I have a true sense of identity outside of this supposed illness or that I have “an old self” that people talk about before they experience depression.I used to think about dying or killing myself and it would scare me even though there was a part of me that wanted it. But nowadays when I fantasize about killing myself I feel relief. I don’t feel sad or wonder what life could have had in store for me, I just feel calm. It’s one of the few thoughts that calms me down. Am I just dumb or have I been depressed for so long that I’ve become cognitively impaired from it? I can’t form sentences without pausing to choose the right words because they don’t come to me as naturally as they seem to come to other people. I feel like anything that requires sustained focus makes my brain and my eyes hurt and the only thing I can have a fluid conversation about is the state of my mind because all I can think about is the emotional pain I’m experiencing. I can’t retain new information, I have no opinions of my own and I just feel like I’m walking through a dense fog of confusion/exhaustion all the time. I’ve felt this way since my early adolescent years and I never did well in academic settings but as I get older it’s becoming more disabling and I feel like I’m doomed because I don’t remember what it’s like to be “normal” and the thought that this is just my natural state horrifies me.I’ve become an angry and bitter person over the years and I feel disgusted with myself because of it. I wish I could feel happy for other people but I find myself thinking shitty thoughts about myself and others constantly. It sucks that these thoughts seem so.. real? justified? But they aren’t helpful thoughts so I’m supposed to convince myself otherwise. Has anyone been able to work on their anger/bitterness?. I can never decide if the things I am worrying about are worth worrying about, If life really is worth living, If I genuinely am a shitty human being, If my thoughts really are “distorted” or just based on reality and cognitive behavioral therapy serves as another means to deluding myself into thinking I am worth something. I don’t value my own judgement when it comes to making any sort of decisions because I feel like I am wrong about everything. How can I tell when it’s the depression speaking or it’s just the hard truth? I feel like I’m going insane. The fact that it’s difficult to function on the same level as others while being depressed makes me want to vanish and not speak to anyone which makes me want to isolate more which adds fuel to the depression and causes the cycle to repeat. I am an empty shell of a person and I don’t want to waste people’s time nor do I want to be perceived. I don’t have dreams, goals, or desires and I’m tired of having to pretend I do when I interact with others. Then I feel like a bad person because I am lying to people. My existence feels like an embarrassment and my thoughts and actions always feel wrong and I can never trust myself enough to make good judgments/decisions. Because I can never trust my own decisions I just remain stuck living at home working a dead end job not knowing where to turn to next. I wish that every trace of my existence could be scrubbed clean from everyone’s mind and I could disappear completely, but maybe nobody actually cares enough to remember me. The thought of nobody caring is a relief in a way even though it’s painful.
    when you’re around them all you’re life You must attract them And is that because you’re the same?Or do you give take on their tendencies?After all we was created by them. Don’t you think it’s funny the more depressed you get you somehow do such a good job at hiding it, people think you’re doing good.It’s funny how social media portrays depression as you’ve got to be looking at your worst for people to acknowledge your depression. Depression isn’t what they make it out to be.I’ve been depressed since my existence due to multiple factors mainly trauma & family based.I’m percieved as doing ok because I don’t look a mess or “depressed”People say I love your smile but my smile comes from pain.People think you’re healthy just because of exterior but when I look at myself my health is getting worse.People think you got money but I’m just about surviving.Maybe it’s because this society is so ignorant.Everyone believes the narrative they have because they don’t really care.Just wanted to know if anyone feels the same since my life progressively gets worse each year.Just a matter a time before sh*t hits the fan. Just not sure how much more life I got in me.I feel like I’m at a point in life where I’m grieving the loss of what I thought was good for me isn’t even though it’s my biological parent.Imagine knowing you have parents who live not even 10 minutes away but never call, message, bother.Imagine having parents who say they love you but it takes you to communicate to them for them to respond and even when you do they shut you down and pick when they want to love you.Imagine knowing you have 2 parents married who have been happily married the whole time you been alive but don’t want anything to do with you.Imagine having parents who reject you yet go church every week preaching about Gods love.Love is consistency.They have 0.Imagine having parents who have 2 kids but only get 1 kid diagnosed with autism and support their condition but ignore the other one (I’m oldest).Imagine have parents who basically told you they never wanted to have you but everyone tells you you have a purpose but if your parents didn’t even love you or want you on purpose then regardless of what I want to be I won’t fully be because end of the day they already set the standard for everyone else.I can’t imagine it. Although I’d like to.But unfortunately it’s my reality.Hey everyone,I feel pretty low tbh.I have no one really when I look at my life who is really invested or loves me due to unfortunate circumstance of being born under a family where my mom pretty much neglected me from a young age and my dad didn’t bother with me.I realised I can’t even bother with relationships because I never had good relationships with my parents to ever dream of having a good loving relationship with a potential partner. Previous partners in the past were abusive and always highlight how I never got love from my parents hence why it’s so easy to not love me.I try so hard to be positive and want more out of life but when I look at it for what it is I don’t really see the point. Most people’s purposes is their family but I have 0, I have 0 friends, I have 0 support.Everyone I see around me has at least one parent out of two that loves them but I don’t even have that.When I look at my life I feel like I’ve failed so much I just feel it’s better my life is just not life. I worked from a young age but just seem to always be held back due to family making my life hard I’ve been unable to prosper in my career the way I’d have liked. I’m 26 and I been working since 18 as I was kicked out from then. Reasons why I feel like a failureEnded up more masc presenting due to my dad not loving me or protecting making me work from young (16yrs old).Working full time but not moving further due to multiple issues with personal because of my family.Get worse off every year.Have no real healthy relationships.Health gets worse yet I’m only 26 (developed IBS, got high blood pressure and recently got another urgent message regarding my health which I haven’t got round to because I struggle to stay on top of life as I have 0 support system)I feel I’m just fighting a losing battle.Sometimes I want more out of life but just starting to feel like by the time it happens I won’t even be here cause life takes a toll.
    Does anybody else despise their living circumstances? I lived in a much more comfortable home with my mother a few years ago but due to finances and other factors I’ve moved to a small one bedroom apartment in an extremely overcrowded and depressing environment. I can’t stand where I live!. Does anybody else despise their living circumstances? I lived in a much more comfortable home with my mother a few years ago but due to finances and other factors I’ve moved to a small one bedroom apartment in an extremely overcrowded and depressing environment. I can’t stand where I live!. Help me. Someone please help me. My depression is so crippling all I do is cry or scream into my pillow. Each and every day is torment. I mean seriously, every minute is agony. I can’t bear to go on any longer. All I want to do is die but I’m too afraid to go through with it. Is anyone else in the same boat?. Are you kidding me? You’re going to touch everything and spread your nasty ass germs everywhere. Smh so nasty 🤮. Can anybody tell me anything positive that might uplift me today? I’m staying with my sister who is a heroin addict and she accidentally shot cocaine yesterday and it scared the living hell out of me. We’re broke, sick and depressed. I need positive words of encouragement. Please. Anything.I got four treatments done in June but got a bit manic so I chose to stop. Then I got three more done in September but the whole process of getting put under and getting the treatment done was too scary and traumatic for me so I decided to stop. I absolutely hated the feeling of the liquid anesthesia and it always frightened me knowing what was about to happen to me. Overall it was a negative experience for me. I’m wondering if anyone else feels the same way? I’m impressed by how brave some of you are, proclaiming how well it went for you and whatnot.Just wondering what types of supplements and foods I can take/eat to treat depression? Thanks!. I had to move due to finances but I liked my old place much better and I’m starting to panic. I’m already suicidal and anxious as hell, this is making me spiral. I’m so heavily influenced by my environment. So basically, I’m not well. I’m so upset. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.How do you cope with the loneliness? What makes it easier for you? I live alone and am feeling depressed.If so what are your experiences with it?. Like the title says, I know someone who lost a left leg and I’m just wondering how long it might take them to learn how to walk again.I was told by my psychiatrist that Prozac is affective in treating depression alongside treating the constant worry that many people with anxiety suffer from. I have been desperate to find a medication that works for me and I’m trying to remain optimistic that Prozac might. I start it next week. Can I hear your success stories? What mg are you on? How long did it take to become effective? Anything else I should know? Thanks in advance!. I only work a couple days a week because of my depression, all my other free time is spent doing absolutely nothing with absolutely no one. I have no friends and my family is toxic except for my mom who I feel like I’m just a huge burden on, so I try not to go to her about my issues.I’m typically a fucking mess every night recently but I actually had a decent day today. I currently live in a small studio apartment with my dog but today I saw a one bedroom apartment I can move into in December and it actually really uplifted my mood. I’ve also had a couple glasses of wine. Idk why I’m posting this. I guess I’m just so proud of myself for having an okay day and I felt the need to tell someone. Is there anyone else on here who felt better than usual today? I’m super hopeful because of it.My dog is constantly jumping off my bed and I’m worried about her hip, spine, and joint health. I’m thinking of sleeping with just a mattress on the floor to prevent injury. What is your experience with it?. I live in a small studio apartment and my dog likes to wake up many times a night to potty and it gets frustrating when I work the next day and lose sleep cause of it, or any night for that matter. Is it wrong of me to take her water away before bed? She sometimes likes to drink lots in the middle of the night which I think contributes to her going potty a lot at night. I feel like by taking her water bowl away overnight I could avoid this problem.I’m so depressed I haven’t been able to stop crying lately. I have no friends and am so insecure of my appearance. I just got out of a psych ward recently and unfortunately it didn’t really help at all. Can someone please give me a reason to live longer?. In highschool I was so popular and well liked with no anxiety or depression. College was similar, except for the onset of anxiety of depression. I was still popular but starting to feel extremely self conscious and much more anxious. I am 27 now and my anxiety and depression are debilitating. I can’t even see friends anymore. It’s been a couple years since I’ve been social. I miss the old me but there is no turning back. I’ll never be her again. How do I accept who I’ve become? How can I go on? I struggle just to get through each day. Sometimes I have suicidal ideation but I know I could never do that to my family, so I’m just at a cross roads. Can anyone else relate? I’d appreciate any feedback. Thank you.Tell me I’m not alone.I had the worst day. I’m supposed to start a new job next week but my car completely shit the bed today. I had it towed to the shop tonight and hopefully they can fix it by tomorrow or Thursday because I’m supposed to drive to my employer on Thursday to pick up a tablet I need for my new job. I am at my sisters apartment now and will be for the next few nights, with my dog, but she is a heroin addict and evidently high tonight. This is so hard for me and I am so stressed out. She picked me up tonight with her boyfriend and we had to drive 30 minutes in the pouring rain while she was high on heroin. I feel so scared and alone. Can someone please tell me I’ll be ok? I have absolutely no money until I start work but I’m afraid I won’t be able to start if my car isn’t repaired in time. I have never been so stressed in my life… and it’s so hard to be around my sister while she’s high. I’m hanging on by a thread here. Please, any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.I feel like I’m constantly disappointing the people in my life, specifically my twin sister and my mom. Can anyone relate?. Tell me honestly, why do you love God?. I am too anxious and depressed to work. I struggle to hold a simple conversation and can barely focus on anything. I’ve been living off the system and barely get by, I mean really I am so broke but I can’t bring myself to work. It seems nearly impossible for me. I feel pathetic and useless and am so lonely. I do nothing but drive around all day and spend time with my dog who is the only other soul on earth I can really bond with. Can anyone give me any advice? Can anyone relate?. Most days I wake up feeling really sad and alone. My anxiety is crippling and I feel like my life is stagnant and everyday I just go through the motions. I was extremely popular in high school and college. I was beautiful and happy with lots of friends. Since then I’ve become depressed I no longer prioritize my appearance or social life. I just dress in sweats and hang around all day and go for long car rides and listen to music instead of doing normal things. I have like 2 friends that I sorta catch up with here and there but I haven’t seen either of them in over a year. I’m alone, sad, and frankly scared of my future. I bought a French bulldog and she is my best friend.Thankfully I have developed a strong relationship with God. He is also my best friend. I feel so embarrassed. I have no job and I live off the system because I am too anxious to work. I sit around a lot just day dreaming of a day when everything is ok… because honestly right now it is not ok. It is so far from ok.Still, I feel alone and sad and useless. Can anyone else relate?.
    I've already written my Goodbye letter this morning, cried myself to sleep last night because I knew this time was going to be different from last time, the pain i felt this time hurt so bad different from the mental breakdowns I usually experience, I started to shake so badly and sweat uncontrollably, rapid heart beat, dizziness it really felt like I was going to die right there in my seat. Last time I tried to commit suicide I was procrastinating using pills, i only took half the bottle. Crazy how I wasn't supposed to be typing this right now because the plan was to, this morning wait for my mother to leave out, write my goodbye letter, hug and kiss my pets spend some time with them and shoot myself in the head but soon as I was heading to grab the gun my mom shows up back home faster than expected. I got really mad cause now I have to wait till she leaves back out again I don't want her to be here when it happens. Atleast the insurance money will help her get into a better spot in life and i don't have to be a nuisance to anyone anymore. It hurts even more to know I will be taking my life the same way my father took his own life, gunshot to the head in the bathroom. Threw out my hole life ive just been one big disappointment to everybody, im just so stupid I can't seem to stop been a fuck up. I just can't go further in life anymore like this. 24M my name is Jadess pray for me I will need all the love & prayers I can get on the other side. Goodbye to everyone sorry I couldn't set a good example for others out there who's unfortunately in the same boat as me.
    The other day, I (25F) layed down, and my boyfriend (27M) started doing other things. I heard him laughing, and I thought it was because something funny happened to him. However, I asked him what was going on, and he told me he was listening to some comedians. Normally, he watches podcasts out loud without headphones, and since I didn't hear anything, I approached and saw that he had them on. I asked him why he wasn't listening as he usually does, and he said it was because he didn't want me to hear it. I told him it was okay and that I was interested in knowing what kind of things made him laugh. He refused, even though I asked him, and that bothered me a bit.We talked about it just now, and I wanted to watch the video he saw the other day, simply to understand what he listens to. He told me I didn't need to watch it because he knows it would make me uncomfortable since it's dark humor that's homophobic and sexist. It's important to mention that I'm a woman, and I'm bisexual, and I constantly analyze the social and personal context regarding issues of homophobia, sexism, racism, etc.Right from the start, my boyfriend and I had very open communication because we met at a point where we were both starting to question our sexist and racist behaviors. I've always believed that he has a strong desire for self-examination, and we continually discuss these things together. However, when he told me that's the kind of humor he enjoys (and I hear him laughing a lot every time he watches it), it made me uncomfortable. I feel that our discussions on these topics are somewhat in doubt, and it doesn't make sense to me that he finds it funny when he himself criticizes it a lot and constantly self-analyzes his own actions.He told me he doesn't want me to watch it because he doesn't want to feel judged, but I'm conflicted because these are issues that affect me as a woman and as a bisexual, and I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with him finding humor in things that affect me (which is why he didn't let me listen to it).Am I wrong to feel uncomfortable and tell him about it? I don't intend to make him stop consuming that content, but I feel unsettled, and earlier, he made me feel guilty for feeling this way, saying that I want to control him, which was never my intention. I just feel like I don't know how he sees me as a bisexual woman if that type of humour makes him laugh out loud. We've been together for 2 years now.TW: suicide.Hello, this post I write with tears in my eyes and zero energy to carry on. I've been depressed since 2015, with post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression diagnosed since 2017. And things have continued to happen that have made me worse. At some point a few years ago, I thought about hospitalizing myself in a psychiatric hospital, but I was told it was too risky because there are very high cases of assault. I've sought psychological help, and it hasn't worked for me. I'm thinking about finding a psychiatrist to medicate me. But the truth is, I can't anymore; it's very hard for me to live. The truth is, I've lived through too many enormous things to deal with the trivialities of my daily life. Thinking about doing the dishes, having to constantly clean my house, worrying about things that are really small for other people, weigh on me too much. They distress me a lot, and the truth is, I no longer feel willing or have the energy to deal with any of it. My mind and body hurt a lot, and all I want is to die. I have some anchors, meaning, people who still keep me alive and beings I love with all my heart, mainly my grandmother and my cats, and my partner. But I'm thinking about ending my relationship because he doesn't deserve to have to deal with my depression and my lack of will to live because he has a lot ahead of him and has fought hard to deal with his own depression. Therefore, I would like to read comments that make me feel a little better. Maybe even book and movie recommendations. I'm not looking for words that tell me that everything will get better or that I shouldn't decide to leave because those words don't work for me anymore. I honestly don't know what I want to hear anymore; I'm just very tired of living, and these suicidal thoughts are getting more and more intense.

Thank you for reading this far.I'm starting to watch OITNB again, and I don't know about Larry proposing jaja. I feel like he's anxious and maybe scared that she will leave him or that she will do things inside of prison if she's not engaged with him. What do you think?. I personally HATE him so much. I tried being compassionate with him jaja, but he's just too selfish! He doesn't take his time to think about his decisions and doesn't care about the consequences either. I feel like Lorelai and Rory have been too compassionate and understanding with him, and he doesn't deserve it that much. I understand he was young too when they had Rory and that Lorelai didn't want to get married... but that doesn't mean he didn't have to be there for them. And I get mad that Lorelai falls everytime for him because he's charming. 🥲. Hello, I hope you're doing well. The reason for this post is that I (25F) have an immense amount of traumas that I haven't been able to cope with. Currently, I'm not attending psychological or psychiatric therapy, but several years ago I was prescribed medication by a psychiatrist, and it helped me a lot, but I think I've gotten worse than that time, I even hace new and strong traumas. Right now, I'm not taking anything. Today (and a couple of times throughout this years) I've thought about hospitalizing myself in a psychiatric hospital. I once talked to one of my closest friends about it, and she told me that it wasn't the best decision because there's a high statistical rate of patient rape in those places (I'm mexican, here in Mexico there are very few mental health centers that are actually safe but they are really expensive). Regarding my experiences with traumas, since I was very young, I've lived through parental negligence due to my parents being alcoholics, and this led me to different situations that marked me for life. For example, seeing my dad and mom drunk from a very young age, being aware of my parents' alcoholism at a young age, and carrying my dad up the stairs to prevent him from falling because he fell several times. At the age of 11, I had alcohol poisoning because access to alcohol in my house was very easy. That day I almost died, and they didn't take me to the hospital. They had told me that the reason they didn't take me was due to money, but now that I'm 25 years old, I realize that it's because it would have put them at risk of losing me for obvious reasons. I also started going to clubs and getting so drunk that I would become unconscious at the age of 15. We used to go on vacation and during those trips, my sister and I would go to clubs alone. I was 15 years old, she was 17, and I was raped on three occasions by three different people. Once at the age of 15 or 16, precisely on one of these trips while I was practically unconscious. At 16 and 17 by another person, and at 18, on my birthday, by my partner. Let's add that I lived with my parents for a long time until just three years ago when I moved out, and throughout my life, I witnessed how they would get drunk daily and be violent with each other, and that was very traumatic for me. Therefore, due to these family experiences, including the rapes I went through, I isolated myself from people and became a hermit, and I feel a lot of anxiety about leaving the house. The day I told my parents that I was raped, they re-victimized me, telling me that it wasn't rape and that it was my fault. And that's how it's been ever since I told them. They haven't supported me, they've never asked me how I am, nothing. They've never come close to ask me anything about it, and they continue to re-victimize me, saying things like 'a man goes only as far as a woman allows.' The other day, I even talked to my dad about the experiences I had at home due to their alcoholism, and he told me that if I had alcohol poisoning at the age of 11, it was my responsibility, not theirs, and that my sister and I going to clubs and drinking that way when we were so young wasn't their fault because teenagers do whatever they want, and there's no way to control them. Lately, for several months, I've been feeling very depressed. Actually, it was around 2017 or a little earlier that I started experiencing depression. In 2018, I fell into the worst depression possible, and I haven't been able to recover from it. This was precisely due to an experience at home because of my parents' alcoholism. I don't feel motivated to do anything, I feel extremely mentally tired, and I don't want to live. And while, as I mentioned, I'm not undergoing psychological or psychiatric therapy, I feel that's not going to be enough anymore, and I need to be in a place where I'm encouraged to do different things – move, wake up, get out of bed, eat – because I can't do that anymore, I don't have the strength to do it. I would like you to talk to me about this. I would like you to share your experiences of being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital, if possible, and tell me which psychiatric hospital you were in and how much it cost.

Thank you very much for reading this far.I (25 F) have a relationship of almost two years with an incredible man (27 M). One of our best features is that we communicate our feelings, our annoyances, what we need, what we don't need, etc. A few months ago, I came across a girl's profile my partner follows, who had the same name as a girl my partner had sexual encounters with years ago. Regarding this second girl, I asked him to unfollow her because it caused me a lot of insecurity. He unfollowed her and everything was fine. It's important to mention that this is something we've both done. If something causes insecurity to him, we work on it and find a resolution point. Sometimes it means unfollowing. I've unfollowed or blocked people precisely to not make him feel insecure, and this is something he did for me this time. It's not something I usually ask of him because I'm not normally a jealous person, but I felt that way on this occasion. So, going back to what I was saying, I asked him about this first girl I mentioned because I thought she was the one he had something with before, and he told me she wasn't and that she was just an acquaintance, not the girl I thought. I let it go more or less because something was bothering me, and I couldn't quite figure out what it was. Yesterday, I posted some stories on our Instagram business account, and saw that she liked them, so I went to her profile, and found that in all her recent photos of her, where she's in the picture, my partner gives her likes. He likes all of her photos, except for the ones where she posted landscapes, her dog, her cat, etc. That caused me a lot of conflict because I felt like he was choosing which photos to like, as if he's favoring this girl. So, I went deeper into the girl's profile and found that in slightly older posts, he would leave comments like 'I'm in love' or heart-eyed emojis. That caused me a lot of distress, frustrated me a lot, and made me feel very powerless. It wasn't what I wanted to find, but something in me told me I would find something like this. Even though we weren't together when he left those comments to her, it's still a conflict for me that he continues to like her posts (her selfies specifically) because based on his comments, he was attracted to her at some point, or they might have had something. I told my partner that I found this, that I felt insecure, frustrated, even stupid and guilty, and that I felt betrayed. He explained that, yes, they did flirt and exchange messages before, and they confessed that they were attracted to each other and said they would meet up, but they never actually met. He insists they never met, but it's a conflict for me because, to me, the fact that they messaged and flirted doesn't make it any less significant, and adding to that, him liking all of her selfies today, absolutely all of her photos, makes me very insecure. Later, I felt practically obsessed with this situation and started searching more, and I found the girl's Facebook profile, and I can't see much more of her profile because it's mostly private, but her profile picture, which she uploaded just about two weeks ago, has the 'love' reaction from my partner. He not only "liked it", but he "loved it". That made me feel even more betrayed because my partner told me he only liked the photos he came across on his feed, but seeing that he 'loves' her profile picture leaves me with a lot to think about. I feel betrayed because when he tells me he feels insecure we deal with it, and I'm very careful when it comes to talking to other men (which means that, if I feel they are flirting with me, I stop the conversation). With this, I feel like he's not doing the same and I feel very afraid of the possibility that he might be talking to other women who flirt with him or that he is even attracted to.Right now, we haven't talked much because I feel very bad, and in fact, I've been feeling very bad these days because I had a fight with my family, since they basically don't want me to publish my thesis because I write very personal things about the family negligence I experienced, and this doesn't help at all. Could someone give me words of encouragement to help me feel better? What do you think of this? I feel awful, and even guilty for feeling this way because I don't wsnt to be controlling of him. But I can't deny this broke me a bit.😞. 🔶SPECIAL ATTENTION TO ASEXUALS IN OPEN OR POLYAMOROUS RELATIONSHIPS:🔶Hello! I am a 25 year old sex-positive asexual (but very occasionally open to it) and I have been in a relationship with a 27 year old allosexual person for a year and a half. After months of introspective work and deep discussions, we have decided to 🔹OPEN THE RELATIONSHIP🔹. He is a highly sexual person, and while we have tried some alternatives, I have realized that I am not 100% comfortable with them. So, opening the relationship became our last option to fulfill that aspect for him. Initially, he was quite apprehensive about it, finding the idea a bit overwhelming, but after further discussions, he realized that it could potentially benefit both of us. 🥺 Nevertheless, he is afraid because we genuinely love each other and he doesn't want me to get hurt. However, I told him that we will never know if it works for us unless we try. We agreed that I would draft the rules that we would follow, and then we would discuss and make any additions or edits together. I have some rules already, but I would like to hear your point of view on what rules you think are essential. I already have a few, and you can also share your opinions on them, but please do so with RESPECT:•ALWAYS USE CONDOMS. No excuses.•Never have encounters at his home, always in a neutral place (preferably a motel to avoid creating any deeper connection beyond sex if he goes to someone else's home. I feel that anyone's home is a very intimate place and it carries some risks. Do you think this is too excessive? I'm not sure).•Not having more than one or two encounters with the same person (I haven't decided yet whether it should be one or two haha. Because if there are multiple people, there might be a higher risk of STIs if a condom breaks or something similar happens. Overall, I'm not sure if this point is a good rule. I included it because I feel that having several encounters with the same person can lead to developing feelings or confusion. But I'm not sure).•Due to the above, getting regularly tested for STIs.•Using Tinder, Bumble or a similar app to get to know people that are not from our social circle.•Not having encounters with people with whom he had encounters in the past.•Not having encounters with people for whom he once had feelings.•Not having encounters with people I have ever felt jealous about (that's quite obvious, but I prefer to include it just in case haha).That's all I have for now. I'm still unsure if I want him to tell me when it happens and with whom. I suppose that will be something to try out and decide if I feel comfortable with him sharing or not. Help me add to my list.Thank you very much for reading.Hi! To give you context, I'm gonna give you some details that I don't know if are important jajaja. SA TRIGGER WARNING:I'm a rape survivor, I was raped 3 different times by three different people. That was on 2014-2015. I'm on a relationship right now with a very caring man. We were best friends before we decided to become a couple. A few months ago I realized that I "might" be asexual (greysexual, I think). I say that I "might" because I don't know if it has any relation with my rape experiences (which sometimes I doubt because I look back before I was raped and I was never really into sex. I acted on it because of the other person involved but I sometimes felt disconected or uncomfortable, as if I was performing a porn video). I didn't have a sex ed at all at home and that took me to porn and "learning" from it, unfortunately. So I feel like what I did was for the idea that I as a woman should please the man I'm with (obviously that's not what I think today and I think it was a subconscious idea in the past).Anyway, I starting touching myself since I was very little, and I did it A LOT at some point... I even thought I could have an addiction, so today I'm really carefull with it jajaja. BUT, the majority of times I touch myself today, I do it because I'm anxious or because I'm bored, not because I'm actually aroused. It can even be hard for me to focus.Does anyone else here do it for anxiety as well? I feel like my mind makes me feel uncomfortable or even guilty for touching, sometimes. :( As if my body doesn't deserve to feel pleasure.Hi!

I've been teying to avoid consuming porn for years because I had access to it too soon and I have to admit big part of what I learned by myself about sex, was because of it (my parents never talked about it with me, I know it's a global problem tbh). Anyway, even though I've been consuming so much less of it, there are times I do... and when I do I have came across staged performances that include rape while the victim is sleeping and I do get turned on but I know IT'S NOT OK. I want to stop that because I know it may be because of trauma and even though I feel what I feel when I watch those videos I also get back to my rape experiences and feel a lot of shame and disgust. I wanted to know if someone else is experiencing something like this. 😔 Also, that's NOT something I want to experience myself even if it's with consent (letting someone have sex with me while I sleep), so... please share with me.

    My mother is abusive. Verbally and physically. As the status is well known basically by every single person in this ummah, she uses that her advantage.She goes on a cursing rampage on my faults and mistakes as well as exaggerating them and making up false claims about me. She backbites me.She has always hit me. Her character is bad. Period. But she cooks, looks after the house, and has put up with me as a baby.Put up with me. But in reality it's highly possible that she has smacked me in the face countless of times as an infant.She makes bad'dua for me, constantly wishing for me to never succeed. She goes out of her way to always discourage me and always claims, that because I have offended her, I will fail. Because Jannah lies under her feet.One examples is exams. She would curse me out and confidently tell me that I will definitely fail. I passed, but the whole process of preparing and studying for those exams was made hard because she would say that all the time (even though these exams are easy).She has made me suicidal for almost half my life now. I lived basically my whole life feeling unloved because she treated me as a burden.When she keeps on doing what she does at some point, I feel like I need to defend myself, or else it will get worse. At the end she beams in pride because she's mom and no matter what she does, her respect is worth more than my pain. She is a narcissist. She doesn't care about anyone else's feelings except for hers.Why is the bar for being a good Muslim parent set so low by our society? Especially for mothers. Yes childbirth is hard but when the da'wah community has always focused on that, it has now acceptable for mother to deem her job finished up giving birth. That now jannah is under her feet and she will face no consequences for her actions. Mothers have become a separate caste in the Muslim world.I am a scholar, but feel so lost. Those seven years in madrasa I never found anything substantial and clear cut about this. Just vague bits here and there. It doesn't help when the sheikhs and the da'wah community constantly talk about the rights of parents and when there's more clear hadith about their rights than children's. Nothing like, "Don't curse/berate your child", "Don't beat your child" even though naturally child abuse occurs more than parental abuse as the child is the one from the start that's weaker and at the person's mercy.*Mercy.* In da'wah, a lot of da'ees and traditional teachers talk how parents should be respected because the baby was at their mercy. Why at their mercy? As if parents have an option to not be merciful? The child is their responsibility. Some of them act like these children asked to be born or deserved to be abused. It doesn't help at all when all we do is bring up hadith that are generic (be kind, be merciful etc) to n audience where there are no potential perpetrators. Muslim parents (especially boomer generation and older, definitely going to the first humans) do not see themselves as generic but exceptional, so they need to be addressed directly.Even despite my knowledge she treats me like garbage. Both my parents treat me and my siblings unequally (this is the only concrete right of children I know of).Honestly at this point I have tawakkul issues. I think what if Allah chooses to side with my parents instead of me this matter. The happiness of the lord lies in the happiness of the parents and the displeasure of the lord lies in the displeasure of the parents.And they have been displeased. The problem is that it's my misery and suffering that makes them happy. They like control. They want me to just heed to everything they want like robot. And it makes me want to kill myself. It's come to a point where I just don't feel any love for them anymore.Which is worse? My parents feeling disrespected (even from a civil disagreement/having different opinion, just a simple no) or me being abused (if Allah even considers it abuse that is).Most others just straight up leave Islam when they go through this like me, but I'm still in because my aqeedah is strong alhamdulillah.I can't talk to my peers (other ulama) about it because they just don't get it and I'm ashamed to tell them because we're supposed to be the last to ever think of suicide or have bad relationships with their parents. A couple who I open up just straight up dismiss me and tell me I should just make up with my mom. I can't make up with my mom because that just boosts her narcissism and gives her more room to continue abusing me. And again, I don't love her.I'm hoping someone who studied more than me, has more knowledge than me can just talk to me about this because I just feel so lost and nobody around me irl wants to hear me out. They all sympathize with my mom even though majority never met her.I'm out.It was abrupt and not planned out. But I'm out and at a safe place.I'm feeling guilty now because I have gone NC with everyone. And the last thing I heard of them is that the APs haven't eaten in 2 days and are weak from crying. I blocked everyone from the family because they're all just telling me to come back.I'm never coming back.They think it's because of a trip. No. It's the whole lifetime of abuse. And I'm done.Baba,I'm fine. I'm safe. But I don't want to talk at all. There's no point in talking now because there was no point of talking then. I did try to communicate before when I used to live in the house but because anything I said or even indicated which differed even slightly from your opinion, would offend you and Ammu. Before I could even explain myself for anything you two would end it with saying that I'm disrespectful.So I gave up. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. It's not only just about the trip it's about everything I've gone through all these years. I'm angry, and I'm hurt. If I list all the things that I remember you both did and said from the first memory to now, it would never end. You say she used to beat me "sometimes" for my own good. How is nearly killing me numerous times for my own good \[Spanning from the time when I was three and she smacked my head so hard with a wooden broomstick at the edge of my eye at nanu's house that my whole face was bleeding (everyone held me down and used perfume to rub my face because there was no alcohol in the apartment) to the time she tried to strangle me right in front of you a couple months ago and you sat there like it's nothing\]? How is constantly telling me to go kill myself for my own good? How is always telling me that I'm going to fail in everything before I even do it, for my own good? How is telling me that I'm not a human for my good? And the list goes on. But I'm supposed to respect her? to help her? That's how I lost so much weight. Because she's always in the kitchen when I come home from school and I had to avoid her as much as possible because who knows what she would say or do? Even if I would help her, she would be quick to criticize the whole thing, say how she knew I would not do it properly, and undo the whole thing. Quite frankly, I lost respect for her years ago. A narcissistic psychopath. But you said a couple months back, "So what if she beat you your whole life?" After I told her not to touch me when she was beating me.And you're not free from this either. You were also complicit. You also would say and do awful things. Just a couple years ago you tried to shock/electrocute me with the car battery charger and got angry and offended when I tried to get away. As if I'm supposed to passively allow the two of you to literally harm me and have no problem with it? To be harmed is good for me?It came to a point where all my nightmares had just you two in it. No matter what I did you two were never ok with it. I was never good enough. I was doing alima and you two would complain how people my age were doing well in academics and doing SAT and going into college. As if I wasn't the one who asked way early on in the very first year that I didn't want to continue but you said no. She even said to my face, when <insert golden child's name> was studying for the SAT, that I had nothing and she was doing something. Then I go to college and you two say people my age are already getting married and having jobs- all while not letting me get a job. That's all what you would do; complain and demand. You both would always compare me to so many other people's children who are my age while ironically badmouthing their parents. Did it even occur to you that maybe it's the parenting that's the reason for the difference? But no, you two are perfect and faultless, how dare I even bring that up! You two never encouraged and even would discourage me and downplay everything. So eventually I stopped trying. Ammu would alway say I was going to fail the TASC but when I passed she switched to saying that the score is not enough to get into college. But before I can even tell you I passed, she tells you all excitedly first (narcissism). When I graduated from alima course you both almost looked upset as if you wanted me to fail and said the teachers just barely passed me; but then go on to have the audacity to brag to other people that I finished the course all while berating me for it at home. And the inconsistency keeps going on.You both complain how I'm not acting like a grown adult all while treating me like a child and controlling every aspect of my life.So much control to the point that despite being an adult, you thought you could just pluck me out of anywhere at anytime regardless of how important it is to me and just drag me overseas whenever you want. In fact you were so egotistical that you didn't even care to think, "Oh, she is an adult, what does she think of going?" But instead you just booked the ticket and decided I was going. It caused me absolute torment to be always surrounded and kept in an environment where the rights of the people who are abusive to me are more important than my wellbeing and if I care about myself even a little bit then I'm selfish.But you say you two did your best? Yes, for your egos and control. But as parents, far from it. I don't want to contact you at all for a very long time. **The Narcissist's Prayer:**"That didn't happen.""And if it did happen, it wasn't that bad.""And if it was, that's not a big deal.""And if it is, that's not my fault.""And if it was, I didn't mean it.""And if I did, then you deserved it."\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\-KEY-Nanu: maternal grandmaAlima/alima course: A 6-7 year course at an Islamic seminary to become a Muslim scholar. These institutions in western countries have you drop out of the public school system, make you register as "homeschooled" but you end up neglecting secular studies because they don't really take charge of it and the parents of the students are mostly immigrants who at most maybe scraped by high school back in the motherland. I started when I was 12 years old.TASC: "Test Assessing Secondary Completion". It's a high school equivalency exam. It wasn't easy to prepare for considering the fact that I never finished middle school.The thing itself inside me making me want to die won't kill me. It will make my chest hurt but it won't kill me. It feels cruel. Why even?. The human death tool is already high. It made me wonder, what about people's pets and just like the strays and ferals who people may have looked after? Is anyone keeping track of that?. And then there's the people in warzones who have it miles worse. It's beyond frustrating that, forget about me being unable to do anything for them, the people in power who can do everything to stop it, actively will not do anything about it. Whether arab or western. All at "best" that came out were empty words of zero weight. The Muslim leaders have betrayed the ummah. They are weak to their whims and meek to to the west. I keep bawling. How and why does Allah allow such evil worse than shaytan to flourish on this earth and keep harming those on his side? The level of evil displayed, I can't seem to even come up with words to describe it. I just get even more filled with anger and the worst of me keeps coming out. And it's crazy that people for the most part refuse to see it as such. Jahannam exists for a reason and surely including for this but how much longer will Allah let this continue? And I don't want to hear stuff like, "oh it's fine they're martyrs in jannah and the Dunya isn't worth much anyway," THEY WERE STILL MURDERED. There is still a great sadistic monster out loose who will continue to commit injustice and inflict torture. I am losing hope. The world will remain silent and let it all pass and make it long forgotten. The arab leaders will continue to break their fasts with banquets and build skyscrapers. The west will continue to destabilize parts of the world for power and pillage. And no one will give a damn when another one happens. We all keep saying this is the end of times but this was what people thought all the time. People thought it was qiyamah when Baghdad was taken down by the Mongols. I don't think this era is it. The world may continue for a couple thousand years before it happens even, in the meantime, things will get worse and worse.EDIT:Ok so this kind of crazy, but I was just scrolling through shorts to get my mind off of things and got [this.](https://youtube.com/shorts/VE7wHeLupIo?si=NS8JkELAfakSSNXp). Call me a racist, I don't care. I feel angry at the current state of the world. By Allah, I wish I could scream out the Dua of Nuh (عليه السلام) and all these Europeans and whites just get struck by a punishment. Why did Allah stop giving his punishments to nations of oppressors? Why doesn't he bring them back? The bubonic plague wasn't enough for these wretched swine? How much farther will they go? Their bloodlust is insatiable. They could have all their questions about Islam answered but these devils won't ever even change because their whims are their only priorities. Give them all the wealth of the earth, give them all the women, children, and animals to grape, and blow up and they will still want more. They'll come up with something even more sinister and demented. Just consume and kill, kill and consume. And they love it. They live for it. Unreflective. They kept humans in zoos but wallahi these people should be experimented on to see if psychopathy is in their genes. I won't say more but I have severe baddu'ahs for them. Their animalistic behavior and ways never changed, just embellished. Utter cancers to humanity. And I don't want to hear stuff like "b-but white converts and bosnians!" Tf do they want? A cookie? For the most obvious thing? Did they commit a great feat by being Muslim or was it that Allah graced them with his mercy of guidance which is often remarkably so uncommon and unheard of towards their kind because of their stubborn mindset and culture rooted in Godlessness? That's like a human deciding to finally act decently and not like a pig. I'm just angry. I hope the worst happens to them on this earth and in the hereafter. I have lost any shred of respect for these people. *"People"* Nothing but a breed of Godless sinners. They're the real human animals. وَقَالَ نُوحٌۭ رَّبِّ لَا تَذَرْ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ مِنَ ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ دَيَّارًا ٢٦إِنَّكَ إِن تَذَرْهُمْ يُضِلُّوا۟ عِبَادَكَ وَلَا يَلِدُوٓا۟ إِلَّا فَاجِرًۭا كَفَّارًۭا ٢٧>"And Nuh said, ‘O my Lord! Do not leave on earth a single one of those who deny the truth—">"For if You spare ˹any of˺ them, they will certainly mislead Your servants, and give birth only to wicked sinners, staunch disbelievers.". Finally going to actually go to a therapist but they said I may get prescribed meds. Kind of wary. I'm not sure if pills can do much for 15+ years of trauma.
    39f quit my job last year after a mental breakdown. CPTSD, depression, anxiety, all the fun stuff. I have nothing to offer this world. No degree, no actual skills, no kids or family. Just a few houseplants and my sense of impending doom. I can barely bring myself to get out of bed and I’m drowning in debt getting deeper by the minute. Trying to get motivated to look for jobs is really difficult when I am constantly getting rejected. Sending me deeper into my spiral where I only recently starting considering the permanent solution. I just wish I had something I loved. Or even just moderately enjoyed. Anything worth getting out of bed and out of my head for. My brain feels broken.I was on 50mg for two weeks and was advised start taking Trintellix instead due to the severity of the side effects. I switched down to 25mg a few days ago with the intention of tapering off completely and it seems like a whole new world. I finally have some energy, feel better physically and a lot clearer than I’ve been in a while. I’m considering going against my doctor and sticking with it at a lower dose, especially because I don’t want to deal with starting something new and all the fun that comes with that. Does anyone have experience with Trintellix or a similar situation with a positive outcome to lowering your dose? I’m very new to this and would appreciate any suggestions/advice.
    I wish my parents never gave birth to me. I curse them for bringing me into this world. These past 18 years have been nothing but hell. I hate everyone and everything. I hate myself and my life.

I currently take whey protein powder after working out at the gym. Is creatine worth it?&#x200B;What are the side effects of creatine? And will it affect sleep?. As the title says, I am a freshman and I have never went to a single party. I am socially awkward and struggle with anxiety and autism and parties and social gatherings just don’t appeal to me. I don’t want to be pressured to drink or dance. I also heard parties cost money, and I don’t wanna waste money just to leave after half an hour or an hour.I don’t feel normal because almost everyone parties. I know I need to get out of my shell a little, especially as a business major, but I just don’t wanna party. Are parties even worth it?. In my floor, there are always kids breaking things in the lounge or breaking tiles in the corridors. People are also playing around with the fire extinguisher. The lounge got locked and now we have to wait until we can get keys to open the lounge. Also, the rest of us in the floor have to pay extra for all those damages which is dumb.Also, my building’s fire alarm always goes off every 2 weeks and all of us have to stand out for half an hour and I’m getting so sick of this shit. Two weeks ago, it happened at 3 AM.During move in week, it was hell too. My floor was a party floor and every day, my roommates would bring over guests and party past midnight.Does anyone else in Hassy relate to this?. So my cousin is a senior in hs and is applying to colleges for CS. He plans on applying to many top colleges like CMU, MIT, Stanford, Georgia Tech, UIUC, Purdue, Berkeley etc. He has a 3.9 UW, a 1590 SAT, and 35 ACT. I called him a failure and disgrace because he doesn’t have a 4.0, 1600, and 36. I said he wouldn’t even get into community college and that I would disown him if he was my child. He then got pissed and blocked me on everything for telling the truth.I am a freshman majoring in Marketing and considering adding a double major in one if them or maybe even switching. Will the classes be very math heavy? If so, what is the hardest math in them? What other technical skills do many of these classes require?In general, what are questions I should ask myself before going into the accounting or finance fields?. As the title says, I am a freshman at ASU Tempe Campus and we started almost a month ago.I am majoring in Marketing (Digital and Integrated Marketing Communications). However, I am considering switching to finance or accounting completely or adding a double major with one of them.I am in three clubs: FBLA, Finance and Accounting Career Club, Sun Devil Stock Exchange.I currently have all As in my classes, but midterms are in a few days.I feel like I am doing nothing though.I feel like I am not socializing enough with students or going to office hours with professors and trying to network with them. My roommates and almost every business major I know seems to be partying and socializing almost every day. I am an introvert with anxiety by the way and never enjoyed socializing and had zero friends in high school. I also feel like I need to be more involved with career events and stuff.I struggle to pay attention in class and struggle with time management. I said that I would try to learn more about investing, but I barely make time for that.I feel like I do nothing except go to class, do homework, go to club meetings, and spend my free time going to gym or going on my phone.Can anyone tell me if I'm on the correct path and give any suggestions on what to do?.

Also any other advice in general? Like what to do and stuff?. Also, should I use Windows 11 or Windows 10?. Imagine not being a Washington Indian Male in CS attending University of Washington.If yes, is it allowed to do more than 1 event in one year?Like for example, one marketing event and one finance event.By the way, I am a freshman and joined DECA this year, and didn’t do DECA in high school, so I am wondering.Started gym like a month ago. I do 30 min cardio every day. Need advice on what weightlifting exercises to do. I’m a freshman and as the title says, I’m starting to really regret choosing ASU.I’ve just never been outgoing or very street smart and never liked to party and everyone is so outgoing and social. I’ve always been very socially awkward and just a boring loser and never fit in or relate to anyone. I have been struggling with mental health issues and learning disabilities my whole life. Don’t ask me why I chose ASU even though I’m like this because I’m stupid AF.My roommates and suitmates literally party every night in my suitmates room past midnight with other people and blast music and are so loud. They always drink and vape. I have no problem with it, but they ask me every day to try it even though I never vaped or drank before. They did respect it though, but it’s annoying when they ask all the time. We’re chill most of the time with each other, but that is one of my complaints even though I don’t like very outgoing and social people mostly because I’m insecure about myself because I suck in every way possible.Today, they literally begged me to say the N word (hard R) and the Fa Slur just for their entertainment. I didn’t want to and they got mad and said that if I don’t say those things, I hate black people and gay people.I’m already considering transferring out of ASU after this year ends.I know this is dumb, but just needed to get this off my chest.Edit: It’s been a day and now they’re being chill again and this topic hasn’t beem brought up. The partying shit is maybe not the complete worst thing because it seems pretty normal in college, especially ASU. Also, even if they were fully quiet, it’s just been harder for me to sleep in general ever since I moved here and at home, I have struggled to fall asleep. If it gets more and more annoying, I can maybe talk to the CA about it. But them begging me to say slurs is just stupid middle schooler humor. If that happens more consistently, I’m going to get the fuck out and find better roommates.I am a freshman at ASU who joined both FBLA and DECA. I will drop one of them though. I just want to know what are the differences of each and pros of cons. I am a digital marketing major who probably will switch to finance or accounting.I’m a rising freshman at ASU and I joined both DECA and FBLA. I will drop one of them though. So I need help on which one is better, DECA or FBLA. I’m a digital marketing major who is also thinking of switching to finance or accounting. Which organization is better for these?.

For these majors, which club is more useful?. Recently moved in to ASU. Used the guest WiFi but it seems slower than with cellular? Is there any other WiFi I should use? If yes, which one and what is the password?. Just write “PRESTIGE” the number of the maximum words allowedex) 250 words max, write “PRESTIGE” 250 timesThat’s an auto admit. I know this question is kind of dumb, but I am a rising freshman and just got back my textbook list. Will there be like free online PDFs of them? Or is it also just like high school where a lot of students don't use textbooks most of the time?. So as the title says, I never did stocks in my life. I want to get into learning more about the stock market and how to make good decisions. Can anyone give tips for absolute beginners on where to start and how to go from there?. So I am attending Stanford this fall for CS, but my friend is attending CMU for CS. Today, I laughed at his face and called him a failure because I’m going to an overall T20 while CMU is T22. He then got mad at me. AITA?. Which schools do you need to go to for those fields too? Just curious, lol.I heard it matters where you go for like high finance and consulting roles, and like it doesn’t matter too much for like CS.I am a rising freshman at WP Carey and will major in digital marketing. However, I’m kind of considering switching to either accountancy or finance.I am thinking of joining a club related to them to see whether I like them or not.

I'm an upcoming freshman at ASU this fall, and as the title suggests, ASU is a big "party" school. I don't like partying or being social or outgoing that much.

Will the trainers do a good job in helping you achieve your goals?. My GPW is a normal one by the way, not the superlight one lol.If yes, what are the benefits and does anyone know any good ones that I should buy?. I (18M) have ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, and Depression all at once.I just hate people who say that depression is just a choice or mindset or tell depressed people that they're playing victim or faking it for sympathy.Or they just downplay our struggles by saying that you shouldn't be feeling depressed at a certain age or that you shouldn't feel depressed unless you're like an orphan, have divorced parents, low income, have extremely abusive/neglectful parents etc. I also like to be alone all the time and I have been told this same thing.I hate those kinds of people so much. Those people are just gaslighting us whether they know it or not.Also, what majors are like that in that school? Just curious, lol.Intended Major: FinanceStats: GPA: 4.0 UWACT: 3614 AP Classes (Got 5s on all of them) and 7 honors classesExtracurriculars: 1) Will be president of DECA in senior year (qualified to ICDC every year)2) Current President of Economics, Finance, and Investing club (Will be President for senior year again3) Interned at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley4) Founded a couple startups and made 100k+ profit5) Made 1 million off of investingIs he fucked?. As the title said, I'm feeling both happy and unhappy about going to college.I'm feeling happy because I can be away from my parents for a while and not have to deal with them being in my business and make me listen to their dumb rules, even though they will still force me to call them every single day to tell them about my day. I'm also happy because I can take some more fun classes than compared to in high school and have a little more freedom because I can eat whatever I like and the earliest I have to start class is at like 9 AM unlike in high school where it was 7:30 AM. I'm also looking forward to get a fresh start by joining clubs because I didn't join a single club in middle or high school.But I'm also feeling very unhappy because I won't have my own room anymore. I have many weird things about me and have always needed privacy and my own space to survive. I have also been struggling with ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, and Depression, which probably contribute to the way I feel they way I feel today. Having my own privacy and space has been something very very important to me. One other thing is also having to be pressured to make friends and talk to people more and just get out of my comfort zone. Growing up, I have always been socially awkward and just a bum in general. I don't have any good interests or hobbies and nothing good about me in general, so when high school started, I just choose to isolate myself, so I decrease the risk of being judged. I'm going to be pressured to talk more to people because I'm thinking of doing some business major and a lot of people need to network I heard. And also because I'm going to ASU which many people consider a party school, and I would probably be judged for not wanting to party, even though I'm just not a party guy. I'm also just going to be pressured to work on myself a lot more by everyone even though I just don't have any motivation too and I'm a lost cause.I know it sounds stupid, but I just needed to let this out.I heard that my little brother's friend's older sister did both CS and premed at MIT for undergrad. Now she's at Harvard med school (without CS though). 1. Get a 4.0 UW/5.0 W2. Get a 1600 SAT or 36 ACT (Better if both)3. Take 16+ APs and get 5s on all of them 4. Have godly extracurriculars and godly awards. Ex) Be president of 3* clubs, intern at top companies like google and microsoft, win a nobel prize, cure cancer, crack time travel etc.5. Write a cracked essay about those godly extracurriculars/awardsYup and that is how you get into a T20. Any other school = Complete Failure Also remember that any other field than medicine, law, engineering, or CS = Complete Failure And that’s how to succeed in life. I hate living this life. I hate everything about myself and my life. I curse my parents for giving birth to me.I wish I could magically live the life I want and forget this current one or just die in my sleep. I'm sick of this life. Call me crazy or stupid or whatever, but it's true. These 18 years and 8 months have been nothing but hell..
    I wonder what it feels like to not feel like this everyday. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like a bomb that could go off at any time. I don’t think my antidepressants are working anymore. I’ve felt so incredibly hopeless over the past few weeks. And irritable. I’ve been putting on a brave face and sucking it up, but it’s draining. All I want to do is lie in bed and waste away. I’m just so fucking sad all the time and I don’t know why.Me and my ex have been broken up for over a year at this point. I was doing well I think. I had stopped thinking about him, gotten into a new relationship. There would be things that would remind me of him from time to time but I’d get over it pretty quickly. Then, like, two months ago, my ex texts me and apologizes. We’re both in a relationships. He’s getting married for god sakes. To a girl he started hanging out with a month after we met and literally got engaged to maybe like 2-3 months into their relationship. WHILE WE WERE STILL TALKING AND FLIRTING WITH EACH OTHER. Ever since he sent me that text two months ago I feel like I’ve thought about him everyday since then. I hate that he texted me and I hate that I responded. I told my current partner about it and he obviously got upset and all communication stopped at that point. I just wish he would have just left things alone. I don’t want to think about him or hate him, or have any feelings towards him at all. I was doing so fucking well getting to that point until he fucking texted me and now I feel like I’m starting all over again.I’ve started to isolate myself. All I do is work and go to sleep. I’ve been ignoring all my friends. I’ve been ignoring my therapist. The one good thing I’ve been doing is consistently taking my antidepressants, but I’m not even sure if they’re helping at this point. I just feel nothing. All. The. Time. It feels like things are happening around me and I’m just there. I’m not really experiencing any of it. I feel like I’m functioning on autopilot. I just don’t want to exist. It’s becoming too mundane. Too boring. I have no purpose. I’m just here. Just existing and doing nothing. I don’t even think doing anything or having a purpose would fulfill me. All I want to do anymore is sleep. If I could just spend the rest of my life asleep I’d be content. I’m tired of having to be a person and be conscious lol.It’s been a year and he has the fucking audacity to reach out to me and apologize for the shit he’d done. I was completely fine with never hearing from this man again but then he reached out and now all of these emotions start to resurface. Most of them not good. He’s still with the girl he tried to keep a secret from me. In fact, they’re engaged. This is all shit I had to dig through his social media to find out. I doubt he ever planned on telling me. He said he wanted to try and rekindle our friendship because he missed talking to me and he missed the connection we had. All while having a fiancé. All while keeping that fiancé a secret from me. He claims that their relationship is open. That his fiancé is okay with him talking to other women. So if that’s the case, why not tell me right from the start? Why did I have to dig to find that shit out? This has made me realize that I still have a lot of pent up rage and anger towards my ex. I can’t even put it into words. I don’t like this feeling and I hate that he has the power to make me feel like this. He was never a good person. He did a decent job of playing one, but ultimately, he is and always has been a selfish asshole. I’m mad that I gave him any of my time, my love, my body. I wish I could take it all back and erase every trace of him from my life.I feel like I’m living on autopilot. Everyday is the same and the days that aren’t I barely remember. Is this all I have to look forward to now?. It’s so hard for me to articulate how I feel sometimes. I know a lot of people say talking helps, but sometimes I just don’t know what to say or how to say it. I just feel down sometimes. I don’t have a reason for it. Or it may not have even been triggered by something, I just wake up and I’m sad. I don’t know why and I don’t know how to deal with it, because how do I explain that? How do I talk about that? There’s nothing in particular making me sad, I just feel that way. It’s so frustrating to deal with, I want to be able to talk it out and release whatever may be pent up, but how do I do that when I don’t even know what’s bothering me.I’ve been doing this my whole entire life and it’s so frustrating. How do I learn to just validate myself?. It’s always so amazing to me when I meet people that are passionate about things in their lives and have hobbies and whatnot. I don’t have a reason to want to wake up every morning. I just do. I have no goal that I’m working toward. I have no purpose, no drive. I’m just here. I want to be able to enjoy things again and be excited about the next day. But I just can’t. I don’t care if I wake up tomorrow or not. I don’t have a purpose or a reason to be here. That doesn’t make me wanna do anything, but it makes all of this feel pointless.I know he’s not coming back. I really want him to, but I know I should stop hoping. I’m trying to move on, I’ve been dating around here and there, but nothing really ever comes of it. Dating just makes me feel even more sad lol. I’m not really sure how else to move on though. Thinking about him hurts way less than it did 4 months ago, but it still just sucks to know that he can do so much crap to me and make me feel like shit and just continue on with his life without a care in the world. I don’t understand it and I know I never will. I think me dating right now is just my need for validation pushing through. I like the attention I get and it feels good to know that I’m wanted by somebody even if it is just for my body or my looks. I know it’s shallow and I don’t really think it’s helping at all which is why I’ll probably get off the dating apps soon. I’ve been using them as a distraction from the loneliness I guess. I know that I need to be alone and just sit with my feelings for a while, but when I do that, I go to really dark place and that scares me and that’s why I’ve been avoiding it for so long. I’m just rambling at this point. But I’m tired of trying to keep it all together most days.I wish I could just do the things I should and clean my room, or eat healthier, or try harder, or just be a better person. I hate that I never want to do anything or see anyone. I hate that it never feels genuine when I’m having a good time. One moment it feels like I’ll be okay and I’ll be able to handle everything and then all of a sudden I can barely even leave the bed.It been a year since we broke up and 3 and half months since we’ve stopped speaking. When does it start to feel okay? Like I’m not doing something wrong? I thought that meeting and talking to new people would help me stop thinking about him and move on, but it doesn’t. It all just feels so fake. Like I’m pretending. Idk, if that means I need more time or what, I just need to do something so that I stop thinking about him all the time.I decided to try to get back into dating and it’s been awful. I met my ex in dating app and everything just happened so perfectly. Now every new connection just feels like a dud. I just feel shitty and objectified. This is probably the 5th time I’ve downloaded a dating app this year and every time I end up deleting it a week later. I want to move on, but it feels impossible.I used to look back on the last text he sent and literally feel sick. Now I just feel nothing. But I still think about him daily and still catch myself daydreaming about our life together. I don’t think he’ll ever reach back out, but that doesn’t stop these thoughts from happening. I don’t know if I’m over him or have just become desensitized to the feeling and emotions that come along with thinking about him.We haven’t spoken in 3 months and he keeps showing up in suggested people to follow. Should I follow him? He doesn’t post anything so it wouldn’t be to check in on what he’s doing or anything. Just would kind of be like an olive branch.I’ve been having a tough couple of days and could use some tips or something. I feel like at one point I had a sort of “zest for life” as they say, but now I just feel nothing for the most part. I don’t care about anything. I’m not actively making plans to end things, but I don’t really care about what happens to me. Everyday feels exactly the same, I feel like I’m moving on autopilot and have been for a very long time. I go to therapy and take medication and it has made things a bit better, but I don’t have any motivation to do anything or go anywhere. I feel hollow. I don’t really know if it’s something that can be fixed.It’s been 79 days since me and my ex last spoke. 🙃. My ex and I broke up almost a year ago now, but went NC 2 1/2 months ago which was my decision because he lied and broke my trust. At the time, I told him I wasn’t ready for us to try and be friends again because of what he did. But the problem is that he was pretty much my only friend. I have other friends and what not, but not like that, not ones that I feel comfortable telling everything to like with him. I’ve been having a tough time lately and I’ve been trying to talk about with other people, but it’s just not the same. It’s like I’m talking and trying my best to explain what I’m feeling but they just don’t understand or they give me the generic “well, things will get better just give it time” or “just go outside and get some fresh air, don’t stay in bed all day”. And that’s fine and dandy, but it’s really not the easy and I feel like I’m getting annoying with bringing it up all the time and now they’re just kinda brushing me off. It wasn’t like that with him, he would try and cheer me up or give me some encouraging words and relate to me. I miss that. I feel like he won’t reach out because he thinks I hate him for what he did and I feel like I’m just being petty now because I feel bitter about how he chose to act after the break up. I felt like I shouldn’t reach out because since he did something shitty he should be the one trying to get back into my good graces. The past few times we tried to be friends it would always sort of go this way: I would be the one to break the silence after initially asking for it even though he was in the wrong and then we’d fall right back into the same routine and I’d end up heartbroken because when things would start becoming more serious he would say shit like, “I’m scared and I don’t think I’m ready for a relationship” or “I don’t want you to be in a relationship with someone that’s so confused about everything.” But lately I’ve just been finding myself not caring about any of that, I’m just sad or numb all the time and he was the only person that made it any better. Basically what I’m trying to ask is: should I just bite the bullet and break the NC?. When did you know it was time to get help or that you had a problem?. I’m a bit tipsy and I have the right mind to text him that I want us to try and be friends again. For a 4th time.It’s been 2 and a half months since we last spoke and it was because he lied about his relationship status and I told him that I think it would be best for us to not speak because what he did hurt. He told me how important I was to him and that he needed me in his life and that although he didn’t want us to stop speaking he wanted me to do what’s best for me. Even after all of that, I still keep hoping that he’ll text me one day and apologize for everything and regret his decision. I feel dumb and I just want a ballpark on when this line of thinking will stop.Let’s say they broke up with you because they said the weren’t ready and then proceeded to date someone else and then a few months later came back, would you accept their apology and try and work things out?. That he won’t ever realize what he lost because he never thought I was that great to begin with. I just want some confirmation that he’s as fucked up over this as I am, but he’s literally back on dating apps and in an open relationship living it up. I think I kind of hate him.I feel like I can’t the times when I don’t feel like this anymore because I know inevitably these feelings will always come back. Like, there’s no cure for this. It doesn’t matter what dosage of medicine I take or how much journaling and therapy I do. I’m just always going to come back to this feeling. I hate feeling like this and it’s like no matter how hard I try, it’s always just there. Waiting. And what’s worse is that there’s not really much I can do about it. There’s no reason for this feeling. Nothing has happened. It’s like one day I was completely fine and actually feeling good and happy then all of a sudden I’m tired, have no motivation, and just sleep all day. I’m just really tired of having to struggle with this. I thought it’d be different this year because I was actually getting help and being more proactive about getting my mental health in check, but now it just feels like I’m back at square one.Wishful thinking.I’ve lost interest in most things and I’m spending more time sleeping. I’m the most anxious I’ve been in months and I just feel exhausted all time. I’m doing my best to fight it off, but I’m really tired of having to deal with this.The lexapro isn’t helping as much anymore. I’m going back to all of my bad coping habits. I thought that I beat it some how, but I think we all know that’s not how depression works 🥲 I was doing well for such a long time and it just hits me out of nowhere. I’m drinking pretty much every other day, I feel like crap all the time and my sleep schedule is all out of wack. I just want to be okay for more than a few months. I try my best to keep the negative thoughts at bay, but it’s getting harder. All I want to do is sleep and not speak to anyone. I’m tired of feeling like this.I was doing really well for a while and now all of sudden everything is going to crap. I’m drinking more, I’ve stopped journaling, I’m having trouble sleeping. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if this is caused by him or my annual depression. But either way, I’m not doing too well.Why is so hard for people to communicate their feelings? I don’t understand what is so hard about telling the other person that you’re having a hard time or you’re not into it anymore. Why prolong something you’re not feeling anymore? If you aren’t ready to be a relationship why not just say that from the beginning? Why wait until someone is emotionally invested? I’m angry and a bit drunk. I feel used and tossed away. How can people be so fucking selfish? I hate just being okay some of the time. I want to be healed from this shit already.It doesn’t hurt to think about him anymore, but that still doesn’t stop him from being on my mind all the fucking time. I’m tired of always thinking about him. Even when I’m out having fun, I’m thinking about him and our relationship. I’m starting to get annoyed with myself. And him. He’s not even around and he’s still fucking with my head.He didn’t and it honestly hurts.Gonna be kinda tough.That’s it. That’s the post.We’ve been no contact for two months now and I’ve been doing pretty well, but I keep low key hoping he remembers the day of my birthday. It’s dumb because I know he won’t and I’ll just end up being disappointed. I did a silly thing and sent him a gift and a handwritten letter earlier this year for his birthday and, I don’t know, I guess I’m just hoping for at least a text or something.I’ve been listening to open hands by Ingrid Michaelson nonstop, makes me pretty sad, I think I need something a bit more positive 🙃. I’ve accepted everything that’s happened between us. I’m not holding any grudges or writing anymore journal entries about you. I’m finally letting all that shit go. You had an amazing woman that would have given you the world and you knew that, but you didn’t want that. I can’t help you so I’m done trying. I no longer feel that pain in my chest when I think about you with other people or that twinge of anxiety in my stomach when I think about my life without you. I feel so much lighter. You are everything that is wrong with you. There was nothing I could have said or done to save our relationship because, believe me, I tried until the bitter end, but you’ve shown me who you are many times and I didn’t want to believe it, but I do now. I’m thankful for all the lessons you’ve taught me and all the good times that we’ve had, but I can officially say that I’m done now, I’m over the situation and I’m over you.?????? I don’t understand how that is supposed to make me feel any better. Thinking back to when he said this makes me so angry. If I was so great, then why did you choose to leave? I am better off without him, but that doesn’t stop me from thinking about all the contradictory things he said to me while we were still talking. What was the point of it all?. I don’t want to be the bigger person and send him well wishes when he’s the one that fucked everything up. I want him to hurt as much as I do. And I hope he is. I hate that because he did a shitty thing, I’M the one left hurting and he gets to just move on to someone else like it didn’t happen. It’s not fair. I’m tired of thinking about him all the time and crying over things he said and broken promises. I know this is only temporary and these feelings won’t last forever, but I just really wish I could skip this part.It’s our second time doing NC. I thought I was doing really well, but I’m just so emotional today and I really miss him. I feel like I’ve been on the verge of tears all day. I know that I shouldn’t reach out to him and I won’t because of how it went the last time. But it would be so nice to just have him here right now. I hate this feeling.I know that he’s struggling with depression and he told me that I was the only one he’s ever spoken to about it. I said that we shouldn’t speak right now because he lied to me about something pretty serious and it hurt me. I’m doing much better and it’s been about a month and I worry about him a lot, but I don’t know if its because I want to rekindle what we had or if I’m really healed enough to reach out to him again.
    In my school the lunch lines are more of a mob than a line, and I'm really short so whenever I get in line what usually ends up happening is I get shoved between people and basically squeezed the living daylights out of, but to be honest this is the most physical interaction I've ever received in my life, and I almost look forward to it because I crave closeness so badly. I don't know how sad or not that is lol. One of the biggest reasons I can never seem to get the actual help or support I need is that I'm suicidal and I can't be completely honest with that in things like therapy. I need mental help so badly but I always hear the horror stories of mental hospitals and how they don't really work, and usually just make things worse. I'm wondering what I should actually do.I need to have a costume for Halloween because I have to wear one for my school, and I was struggling trying to figure out what to be. I'm supposed to be a character from a film and while looking through options I became really frustrated. For a lot of my childhood I was made to look a certain way and I was always badgered about it and forced to lose weight even when I was sick, and had my hair processed to be more "neat," and my family would pinch my nose to make it more of a defined nose bridge. I think all of the image issues I had from that made the feeling I have now a lot worse, and while looking for a costume I was really looking forward to try and find something where I could actually feel comfortable in my appearance for once. I had a really hard time finding characters to do so I asked my friend's for suggestions and they all started replying with really ugly or fat characters, for example ones based on my hair being big and outwards, suggesting I go as Willy Wonka or pennywise. I jokingly replied (this was all over messages btw) "wow you guys are sure roasting me, huh lol" and they responded confused saying it wasn't a roast at all, they just thought the characters would really fit me. Honestly that made it so much worse because it just enhanced that people perceive me that way, in an ugly messy and unattractive way, and the fact they didn't even mean to be mean and were simply saying what they thought was objective hurt so much more. I hate how ugly I am to everyone, especially as a gender queer person. I don't fit the expectations for what people find normal to look like and it's to the point they think it just makes sense for me to dress like a freak (one person even suggesting a circus ring master from an anime) I don't want to confront them because they would 100% say I'm just being too sensitive, but I'm starting to consider becoming isolated again and dropping yet another friend group. It feels like no matter who I'm around no one ever likes me for everything I am. I know how superficial it sounds but I wish more than anything that someone would think I'm pretty, or at least not think I look like a freak of nature. People say they don't even see me as human sometimes, and it hurts so so much. It doesn't help that the only people to ever call my attractive before were extremely abusive individuals. I still need to figure out a Halloween costume (and I really can't skip it) but I feel so hurt right now and I don't know what to be still. I just don't have the energy to keep this up, and I wish I had someone to support me, preferably someone who actually likes me and the way I look :(Edit: thanks for any costume suggestions btw, I should probably clarify it needs to be a costume of a film character because I'm dressing up for credit in my film studies class. I hear the phrase a lot when looking into depression treatments and it's always something about "feeling happy again" or enjoying things you used to enjoy, but I honestly can't remember ever feeling happy. When I was an extremely young child my first thoughts were self harming ones fueled by existential understanding of my place in the world. I felt wholly disconnected from myself and my experiences, and remember just constantly crying. I can't remember a single time in my life where I was mentally (or physically) healthy. I remember wanting to die when I was 5 years old. I don't think I've ever really enjoyed anything. I don't feel fulfilled by anything in life, and I don't know what happiness actually feels like outside the synthetic one from being intoxicated. Was I just born depressed? I don't think I've ever enjoyed living.I've been suicidal for essentially my entire life, so I've told a number of people about it at this point, but every single time the response was never "don't kill yourself" it was always just apathy and annoyance. There was only one time in my life where someone responded to me with a "I don't want you to kill yourself" and now that person is gone from my life. No one loves me now. I don't want to keep waiting for the day someone else will. People give way too much credit to humans abilities to exist in isolation. Humans, or at the very least I do, need other people to feel okay. I need someone else in the world to care about me to feel happy with myself. I don't feel happy when everyone hates me (go figure), and I don't know why there's this expectation for suicidal people to love themselves when everyone else treats them so cruelly. I can't love myself or feel loved when I'm in the middle of being rejected by everyone else in the world. I can't fix my issues making me such a burden by myself, but my baggage makes me too hard to be around so that means I'm not able to get help. There's no escapists the cycle no matter how much I reach out. I'm not loved, genuinely I'm not. No one in my life has ever tried helping me, it's only ever been betrayal and being shat on.So I have some friends really struggling with mental health lately, and typically I help through counseling and being a dependable figure for them (which is usually really effective and helpful) but lately I've been coming to terms more with my own mental struggles and I'm not sure how to navigate. I still want to be there but I don't want to put aside my own feelings either. It probably isn't that helpful for me to make it about myself while they're talking about their struggles, so how do I continue being there to support them while also having my own emotional needs met?. So my earliest memory (around 4 years old) was me feeling an intense apathy towards life. I stabbed myself in kindergarten because I didn't have any hesitations in the concept of harming myself and I felt no positive emotions. Another little kid jokingly told me they would attack me (in the child make believe violence way) and my response was that I didn't care if they did. My other memories are all just constant existentialism and a feeling of disconnect towards my own emotions and experiences. I remember being on the playground and questioning the concept of free will because of a constant feeling of just going through the motions without a genuine connection to my own choices and person. I was labeled gifted for my outlook, but in all honesty it's always just been a heavy suicidality. I can't remember a period in my life before being suicidal. I've always wanted to die. Literally always. That's part of why I can't wrap my head around the saying that suicidal ideation is temporary, because for me it isn't. It's never once changed, it never really started anywhere and it's never seemed to end much. I'm intrinsically suicidal. My only real dreams in life are centered around dying. It feels like it's the only thing that gives me and sense of comfort.I'm wondering now if it really just means I'm destined to die young. Every therapist I've ever seen has been stumped and every person I've ever talked to has been overwhelmed or not understanding. I honestly think I belong in a mental hospital with how absolutely insane I must sound, or be i suppose, but I honestly feel further isolation from society would only make me want to die more, and I'd rather be dead than be crazy and stuck in a mind of torturous existence. I don't think I was ever meant to exist. I'm honestly not sure what to do at this point because all the years I've spent searching for answers have been to no avail and I'm just really tired of living this way. I'm holding out hope that support could fix me enough to function like a normal human being, but when all my life I've been told I need to fix my own problems and that no one else can save me, I figure that considering there's no healthy way for me to exist I might as well not. I've tried absolutely everything. There's not a single piece of preexisting advice that I haven't given numerous long-standing shots.I'm also extremely accustomed to people simply not believing me. Everything about me is an outlier and it makes it impossible to find connection in my life. I've never felt understood in any sense and it's not something I think I could actually grow out of. I'm genuinely broken. I'm not meant to live.So I'm genderfluid and almost exclusively attracted to men, and something I've really struggled with is how to find a partner who's both interested in me and respects my identity. Everyone assumes I'm a lesbian at first because there's mainly only lesbian nonbinary representation around me, and I feel like that adds into not being able to find someone who actually respects my identity. I also tend to lean male in my gender identity, and I'm usually more attracted to gay men, but as a genderfluid person who's afab and not a binary man, it feels wrong for me to even try with them. I'm extremely lost in finding men who are willing to date a genderfluid person (and also acknowledge the fact I'm genderfluid) and I was wondering if anyone had any idea how I could find potential partners.I have a lot of mental issues from trauma and one of them specifically being bpd, and I honestly don't know if it would even be okay for me to ever love someone. Inherently being with me comes with extra burdens, regardless of how much I work to fix my problems because some of them are just permanent. I'll always have certain triggers or episodes and I'll always be someone that comes with a lot of negative experiences that inevitably would be a lot for anyone else to come to face with. I've been told by people around me before that if I want to be in a relationship I'd need to hide everything about me essentially, and I don't know if that would be right either.I'm also genderfluid and it makes relationships even more messy. I've been yelled at before for trying to "change who someone is" because my very existence doesn't fit into most people's sexual orientation, and me being with someone would be "perverted" in a way since it's making someone change and possibly be uncomfortable because it makes them question themselves. I'm a very complicated person and that's why I'm wondering if it would even be right for me to be in anyone's life. I've usually left people because every interaction ends up being one where I get hurt or I feel scared of hurting someone else. I really want to be in love or be in a relationship but I don't know if it's even right for me to want it. I'm a very broken person and I'm scared me being with someone would mean I'm being selfish and hurting someone else with my baggage.I feel like the subject of intelligence is something that makes people feel very easily threatened. Because of the stigma around acknowledging your own traits, it's really hard to try and get help when it's in relation to something everyone else only ever sees as a positive. People either don't believe me or don't understand my experience or why it would even bother me at all.I tend to delve extremely deep into the things I focus on, and I'm driven by passion. This backfires a lot because that mindset just doesn't fit into most expectations. I can't find the motivation in completing monotonous tasks, and it's always seen as me being over dramatic or lazy. I need more mental stimulation than most people around me, and because of that passion for things that people view as too much, I'm left feeling constantly isolated.I need so desperately someone to help me find connection to other people in a way that can be genuine. It feels like I constantly have to hold back the person I am when I'm my happiest- which is when I get to work through challenges and look deeply into more abstract ideas- because if I don't, I'm "too much" for the people around me. I want to have community and feel part of it, but the way my brains wired makes it so I don't get to be fully myself around others, and I'm left feeling desolate and disengenious. I "try too much," but I can't help it.I'm always the exception. I'm always the one people go to for answers and help but no one ever converses with me in a way where I get to feel like an equal. I'm chronically misunderstood and I'm left feeling like an outside observer to a world that doesn't seem to acknowledge my existence unless it can be used for the benefit of themselves. I want to feel what it's like to be accepted and understood like a normal human being.All of this and other things I lose sleep over are all topics I can't really address with a therapist or friend. I've tried but I end up feeling worse because I don't know how to address the real hurt I get from it without sounding like I'm trying to threaten or insult someone else's intelligence. I end up feeling worse after because I don't get any good solutions and all it achieves is making me feel even more alone, and causing someone else to also feel bad. The only advice I've ever received is that I need to wait for even more years to pass me by until I eventually find someone else who gets me, and I'm honestly just so tired of always waiting. I just wish I could be part of this world in a more natural feeling way. I wish I didn't always have to be so "special.". Very frequently I find binge episodes for me are triggered by anxiety. I had a lot of traumatic experiences growing up and nowadays it feels like the only thing that can make me less anxious is eating. I've tried exercise or meditation and the sort for a very long time but it's never really worked the way everyone seems to say it does. Food is my absolute only source of comfort in all honesty. People leave me or hurt me, I eat to feel safe. It sometimes feels like food is the only thing that stops me from having really bad thoughts, so I have no clue how I could stop binging. I've tried everything to find support systems but it never works out, so until I get lucky with that idk if there's much I can do to fix it.I know people say those type of things as a way to try and be comforting or supportive, but to me it just makes me feel like they don't want to understand me. Like... I almost died, each time something incredibly terrible happened I was left with scars that will never heal, time I won't get back, and an uncertainty of my safety. I have no guarantee that things will be alright for me, in fact I have evidence to suggest that they won't. I'm very likely to die young for a number of reasons, and I have no support or safe space to look to anytime soon. I don't want to hear that sentiment because it feels incredibly dismissive to everything that's continually happening to me. If anything I'd rather hear it as a wish, like "I want things to be fine for you." Idk it just always feels like a way to shut someone up about the real issues they face and invalidate their feelings and fears. I wish people would acknowledge how bad some things are instead of saying this. I'm so tired of never feeling heard.I'm primarily attracted to men but for obvious reasons, it doesn't really work out in a healthy way if I date a straight or gay guy since my identity is never accepted as a whole in either case. I'm pretty much limited to specifically guys who are bi or anything similar, but I've almost never met an openly bi guy at all let alone someone who's single or compatible with me. It feels like some guys who are bi just pretend to be straight since it's more accepted, so the only people I ever have a chance with are slightly homophobic closeted dudes who see me as some weird experiment or straight guys who just see me as a woman. Does anyone know any ways to meet more bi men specifically? I'm really struggling in the connection field and as much as friends are nice, I can't help kinda wishing I could date someone openly for once lolEdit: PLEASE READ!! I meant "find" as in meet, not what's your opinion on bi guys btw😭. This is more like a advice/vent post, and also probably TW for mental health issues, and general not so great thoughtsI know the typical responses are always just gonna be "love yourself" or that it doesn't matter, but as a genuine question, is it possible to be attractive as an overweight genderqueer person? I feel like it's already hard to be overweight as any gender, but specifically with being genderqueer, it feels like the only one accepted body type is thin. With being a man being overweight isn't always necessarily that unattractive. With being a woman I feel like it's starting to be a little more body positive and there are ways to dress to show off your curves in a flattering light. But being nonbinary, (specifically afab and trans masc leaning) I can't dress in the ways that would make my body less shapeless without accentuating extreme sources of dysphoria, and it sort of forces me into having to always dress and look extremely unflattering since there is no beauty standard for enby outside of androgynous. As someone short and stubby, I feel so hideous because it feels like I'm forced to look like a child since there's no other way for me to look. This has genuinely pushed me to considering detransitioning because even though I know how disgusting I feel pretending to be a woman, the thing I want more than anything in the world is to be loved by someone in any amount, and I'm always looked at with disgusted looks the way I am now. Anytime I've presented more fem I've gotten the nicest responses and honestly as much as I hate to admit it, being attractive is something I DO care about. I know how shallow it sounds, but I just want people to look at me with a positive energy and it's so nonexistent when I don't act like a woman and I don't know. Honestly I think I might just be too weak to be out as trans. I'm genderfluid (I'm sure of it after a lot of introspection) but I'm also just an extremely sensitive person who is prone to suicidal thoughts when faced with the amount of disdain I get being so different. I feel like I have a choice between being uncomfortable from extreme loneliness and dejection or being uncomfortable from dysphoria, and honestly I don't know if I could be happy not being loved by anyone else. Not to say it's impossible for a queer person to find love but honestly I think just for me specifically it's not gonna happen anytime soon and I don't know if I'm strong enough to be myself and hated for that time with no support in my irl space. I have a lot of symptoms of BPD as well as most likely PTSD from a lot of childhood threats to safety, so that's very likely a factor in my anxious feelings, but still, I have no access to mental health support (and hotlines are a useless nightmare from a lot of experience) so I don't really know what else I could do at this point in time. I'm also a minor until next year so my options are limited in that sense too. I'm just so extremely starved of any feeling of safety among people and being seen as ugly as silly as it sounds really does add so much fuel to that feeling of panic.So I guess I'm half asking for advice, half just venting some shit, but either way thanks for reading to anyone who got this far :/. I'm genderfluid and almost exclusively attracted to men, and when it comes to dating I really don't know where to try my luck with meeting people who would date me as I am. Probably my only options are bi/pan guys specifically since I need someone who's into multiple genders, and even though I know they obviously do exist, I've almost never met a bi man in my life let alone someone who's available/I'm compatible with. I live in California so I feel like there's probably some opportunities here, but I'm really just not sure where to look. Is it worth finding someone who acknowledges my gender fluidity? I'm afab and honestly I could probably survive going back in the closet or simply not being that pressing about my gender when people get it wrong, but I don't know if that or waiting for someone who can understand me is really better. I'm also 17 for some context, so I obviously have some life to live while waiting, but to be real I'm honestly kinda lonely and would really like some advice on how to potentially find spaces where I could find connection with someone, preferably some advice on spaces I can be in rather than to just wait and hope lol. Also before anyone says anything like that, I want to clarify I do care about more in life than just dating. I have other interests and friends and such, but this question is still one I'd like to ask, so please be kind and not dismissive just because of assumptions you might make on me based on the nature of this question. It's lighthearted and not something I want anyone to take in a wrong way please :) Thanks in advance for any advice!. I know people will always say that it's just hormones and when I'm older I'll learn to appreciate her and so much shit along those lines, but she really truly fucks up my life. Throughout my entire school career she's chosen to go on constant "vacations" and trips and forces me along with her regardless of how busy I am, and because of it I've failed a lot of my classes and in general have not had any time to live my own life. I've missed months of school at a time because of her, and now I'm on my last year and I might not be able to make up the credits I need in time because she keeps pestering me while I'm trying to work. To other people it sounds like I should be grateful that she "spoils" me so much, but it's never once been what I actually wanted. It's just her way of putting me in debt to her while simultaneously holding me back. She's lowkey sexually abusive (taking me to have a retired doctor give me weight loss shots in the butt with her because she wants me to be more "sexy" for example) and there's nothing I can do about any of her shit because she is completely insane when it comes to trying to communicate with her. She's manipulative and honestly, just really really annoying. I just want my own time to do my own things and because of her I'm constantly fatigued. I hate that everyone else loves her so much. I'm forced to just take it and know no one is on my side because she's "so sweet" and I'm just a "moody depressed typical teenager". I feel like I'm actually going crazy.For my entire life I've only had myself as a source of guidance. I've never had anyone who would take my side. I've never had anyone compliment me for my work or look. I've never had someone believe me, or think about me as a first thought. I'm trans genderfluid, so obviously I don't get societal validation either, and no one has ever seen me for who I am. So much about me is hated by everyone around me, and I'm basically just a piece of trash to be used or discarded. No matter what I do no one has ever loved me or cared about my feelings or wellbeing. People actively do things to hurt me, and most of the time it's purposeful. People always give the advice that you only need yourself and that you should absolutely never look to others for validation but that is just so fucking ignorant and privileged to think. People assume that everyone has a base level of support, that they've ever been told they matter, but for some people they've spent their entire lives fighting the constant message from life that you don't matter. No matter what I think of myself I simply can't feel ok when I have no positive human interaction at all. People don't understand what it's like to be constantly dehumanized by everyone including the people you think you love. I need someone else to like me, just once in my life. I need someone else to know me. This perpetual isolation is so much more painful than anyone imagines.My entire life I've had issues and tried to get help with them, but not a single person has ever understood any of it. People can't fathom the world view I had as an abused neurodivergent queer kid and always give their advice through the assumption that I'd have the same experiences as everyone else. They assume because I'm currently a teenager that I only think shallowly and that my problems are all to try and seem "cool" or edgy. Every therapist I've had has said extremely offensive things to me (ex, comparing my identity and body dysphoria to acne and saying how it'll all clear up and solve itself when I'm older) or simply couldn't help me. I've never had a friend or mentor figure that I could trust completely without being betrayed, and I've never had any of my issues cared about enough for anyone to actually do something. When people found out I tried to kill myself they didn't think it mattered at all. My entire life has shown me over and over again that I don't have enough value to be helped and that my abnormalities make me a burden on society. I'm constantly told my life doesn't matter directly and indirectly, and I don't have the energy to even be angry for long. I just cry. Right now specifically though I have multiple essays and projects due as finals and I'm sick and feel too drained to do it. I don't care enough to do it. I know my teachers are disappointed in me for being lazy and not showing up to class enough. I don't know how to face them when they call on me asking why I didn't turn in the work. I also have a weird dissociative reaction whenever talking to them at school where I don't remember any of my issues and start involuntarily masking and acting completely fine, and it makes it impossible for me to talk about my problems because I just physically can't. No matter how hard I try I just can't relay what's going on with me in front of people, and people always assume the worst of me. No one ever knows me, and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm just tired.My entire life I was abused, and no one ever cared about my tears. Then one day one person seemed to. He was the first person to ever notice when I needed comfort, the first person to ever make me feel like I mattered at all or that I was even a human. Then I lost him on the day I finally hugged him for the first time. It was my birthday. Years later and I've never found anything like it. No matter how I try to stay open there's no one willing to attempt to know me let alone be close to me for reasons other than using me. I still don't put up walls but it's getting more obvious each day that love isn't coming for me anytime soon. How do I live while waiting? Nothing I do feels like it matters when there's absolutely no one I can trust and share my life with. I know people say you just have to be enough for yourself, but truthfully I think my heart isn't strong enough for that. I don't have anyone in my life and no matter how many clubs I join or activities I go to, no one ever gives me the chance to belong. I don't think I belong anywhere anymore.I think it's wildly ignorant for anyone to try and say that trans men don't experience misogyny in full force, however at the same time I really don't like calling that experience simply misogyny as it isn't just a hatred for women, since well, obviously we're not women. It is partly influenced by misandry but it definitely isn't only misandry alone, so how would you define the experienced discrimination trans masculine people face due to factors related to how gender expectations are framed? I'm asking because when having conversations about misogyny trans men aren't really acknowledged even though we definitely should be realistically and practically, and even though we aren't women it's really ignorant to pretend trans mascs have the same privelages and experience as cis men do in terms of gender related oppression.Edit: ok I think I really need to clarify this post a bit more based on some comments. The misandry I mentioned is more about how men/masculinity is demonized, which definitely affects trans women/femmes because that's where a lot of the discrimination is based on (and again also misogyny but not misogyny alone), and it affects trans men/mascs because part of the negative perception of that group is on "losing beautiful women" to the gross man group. It is definitely all caused by misogyny at a more fundamental level I'd say, however at certain points it gets tricky to label it as misogyny alone with the context of many discussions. My question is less about the technical language to use for comfort, and more about how to explicitly include trans masculine people, who are almost always invisible, into conversations that also concern them because of the inevitable effect misogyny has on them either through direct issues or domino effect ones. If you're having discussions involving misogyny the immediate assumption is that you're talking exclusively about women.When looking up the definition of it the descriptions always say "perceived" flaw and there's a lot of mentions of how usually the flaw is miniscule or not actually an issue others could notice, so what I'm lost on is would it still count as dysmorphia if the flaw is very much a real thing? Like for example I have very unusual proportions and I know it's not just me thinking I do because so many people throughout my life have brought it up unprompted, (I have a wide and flat face along with short limbs, and I have hair VERY unusual of a texture [people have even compared my natural hair texture to pubes]). I'm objectively unattractive in those aspects, so it's not just a "perceived" flaw and it's definitely not miniscule, but it's constantly something I think about and it ruins my life more often than not. I'd honestly rather be brutally disfigured than look how I look because at least then I feel like people would have a bit more empathy about saying anything, and I've come close to actually hurting myself because of how ugly I feel at times. Does dysmorphia mean you don't see things for how they actually are? That's what all the definitions I've found kinda pushed at so I'm not sure if what's up with me counts since it's definitely grounded in reality I just hate how I look and really wish/feel like I should look different. It's probably also worth noting I'm transgender and I do have dysphoria.I've never had any sort of especially positive mentor or role model in my life nor any genuine relationships/friendships/family. Every therapist and psychiatrist I've seen failed me repeatedly and I don't have the available resources or even the freedom to try and find better fitting ones any time soon. Without going into too many dreaded details I have severe trauma spanning essentially my entire life (to the extent I tried to kill myself for the first time at 4-5 years old and had already become apathetic to life at that point) and this trauma has made life extremely difficult to deal with, especially with the fact much of those traumatic experiences are ongoing/frequently triggered up to now. I'm a minor and I'm financially dependant on parents along with being chronically ill (meaning I'm unable to leave my current situation safely). With all that out of the way, my question is mainly just what can I do to be mentally ok enough to at least make it through the next few years? It's extremely difficult to do school work when I have other issues surfacing too often and I have somewhat of an eating disorder that I can't make my way out of because it's triggered by deep rooted beliefs instilled by abusers. I have very severe memory loss at times that I suspect are caused by PTSD because I also have a tendency to dissociate. I'm fairly certain I'd be ok if I had at least one good relationship in my life as a source of support/safety but I can't get that when my issues make it difficult for people to quite understand me, and I have a tendency to both trust too much and too little all at once, resulting in more pain. I also know I can't expect to get all the emotional support I'd really need from any friendship, but I don't know I just really think I could make do if I could find a way to find even one person I could actually trust to care about me as much as I did towards them. Since I obviously can't directly control who I meet I guess my question is more so asking advice on how to find support when you have none to start with. Everytime I try researching how to deal with issues I have, the results always say things along the lines of "lean on family and friends" but I don't have any source of support that understands or cares about me past a superficial level so I'm at a bit of a lost on what to do in my situation. Most people who I tell about myself just let me be hurt because they say it's too difficult for them to do anything and they assume I'll be fine since I've lived like this forever, or they simply give generic advice that never applies well for someone like me (I've tested out the advice and believe me none of it has ever done anything but make things worse). I'm just at a loss for any ideas on what to do because it feels like I've tried everything and none of it's ever had a positive outcome. My only real options now are to fix it myself but I have no clue how to do that when generic mental health advice doesn't work for me.I should also mention I've tried every single hotline and online resource on every list I could find and not a single one has ever done anything but make me more suicidal and hopeless. Please don't recommend any hotlines because my situation is extremely specific apparently and hotlines never have anyone capable of dealing with me. I'm looking for advice on how to deal with trauma when you're completely alone.Is it really possible to connect deeply, for more than a fleeting moment, with someone, if you have deep set trauma and they don't? It feels like every time I think I'm getting close to someone there's this barrier that pauses it right where it's at, or altogether takes that connection away. I don't have a problem making friends, but I just can't seem to make friendships that feel real. The only times I've been able to feel any actual human connection is when the other person I'm with also has some understanding of deep emotional turmoil. I guess for me, trauma is just a part of who I am. It isn't an event I can get over and I don't think it's possible to separate who I am as a person from my C-PTSD because it fuels everything I am and care about. Trauma *is* my childhood, it's not just a part of it. Have any of you ever found any real connection with others that lasted? How do I do that? How do I do that when I'm so blatantly different from everyone else around me, no matter how much I push myself out there and make countless "friends" I'm always alone. Not a soul in the world understands me on any significant level that isn't abusive. Am I just doomed to never connecting to anyone since my circumstances are all just too depressing and unusual? Also I want to mention it isn't that I'm putting my guard up too much or simply not giving people a chance. I'm constantly being vulnerable with others but the outcome is just always that people have no clue how to handle how intense my life is and will start pitying me while holding me at a distance. No one relates to me so it just doesn't end up working out. The only reason I have friends is because people like me for being "kind" or some other positive attribute they attach to me, and also because I'm able to help others a lot. It's just that care is always one sided and I end up understanding them on a level they can never seem to understand me on. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I can't just force people to put more effort into understanding me, no matter how much I put into being there for them they still aren't obligated to do the same for me so yeah it just ends there. It's not even necessarily that they don't try, it's just they really have no clue how to handle my problems since they're more complicated than they're used to, and they don't know how to emotionally relate with me. I'm losing hope that I can have relationships with people who aren't also traumatized.I need to make a signature to put on my passport but I am nowhere near close to figuring out my name. I really don't want to sign it with my deadname. I know you can technically just do anything for a signature but how do I think of something when I don't have a name to kind of guide the lines if that makes any sense.So this really isn't ftm specific but I'm genderfluid/trans masc and I just feel more comfortable discussing this in a place I know isn't going to produce shallow arguments about irrelevant topics, but here's what I wanted to bring up: I feel like more left leaning people actually do get too sensitive about a lot of things, just not in the way conservatives/ right leaners usually put it. I'm not talking about people just arguing for their rights, that's not what I mean by sensitive. What I am referring to though is this thing I've noticed, where more socially conscious or progressive people tend to have something of a trauma response turned on at all times, even at times where it's extremely bad for everyone's mental health and peace. I grew up in a conservative home, and while we all know the obvious toxicity from more conservative ideas with fear focused behavior or hiding parts of your identity and what not, one thing I think is true about conservatives is they tend to have more community, and ironically enough considering the LGBT+ community is literally centered around love, there just seems to be so much more down to earth empathy and love for other people in conservative spaces than in liberal ones. Now obviously I'm being extremely general here because conservatives have infighting too and many liberal spaces don't, but the general feeling in most conservative spaces is usually an acknowledgement that they all have something connecting them on a human level. You could definitely argue this "love" is often not fully genuine since they aren't loving who people really are a lot of the time, however the point I'm trying to get at isn't about comparing who's more really loving. My entire reason for bringing up that comparison is to say that I think we really need to address how we approach being socially conscious. Being socially conscious doesn't have to mean we're constantly walking on eggshells about terminology. While using the right language is important, what's more important is the meaning and intent behind those words, and I feel like a lot of people on this side of the political spectrum tend to be really quick to "cancel" people instead of allowing real growth and change or open discussion. We kind of forget that we're all human in favor of radical justice. While I wholeheartedly agree with the actual points left leaning spaces have about laws, politics ect., I think we're missing the point of advocating for those laws when in the in-between moments we're all always on edge. To make an example of what I'm on about, more than a few times in the past month I've asked genuine questions about topics I didn't have all the information on. One of those including the events of a recent shooting. The replies I got to that question consisted of performative activism, people telling me "gun violence in America is evil" when I wasn't disputing that in any way and simply asking about the specifics of what took place. I honestly can understand why some may act this way since it's not rare to be harassed by ignorant people however people were so quick to assume malicious intent for simply not already knowing every last detail of something of political discussion, and this isn't a one time thing. There are probably much better examples but unfortunately I just can't put those into words at the moment. What I'm asking is how do all of you think we could change this? It really feels like there just isn't actual community on this side of the spectrum because everyone's so obsessed with what's politically correct that they don't think about real life application. I don't think having open discussion and being fine with disagreement has to mean we hate each other. Open discussion is only healthy if it comes from a place of genuineness and not a closed off attitude of just trying to prove a public point. I feel like I haven't fully phrased everything I'm trying to get at in this post but I hope you take what I'm saying as coming from a very real place and not as a shallow debate topic. I'm asking because I really don't want to just accept that I either have a loving connected community or a socially conscious one, because I truly believe it should be one in the same. Activism can come from a place of love and not hate can't it? I'm not saying to stop fighting for what's right, but does that hostility towards injustice really have to come at a cost of frequent crossfire within our own spaces? I don't know honestly. So if you did read all this please let's discuss. I'd really appreciate hearing other perspectives. I just don't think we can deny that there definitely is a bit of hyper sensitivity when within left leaning spaces that needs to be addressed before the community here splits up even more.It's more than just not liking any names. It's more than just not feeling used to them. I just don't think I could choose a name for myself without breaking down. I don't know what exactly it is, but I don't feel like I could ever have a name, not really. A name to me means so much. It's the one label that you define completely, that encompasses who you are and surpasses the ever changing structure of your entirety. Other aspects of you may change, but a name that’s truly yours stays consistent. I know other people would feel differently about it but to me a name is everything. I've grown up financially well off but I've never felt like I really owned anything. Everything, absolutely everything, down to my hair and to my room, my body and talents, everything belonged to my parents. But a name would be mine. A name would be the proof of my existence, the uniting aspect to my ever shifting identity, something I could be seen with. But it just doesn't feel right. Nothing ever feels right. I know some will tell me to just pick whatever and stick with it for awhile but I just... can't. I think a big thing might be that naming myself would mean nailing the coffin; accepting it wouldn't be a gift from my parents and instead a desperate decision. I don't want it. I just don't want it like this. Maybe it doesn't even need to be my parents but I just desperately need whatever my name will be, to be given to me. I need that. I'm always alone, everything I've ever done it's been in isolation, and I'm so tired of it. There's no meaning to who I am. I'm an abstract concept. I'm not a coherent person. I have no one in life I feel a connection to. Maybe I feel like I don't deserve a name. I want to disappear and maybe the thought of having to exist scares me. I feel constantly chained by so much in life and a name feels like a prison right now. None of them quite fit and because of that it just feels like I'm being pushed into a tight garment. But I need a name. I wish I didn't. If I want to do almost anything I need a name. Meeting people is painful when I have to introduce myself by a lie straight out. No one knows me. Doing anything requiring identification makes me frankly suicidal. I don't know how to live like this. I don't know how to find a name. I wish I wasn't genderfluid, maybe then at least I could fit in a category in my search for a name. But the reality is I never fit anything in life. It's tragic irony that I have perfectionism OCD, because nothing in my life perfectly fits. Nothing in my life is even ok.We know chongyuns constitution drives away evil spirits simply by being near them, but Xiao, as an adeptus affected by evil (his karmic sins), would he be hurt by chongyuns energy or would it actually heal him by purifying his karma? From what I remember in chongyuns hangout event, the ghost girl said something about how chongyun being nearby "hurt" her, so that makes me wonder, would his energy hurt Xiao as well since in a way he is an evil spirit? Or because of the fact Xiao is at base an adeptus mean that chongyun would only drive out the evil inside him and leave the adeptus side of Xiao safe? I might be misremembering details but I just thought this was something interesting to think about and I haven't seen anything about this yet. Would it be possible popsicle boy could save this tortured adeptus?Edit: Im not talking about Chongyun just being an exorcist in itself, I'm talking about his unique constitution that makes him different from other people AND exorcists. In his story he mentions how just being near spirits wards them off, that's more so what I'm referring to than just the talismans or other practices he could use from an exorcism standpoint.It's just so frustrating how this concept can't exist anywhere outside of trans specific spaces. Don't get me wrong I acknowledge it's true that women face that kind of stuff on a high percentage and I do agree that they should be supported, but I am so tired of people only ever acknowledging women as victims. School talks and domestic abuse support groups essentially cater entirely to women and tend to demonize men. Where do I go then? I'm trans masc genderfluid. Right off the bat I've never met a support space that acknowledges nonbinary people and along with that people tend to look at you a certain way if you're not a woman who's gone through that kind of abuse, because your very existence makes it awkward since you don't fit in with everyone else there. I know this isn't women's fault because unfortunately that's just how the percentage screws however I don't know what to do when in my case, I can't relate to that standard narrative of a woman hurt by men. But general support rant out of the way, I'm so sick of the actual sexual abuse I have to deal with daily. I'm sick of the fact people don't really care. My mom fetishizes me every damn day. She makes me sick, and I mean that physically sometimes too because she's literally drugged me to try to get me to look more "thin and ladylike". Even if I wasn't trans the way she talks to me is disgusting and the fact I *am* trans means all the things she's saying can't be taken any other way but as a weird fetish. She touches me in ways to prove I'm female like pressing my chest to herself when she forces me to hug her, or commenting on and slapping my genital area and butt like she did up until I was 12 years old. I honestly don't even know what's normal because I've never experienced any non toxic relationship with any woman, but I have some doubts that grabbing me from behind and aggressively and forcefully kissing my neck repeatedly even up to now when I'm a few years into highschool is a normal interaction for mother-son. When I was younger she would force me to strip in front of her when I refused to wear the girl clothes she gave me that I told her were so uncomfortable I was tempted to scratch my skin off, and then she would spank me with a thick wooden rod. She talks in a creepy voice about how my body doesn't belong to me and says all that bs Jesus shit with a smile on her face. One time when I was crying in bed because I was allergic to the fabric on all my clothes, she groped me while I struggled to push her away while I was naked under a blanket. Nowadays I'm forced to pretend to like her and have to talk like "a good little girl" (forcing my voice 20 octaves higher and giggling a lot to keep her happy) and subject myself to her constantly commenting on every part of my body and how "womanly" it's become (when I've literally passed as male my entire life because I have an extremely not feminine build even now so that's clearly a weird fetishized perspective she has). I'm so fucking sick of it. I don't want to hear her using that dog-baby voice on me while calling me her "pretty baby girl" (she goes to the extremes of no joke saying every feminine adjective she can think of whenever addressing me even when it is very obviously not describing me from anyone else's perspective if they were to see me.) What kind of perverted mom takes their teenage child to a "health clinic" and without their consent brings them to an old man (in his 80's) to inject a needle IN THEIR FUCKING BUTT filled with a drug that suppresses appetite. The needle was as long as my fucking hand. I'm tired of everyone defending her just because she buys me stuff. She only buys me stuff in exchange for my compliance in being her living doll (her actual words on what I am). She's literally chastised me on my need to eat, you know, that thing humans need to do to survive. I'm so fucking tired. And of course there's no one in the world I can go to about any of this because no one gives a damn about weird trans kids in upper middle class christian homes. I will never fit the narrative.Fuck adults man. I'm so sick of how disgusting adults are. I'm so sick of living in a world where everyone says they want to be special or stand out but then the people who actually do get shitted on. I'm so sick of how every single person fails me because I'm too different. I didn't fucking ask to be born. I just want someone to actually be there for me who isn't just trying to exploit me for what I can do for them. I'm so tired of every night being too scared to sleep because I'm too vulnerable then. Why does everything have to hurt so much?. I've tried a lot of the advice people generically give out: meditation, journaling, exercise, therapy, breathing exercises, pretty much every recommended destress activity, talking to a psychiatrist, trying different mindsets, trying to do social stuff etc. But as the title suggests, none of these things have been helpful to me. My biggest struggle is that I'm not the generic case people can help. I'm a minority in multiple ways (racial, sexuality, gender, +) and along with that I have some unique circumstances that most people I've talked to aren't able to understand or relate to. I try my best to keep an open mind to things but time and time again it's proven to me that people really don't understand (and that I'm not overreacting to say that either). It's not hard for me to *make* connections with people, but they always remain fairly superficial because the other person will end up saying they appreciate how well I can understand them or be there for *them* but will admit to not being able to understand or help me in any real way because my situations are too complicated. I end up making people feel bad because they'll somehow both pity me and feel intimidated by me, and if this doesn't happen, they'll just straight up misinterpret my situation or who I am (like in the cases I've had with multiple therapists).I have severe trauma stemming from both my abusive family and general outside sources directed at me because I'm a minority. I also very likely have many mental issues. Because of many different reasons I really do need support of some kind, but I just have no clue how to find that anymore. I'm still a minor (highschool aged) so I have a very limited range of options, but I'm actively suicidal and recovering from burnout that was so severe I had to leave my old school and switch to an online school. My parents allowed this because they don't care about my education much and also because it means they have more control over my schedule. My brother is schizophrenic and my parents abuse him for it because they believe it's "against gods will," and besides the obvious reasons this would affect me this also means I can't be quite honest about my own mental issues with them. My dad is less religious than my mom so he's more willing to have me in therapy which means it would be possible for me to maybe ask him about trying it again, but I don't know how to go about that without it failing again. The last therapists I had were terrible and wouldn't listen to anything I said because "your grades are too good to be *really* depressed" and constantly told me unhelpful things that didn't apply to me. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like no one would even want to help me because I'm such a small minority and a different case then the usual that it doesn't matter what happens to me. I'm not the majority so why would it matter what happens to someone who doesn't fit the standard advice people give? This is the kind of thing I've experienced at least. I've never had anyone in my life actually be there for me except to abuse, hurt, or take advantage of me, and I genuinely don't know how much longer I can continue living when things are this shitty. It doesn't help that so many people and systems are out there made with the sole purpose of getting rid of people like me (queer) so I know that the majority of the world would have me killed if they could. It's hard to see a reason to live when I'm left with not much else to try.I have extremely thick, dense, and wavy hair (around 2c/3a), but for most of my life I've pulled it down and straightened it because I'm Asian and I always felt really out of place having very different hair than any other Asians I knew. Recently I've been trying to embrace my natural hair type, but I'm having trouble being confident enough to leave it the way it is when out in public. Any advice on how to become comfortable with not weighing my hair down and flat like I've been accustomed to doing? Also any suggestions on how to stop my habit of touching my hair to pull it down while outside would be really helpful. Thank you in advance for replies."Men suck." That's all I've ever heard from anyone in any leftist community and it's not unbased. Statistically yes, men do more terrible things than women and especially with things like sexual assault or just being plain stupid, it's a lot more expected from men. It would be a lie to say that all of those negative claims about men are false, but as a trans masc person, I can't help just being so frustrated by it. And please don't give me the response of "trans men are different/better" that's even worse than simply saying I'm inherently a terrible person. I always hear stuff about how we need to empower women and how women rule the world/ women are superior in everyway etc etc and while I agree that sexism and patriarchy suck, I feel so completely ignored in those conversations about sexism or anything having to do with oppression, which is sadly ironic because I was sexually abused which is a heavily referenced topic in those discussions. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this because not only do the responses usually involve invalidating me as a guy, but the people (yes multiple) who sexually abused/harassed me were women. It's a mental pain for me a lot of the time hearing the discussions about sexism because it always refers to how women are screwed over by men, and when there's me who doesn't fit that narrative, I'm left feeling like the bad guy for simply existing since I invalidate the experiences of women who are really just venting when they say stuff like "kill all men", but at the same time it really does make me feel bitter inside because I've been through the same thing as them yet I'm not allowed to be sympathized with or else I'm not really trans. It's just really confusing. That bit out of the way it's also with things like my intelligence. One of the reasons my mom gave for why I'm not a guy is because I'm smart and we need more women in STEM and shit along those lines. I recognize I'm being bitter again but I won't lie, all of this stuff about women being constantly pushed down my throat makes me somewhat resent female empowerment because it feels like it's in direct conflict with my existence. Now even though logically I know I don't really mean that when it comes down to it, I can't help that emotionally I feel like I'll never be allowed to be my truthful self or else everyone will hate me. These fears aren't unbased either. To be more precise I'm not a man exactly because I *am* genderfluid, but I lean very heavily towards the masc end of the spectrum so along with the alienating aspect of being nonbinary in itself, I can't help but feel outcasted by the community I'm supposed to be supported by. I don't fit in with the cishets but I sure as hell don't fit in with the vast majority of the lgbtq community. I feel like the community puts so much focus on femininity with even most gay guys for example "hating men", that anyone who's identity is based on masculinity is instantly demonized if not fetishized/babied. I know I'm gonna get hate for this post because no one wants to talk about this but seriously, how the hell do I feel proud to be who I am when even the community that claims to be inclusive of identities hates anything that isn't a "goddess"?Sorry if I'm coming off as rude in this, I'm just really pissed off by some recent interactions and also am genuinely curious if there's a way to be proud when you're transitioning to the "bad" gender.I feel like being trans and more specifically genderfluid and trans masc makes it so that there are very few people in the world with the capabilities to understand me, and even fewer that I'll ever meet. I know I don't need to be exactly like everyone else but I'm just so different from anyone I've ever met and it's gotten to the point where I feel like I might go insane from the isolation. I guess being trans isn't the only reason I can't connect- I'm "gifted" which means that over and over again I'm placed on a pedestal and treated as simply a useful tool that doesn't need care or help ever, I've been through several traumatic experiences that outcast me since they were mainly dealt by the hands of women so people don't always believe it could have been as bad as I'd say, I simply have different interests than the vast majority of people my age, and I have health problems that part of which affects my memory and sometimes causes me to dissociate. All of this heavily contributes to me having a difficult time really connecting with others, but for some reason being trans to me is the most debilitating issue. Now please don't get me wrong I'm not trying to say being trans is a bad thing, but just personally, I don't think I can handle the problems that come along with it. Dysphoria is so debilitating to me especially coupled with likely dysmorphia, and strangely it's the one part about me that I can't find a way to feel ok with. All of the trauma I've been through, the abuse and the physical pain from recurring health problems, all of that - i don't know, it just feels less daunting. Those things however terrible feel like they're a part of me. Being trans- it just doesn't feel like something I could put into a positive light. Not only does the crippling dysphoria of misgendering mean that I've had to stop seeing certain doctors and therapists because no one understands why I'd be hurt by simply being called by my birthname or recieving little comments about how I should look, but I can't see myself transitioning into anything that could alleviate this pain. Surgery and hrt could only do so much, and then it's all toppled with the fact that I'm genderfluid and my dysphoria changes what factors bother me meaning I'll have dysphoria regardless of anything. I'm a minor so I couldn't even start hrt anytime soon without parental permission, so even if I just wanted to give it a shot, I'd have to either wait (which I can't do anymore because each day gets harder living a lie), or ask my parents for their consent to start it, which I don't think would work as they're extremely religious and don't believe me being trans is real.I've seen psychiatrists, therapists, teachers, "friends," and doctors; all of which unable to pin me because I'm just too different from anyone they know. All of those mental health talks at school always make me want to run out because they always dismiss the possibility that the person suffering could have already tried getting help, could have already reached out over and over again and simply have been constantly dissapointed and abandoned by everyone who deemed the issues too hard to fix or simply ignored them. I'm so tired of it. Sometimes I'll feel a little ok- I'll just not think about any of the pain for a moment and get distracted hoping to be happy for a bit, but every time I get sent back into an even worse spiral because I'm intrinsically abandoned by everyone. All of my issues just prevent me from connecting with anyone around me because those little things people do or say trigger stuff for me and I can't speak up or else I get hit with the I'm just making it up or that I'm attention seeking or even just I make people uncomfortable because I don't know how to be a normal kid. I can't do it. I fail at that every time I try and I just don't know how to keep trying when I'm in this much pain. I don't have anyone in the world who's ever understood me and I have no one to look to who will care for me. I just can't be strong for myself anymore and I can't handle this eternal loneliness. My parents will never be able to really love me because it's simply impossible for them to understand me, and I can't connect with anyone when every interaction I have feels fake because this isn't the right body and no one understands me enough to see me as me in whatever I do so no one ever knows me. I have people who claim to like me or care about me but then they'll hurt me over and over again and never take the time to know me and I just can't handle it anymore. What do I do anymore? I've tried everything I could. I took every advice ever given to me but none of it ever worked because my situation is just too different from the majority. I've never had a real connection to anyone and I don't see the point of living when it's like this. How could any possibilities be worth this pain in the moment when there's no one in the world who loves me or even knows me? I'm so messed up already. How is this supposed to get better with time? Why should I live past 15 just to have to deal with more pain and burdens? Please someone tell me why I should live when there's nothing for me but suffering. I'm so tired. I tried so hard and nothing worked. I don't know what to do anymore. No one even actually cares about me.I feel like it's very rare for me outside of the internet and just in general to find people (of any gender) who are attracted to men/masc folk, or if they do, they'll also be attracted to women/fem folk and usually with the preference for women. I think I only know one gay (towards men) person irl, while knowing MANY people both online and in real life who are attracted to women. Pretty much all the guys I know irl have an attraction to women (with few also having a part attraction to men but on a much lesser scale), and the vast majority of girls liking girls. I don't think I know anyone (besides the one person) who has specific to men attraction, and I was wondering if this is a universal current experience? I live in California and as such there's a big inflation of the queer people I meet, but even then it's pretty much all women. Everyone here likes women lol. Ik this is probably just a weird thing specific to my location or something but as a genderfluid yet mainly masc person I sometimes do get a little uncomfortable when everyone around me goes on constant rants about how much they love women and hate men (though it is understandable where they're coming from sometimes). Idk small rant aside, I guess I just really want to see what the ratio is for other people, and if theres any explanation for this. I'm starting to forget people other than me are actually attracted to men at all and I wanted to see if this is just my experience or if there really isn't as many androsexual/romantics out there as there are gyno-attractees.Whenever I try to sing for some reason I can't find my "natural" voice. What I mean by this is whenever I sing (and less so when I talk as well) it feels like there's some kind of mesh filter in front of my vocal cords. I have a slight lisp as well but I'm not sure if that's what's causing this. It's really frustrating because I become extremely out of breath when singing and I get headaches, along with not being able to reach any notes I'm attempting. Am I just tone death, and if so, is there a way to fix this? I have no idea how to find a comfortable singing voice and even though I have a very wide range no matter what I sing it feels like I'm speaking halfway underwater. I really want to be able to sing but I don't know how I can work to fix this. Any advice would be really appreciated on how to fix this or what I might be doing wrong vocal technique wise. If it gives any more context I have slight asthma.My thoughts are spiraling a bit right now so sorry if this is a little cluttered.I have so many mental issues, but whenever I try to get help it goes wrong. I don't get helpful treatment because they don't really believe or understand that I'm trans, which ends up making everything so much worse. Part of why I'm not getting the right help is probably because I'm never able to tell my parents the full truth about what's wrong. The issue is they've been extremely abusive in the past because of obsession with religion (threatening, harassment, sexual abuse, humiliation, etc) but things have finally been getting better, my mom's actually trying to be caring and it's obvious because of the change in character + how she doesn't hurt me for not wanting to be christian anymore and my dad's always been extremely overprotective but he has good intentions and they both say they love me. I've already come out to them but they're both pretending it's not true or just don't accept it as real. I'm so scared to tell them the truth of what's wrong because that means making it more clear how real this is and how much things like dysphoria truly affects me, and I don't want to lose my parents when they're finally here for me. It doesn't help my brother has really apparent mental problems such as schizophrenia, because I've always been their golden child, and I've always been so perfect to everyone, I've always been seen as smart and strong and- I just, don't know how to handle losing that kind of respect. I'm already losing it. My issues have been getting so bad I had to leave all of my friends and move to online school until I'm at least ok enough that I stop passing out at school. I've been so much more stressed especially with all that's going on in the world and in America with the lgbt-phobic laws being made. I used to be so passionate about social issues but at this point I'm just too tired of my existence being seen as a debate or political. I can't handle it anymore. I feel so alone and most people who used to be my friends started avoiding me because I'm making them uncomfortable with how depressed I've been. Everyone already left me and I don't know what to do anymore. I want to die every other day and no one cares, and the only people who say they care I can't get myself to tell them because they already hurt me so much before and I don't really feel like I could trust them enough, and I'm not sure they'll still care about me if I make this more serious. I'm so tired of having to be serious. I just want to be a normal kid. I don't even know if that's possible anymore. I just want a hug but I don't have anyone I could get to just hold me for a bit. I'm so tired and anxious and in constant hurt and I don't know what to do. I already took all the advice of trying to get help and therapy and all that but it just isn't enough and I don't know anymore. I'm thinking maybe I'll just try to suck it up and confront my parents or at least my dad because I trust him a bit more, and if it doesn't work out this time I'll just kill myself and stop having to worry. I don't know if I can really get myself to tell him. I don't know if he'll even take it seriously this time either.I just.. feel like less of a human honestly. I look very visibly different from other people, and because I'm trans my short and round stature (coupled with chronic genetic Babyface symptom) makes it so that I'll never pass for an adult if I want to pass as my own gender as well. I'm genderfluid but I'm so fucking ugly no matter what presentation I'm at and it's to a point where I'm pretty sure I feel dysphoria both ways because I don't look like any gender except ugly. I know height shouldn't matter this much but I'm so constantly frustrated by it because my proportions are so terrible that there are many activities I'd wish I could do like piano or dancing but I physically can't because my arms and fingers are so short. Also because of my height it highlights my stupid chest no matter what since everyone sees me from a almost 90 degree angle. Binders are pointless because they never fit my weirdly wide and short torso well and they're always so visible under any clothes. I don't have a neck either. I genuinely plan on killing myself if I don't grow any taller or at the very least even out proportions wise. This isn't just a small problem for me- it interferes with every aspect of my life. It's physically uncomfortable doing most things because I'm just too short and it's extremely embarrassing to exist in public. I know this is probably all coupled with dysphoria from other things making my height issue more exaggerated, but I genuinely don't know how I could possibly be ok with this. The thing is I look at tall trans women for example and though for many that could cause dysphoria, it's very much possible to be feminine and make that height such an attractive feature. Tall women are beautiful and have more ability to make it their own. But with extremely short, well, anything, its never going to be attractive because it makes you viewed always at the worse angles, it makes it so you can't wear anything designed for adults, you can't reach most things, you have less to work with, and at a certain point you start looking like a troll once you're wider than you are tall. (Also I apologize if this comes off as dismissing the troubles of others I'm aware there are other factors but I'm just saying this as a general thing, way more models are tall for a reason). What makes this so much worse is every doctors visit I'm told by multiple different doctors that "girls can get away with high heels" or that I'm lucky because I can wear tall heels and be "short and feminine" still. I want to fucking shoot myself. I'm so tempted to stab myself every fucking day from how disgusting my body is and how I'll never have a body that matches who I am or that would let me do the things I care about. I want to go into sex work just so I can objectify it and not have to see this fucking bullshit as anything but something I could at least sell. If I got hurt, good. I hate being genderfluid. 99% of people won't even believe me anyways so why even try to present as myself. I'm never good enough for anyone. Sure I have friends but that's all I'll ever be. A "good friend." The goofy little friend who's only good as a therapy emotional support dog for others, who will never really grow up because they barely exist as a human. The one everyone already expects to die before 30. The one people can't imagine as older because I'll look the same no matter if I keep living. The one always in pain. The one that everyone "loves" but will never be enough to love any other way than "little sibling." I don't want to breathe anymore. I'm tired of being ugly. I'm sorry if this seems shallow. I don't care if everyone says they love my personality or soul or whatever bs. I don't care if I have good intellectual traits. I don't want to live those things out in this body. I just can't do it. I'm tired of always falling short of enough but simultaneously being too much life and emotions wise.My face is red and dry too and everything hurts.I just can't love or even like my body. On top of being trans, I have numerous health issues that mean I don't get to live normally anyways. I'll never get to know what it's like to be able to just eat what I'd like without needing to know every specific calorie and nutrition value. I'm always jealous of classmates around me who all have the opposite problem and eat everything constantly with no issues. But besides that, even just dysphoria alone is enough to make me hate my body. Everytime I see a mirror I cry. Everytime I see any man I feel hurt, it's that bad. It doesn't help I'm ugly for both a guy AND a girl. I'm shorter than most women too and in my last doctor visits they told me I'm done growing, and 2 seperate doctors made the "joke" that I'll be fine because "women can get away with wearing heels." I'm sad that no one will ever know me. I've had so many friends who were amazing people in all other ways, but simply because I was trans, no matter how hard they tried they just couldn't understand me. It hurts so much. I know you can't expect people to read your mind but every joking deadname, every "for a girl" comment, it makes me want to die. I can't seem to explain to them why I'm in so much pain.I feel so pathetic. Every time I imagine myself I just see this mental image of a little kid covered in bandages on the brink of death laying in the cold with no one being able to see. I'm so tired of being sick and constantly uncomfortable. I can't even do anything about it. Therapists never understand me because they don't get that I'm not just a "girl who's spoiled and wants to be quirky." No one ever gets it. I wish I had just one person in my life to depend on without feeling uncomfortable. I'm just scared. All the time. I don't know what I'm waiting for. A miracle maybe? Even if I wanted to transition I couldn't really. I'm genderfluid so dysphoria changes too much for me. Also, being a short more obviously masc guy seems worse to me than just being nothing. I don't want to be a transitioned version of my body, I want to be me. It just won't be me still. It's like I can't enjoy anything about life because this isn't my life. It doesn't feel like me at all. I just want to disappear.I don't know what I'm waiting for. All I know is I'm sad, hurting, hungry, and completely insatiable in every damn way.Edit: also really irritated at the constant micromanaging of everything I eat by my parents. It makes me just not want to eat at all. But of course that makes my mom happy.The idea of being a woman absolutely disgusts me. The idea of me as a man seems so wrong. Nonbinary? Maybe. But it doesn't work completely. I feel always incomplete. I hate being genderfluid. I hate that most people I meet and will meet won't understand me. I hate that it's like that even with my closest friends. I hate that I'll never feel whole. I hate that even when I feel more femme than other I can't be confident enough to present that way because people will stop taking my transness seriously. I hate that that happens. I hate that I don't have any energy to advocate for myself anymore. I hate I don't have the energy to even be comfortable. I don't know if I want to live. I'm always incomplete. I'm incomplete with my gender, never having a way to transition since it shifts. I'm incomplete with satisfaction. My genetics give me health problems that make it so I'll never get to enjoy the things I like. I'm so tired of never feeling like anything's enough. I hate it. I hate it so much. Why am I even here? I hate that my parents will never really love me for me. I don't know if anyone will. I'm tired of being objectified. I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of doctors and therapists always failing me. I don't know what to do anymore."I'm just a kid" but "just" implies there's something better to rely on, and I just don't see that. Every adult in my life has and still consistently fails me. Each time I interact with someone I have a slight twinge of hope that maybe this'll be different, maybe they'll be reliable. Then every time they abandon me, abuse me, use me, lie to me... I just don't care enough anymore. What's the point? Everything hurts but no one believes me. Even when they do, no one does anything to help. Every time I think I can trust someone they end up betraying me, yet for some sick reason I can never seem to stop trusting more people. I'll never understand why people refer to childhood as a simpler time. I can't remember any time my life's been comfortable. Every memory is just tears. I remember stabbing myself with a pencil at 5 years old because I didn't think what happened to me mattered anyways, and when my parents saw, they just made fun of me and reprimanded me while trying to get out the lead. Same thing when I got my heel punctured with an old nail and fell down the stairs, they just laughed. Everytime they did something "nice" for me it was just a way to put me into a debt I didn't ask for, and so they could be as cruel as they wanted with punishment later on. I'm going to be an adult soon, just a couple more years till I'm 18, but right now I just feel like a scared little kid who just wants a hug. But even hugs are out of the question. Physical touch has been so painful and so scary so many times I just can't separate that even with small things like being held. I always feel cold. It's like my heart's out on a snowy driveway at all times, and no one cares enough to shovel it out, while I'm just too weak and tired to do it myself- not to mention I just don't see the worth in doing that since someone will come throw it down again anyways. I'm sick a lot. Thing is the laws and regulations out there don't care about people like me. They don't think I should exist. I'm tired of being trans. I'm tired of no one understanding what that means. I'm tired of no one seeing me for me. The sexualizing I get from family even because of it is just so repulsive. But no one will help. No one cares about those "attention seekers." You'd think in California at least people would be more understanding but no. The harassment is still there, the difference is just no one believes you about it. Therapy is another failure. I've gone to a few different therapists at this point, none of them ever help. It's just more adults failing me. I'm just so tired. I wish more than anything to have someone I can be comfortable with just be there for me. I want to be able to sleep for once without waking up terrified from all the nightmares, I wish I could sleep with someone next to me just there to hold me when I start shaking. Someone who would look at me and just love me. That's all I want. I don't know if I want a future. I think it would end up just hurting more. I just wish I could be comfortable at least for a moment. Even if it was my last moment, I'd just want a hug that feels comfortable and safe to leave me with something. I just want to feel that once.i just want to feel safe, once.The biggest source of dysphoria for me besides my appearance is my inability to sing in a voice that feels like mine. There are so many things I wish I could do but the fact I'm trans interferes with so much of it. There's really nothing in my life I feel I can look forward to. I love being energetic and doing things like dance or athletics but I just can't do it past alone in my room because the dysphoria and highly genderedness of it all hurts too much. I'd want to sing my heart out but it just hurts more than anything knowing I can't. I know I could possibly have a more fitting voice if I start hrt in the future (trans masc) but I'm so impatient already and I don't think I could wait all the years it would take for that, along with just the uncertainty of how taking T would affect me. I'm scared it'll just make me more depressed because I'll never quite reach what feels right. I'm sorry if this is hurtful to others here, I just really needed to vent about feeling like my passions are all restricted somewhere. I'm still really young but idk I already feel like giving up. I've wanted to kill myself quite seriously since I was 4 years old. I stabbed myself when I was 5 and remember thinking it didn't matter. I've never felt connection to myself and I'm scared I never will, and if I do, will it be too late? Everyone says just love yourself but I just can't make myself feel there's anyone really there to love. I don't feel real, I don't want this to be real- it hurts enough as a distant experience as is. Why do I have to exist like this?. For me I've been really struggling with how to go about this as someone who's trans/queer, POC, has a strangely high IQ (trust me that isn't always a good thing to be seen as smart), and has been through some uncommon forms of trauma/abuse throughout childhood.I've yet to ever meet anyone who could understand me, and I want to know- how do you deal with that reality? That the masses likely won't be able to instantly or even ever understand your mind?. Just to clarify, I'm not saying I'm right in every discussion. I'm specifically referring to the situations where me being right isn't a question and I'm just more intuned with the topic than the person I'm arguing with. I don't have a hard time accepting when I'm wrong by any means and I'm usually happy to be proven wrong because that situation means my company is just as if not more passionate than me on things. So often there are situations where I'm very clearly right- cases where I have a multitude of evidence proving my side along with extremely solid reasoning -but I usually let the conversation drop and pretend the other person is correct just to not turn it into a fight. The times where I don't drop it and I do lay out all of my arguments, I'm always right because again, I actually think unlike the other person who's only going off emotions and pulling at straws as evidence, but the other person gets mad at me and leaves because I've injured their pride (I know this part for sure because I've discussed it after the fact). My issue is: is it wrong or right for me to pretend something is correct when I know for sure it isn't, if it means I avoid conflict that hurts my relationship with the other person? What's more important, the truth or keeping the peace?. I just feel so broken. I know people will say I'm too young and all of my feelings are just puberty but I've felt this way my whole life. I can remember distinctly being 6 years old and stabbing myself because I had no reason to care about what happened to me. No one ever loved me and I've never loved anyone. Recently I made a friend who I grew close to. They were someone I began caring about so much and eventually I trusted them to the point I relied on them a bit. Adding to the countless times I've thought about it I was suicidal at a point, and they found out. They were one of the first and only people to ever react to that news by actually saying they cared about me and really trying to stop me. They cared enough to try and stop me and that made me think they really did love me in some way. I thought I found someone I could be safe with.After a few years I think I started actually loving them. I don't know what you'd call it because honestly I didn't care if we would date or be friends or whatever I just wanted them in my life and I just wished that I could love someone who loved me back. I craved that feeling more than anything and I thought I felt it with them.But in a conversation recently they mentioned how they thought love was stupid unless it was family and that made me break a bit more inside. That was something I was always scared of. If love had to be family. The only family I had were manipulative and abusive. There was no love there. I'd always see all my friends have this bond with their parents or siblings and I just couldn't have that. I tried convincing myself I can find that somewhere else, that relationship of trust that's just so fundamental, but hearing the only person I first felt a semblance of love from say I couldn't, I just feel alone. My heart feels like a broken lamp. So beaten and so fragile barely hanging on to a light. All I want more than anything is for someone to be there to help hold it who won't leave me. I can't handle this grief alone. I can't handle living in a world where no one knows me and no one cares enough to. Why can't I just have someone who loves me? I don't think I can earn love anymore. I've tried so hard and it's gotten most people to like me or respect me but no one ever loves me. I don't know what more I could do. I've let down my walls more than safe honestly in an attempt to be vulnerable and to trust people and I keep trusting over and over again but every time that trust gets betrayed. I don't want to earn love I know this is selfish but I wish someone would just love me because they do. I wish there was someone who cares about me enough to not want me in pain. Why does everyone just abandon me?.
    Even though a psychiatrist diagnosed me and even prescribed me medications. I told him like 3 times but he always seems to forget. Whenever I mention it he's like "no, you don't have depression because you don't let yourself go and you have achieved things in life" and it honestly makes me so mad because not all depressed people are the same. Not everyone is going to experience the same things and, just because I don't like to show him what depression really does to me, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I still feel like shit every single day, just because I can pretend to be okay it doesn't mean that I am. I'm so sad and tired...
    I live in a country that is supposed to have free healthcare, but even though I am very suicidal, I can't get help and see a psychotherapist.Psychotherapists should be free if you have an insurance, but all of them are "overbooked for insurance clients" and only accept self-paying clients. I am a student with a part time job and I don't have 50-70€ a session. I have only 300 something in my bank account, which is making me more depressed.I don't know what to do anymore and I don't think I will make it if I don't do anything about it.But I guess a piece of rope is cheaper than a therapy.\[Sorry for rant, I needed to vent somehow\]Edit : I am from EU - Slovakia. I don't do drugs, I usually don't drink coffee 8h before bed. I drink only on rare occasions. But I have diagnosed ocd, anxiety and depression (and undiagnosed adhd and ptsd). We are both virgins and we are in a long lasting relationship (almost a year) and I wonder if we should get better together through trial and error. But I don't want it to be bad.(We have not discussed /agreed on not watching porn, so that is not the issue.). Me and my gf never had sex, but I am kinda worried about my occasional wet dreams. Is it posaible to get someone pregnant from having wet dreams and sleeping nezt to them ? I have had underwear and pyjamas on and from what I saw there was no cumstain or the smell of cum on my clothes.I am in such a terrible state for no f-ing reason everything should be perfect. But my mind is mess today and i cant even keep my body from acting normally. I am having so many random ticks and keep twitching. I should be learning for my college exam, but I simply cant. And my intrusive thoughts been telling me the worst things. I was writing this so I may feel better after putting this into words, but it didnt help :). I am just an empty shell for way too long. I don't enjoy anything 99% of times, I can't even kill time on youtube / games / anime anything i kinda liked. Everything is so slow, only my mind is fast in overthinking and self-pitying. I don't fit in my college among other students or among my friends. I can't focus I can't think, I want to cut myself so bad, I can't go on like this. I have everything I could want but what of it. Nothing helps.I need to get on meds again and start therapy, but I dont have time or money. Sorry if the text is scattered / doesn't make sense I can't think straight.I have been doing some research on my family history and I am struggling to find this so called "Gondolani Spitz" where a short battle was fought between Austro-Hungarian and Italian troops.The name "Gondolani Spitz" is most likely not entirely correct, since it was written by non-german speeking people. Also there is no mention of such place on the internet or in old lexicons of Alps.It is likely set in North Italy somewhere near Rovereto, but that is just my deduction.If it helps ,the battle took place in 1918 or late 1917 and was fought because one new recruit lit a cigarete during nighttime and Italian troops spotted the light and started shooting which caused and avalanche and Austro-Hungarian troops fell into deep snow and their limbs froze.PS: I understand it is probably in Italian alps, but maybe someone will help me at least with the correction of the name or will know something since it is about Austro-Hungarian troops.Edit : I tried r/italy and r/germany already. Hi everyone I got scammed on ig by someone who seemed super legit. They made lot of colabs with poke-tubers (f.e. deep pocket monsters), but none of the videos are still on yt.They may seem legit at first and even sell, but once they have enough follows to scam more people at once they won't deliver anything and delete all social media and won't respond anywhere. The only thing left is their yt channel.PS : I am super dumb, so I chose friends and family in paypal so can't even get money back. But at least I will be more careful.Hey everyone, I have ordered some packages from ultrazone2020 on instagram, but haven't recieved anything for 3 months. It was supposed to ship from UK to central EU, but still nothing and the seller haven't posted anything since september. Does anyone have some experience with Ultrazone2020 on instagram ? I am thinking I might have fell for a scam, but don't want to call someone out for no reason.If only my mum stayed abroad for another month, I could have ended myself now.If only my mum stayed abroad for another month, I could have ended myself now.I just can't keep up with life. I have been struggling with extreme ocd, anxiety and depression and despite that I got to university and before covid I was in good shape, won few medals in martial arts tournaments and I've gone to part time job few times a week. However that changed drastically. I may have got to university, but as a first year I am struggling way too much. I must admit it is difficult for first years to grasp the different way of learning, but I am just a lost cause. I would have failed my first exam if it wasn't for cheating, today I failed my history exam despite learning daily for 2 weeks. I really doubt I can make it past this semester. All of my good friends left to study abroad and I have almost no one to talk to about my true feelings. I am too ashamed to get back in contact with my psychiatrist and to take meds again even though I know fore sure it would help. I gained a lot of weight (about 15kg) and striae started to show on my arms and legs. In addition I am slowly loosing my sight and hearing even though I will only become 20 in next few months.After my last relationship I found out that I am bi and ace which makes my love life damn hard and in my country it could even possibly kill me since there are a lot of Nazis. Overall I am weak-willed and have found no such joy in life to keep me going forward. I cannot continue to smile anymore, I cannot get back on my feet anymore and I cannot keep going forward anymore. In my life there is a line of how much can I bear, and I feel like I am slowly getting there.I just can't keep up with life.

Everything was fine, but after few months I broke up with him, since he was a douche who sexted with too many people and made me do bad stuff. Even after that I wasn't depressed, only after I started my first semester at uni I found out that I am not fit for it and my whole plan for future is ruined. I am unable to focus and learn properly during classes which are all online. I had to cheat on first test for which I spent much time learning for. I am a big fuck-up who can't even prepare for lesson properly. I don't have any strong sides besides being funny and empathetic which won't help me at uni or find a decent job. I don't feel sadness, anger or any regular emotion, just desperation and won't to end it all.I haven't had any symptoms of depression since march, but past 2 weeks it's getting worse and worse again.Since March I found myself my ex bf, accepted my sexuality, became extrovert who enjoys going out, but for some reason I started doubting myself again. I was appreciating every single day I lived, because I knew how terrible my life with depression was. And now it's happening again.My friends went to study abroad, my entire college is online so its hard to make friends and me feeling like crap doesn't help my college study either. Idk if I should start seeing psychologist and psychiatrist again, but I may need to if I start struggling even more.PS : At least I feel a tiny bit better after putting my thoughts into this short text, so thanks brain ig. (I found a perfect bf and he made me post this after playing truth or dare, I love him so much aaa). I am not as depressed as I used to be, but I can't seem to get back into normal life. I am unable to do things I need and want to do. Only few things bring me joy and I have problems with learning.Even though I am doing better, suicidal thoughts are not stopping just getting stronger, since I am not feeling that bad but I still don't do anything productive. I doubt I have any future ahead of my painful and pointless life so why not end it ? Oh I know why, because I am fucking pussy and I would screw that up too.Life is just too boring for me since I lost interest in most of my hobbies. And I can't travel which was a thing that could keep me sane for a while.Also being such idiot that I envy others relationships doesn't help either.I am 18, but I am so tired of life that it is unbearable. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for over 5 years and it's just getting worse and worse.I can't bring myself to do anything productive, mainly because my illness and because... life is just too boring for me and I would like to end it. It's not like I am getting anywhere since the only thing I do all day is watch anime and game. Even if I want to learn, work out or practice guitar, I just can't. If this continues I have no hopes for graduating, going to college, getting decent job or having a stable relationship. So basically I will have really no reason to keep struggling. I am just a big failure atm and I will probably stay like that.Lately I have been dreaming about suicide and writing my last words way too much. I even remember what I wanted to write there.Anyway thank you for reading my vent, I am going to cry myself to sleep nowPS: please don't send me any "Jesus loves you" etc messages into DMs. I am atheist and it will just cause more harm than good.

    22 right now and im in film school, however im having some second doubts with really doing film.Other than that I really want to pursue music but thats honestly something better left on the side for me to work towards while having a day job.At this point im not really sure what to do as a back up/day job as nothing really interests me at this point.For some time i did have an interest in Architecture and also Psychology , but those both require a masters to really get anymore.I just feel so lost with what to do realizing that I want to pursue music this late but also the fact that I need a backup as music isnt reliable as a career path.22 right now and im in film school, however im having some second doubts with really doing film.Other than that I really want to pursue music but thats honestly something better left on the side for me to work towards while having a day job.At this point im not really sure what to do as a back up/day job as nothing really interests me at this point.For some time i did have an interest in Architecture and also Psychology , but those both require a masters to really get anymore.I just feel so lost with what to do realizing that I want to pursue music this late but also the fact that I need a backup as music isnt reliable as a career path.Hi film student here, was wondering how the jobs are in terms of pay, fuffilment, hours, and so on.Im worried from rumors that people glorify film alot of the times, and that in reality the jobs out there arent really that exciting or fuffilling. I also don't really have that burning passion for it as i once did so im also scared that its a sign to pack up my bags and leaveWith where im at, i think ill finish my degree and treat it as job while trying to find something else on the side, but that depends if the pay is even worth getting getting a degree out of in the first place. Would be appreciated if anyone in the scene could give some insight.With the amount of young successful artists these days, what exactly contributes their sucess.Were they lucky, talented, or hard working?I find it confusing as there are so many talented and skilled artists who have been in it for a long time and who also dont see the light of day. While there are others that go viral out of nowwhere from a few songs put out and go onto sign record deals shortly after.Does hard work and talent not matter as much anymore in regards to an artist making it? Does it boil down to luck on if their music gets views or streams?I used to believe that good music should speak for itself and will naturally attract a following, but this feels further from the truth these days.Are artists who've broken into the industry just extremely lucky over others to have thier music noticed?Unlike sports where theres a clear difference in skill, and work effort, music feels much more of a lottery sometimes with your talen only taking you soo far and luck being the final decider on who makes it or not.TLDR: Worried that its too late for me (22M) make it far as an aspiring music artist on the side due to life setbacksArt and creative fields such as music has always been a passion of mine, but was neglected throughout highschool due to academics so i never really stuck with it.So going into uni I majored in economics instead, and flunked first year as i got depressed with majoring in it. Spent 2 years trying to transfer into film school, and im now in my 2nd year with 2 left. However my interest in film has dropped and I really want to persue music however with how difficult the music industry is im worried that its just a lost cause at this point.Theres soo many young breakout artists these days who started in their teens that it feels like I've missed the boat on this.Yea there are some musicians that started late and switched over from doing a full degree in something else. Hell, even this musician that got quite big after learning a year of learning with 0 prior background. But it feels like those people got incredible lucky with getting their music noticed to landing record deals.At this point im not sure what to really do, drop out of film school, stick through it and work my ass off perusing music on the side, give up entirely on both and just switch to for financially stable major.It's been difficult to naviagte through life recently and even more so on the thought that maybe dreams should stay dreams. I just want to be happy doing something that im passionate about, but jt feels that the whole world is against me due to being late to the game.Its kinda struck me recently that my life is so insignificant compared to acomplished musicians, atheltes, actors, etc.. my age (22) and i get this deep envy that im not living life to the fullest.Touring the world and playing music, acting in big films, the rest goes on. My life just feels so mundane in comparison and I'm not sure how to really reconcile with being normal. Obviously they did have to work hard to get to where they are at, but at my age it feels a bit late to really pursue things like those anymore and im locked into a STEM career for the rest of my life which doesn't really appeal to me.How do i feel better about myself and the life that I have for myself going forward? How do i find happiness despite knowing I may not be able to be an acclaimed musician, actor, athlete, or someone doing something really cool in life?. Im 22 right now and ive been back and forth with university to which i have 3 more years left to graduate due to transfers. However i dont even think im passionate towards my current major anymore (Film)I started to get into a really bad habit of comparing myself to people my age who found their passion early, stuck with it, and are now extremly successful.From young acomplished artists, actors, atheltes, enterpruners etc.. it just feels really crappy that they are living a dream life with sucess, fame (not to the extent where it interupts with your life), and wealth while your not.I have this heavy regret that If I had a better idea of what i wanted to do and dedicated myself to it in highschool, that I could have been successful by now.How do i get back on track and really be passionate about things again?. TLDR: Worried that I'm too old (22) to start from scratch and make it far as an aspiring music artist due to life setbacks.So I'm 22 and I've always had a passion for music, however, it was never the main focus of my life and I ended up going down a traditional path all through high school. a few years into university I finally switched over to a creative career and am now in my 2nd year of film school. Unfortunately, things didn't work out and my passion for film has dropped while I've felt more and more passionate about music over the years.I plan to pursue music on the side while finishing up my degree. However, I'm scared that I won't make it far in the music industry being someone who is doing an unrelated degree and with limited skill/experience in music.Alot of people say it's never too late and that you should never ever give up on your dreams. But I'm still worried that by the time I let's say graduate (25) or even later, and have spent a few years getting to a decent enough level to put out quality music, it will be too late for a label or anyone to take an interest in me. While there are modern artists like Thuy or Keshi who did university in totally different things and still made it in the music industry later on in life, it still feels so surreal to me if I could do the same. I do wanna also point out this Japanese artist Imase who was able to break out only after a year of learning how to compose, produce, etc with 0 prior music experience. But still, I'm not sure how much I can value these success stories over the possible number of people who failed at pursuing their music dreams.It's been eating away at me so much recently that I've been really depressed about whether I can really make this whole thing work or not.I'm a really ambitious person and a big dreamer who wants to live life in a meaningful and fulfilling way. Through all of this, I'm not sure if I should just let it go and accept that this is something that is completely closed off from the rest of my life because I didn't start pursuing it in highschool.TLDR: Worried that I'm too old (22) to start from scratch and make it far as an aspiring music artist due to life setbacksOver this past summer, I've become extremely depressed over the thought of it being too late or impossible to achieve my dreams. So much to the point that id barely want to leave my bed, keep up with my studies, or hang out with friends.So a bit of of backstoryI've always been the kid more interested in art and creative things. That different kid didn't want to go with the norm. Didn't want to follow an unfulfilling 9-5 and always pondered on doing extraordinary things with my life instead, like being a film director, music artist, fashion designer etc...However, I ended up following a typical Asian path of going into a stem career which I majored in economics going into university. I then had a lot of regret for not doing something that I was truly passionate about and I ended up failing the 1st year due to how depressed I was. I then spent the next 2 years doing prerequisites and grinding my GPA up to a B+ in hopes of transferring into the university's film program at the school which was selective (30ish out of 250 or so applicants each year). I ended up waitlisting both times 14th then 4th and ended up transferring to another school and am 4 years deep into uni with 3 more years including this one until I graduate. However, I've lost a lot of interest in Film as a career due to a lot of complicated reasons. And have only gained an increasing passion for music over the years.That said with how behind I am in life and realizing that I want to pursue music instead, I'm worried that it's too late for me to make it far in the music industry with limited experience at 22 (2 years of school band, Choir, and Guitar lessons. However I never really took it seriously as I didn't have the same appreciation for music when I was younger.) I have such a deep and heavy regret that's been taking a big toll on my mental health that I could have made it somewhere if I discovered my passion in high school. I'm 4+ years deep into university and there are so many people my age who have made a name for themselves and can tour, play in front of fans, and pursue a creative life that's very meaningful.I feel really lost and im not sure where to go at this moment or how to feel mentally better. I feel so discouraged with how much time I've spent sticking to academics in highschool, to switching over to film, just to have it not be what I truly want in life.I just want to be happy and to live out my life to the fullest, but I feel like it's such a pipe dream to do so since I'm discovering this passion and dream all too late.Sorry for the long awkward ramble, I'm wanting any opinions or advice on my situation and also thank you in advance to anyone who's read up to this point.TLDR: Worried that I'm too old (22) to start from scratch and make it far as an aspiring music artist due to life setbacksOver this past summer, I've become extremely depressed over the thought of it being too late or impossible to achieve my dreams. So much to the point that id barely want to leave my bed, keep up with my studies, or hang out with friends.So a bit of of backstoryI've always been the kid more interested in art and creative things. That different kid didn't want to go with the norm. Didn't want to follow an unfulfilling 9-5 and always pondered on doing extraordinary things with my life instead, like being a film director, music artist, fashion designer etc...However, I ended up following a typical Asian path of going into a stem career which I majored in economics going into university. I then had a lot of regret for not doing something that I was truly passionate about and I ended up failing the 1st year due to how depressed I was. I then spent the next 2 years doing prerequisites and grinding my GPA up to a B+ in hopes of transferring into the university's film program at the school which was selective (30ish out of 250 or so applicants each year). I ended up waitlisting both times 14th then 4th and ended up transferring to another school and am 4 years deep into uni with 3 more years including this one until I graduate. However, I've lost a lot of interest in Film as a career due to a lot of complicated reasons. And have only gained an increasing passion for music over the years.That said with how behind I am in life and realizing that I want to pursue music instead, I'm worried that it's too late for me to make it far in the music industry with limited experience at 22 (2 years of school band, Choir, and Guitar lessons. However I never really took it seriously as I didn't have the same appreciation for music when I was younger.) I have such a deep and heavy regret that's been taking a big toll on my mental health that I could have made it somewhere if I discovered my passion in high school. I'm 4+ years deep into university and there are so many people my age who have made a name for themselves and can tour, play in front of fans, and pursue a creative life that's very meaningful.I feel really lost and im not sure where to go at this moment or how to feel mentally better. I feel so discouraged with how much time I've spent sticking to academics in highschool, to switching over to film, just to have it not be what I truly want in life.I just want to be happy and to live out my life to the fullest, but I feel like it's such a pipe dream to do so since I'm discovering this passion and dream all too late.Sorry for the long awkward ramble, I'm wanting any opinions or advice on my situation and also thank you in advance to anyone who's read up to this point.
    One day, I'm doing fine. Managing my business, doing errands, drinking my antidepressants nightly, everything is great. The next thing I know, I'm tired of everything, I'm sad and irritable, I hate everyone and I just wanna isolate for a week. I never realized how non-linear recovery is. Do you feel this way too?. Hi, are there any active cosplay/anime groups in Bacolod? I'm interested in joining but I'm hesitant because I'm older than the teens/kids but enjoy anime daily. Maybe some Facebook groups or anything. Hi everyone! I'm making a YouTube channel dedicated to RPG characters and the first ever highlight is for Velvet!

I literally just found out about this page today and I'm beyond thrilled to see so many people talking about IBS. I was diagnosed with IBS M last February and I wanted to ask. To those who have partners or family, what do you say to them when they ask you how they can help you?. *Mommy didn't know that killing people was the only thing that made my sadness go away*.
    I've already sunk $60 on trying to get it and no luck. It seems the only way I'm getting it is from either ideality or next time the event comes around. Do we know when the event I'd gonna return or is it gonna be, like, a full year from now during next Halloween? I'm a completionist, and although I know how bad that can be for gatcha games, Limbus and Project Moon is something I really support so I'm not too against whaling for them. That being said, I'm not sure I wanna waste all my money for something I might not get...I was being stupid and speeding. Got a ticket, he was cool though and lowered it. When he asked why I broke down and started crying. It's been a couple hours since and I'm still shaken up. He's said some nice stuff and was nice but I would be lying if it didn't make me feel awful. I feel like such a fuckup. I hate myself so fucking much.Edit: I'm locked kinda happy, it was the first time someone seemed concerned for me. Not happy about the ticket. He said sorry about it and he felt like a dick for giving me a ticket after we had a good 15 minute talk about my future. I told him I deserved it cause I was being reckless.Everyone I see seems to not want to tell their therapist too much as to avoid going to a mental hospital, and I was wondering if they're really that bad.When I started antidepressants, my strong suicidal tendencies went away for the most part. I went from actively suicidal and making plans to just passive, still wishing I could die but not having much motivation behind it. I wish I could get some help but I have trouble with it, I was wondering if it's bad to actually want to be put in a mental hospital. Maybe I'm just desperate to interact with people and hope it would be an excuse to find help. It's probably just a waste of the workers time to have me there. Idk if it's necessary or if I'm just better off geting a therapist.I'm extremely scared of infection and am usually very thorough with cleaning my tools (boiling water + 70% rubbing alcohol + hydrogen peroxide). Plus I use antibiotic ointment, 70% rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide before and after each cut. I know I'm never 100% safe, but I wanted to know at what point its just diminishing results.I was wondering if, at least for my tools, if I should be doing that before every time, or just every couple of times. Any help would be nice.I was clinically diagnosed about a month or two ago and they gave me meds. It was rough the first few days, helped the strong negative emotions and stuff and I guess I've gotten "over" some of the reasons I've been sad. I don't think of my problems as much but I still feel empty. Nothing feels worth doing, all my old enjoyments are dull and I can't stand them. It's like when your sick and you can't keep anything down. All I do all day outside of work is play League of Legends cause it's the only thing I feel like can stomach. I look for any opportunity to go outside or do something cause I feel my mind rotting away otherwise but my town is boring. I can't cry even if I want to, the meds do a good job at that. I eat too much fast food because it's an excuse to leave the house for a bit.I know it's my fault I feel this way but it's hard to find ways to alleviate my depression. I have no aspirations, I live with my family still but I don't desire anything. I have nothing to be excited for. I have no hobbies outside of games, but even those feel shitty to me. I think of moving out but I just remeber it's gonna be the same feeling with or without people around me. I think of dating but I don't wanna burden others. I tried so hard to make friends in college but I fucked that up too. I just wish I had that spark back, where I was excited for the future and what it held, but now I feel like I'm at a dead end even though there's a vast road ahead of me.I don't know what to do. I hate everything an nothing feels worth doing. I guess I'm happy that I'm crying while writing this, I was scared I lost the ability to cry.I have some trouble with keeping my gauze on my sh. I use paper tape (made fore keeping bandages on) and tape them on my sh but my body moves in ways that keep causing them to unstick and fall off. Are there any tips for keeping my bandages secure? I sh on my thigh but I the tape becomes loose after moving my leg a bit and it's getting annoying trying to keep sticking the tape back on or adding more tape to resecure it.When I sh on my left thigh, I usually do it at night, around 3 or 5 hours before I go to bed when I'm alone and no one is likely to come in. Just cat scratches, but I usually take care of the area. I'm pretty extra about caring about them, I wipe and clean with baby wipes, then sometimes hygrogen peroxide (mostly done for the burning feeling), then once its slowed down with bleeding, I use this wound cleaner called Puracyn plus, then 70% rubbing alcohol (also cause it causes a burning sensation and I feel the pain), then finally put a bandage on it. Sometimes I uses rolled gauze to wrap my entire leg, other times I just use a paper towel with some tape. Even though its not bleeding anymore and has seemed to scabbed over, I keep the bandage there once I go to sleep cause, for some reason, when I wake up in the morning, I find that I have dried blood all over my thigh and my bandage is clinging tight to it so I have to rip it off. I was wondering if anyone else has a similar problem and if there's an explanation. Thanks!. I don't mean just your favorite songs, but the ones that best represent Mili and their style and to impress someone else of their talent.I chose the following but would love to hear what others think!- world.execute(me);- Ga1ahad and Scientific Witchery- Camelia- Imagined Flight- Bathtub Mermaid- LemonadeI tried to choose a variety of their music and ones that are different. I have a friend that we're trading music (she gave me Taylor Swift's Folklore, can't wait to tell her what I think!) to listen to and talk about next week.A bug appears to make it so he no longer HEALS anymore on any of his skills! His main gimmick is gone.. So far, I've been loosely using S&F for their town, some mechanical benefits to sink their money into, but I wasn't much of a fan of the battles and commanding troops. It feels a little slow to be the main focus, and a little too much to be a side thing. My players are really insistent that I give them something to do with their troops other than handwave them off and saying "their fighting the good fight off screen." It's the climax of the middle of the campaign and they rightfully want to use their troops. It's just, I find the troop combat stuff boring and slow.I was wondering if K&W has a better mass combat system for me to run a large battle in it and be the main focus. Plus if I can convert their troops to that system as well. Any help I can get would be greatly appreciated.I know the Refraction Railway JUST came out, but I wanted to hear other peoples strats for clearing the first stop the fastest and what kind of clears others have gotten already. I REALLY want the sub 120 turns banner but was having trouble bringing my time down.I've tried 3 times now and the lowest I got was 10 turns with:R corp Heathcliff Kurokumo Rodion W Corp Don G Corp Gregor Kurokumo Hong LuUpdate: I went back with G Corp Outis, G Corp Gregor, Kurokumo Hong Lu, Kurokumo Rodion, and R corp Ishmael since their weak to blunt and got a 9 turn clear which I think I'm happy with. I'm sure with better Ids I could get an even better clear.update 2: I went back and got a 7 turn clear with G Corp Gregor, R corp Ishmael, Mariachi Sinclair, Grippy Faust, and Seven Section Outis... but then my game crashed once I exited the battle. Thankfully my data was saved and I still got the clear!. My players are in a race with Infernal War Machines across the city outskirts. Rules are: anything goes as long as they don't attempt to kill the drivers, only disabling the vehicle (non-lethal stuff like blinding the driver is fine as well). I was wondering if there were any fun or interesting spells, items, or tricks that I could use against my players.Just wondering what other people think about what feels like a controversial spell being used on the party. I just recently used it to, surprisingly, really good success. The PCs saw something they weren't supposed to, and a high level wizard sent them on a quest that would weaken them and use all their resources before he used a combo of a bunch of spells to get them knocked out (Glyphs of warding, Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum, Force Cage, Dark Star, and good old fashioned poisoned tea). While knocked out, he used modify memory, and sent them on their way back to their house. They were pretty mad at first, but when they found out they were handsomely rewarded either way for finishing the quest, and even got a 20% increase in what they agreed on, they got over it quickly. One player was still mad, but they were more mad at the fact they got betrayed rather than their memories got messed with.My PC's own a up and coming town and I want to better connect them to this town and really make them feel that they shaped it into what it is, while also promoting inter-party discussions. I want them to be deliberators and decide on things that effect their town, kind of like judges for court cases or a meaningful choice in a video game RPG (like ones found in the Witcher 3 for example). Problem is that I'm drawing blanks as to what kind of interesting events and choices I can put in front of the playersAre there any resources for lists of such events or help for designing such encounters. I intend for them to be side things for the players to order underlings to do when they return to town after an adventure.I don't mean like how much would rations and bedding cost. I mean, if you could put the benefits of a long rest into a consumable magic item, such as a potion, and you were just a bit desperate, how much would you be willing to pay for it?What kind of price would you put on: healing all your HP, regaining half your hit dice, recovering your class resources/spell slots, and reducing exhaustion.&#x200B;Background: I have a homebrew rule where players can't get the benefits of a long rest outside of civilization. If the players need a long rest after a long travel in the wilderness, they have to pay for special camp supplies that I tend to set at around 1000gp for 3 level 10 players. This made me start wondering if this was a good of deal or not. I'm more so wondering what others think rather than looking for practical advice.Bonus question: What would you pay for a long rest at level 1 vs level 20?Edit: People seem to be misunderstanding, I wasn't asking for rules help or anything. I was asking for the sake of discussion, if there was an item that gave the benefits of a long rest in a case where you could not normally take a long rest, how amazing and valuable would such an item be.. We're talking absolutely crushed, annihilated, and downright dominated on. Think tried to use a magic item to cast Gate to pull the BBEG into the elemental plane of water to drown him just to have him beat them up, steal their magic item that allows them to teleport back home, dispel their breathing devices, and left for dead with no way to get home. No one died thankfully and they eventually got back to the prime material plane. The worst part is that the rogue's one-shot bullet of human slaying that cost a couple thousand gold missed after he failed to hit even with advantage, just completely unlucky. The BBEG wanted to embarrass them, not kill them, thing is that he did way too good a job and frankly I feel bad. They're plan was really really good, one of the best I've seen, but the dice didn't land favorably and I feel awful that it didn't work out.I want to make them feel better or something but I'm not sure what to do. I was thinking of maybe have them feel strong by letting them beat up a bunch of trash mobs or let them try to sneak into a dragon's layer so they could steal a bunch of gold or magic items or something. Anyone have any experience with stuff like this?. I've played through all the Dark Souls games and have always done a full strength build everytime. Always have done the good old sword and board and felt it fun. Thing is, I don't know if I'm misremembering or something, but I feel like heavy weapons and armor suck now. I get stomped in PvP and bosses feel much rougher. I take and deal the same amount of damage to other players who are twice as fast and half as armored than I. I've tried great swordes, axes, all of them feel too slow to the amount of damage they do. I just get stomped on by people who hit and run me with far faster weapons. And it's not like I can punish them when they get caught, because by the time I've finished my swing, they’ve either already dodged away or knocked me out of the animation. Even when I do get a hit in, the damage they've done is practically equal to mine even though I'm wearing the strongest armor I can get.Does anyone else relate or am I just rusty? Maybe I should restart with something else.My rogue has a really great plan and has been gathering specific magic items to shoot my modified human archmage with a bullet and kill him in one turn. An antimatter Rifle for 6d8 necrotic, plus a bullet of human slaying with 6d10 bonus damage on a failed DC 17 con save, plus 5d6 sneak attack damage, all together puts around 82.5 damage or so in the first shot. This is without including other stuff like haste from a potion and other things I'm probably missing, plus follow up by the fighter and wizard.It's a lot and I'm proud of my player's planning and I'm never someone to deny a plan because its too good. That being said however, this has been the villain for the past 60 sessions, around a year and a half or so, and I feel it would be anticlimactic if it just ended with a single round of attacks. To try and offset this, I did give him some illusory duplicates to try and distract them from hitting him. I also thought about maybe giving him the 9th level spell invulnerability instead of time stop. Other than that, some standard legendary actions, and some lair actions, he's just a standard archmage. Am I over preparing and ruining the rogue's plan or should I be worried about them one-shotting him?(As for specifics, both the BBEG (121 HP) and the party (3 level 9s) are very familiar about each other and know each other's weaknesses pretty well. They have fought once before in a minor scuffle but never dealt any real damage to each other. Most other encounters between them have been social for the most part.). Lvl 8 fighter is now a weretiger after eating a wierd fruit in the middle of the desert. I was wondering when I could have such transformations occur. I already track the moon in my games so I could just have it happen on the classic full moon. His backstory is that he's a vigilante, is extremely edgy and filled with a bloodthirst for criminals/pirates (which I think is really fun) so I was thinking about having it happen whenever he killed someone like that or whenever they go out as a vigilante at night. I was also looking for inspiration for what happens when he would return to human from this transformation. Maybe waking up with a dead body at his side or strange objects on his person. I have ideas but I wanna hear what others think would be cool/dramatic. This player is a heavy roleplayer so the more interesting and more chances for roleplaying, the better.My player's theory is really interesting, but I've always had a discipline in which I would never change the plot of my campaign from just hearing my player's theories. This is mostly to cement into my players minds that I would never try to pull the rug from under them if they ever guessed correctly about the plot, giving them the satisfaction of guessing the plot from my foreshadowing. But after last session, their theories of my BBEG not being the person he says he is, that he has been pretending to be some one else, is both making a lot of sense with what information they've been given, and its a lot more interesting than what I originally had going. Should I just take their theory and start backing it up with more plot points and say they were correct even though they weren't? Or should I let them follow this red herring and have them figure out the actual plot?. Me and my party just recently killed another PC who was doing pretty sketchy stuff (cursing people, raising an undead army, etc.), and after it was over they introduced their new character, a barbarian. I play an 8th level battle master fighter and I was really excited to play with this new character and thought it was gonna be really fun to have another martial character like myself. It was until I learned more about their character that I kinda felt kinda bumped out. Apparently, they're a fighter 3/Barbarian 5 which is fine by itself, but seeing their stats, it's just way better than anything of mine. I made my character to be a striker with alright defense but it turns out their PC was able to do slightly more damage as I can with double the health (and quadruple the effective health with totem barbarian rage). Anything that I was good at (athletics, intimidation, insight), they were just as good at, and anything that I was bad at, they were way better at. They're also faster with 40ft vs my 30ft. This is all without mentioning all the stuff they get from being an echo knight like action surge, second wind, and an echo. My DM even gave them my PC's signature weapon, albeit reskinned to do a different damage type, and even homebrewed it to be better.The only thing I have going for me is a +1 higher AC and my battle master maneuvers. Even then they also got superior technique and can do maneuvers of their own. They're faster, stronger, healthier, and just as skillful, both in and out of combat. It's like they copy and paste my stats and just got an extra 5 for Con. I get that fighters get extra attacks and more ASI, but my third attack isn't until 3 levels from now. What am I suppose to do? Did I just mess up by not multiclassing? Should I just throw my character away and roll a new one? I don't wanna come off as petty but I feel useless in comparison and I'm honestly just jealous.
    My dad basically married my mom out of depression ig my mom forced him to marry her and then he fell in love with her couldn’t leave her thus the reason why we now have a disfunctional family and the reason I hate my mom so much is because we don’t get along well bc she lacks self esteem I say or our personalities just don’t class, she leaves me to rot in my room and in return I give her the silent treatment which I am going crazy for bc she is making me go crazy .

    normal family, normal love, normal friendship, normal experiences, normal mentality, normal body, normal job, normal money, normal food, normal life…i have non of these. All the beautiful, good and appreciated things in the world are essentially "normal". Being successful is normal, love is normal, good jobs are normal, being loved is normal, having kids is normal, traveling the world is normal, anything good is normal.why can’t i be normal? I feel like everyone else has found their way and figured out but I'm stuck on the road. I’ve ruined my life with many wrong decisions and mistakes so I don't blame anyone but I don't know what will happen if I don't find a way out. I'm a sociology graduate, but I don't think I'll do anything with this department because it's all nonsense. Especially in a third world country. I love writing and making music, i make music, release them on social platforms but it’s not getting there yet. I’m stuck. Either i will be successful or die trying. i am struggling to find my way and i’ve been suffered with depression so many years. i feel like being normal is the only answer.normal family, normal love, normal friendship, normal experiences, normal mentality, normal body, normal job, normal money, normal food, normal life…i have non of these.

I love writing and making music, i make music, release them on social platforms but it’s not getting there yet. I’m stuck. Either i will be successful or die trying.Let’s talk about the solution. My suggestion is “ignore the rest” method. You have to ignore and act like everything is normal. At some point it feels normal. Try to forget past & what happened.If you can’t manage the situation, you should manage the perception.Focus on your main success. Focus on your inner peace. I tried meditation. it gives me comfort. I would like to hear your suggestions.Do you use this term as in the actual meaning and if so, do people around you do this “unconciously” or in purpose? I’m new here and trying to figure out what’s been used for these situations.
    every relationship has one unfixable problem, how do you manage it?. if you feel like you’re really over it, quit. you won’t regret it. if OF is your only income, planning to quit can be a big motivator to rebuild your life and career in a different direction. plus with online content you can always come back and rebuild better than ever. i have quit various platforms over 3 years and every time i come back, i can always build to a good level. i was making good money at top 2% but i was so done. i worried how i’d get by in life without this income but when i tried to work i was paralyzed.i quit now and i’m so relieved.is to find a delusion you’re willing to accept. nothing matters. everything sucks. it’s all hopeless. most people get by on something they delude themselves into accepting with their whole heart. now to find that thing….is hard…. when OE, we know it’s best to do your job and not stand out, but what about when you mess up or worry about messing up? and how do you deal with the anxiety of being found out?even if you mess up hard enough to be fired from one J that still leaves you down one J and then you’ll have to go through interviewing again i just wanna not give (too much of) a fuck about work with OE. how can you feel whole when you know your other partner needs a whole other relationship and a whole other person besides you?even if you yourself have multiple relationships, the multiplicity of that level of deep romantic connection cheapens it. it makes it one of many not one of a kind. how can you build a life with two separate relationships? two houses? different sets of children? oh not to mention the children.i’ve tried the harney and sons and the yamamoto brand but i want to get even better ones. …asking for a friend. What brands or styles do you ladies wear for swimsuits? I’m new to bikinis but of the ones I’ve tried they seem to flatten my boobs, heavily padded, or were otherwise unflattering. Top + bottom combo advice would be super appreciated too :). I’m 20. I know that’s young but I feel pressure to complete my 20s be perfectly starting now because I know it’s such an important time in life. I don’t mean do it without making a mistake. I want to have the right mix of mistake, discovery and freedom with the right mix of stability and not ruining my life. Not too straight-edged but not too crazy. Society tells me that my 20s is THE time to do everything I want for my life’s bucket list because everything is more difficult when you’re older. But that can’t be all, right?.
    Therapy doesn't help anything when I'm just a bad, ugly, revolting person that is and always has been unlikable to everyone around me. I've been here too long and I'm just tired. I want to end myself so bad but don't even have the courage to do that right, so I'm stuck here with this awful life I was dealt, and I hate it so much.I find a strange amount of comfort in the therapist just being overwhelmed and being like, 'wow you really have gotten a bad deal in life.' It's so much more vindicating than people ignoring you or telling you to grow up.It's paid for by my work and I'm ready to give it another shot. Will it amount to anything after 30 plus years of misery and depression? No, probably not. But hey, it's gonna be amusing.In just a few days. Last time was not a good experience. Not at all. I don't trust therapists and feel like all they try to do is stick you on medications, and I really don't feel like anyone can do anything for me. But I'm so miserable and just can't live with it anymore to the extent that even I am giving those people another chance. I have nothing else to lose cause I have nothing. Having to exist like this in this world just isn't fair and I'm tired.Especially since I'm not of worth and have no right to receive that kindness. But there's one person at work who does so, and I suppose that makes her very kind to humor trash like me. Most don't even do that much. It makes me feel good inside for such a brief moment, even when I know it isn't real. It's still an act of kindness that really helps me through another difficult day.I've gotten so old. It's never gotten any better. No real proper human contact or relationships. It has done so much damage to my brain and development. And the worst part is knowing nothing will ever get better. I'm alone. And will die alone.And then I woke up. I really desperately wish I could have died and stayed there. I've been really upset about it all day at work today. I hate existing in this reality with every fiber of my being.I got terribly sick around my teen years so they feel obligated to support me no matter how years have passed. I failed at any attempts I made to better myself and have done absolutely nothing in my life. They expect nothing of me other than to exist which makes it even worse. I really need to die. I'm the lowest form of human trash that only hurts them by existing. I never should have been born and I want to end it.They just sit there. Don't say anything. And try to stick you on medications. Best scam job out there. Really good hustle. And the worst part is people actually pretend that they are some sort of magic wand to fix all of life's problems. 'Talk to a therapist.' Really? Ever tried one? Cause they're a joke.From the beginning, I tried to make friends. Nobody ever liked me. Never wanted to spend time with me or date me. I had a crap job so I went back to school. Got a bachelor's degree. Ended up right back ina grocery store cause no one likes me and won't hire me.I'm sick of it. I'm sick of working so hard only to never ever get anything in return. And what's more, get blamed for being a failure and called 'lazy' when I have overcome so much only to get nothing. I hate life. Hate being alive and just want it to end. And I've known it for decades now. I have nothing. Never had anyone. Never accomplished anything. Wasn't even born with good health. And have never known anything but unhappiness. The only reason I haven't been dead for ages by now is my mom. I'm just waiting for her to die first cause I can't do that to her. It's a miserable, horrible experience being alive. Being chained to this life by a single obligation. I hate it.Spent all my years in school being bullied and became socially and mentally stunted as a result. I feel like the lowest, most worthless piece of trash and I really don't want to go on anymore. I have no future and I'm tired of living a life only of loneliness, sadness, and bitterness.It was inflicted on me by the bullying and abuse I incurred growing up, after all. So some strange part of me loves what it feels like to hate everyone because I feel that's all they deserve for what I endured.My life is riddled with failure after failure. My attempts to turn things around have only lead to more failure. I'm alone. Never been in any relationships. No friends. I went back to school only to get a degree I could never do anything with and loan debt that has now ruined me. Now I just idle by with very bad health too and it's all for nothing. I'm so miserable and tired. I can't stop the downward spiral and it's only heading towards suicide.It's horrible. I hate being cursed with this miserable life that I never asked for. I have more reasons to die than to live but I can't do it. I'm such a loser that I can't even die right.No one has any trouble accepting that some people are just naturally loved and popular. But bring up that you're a person that people just naturally hate? Nope. It's not possible. According to what people tell me, despite having lived it for over 30 years and having been well aware people hated me since I was like three. I was contacted by a girl who used to pity friend me in school and tried to drag me to hang out with the same people who were still making fun of me ON HER Facebook page when I looked at it. I told her no. She kept telling me I should. I blocked her and never spoke to her again.Bullies may have ruined my life. And I'm a sad pitiful person with no future and have dark plans for myself. But they're a sad pitiful breed too. To go on about me years after the fact. You would think they have anything else to do.I've faced so many hardships in life. Born with bad health, bullied, no social life. Never had friends or relationships. I tried to better myself and go to school and get a bachelors degree and I did, but then it lead to nothing and I ended up right where I started. I feel so inferior to others that I feel it's a waste of their time to acknowledge or look at me. That I'm stealing air from others just by breathing. For decades I have felt that I have no right to live and it only grows worse anytime a person ever acknowledges I exist.Most know better and I get them. But every once in a while I get these bizarre people who actually talk to me like I'm worth something or even a human. It doesn't happen often, maybe once every five or so years, but it always just leaves me perplexed in the end.Everything is wrong with me. I don't have a single redeeming quality and I only hurt my parents who made the mistake of not throwing me in a river at birth. I hate being alive and I hate myself so much for my failures, inadequacies, and inability to even approach functioning like an actual human. Every day is just pure pain to be alive.Got a bachelor's degree many years ago that I never did anything with and just work minimum wage at a store. I hear all the time about these supposed jobs that hire people just cause they have a degree. Do these really exist? And if so, where on earth are they? Cause I job hunted for years before giving up just to make any sort of income.I had heard nightmare stories about this fight for years but wow. I have an easier time beating Ninja Gaiden than I do with this boss. I'm doing my best but there's just nothing I can do we he spams those kicks. This is absolutely nuts.It's so hard living knowing you'll never be good enough. Whether it be in jobs, friends, or relationships. I've never had any of those no matter how much I struggled, and now reality sets in that I've grown too old and it's simply too late. I'll never enjoy any of these things.Life was pointless and miserable for me. And it hurts so much knowing that.Everyday I hate it. I hate being in this world that I never had a place in and no one ever wanted me here. I hate it so much.I was so stunned by bullies as a child that I had to shut out the world and shut off my emotions just to protect myself. Then over the years, maybe because of so many people pretending to be nice to me just to turn around and bully me, I became emotionally dead inside and have forever been completely numb to anyone and everyone, whether they're 'nice' to me or not. Been waiting over 30 years now. Never got better. Not even for a minute did it ever get better. And I'm just tired of this life.My face. My personality. All of it. I hate myself so much it hurts.I was a happy once. When I was a young kid. I wasn't afraid to talk and socialize. But then I started to realize I had no friends. That people didn't like me. Even the teachers. And bullying started to pick up. By junior and high school, I was loathed by the entire student body and bullied by everyone imaginable. Even people who acted nice to me only did so as a bait to further mock me.The nice in me died. I stopped being able to interact. Couldn't look at people anymore. Didn't know how to speak. Then I got type 1 diabetes when I was 17 to make me even more miserable. Fast forward to my mid thirties, I got a bachelor's degree that I can't do anything with cause no one will give me a job because people just don't like me. I've never had friends. Never been on a date. I have no happy memories and no future to speak of. And it all started from when I was bullied and it spiraled downward from there.Bullying ruined my life, and it cant ever be fixed, and nothing will ever get better. I think a lot about ending it all. It's a cold, cruel, empty world for me. I see nothing but further pain in the future because that's all I ever knew.My face, my personality, the way I function, it's rotten to the core. I've never had friends or relationships. Never been liked or prioritized by anyone. I'll simply never know what a human relationship feels like and it hurts so much. I'm in my mid thirties and things only got worse and worse. Spent my whole childhood getting bullied to the extent that I never learned to function as a normal human. Have never had friends, a girlfriend. Got a bachelors degree that I never could use and work minimum wage at Walmart with student debt I can't pay.Everything is blank. I've never been happy. Life will never get better. I'm really at a loss.Nothing was ever right. I was bullied and laughed out through my whole childhood, so I never learned to develop and function as a normal human being. I got sick with type 1 diabetes as a teen, leading me to have to take five or six needles a day to live. I went to college in an effort to not be a loser, only to get a bachelors degree year and never get a job cause no one likes me. I work minimum wage now. In my mid thirties. Never had happy memories. Friends. Relationships. Time is ticking. I have no future in front of me. And I'm just tired of the struggle. It never gets better. It never has and it never will.There isn't anything good about me. Not a single thing. I'm a failure who works a dead end job with mountains of debt. I'm hideously ugly. Have a rotten personality. I'm terribly sick and have to live off multiple insulin injections a day. Everyone hates me on sight and wants nothing to do with me. Had no friends or relationships my entire life and am in my mid thirties. Have no past fun experiences or interesting things to say. No happy memories. Every day just hurts so much to live. I just want to die. There is absolutely no point in continuing.It doesn't happen very often. Maybe once every five or so years. But theres a girl I've spoken to at work and no matter what I do, I can't stop myself from liking her, and I despise it.All it does is make me think ridiculous and stupid things like maybe I should talk to her more or maybe she likes me, when that's completely impossible because I don't have a single redeeming quality as a person to the point that I don't consider myself human. And all it does in the end is just cause me pain.Liking someone is the worst and I hate it when it happens. I wish I could stop it.I'm tired of the guilt trip. Tired of living out of obligation and guilt over 'what it will do to others.' Literally everything that could have ever gone wrong in my life did, and I'm just expected to smile and deal with it and shut up. When I have no options left, am alone and have always been alone, and no future to speak of. Sick of it all.I was never able to get a job out of college and now work on minimum wage. Degrees were useless. Loan forgiveness was struck down. My debt just keeps plunging deeper and deeper. Everything just keeps getting worse and I feel that I'm on the verge of a breakdown. Going to college gained me nothing and only ruined my life. I just don't know what to do anymore.EDIT: thanks for the responses. But at this point it's all just pretty hopeless and I'm at a deadend. Just nothing worked out for me. We don't all live dream lives and I give up.
    I left work early the other day, stupid shitty day and my co worker stayed with me for a bit while i just vented about everything going on in my life. We had a couple drinks and now im spiraling.He called me the next day and said i “insinuated” that i want to be with him instead of my bf? i dont remember saying anything like that or meaning to and now im freaking out..I asked him what i said that made him think that and he just wouldnt tell me so now my OCD is going crazy obsessing over what it was. He said “it doesnt matter” so i said yes it does bc i feel like a cheater and my bf deserves to know.I just said to him that im sorry but thats not what i was trying to get at and i dont want that with him.. i told my bf about this and he’s being so relaxed about it saying he probably just took things the wrong way or something but im so afraid i said something stupid whether he just took it wrong or if i really did say something.. i was kinda drunk so i cant fully remember and i hate that.I dont want to be a cheater I feel like a garbage person and idk what to do. Not opposed to nights but im definitely getting the hell out of the shithole i work in.Moneys great but its sucked the remaining life out of me so its time to go even if it means 2 jobs again instead of one.Told myself id never go back to my old job but i might. I cant believe how toxic some jobs are. I used to get random energy bursts at night and get talkative, I used to go out and have friends.. i used to do things to improve life, i worked out.. things in my life were shit but they affect me more now than then.I was depressed but i was functioning. Now i lay in bed on my phone all day, i drink too much, barely make it to work but its the only form of normalcy i have anymorei cant maintain friendships, i dont know how im in a relationship when i suck the life out of everyone i care aboutIm a shell of who i used to be, i have nothing.I have no real hobbies, no sttention span or desire to entertain them, no energy.I feel numb, but so anxious and depressed and frustrated. Its been years. I have lost everyone i had, i push them away and i offer nothing to friendships anywaysMy meds dont help anymore at all, but i have no motivation to keep start over. I miss who i used to be, i didnt think it could get any worse than it was, but it has and eventually maybe ill actually end it all.. for now i am too numb to try. I just want my life back.I think its probably time to try something new. It really sucks because I have been on so many other types of medication and effexor did help me a lot in the beginningIve tried increasing, decreasing for tolerance then increasing and it only helps for a little whileI know my life circumstances dont help, no friends, shit job no distractions and whatnot but all i want is something to help me cope or give me energy to push through and make changes.Unfortunate and im not ready to start over again.My neighbours kept me up all day being loud as hell and idk, wasnt super tired when i got off work this morningIm gonna try and snag an hour nap but im afraid i wont wanna wake up if i do.How do i get through this shift other than coffee because i have adhd and it doesn’t keep me up..ritalin?? maybe?? BLAH. Man my familys fucked but i still wanna get them gifts but i also just want to save money so i can get the hell away from this job and take my exams for the degree i got.where i work has become so fucking insufferable. everyone warned me it wad a shit job but holy mother its toxic. ive never drank as much as i do now.why is capitalism!!!!!. I want to talk to my psychiatrist about it but I also feel like I shouldnt.. it feels forced if I do.It doesnt help that Ive only met him once (We get bounced around alot in ontario, especially when you bail on appointments or cant afford them anymore like me)I feel like such a toxic person to those I love and I hate that about myself and I want to get better. It seems like symptoms can be somewhat vague / vary so its hard for me to know.. especially when i have other conditions ive been diagnosed with that explain some symptoms like my ADHD, OCD, depression idunno.Maybe it doesnt matter but I want to get better..What made you get help ? How did you know you had BPD?thanks for any and all responses. I just want to be a better person and im so tired of being so sad, toxic and negative and nothing helping.im already such a depressed person but man these 12 hour shifts at this horrendous depressing factory make me want to die.I just want to sleep.Hope everyone has an alright or even better shift tonight and it goes by fast and smooth. Im gonna go cry in the shower while i get ready lol. I live in an apartment building and there is one tenant who is causing immense problems. She lies about people 1. Kicking her door when they walk by2. Hitting or punching her3. Messing with her laundry4. Abusing her dogsetc etc…She has made up lies about all of us, yelled at us all, posted inappropriate fb videos about peoples personal lives, her dogs have bit others dogs, plus they bark ALL day.She purposefully stares out her window all day to see who is outside then immediately comes oitside and screams at them accusing them of something. Including teenagers.She used to sit outside ALL day eith her dogs blocking the front door so no one else could get in with pets because hers are aggressive, thats the only thing the landlord has done.We have all written a letter to the landlord and signed it with our concerns, the police have been here 3x from us, more from her lying and accusing people falsely. Is there anything we can do to get this woman out of our building? She is making life miserable. None of us can even sit outside, take trash out or do laundry without her suddenly showing up and screaming at us for no reason. We have video proof of most encounters as my one neighbor just automatically records when she gets home because at this point there is almost always an altercation. Any advice appreciated. Tia!.

We are in Ontario. Kinda hate this shift, most of my co workers are cool and honestly in this economy its the only job that pays well enough. But man it’s lonely. I dont have friends really to begin with but ive spent all summer alone or at work. Just finished up my 3 day weekend and i work 12’s so the whole weekend is a write off anyways. 2 days off, one for recovery the other for chores and then i go back. I try to get up at 3 ish on my days off so i can function but meh I never have plans anyways or the energy to try to make any so i just sleep more lol. Anyone wanna be friends ? I have 3 really cute cats I can send pictures of and Id love some friends to game with or whatever you are into :)Large bonus if youre in the same time zone as me im in ontario!!!!(pls do not be flirtatious even tho i am socially inept i somehow have a lovely boyfriend lol). on hour 28 of 36 this weekend. sooooo fucking exhausted. send help. Im in ontario, and my mom is basically refusing / in denial about her condition. She has multiple health conditions and is a chain smoker. Ive already lost my father almost the exact same way so it hurts more.My moms leg is swollen teice the size of tbe other and goes red, she has bad circulation already and had blood clots last february so im concerned its that again.. but she js refusing to let me take her to emergency and hasnt called her doctor for an appointment.. is it insane of me to ask if i can call her doctor because im concerned ? I dont know what else to do she wont listen to me and is acting like its fine but it’s absolutely not. I dont know what the fuck to do but i dont want to lose her, its been hard enough to get her to consider a new job that isnt going to destroy her body further. Seriously is it insane to call her doctor because im concerned? i know i cant force her but maybe she would listen to him if she wont listen to my brother and i.i’ve realized how much of a loser hermit i am, officially..I wanna go do stuff but i dont even have friends, and i also just dont really want to do anything at the same time.I work 6-6 in a hot ass factory, where we can barely take breaks and its insane tonight.Im so shaky and i feel so nauseas and fuck you can only drink so much water before that makes you feel sick too. I want to go home and snuggle my cats in my cold room lol..hows your night going friends ?. I love seeing posts on social media promoting “normal” bodies, i love seeing women love themselves but i just wish i looked like them but instead I get told to eat more and that i look like a child or sick. I dont want to look like this, i dont want anyone to want to look like me, i want everyone to feel beautiful as they are, but my flat rectangle curveless, 95lb body will never make me feel beautiful and im tired of trying to gain weight that never sticks. Promoting skinny bodies is now seen as shaming fat or curvy people, but skinny isnt the “beauty standard”.. i look like a fucking sick child. I want to see posts promoting ALL bodies.. not to shame others, just so i can feel less alone without feeling like im an asshole for wanting to see my body type too.. I just want to look like them, I want to love myself but i cant. I feel disgusted.I dont have many friends, which i guess makes this shift fine for me, I work 4/5 12’s a week and get off at 6am,My cousin wanted to go to the beach yesterday and I was hoping id get up by 12 to go with her but I didnt get to sleep till 9 and couldnt wake up in time, I felt so horrible because I can never really see her, our work schedules are hard because she works two jobs and I work nights. I dont get out much but it really sucks when im too exhausted and dont even look forward to it because of how tired I am, Usually I try to do things in the afternoon since I typically get up at 3/4pm for work anyways but thats not always ideal for others especially if they just worked all day. On the bright side, after a month and a bit of doing this shift, my body is finally adjusting to being awake all night but it sure feels a lot more lonely than being awake all day.i hang on so desperately to people i do have, regardless of how shit things are because i have such shit social skills and no clue how to make friends.im always the odd one out and get replaced. i feel like any friends i make get bored of me so fast, and we click online but meet in person and then hear less and less from them over time. I hate being such a loser. i just want friends who like me, and ive been such a hermit i dont even know where to start and ive lost any skills i may have had. im an introvert but i used to not want to be alone so much. its so weird, but maybe its because i just adjusted to being alone. ugh.
    Yea I know, but what does that have to do with me?Honestly I just want a response to give them some sense without me leaving the impression that I'm some weak, pathetic, whiny and lazy dude. It's infuriating to be labelled that when you've kept it together and gotten better without bothering anyone for years or made it your whole personality.How did it happen? What were the both of you doing before getting into the relationship?Was it hard maintaining it?How did you love each other so well that it stayed after all this time?. It's been a mess saken lately.A relationship of 2 years full of promise abruptly ended. There was nothing in between our relationship except for our own personal problems eh.I had this full committment na palagi akong andito sa kanya especially when she's having problems and a crisis with herself.We had a lot in common, our mindsets our perspectives. She struggle with herself but I was the one to lift her up and pull her out of it. When I wholeheartedly accepted who she was and promised to always call her out upfront whenever there's a trait I don't like about her so that she doesn't get devoured by thoughts.I stayed and pick and sorted her thoughts out which was why I understood her. I've gone through the phase she's going through during those days na sobrang bigat para sa kanya. Over time she got better and life became livelier and more open para sa aming dalawa.We still had battles but we always promised to resolve it. Always promised to stay with each other but it was mostly me who initiated and exhausted my whole being but I never felt the exhaustion if it was the woman I love.Why? Because I had thought I had died a couple of years ago, not literally but in a sense I've lost all reason, emotion and hope for my life. She gave me that hope again, she gave me life. I thought I'd just help her as a friend because of empathy but I fell in love because of her personality and amazing traits.Long story short, I struggled with my lowest mental place just days ago and there was nothing wrong with us. I kept out communication and there was no problem at all. For me, it was an all-out existential crisisNanalo siya sa contest nila and I wasn't able to respond quickly. Sinabi niya na to watch the video of the rewarding ceremony but I said I was "busy", in reality I was trying to keep myself from completely falling apart. I had to calm myself down and I didn't want her to think na I'm ignoring her.So after we talked about her victory, I could tell na medyo hindi siya masaya. And so I opened up sa nangyayari saken. I tried my hardest to save myself so that we can become better as a couple but she said na I pushed her away and I was independent when in reality it was me distancing my problems for her while she was at her busiest and that my mental well-being depended on her and on us.I was the exact opposite of what she told me I was. Na I never change and I never included her in my life.After a while of reassuring her and talking like my usual self and did my hardest to make her understand and that I regret what I did when I invalidated her and that I'd never intentionally do something stupid to ever hurt her and that I wanted to keep her safe and care and love for her. She says na she's letting me go?What the fuck man. It was me who gave my all to get you through your problems and helped you in your lowest because I love you with all my life and now that it's me who genuinely regrets and still genuinely loves her and understands her that she said those stuff out of spite, it's as if she just casually discards me.I stood by her when we both had nothing.But now that she was at her high place and I was at my lowest, she discards me. I feel betrayed, used, drained, ignored, and never actually heard and understood.There's more to this which is why it's damn heavy for me. Na para bang walang nangyari sa amin hahaha. Na parang pampalipas oras lang tas ngayon na di na ako convenient para sa kanya ganun nalang kadaling tinataboy ket kitang kita niya na ginagawa ko lahat para sa aming dalawa. Na I was willing to surrender myself to us but she never actually did so hahaha.So ayun, since it was a promising, healthy relationship. None of my friends and family know this. I'll wait for the right time to breakdown in front of them. Just right now.I have felt no life from acads, no aspirations, purpose and passion. Hindi ako nakakapag-study.It was alright if I was at home all day kaso it's dreadful dito sa room na walang ginagawa eh.How do I find peace? How do I remain strong at times where it's just unbearable?I need your help, faceless people of the internet, now that the person I dedicated my soul with has discarded me like I was nothing.I'm currently in Grade 12 STEM. I'll just be direct. I grew up losing interest on things eventually eh. I lost my passion and now I don't have much hobbies other than killing time through playing video games.With High Honors ako nung Grade 11 but I don't think na I'll make it ngayon sa Grade 12, ahahaha. And I don't have any aspirations in a profession. Like wala talaga. Basta ang end goal is to be RICH!As empty and unfulfilling life is, I certainly don't want to be poor because then I'd make my life even shittier. So, when you had a time in your life na di mo talaga alam kung anong college course ang piliin, tas ngayon na nasa college kana.What's your course and what made you decide to settle on that decision?. What are my options to earn money while on college? A scholarship? A business? A job?I'm genuinely wondering, perhaps I'd be able to do some of those things while I'm still in high school and earn money.Our family isn't rich and I don't want to be a burden. Heck I barely even ask for anything because I'm always concerned about our financial status. My mom doesn't have a job, she's always busy at church, it's only my brother who sends our monthly allotment, as for my Father, he doesn't support me financially.I'm still in Senior High School, a Grade 12 STEM student so I'll be going into college next year. The thing is, I don't know what course I should be taking simply because I don't have interest in anything. I have no hobbies too, well I used to have but I simply lost interest and passion over time.So basically I'm a depressed kid, empty, lost, numb. This post isn't me opening up but just asking advice in what career path I should get for the goal of being financially stable perhaps even rich, just so that I don't suffer more from being poor.I don't want to end up wasting my life away in college because it's depressing and would just make my life even more meaningless. I don't have any kind of passion or interest at any job or profession in the world. I actually haven't felt passion or interest for the past years actually. So I literally have no idea what the hell to pursue in college or if I even should go to college let alone what I should do in life. Apart from just wanting to have a financially free and stable life, there's nothing else I am looking forward to.As empty and as meaningless I feel as a person, I certainly don't want to dig an even deeper hole for myself by suffering from being poor.What should I do? I badly need advice.It's as if I never had a life or hobby back then. I just forgot everything as if I never existed. Ironically, as I am right now, I'm just existing and not actually living.
    I heard a lot about this movie. It's a movie with Willem Dafoe in the titular role. Is it worth watching?. Are there any views that modern day followers of Judaism do not agree with? Are there some perspectives from the Torah that have been altered due to more information on a certain topic? Likewise, are there views from the Torah that became even more relevant as time went on?If this question sounded a bit harsh or offensive, let me know.For context: I grew up in a location where it was believed that God gave men and women very specific roles that encompass everything from hair and clothing to lifestyle choices and personality traits.What is the general viewpoint on someone who is a masculine woman or a feminine man (for the sake of this question, men who are housekeepers and women who are career-focused also count)? Is it frowned upon or does it only apply to Orthodox churches with harsher regulations on the matter? Does the take on cross-gendered clothing still apply (even if it is sewn specifically for the opposite sex) or is it as overlooked as the Leviticus take on tattoos due to the context of this verse?Also, slightly unrelated, but how are families where neither the husband nor the wife want to have kids? Is it viewed as ungodly or perfectly normal as long as they do not engage in intercourse for the sake of lust?. Is it perceived as a mental disorder one has no control over (i.e. cases of chemical imbalance) or is it viewed as the same type of sin as wrath, greed and lust?. I want to find out what the perspective is on the matter. Suppose, there are parents similar to Joseph Jackson (MJ's deceased father) or Jeanette McCurdy's mother. What is the take on such cases, considering (correct me if I'm wrong on this one) "Honor thy father and thy mother" is one of the Ten Commandments?. I feel like this is a very rare position, as when it comes to other people, I don't mind them being gay at all. But when it comes to myself, I have a different stance. Am I alone in this?. Is English some kind of an insanely complicated language? Do they think that us foreigners don't have internet connection? Do they not realize that most social media content is most likely in English, hence, there will be more people here?. I know that Stockholm syndrome is a common issue, but I noticed I have a different perception of what happened to me (verbal abuse) than someone would have had with racist or sexist parents. Why is that possible? Is it because my family thought they were protecting me, which is why it's harder for me to call it out?. I was a normal girl before I found out about all of this. I was just tomboyish, but no more than that. If my family finds out, they'll go nuts, and I don't blame them. If I were into people incapable of consent, they would have had any right to call me out and stop me before I hurt anyone. So how is homosexuality any different? If I'm out, my life is over. Why are people so obsessed with affirming me and this stuff in general? I can't see a therapist, I'll lose my family. Wouldn't it make more sense to resist these desires and at least be celibate?. So, lately, I'm starting to think that I'm to blame for my parents being angry at me over the gay stuff. I genuinely start to believe that if I hadn't watched that lesbian melodrama at 17, I would have been normal by now. Does anyone else experience guilt over being born as something they didn't choose to be?. I have known about my parents' attitudes regarding the matter since I was twelve. Finding out I was gay used to be my worst fear and it came true. To top it off, my father (my mom would play along and would sometimes say lesbophobic stuff) used to yell at me for hours on some occasions over this shit (since I started wearing unisex at 16). He even said something so hurtful, I cannot even quote it word for word.It stopped when I was 23-24, but the damage is done. I used to think I was bi, but then I fell in love with a girl 4 years older than me (it was my other worst fear) and I realized that I can only see guys as friends. I feel guilty about finding out. I wish I never did. I wish I never watched that lesbian movie, never spent hours on LGBT related Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram accounts. I feel like I am to blame and I still think that if I hadn't found out about gay people being a thing as a minor, I would have still been normal. I'm starting to believe that it wasn't actually abuse, that they are actually right. I'm starting to see myself as the one to blame for what happened.I get flashbacks to these arguments, but also I barely remember myself at the ages from 17 to 23. Even the smallest thing, whether it be a discussion about a future husband or another parental lesson on life, becomes a trigger. I want nothing to do with all of this. I want to be married to a man and to have a semblance of a normal life, so that I could finally be left alone. I'm even willing to LOOK normal for this purpose. I would do anything for this torment to stop. I've been dealing with fits of depression since I was 17 because of all this (had a hiatus at 23 and then everything went to shit again). I'm so hurt, but I'm also starting to see myself as the perpetrator of my own problems. I'd give up anything to be left alone. I lament the fact that being gay is as inherent (though that part is indeed underresearched) as race or eye color, because if there was an opportunity to change it, I would have used it.I even fear that I'll project my internalized homophobia onto my future children, because I unironically started to believe that if I hadn't found out about this, I would have still liked guys. I just hate this and want to be left alone. I can't take it anymore.Edit: I can't go to therapy because affirming gay people or being neutral on the subject is illegal. I can't move to another country, either.As a teenager, I received a ton of homophobic crap and on some occasions, my father would yell at me over it for hours. Understandably, this affected my mental health quite negatively. Now I'm an adult and it turned out I wasn't bi, but actually exclusively into women, thus, I'm in a harder position than I was in my late teens. I know it's wrong to feel that way, but I definitely struggle with the fact that I live up to the statement "Hurt people hurt people". Since I cannot express WHY I still deal with distress, anger and frustration, I'm sometimes guilty of being rude. How do I cope with this grudge without being vengeful? I know it's wrong to do and I just need to find a way out of this.For context: I'm a masculine woman in her mid 20s who has been single her entire life. I started liking unisex at 16 and would look more masculine than my female peers during college. Me looking that way used to have my family start arguments over it, asking me if I'm gay or not and acting as though I killed someone without regret. I cannot move out and I can't get a therapist because it's illegal to talk about gay people in any way other than negative. I don't support stereotyping and recognize that femmes are a thing, but given my circumstances, I have to recognize that most people (my family included) do think all lesbians are masculine.I don't know if it was a dumb step, but I said that most guys wouldn't like me anyway. They interpreted it as me being insecure when I actually said it both as a fact and because I wanted to maintain the "I'm straight" nonsense. Since then, the topic of husbands and boyfriends gets brought up in occasional statements, like "guys will like you if you're more fashionable" and I genuinely don't know how to react. I recognize that the older I am, the weirder me being single looks and saying stuff like "mind your business" or "I don't care about dating anymore" will sound weird coming out of my mouth and even suspicious, as though I have something to hide (which I do, because I'm closeted). Is it just my fear talking that they're gonna find out soon and I'm delaying the inevitable? If you experienced something similar, how did you cope and act in this situation? Looking forward to some responses, bc, honestly, IDK what to do and the fear of them finding out is driving me nuts.So, recently, I watched this movie (directed by Ryan Murphy) and would like to know y'all's thoughts on it. Personally, while the stories of the interviewees were sad (when they talked about the times when they pretended to be ex-gay), it made me feel better about myself as a closeted lesbian. What do you guys think?&#x200B;. I hate how people infantilize individuals who are older than 25. People have talked about Evans' gf/wife as if she's some teenager and not a grown woman. I'd get the outrage if she was 18-21, because this IS extremely young, but since she's 26, they're taking it too far. I'm into 30-35 year olds and I'm in my mid 20s. Why should her relationship and my preference be treated the same way as actual cases of grown adults dating minors? Arguments like this erase victims of relationships that actually ARE messed up.I've been noticing the use of "sexuality is fluid" and it's starting to make me cringe. If it applies to the person saying it, cool, let it be so. But I don't like it when this opinion is propagated in general, without an understanding that straight and gay people are still a thing. I get that the goal of this statement is inclusivity, but this is one of the cases when something does more harm than good. To me, such a saying is no different from telling me that I "haven't found the right man yet" or that I'm "going through a phase". The people saying it should at least apply it on a case by case basis instead of making a progressive version of conversion therapy rhetoric. Even if their goal is not to erase anybody, I certainly feel erased and, perhaps, I'm not alone here. Whenever I see this phrase, I read "You're gonna change your mind" or "Don't limit yourself". No, no, no. Some people are exclusively attracted to a certain gender. I want this phrase to be used depending on the individual, not in the broad sense.Edit: if it wasn't used towards gay people and even some straight people, I wouldn't have been so worried. Except it is. I don't want this thought to be applied to everyone, same with the cringey "everyone is a bit bi" statement.Side X has definitely been the subject of controversy. Is their stance on the matter really anti Christian?What are your views on the people who think they must destroy their same sex attraction, too, as they view it as sinful as acting out on it?. While I have been told that there are some sins that people are more lenient towards due to historical context (tattoos being one of them), how did you approach the same attitude regarding homosexuality? What is your reasoning behind this opinion? Do you believe that homosexuality being listed as a sin is actually a mistranslation that was meant to imply pedophilia and/or infidelity with someone of the same sex? Or do you think of it as merely being a product of its time, as there was no concept of sexual orientation as something that is innate, let alone an idea of a non-heterosexual consenting relationship (two men or two women)? How do you deal with the passages regarding intercourse and marriage?. Disclaimer: I am asking this question out of theological curiosity, it has nothing to do with me personally. Regarding suicide, I'm talking about cases caused by mental disorders.I heard that depression and suicide are sinful because one needs to avoid falling into the former. Meanwhile, the latter goes in direct violation of God giving you life and you needing to cherish it. The depictions seem to imply that it is the person's fault that they succumbed to this. What are the attitudes like nowadays? Is there a belief that suicide and depression are all the result of Satan and demons clouding the individual's judgement? Or is it still on the individual's conscience, even if they pray every day and have been diagnosed with depression or a similar disorder?. If it's A, does it mean that a Christian is expected to repent, say, eating shellfish or engaging in a role traditionally meant for the opposite sex the same way one would repent lying and adultery? Likewise, if they follow a lukewarm path (i.e., "I acknowledge I sinned, but I cannot/will not repent?"), are they going to face obstacles regarding God allowing them to go to Heaven?If it's B, then what are the justifications for some sins mattering less than others? How would wearing mixed fabrics or following a role meant for the opposite sex be more forgivable than lying? Is it fair to state that some sins are heavily reliant on environmental and historical context, while others aren't?. My family doesn't approve of having a gay daughter and due to my fear of losing them (my father isn't young and my mom experienced being comatose for a week and recovered), I am starting to believe that I shouldn't affirm myself and that my tendencies are wrong. I'm experiencing thoughts of wanting to marry a man while being open about there being no attraction whatsoever, even though I know it isn't the right thing to do. What are some ways of overcoming this crippling self hate, as it is ruining my life and my mental state?Note that pro gay affirming therapy is illegal in my location and if I confess that stuff to a therapist, I will be taken to conversion therapy. It applies to the entire country and I currently do not (and will not have for at least a few years) the finances to leave.Disclaimer: I know that what I'm about to say may sound controversial, but I'd like to clarify that these are beliefs that I have regarding MYSELF. What others do in this situation (being gay while being or not being Christian) doesn't make much of a difference for me. I do not support conversion therapy as I find it very harmful, nor am I allowed to condone harmful practices like this.So, basically, my stance is that it is highly disrespectful of me to join Christianity due to myself liking women and here's why:The Bible is very clear of what its perspective is on homosexuality. It didn't say "you can just be celibate and gay, it's perfectly fine", there's literally a verse that says that homosexuals "will not inherit the kingdom of God". While divorce can be repented and a person can find oneself in a more stable relationship and one can easily confess to having been a thief and not doing it, the same does not apply to homosexuality. The thoughts will still be there, just like straight people will still be attracted to the opposite sex. So even if I were to NOT act out on it, the answer is still "no". To me it is like trying to attend an event where I'm blacklisted and the owner of the venue has made it EXPLICITLY clear that they do not want me there (even if I may find their reason for it as absurd). I will not try to break into the building to attend this event, I will not come crying to the owner about it, I'll simply turn around and leave them alone. I know it's a bit weird to compare a religion to a venue where an owner is entitled to their rules, but that's kinda what it would look like for me. So, what are your thoughts on this stance?&#x200B;PS: I can delete the post if it's too much. I apologize in advance if it is.I saw one youtuber who is very knowledgeable in the bible and all this stuff. This person seems to be a very old school Christian who talked tons of times about how aliens are demonic and how homosexuality was wrong. However, whenever they were confronted about STILL getting tatted (they intend on getting a "sleeve"), they were like "oh, it's not the real me, I wanna be true to myself". Isn't it kinda hypocritical from your perspective, given this person is a conservative Christian?Another youtuber talked about how her aunt was so modest and feminine that she never saw said aunt wearing pants or her knees. But when she talked about herself wearing unisex/masculine clothing, she went out of her way to say that it was just the way she was. Isn't it kinda off-limits in Christianity, too?Just wanted to read your thoughts, personally I do not care bc I'm not Christian.Addressing this to my parents bc I'm so hurt and even though I know they'll never read it.I'm sorry for everything. I know you think it's wrong. I know you think I should be married to a man in the future and I respect it. I know you disagree with me liking women and I apologize. I have always been a disobedient kid and now, as an adult, I'm making this huge mistake. I recognize you'll never forgive this. You have boundaries and lines that cannot be crossed. And I did. I know that I'm not harming anyone, but I guess it's time to realize that adults make mistakes, too. Adults are also capable of consenting to things that are bad. And I'll do my best to respect your wishes even though I feel like a mistake every time I realize I'm not genuinely attracted to men. Ultimately, if this made you so angry over it that you used to yell at me for hours on multiple occasions, you may have a point. I wish you had aborted me so that you wouldn't have had to put this mistake out into this world and tried again, hopefully, having created a normal kid. But what's done is done. I fell in love once. She is the best person I've ever met. It felt amazing. But I guess I should do what teens do when they become adults and leave my harmful interests behind. I promise I'll make you happy with a decent son in law and at least listen to you in this one case.Disclaimer: I'm not Christian, but I figured I'd be able to speak up about it here, as other subs won't take it lightly.I was one of those children who you knew would grow up to be gay. When my family started suspecting, they'd yell at me for hours. It sent me down a mental spiral. But now that I think of it, it isn't abuse. Abuse would have been an appropriate term if I were treated poorly for being a woman, which is not the case. My family wanted to steer me away from doing something bad, which I didn't understand then. I do agree they shouldn't have reacted this way, but when I picture a more violent/delinquent situation (e.g. me assaulting or intentionally harming animals), their reaction makes more sense. I may be delusional, but I do wish I could have been able to discuss this struggle with them the same way one could turn to their parents if they were raped or bullied. I have come to the conclusion that I do not intend to act out on these desires. My family matters more to me than this wish. I recognize I will never be able to love men the same way I'd love women. But I also recognize that they do not approve of it, so I must listen. People have said "oh, you're an adult" and "you're not harming anyone by doing this". It's true, but if this matter made them angry enough to have yelled at me for hours on multiple occasions, they most likely have a valid reason to hold this viewpoint. Adults are capable of consenting to things that are wrong, so I do not see myself as a valid authority on my wishes. My family wouldn't have let me drink till I'm wasted and acting up, so how is same sex attraction any different in this regard?. Before I begin, I understand that it is a triggering topic and you don't have to answer this question.Does anyone experience harsh internalized homophobia not only due to liking women, but also due to being and looking masculine? I noticed my internalized homophobia goes nuts whenever I get haircuts or look masculine because my bigoted family used to constantly ask me if I'm gay (in a negative way) and go on rants till they were too tired to talk about it. Did any one of you have this experience? If yes, how did you overcome it? Keep in mind that I cannot go to therapy bc the only therapy that exists for gay ppl in my location is conversion therapy and it goes without saying why I think I shouldn't do it.PS, friendly reminder that you're not obligated to respond to this post as it is a very sensitive topic, which I hate talking about as well.I'm curious to read some opinions. Personally, I feel sorry for them. They're putting their spouses' lives in jeopardy when said spouses could have married someone who genuinely likes them. Long story short, homophobic family that is ok with gay people as long as it's not their kid. Been lectured and yelled at for HOURS whenever they assumed I was gay, as if I killed a kid or had beaten someone up. Used to think I was bi, but I realized I only like women after falling in love with one.Now I hate myself for liking women. I feel like I'm betraying my family both in regards to my career and my attraction to women. I'm also tomboyish, so I live up to the stereotype. I get thoughts of converting myself, though I know that my mental health will deteriorate if I do it. However, whenever I'm more clear minded, I feel betrayed. I was 17 when I found out about it. Instead of calmly talking to me, they yelled as though I killed someone in cold blood. I needed help and support and instead ended up trusting people online more than I trust my family. It just sucks so much and idk what to do.I genuinely don't understand why fellow gay people stay in Christianity, while going out of their way to find loopholes in it. I'm sorry, but this religion was never okay with people like myself, and the only stretch you could apply so far is that the Bible focuses more on gay men than lesbians. Even then, many Christians don't condone lesbian relationships, either. Like, wouldn't it be better to either find another religion that doesn't perceive gay people as individuals who went down "the wrong path" or just quit Christianity altogether? I just don't get how some people stay in Christianity despite this religion being EXPLICITLY opposed to who they are.Edit: seriously, what's the point of being gay and taking part in a homophobic religion?. I'm just tired. I do not have the energy to fight for myself. I only feel guilty for being exclusively attracted to women. I know that performing self-inflicted "conversion therapy" will make me feel worse, but I am exhausted. I've been fighting for my confidence and self-esteem regarding the matter for many years, but my battery is dead. I have heard a ton of negative shit about lesbians from my family for nearly a decade and knowing it applied to me makes me feel so much pain. I get flashbacks to these arguments and I'm losing my mind. I feel bad when I'm being myself, but rationally, I also recognize that things will get worse if I try to make myself straight. I'm just stuck.Has anyone ever been in such a situation?. Trigger warning: mentions of suicidal ideationLong story short, my family was one of these "we're fine with gay people as long as it's not our kid". The first time my father heard of lgbt teens, he was like "thank heavens you're not one of them". Then, at 16-17, I started getting into unisex fashion (I was more alternative, though, and still am). I found out I liked girls at 17. But whenever my family assumed I was gay, they'd argue with me FOR HOURS as though I killed a pregnant dog or killed someone in cold blood. Mostly my father, though, but my mom would play along. My worst fears were finding out I'm actually gay (I used to think I was bi) and falling in love with a girl. Both happened last year.And, tbh... I'm tired. I've gotten to the point where I lack the energy to fight against this hate. They haven't said a damn thing since my uni graduation (I'm in my mid 20s), but the aftermath is still there. At times I catch myself having thoughts like "why can I have my own values and they can't?" and "I can just marry a man, I don't have to sleep with him all the time". I feel guilty for liking women because my family never argued with me unless it was something actually bad (me failing algebra at one point, for example). I notice that I'm starting to gaslight myself into trying to stop being gay, even though I recognize that this will make me feel worse and push me to suicide. However, by letting myself be who I am, I came to the point where I do not feel any better. I used to be very disobedient as a child and a teenager, so this also contributes to my guilt regarding the matter.I was never SAd or anything of that sort and I do not hate men. I'm just not sexually attracted to them (I don't feel anything romantically, either). I can acknowledge if someone looks attractive (like Hayden Christensen or Tseng Jinghua), but that's about it. However, picturing the guys I find attractive as masculine women is a completely different thing. To top it off, I'm also tomboyish, which contributed to the arguments I had in the first place. So in theory, if I were to repress my identity, I would have had to change my appearance, too. I don't know what to do and this guilt is killing me inside. I cannot access any therapist at all bc once I tell any therapist or psychiatrist that I'm gay, I'll immediately be offered conversion therapy, and given how fragile my mental state is, if someone tries hard enough, I might actually consent to this heinous practice. I'm just stuck and hurt.Long story short, my family is one of these "we don't care if other people are gay, as long as it's not our kid". The first time my family found out about LGBT teens, my father was like "thank god you're not one of them". Since then, I've been hearing a ton of fucked up things. When they started suspecting, they (mostly my father, my mom would play along) would yell for HOURS till both sides got too tired. I'm also tomboyish, which would be another reason why I get this stuff in the first place. I found out I liked girls at 17 (had signs as early as 5), thought I was bi till last year (I'm in my mid twenties).Being gay and falling in love with a girl were my worst fears. They happened nonetheless. However, after years of fighting, I'm tired. I want to stop being gay. I want to stop liking women and start liking men. I've been checking out videos of self proclaimed "ex gay" people, and while I know it's not really a thing, I wish I could follow suit. I'm starting to believe that my family is right. They never argued with me unless the situation called for it. They're even fine with me still searching for a job. But homosexuality has had them get so angry that they'd tell at me for hours as if I killed someone or got expelled. I do not have the energy to argue and I don't know what I'll do if it happens again. I get flashbacks to past arguments and it's taking a toll on my mental health. I know that trying to repress my attraction to women will make it worse, but I feel too guilty and exhausted. I don't know what to do.I know conversion therapy doesn't work. I recognize deep down that trying to change will drive me to suicide. But I don't want to be my true self, either. I get flashbacks to what I heard as a teenager and I'm in so much pain. All of the lesbophobic shit I heard applies to me. When I thought I was bi, I hoped I'd marry a man so that I'd never act out on my other preference. Unfortunately, it turns out I'm not attracted to men at all. I feel disgusted at the thought of sleeping with a man or interacting with their parts. Kissing one will feel like a chore.At times I try to convince myself that I can change. That I can look more feminine (I live up to the stereotype that lesbians are tomboys), marry a man and have kids. But to some extent I recognize I'll end up either killing myself or devastating my fake husband once I come out to him. I never wanted any of this. I want to have a good relationship with my family. I don't want to lose them over it. At times I wonder why I'm allowed to have values and they aren't. They don't want me to be attracted to the same sex. So why can't I stop being so selfish? The worst part is, if I do kill myself, they'll probably think I was motivated to do it bc of people on social media (I'm in my mid 20s, so this already sounds nonsensical). I'm so hurt over everything and just wish I was dead. I'm so devastated by the fact that I like women that I'd rather be dead than gay.I'm struggling a lot latelyI do not have suicidal ideation, but I do have thoughts like "I wish I was aborted" or "I wish I was murdered". I found out I wasn't bi, but actually a lesbian last year. I fell in love (albeit, unrequitedly) and it was the best feeling ever. Unfortunately, internalized homophobia is so engraved in my mind that I go out of my way to justify it. I have thoughts like "if I can have a moral compass of what I find and do not find acceptable, why can't they?" and "I wish I was aborted". I used to hear so much shit about it FOR YEARS that I feel nothing but hate and resentment for myself liking women. I would have given up anything to be able to remove this attraction and like guys, but I know it is impossible. It makes me feel like a burden, even though I know I have friends who love and support me more than anyone. I don't want to lose my family over it, so sometimes I wish I could just marry a man and keep them in my life.I still remember the first time my family suspected I was gay. They (mostly, my father, my mother just played along and went for the good old "all lesbian couples are butch x femme") reacted as though I did something atrocious. Understandably, this would later happen on some occasions, but this first time was just the absolute worst. I'm just so tired of everything.I grew up in a homophobic family (the "we don't care if someone is gay as long as it's not our kid" types). And long story short, I avoided this topic till one day I realized I was gay and this made me struggle with self-hate for a very significant amount of time.I will admit, I still feel guilty about liking women instead of men. The fear of losing my family over this makes me gaslight myself into believing that they may have a point. But there's a part of me that understands that I need to feel sorry about the way I treat myself, not about who I am attracted to. I will try my hardest to stop hating myself. While, usually, the best option in my situation is getting therapy from a gay friendly psychotherapist, I do not have this option because there aren't any (I'm not gonna disclose where I live, please, respect it). I will try my best to understand that me liking women doesn't harm anyone and at least find a way to treat myself with compassion instead of unknowingly pushing myself past a breaking point.If anyone of the people reading this has experienced something similar, I'm looking forward to reading about your experiences and advice on the matter.
    Jag började på folkhögskola nu för ett par månader sen. Inte för att jag behövde läsa upp gymnasiebetyg eller så, utan tanken var att jag skulle försöka skaffa vänner och ta mig ur min depression och sociala fobi. Jag ville vara frisk och glad innan jag började plugga på universitet.Nu har det inte gått så bra med detta och jag funderar på att avbryta studierna i förtid och istället börja på universitet till våren - fortfarande deprimerad. Det känns omöjligt att må bättre så det är väl lika bra att inte slösa tid och pengar på folkis. Samtidigt är jag orolig för att jag inte kommer klara universitetsstudierna för att jag mår så dåligt.Jag vet inte om mitt studiebidrag också kommer dras in och om jag ens kommer få söka nytt igen eftersom jag redan har intygat att jag skulle läsa här i ett år. Jag kommer också behöva betala tre månaders hyra för mitt korridorsrum på skolan om jag slutar tidigt.Finns det någon annan här som har varit i en liknande situation eller har några goda råd?. For a couple minutes today as I was waking up I think I actually felt happy. It was like my thoughts were clear instead of foggy, bright instead of barely visible. I was able to wake and sit up almost immediately. It felt amazing and it makes me envious of other people who are happy, like I was shown what humans are capable of feeling, but I am not.The moment was however over quickly, like my brain suddenly remembered *"oh right, I'm depressed"* and I was back to normal again. This happened another time a year ago. That time I was just standing in the kitchen and it felt like this cloud was lifted from me.As an assignment for the public speaking class I'm taking, we're supposed to teach the class a practical skill. I decided I'm going to teach them how to shuffle a deck of cards. More precisely, the riffle and bridge shuffle. I believe it's how magicians and casino staff often shuffle cards. It looks really cool.I knew how to do it before, but just barely. I did it very bad and awkwardly. Cards would go flying, and well - the deck wouldn't even shuffle that well lol. But now, after a few days of practicing and hundreds of decks shuffled later, I have to say I'm getting pretty good. I don't even need a table and I do it really fast!Seeing yourself slowly get better and better is a satisfying feeling, it's almost addictive. I can sit for hours just listening to music and shuffling my cards.Anyway I hope my nerves won't fail on me next week when we're holding our speeches. Doing it alone in your room is one thing, but in front of a crowd... At the same time I'm for once actually excited for my upcoming speech, I kind of want to show off my skills.Edit: I’m also wondering how many of you guys know how to shuffle cards this way already. Would be good to know if it’s common knowledge before my speech.As an assignment for a public speaking class I'm taking, we're supposed to teach the class a practical skill.

I spend every waking moment (except school) watching youtube, netflix, twitch, reddit etc. and it’s gotten to the point where I feel like I’ve already seen everything. Nothings interests me anymore. I have squeezed out every single drop of entertainment I could have gotten.I want to replace my bad habit with reading books but I can’t bring myself to do it. It’s much easier to just watch another five phone reviews or whatever until I fall asleep. I have read a tiny bit before, but I often quit in the middle of a book and never pick it up again. What are some tips to motivate myself to read instead of scrolling?. I got invited to a party for the first time ever and I of course really really don't want to go, but I feel like I have to if I ever want a chance of getting better.I'm sure I will have an awful time if I go, but at the same time exposure therapy is apparently the only thing that works.Idk, can someone give me some motivating words or something?. Reading this sub makes me feel pretty bad and hopeless about my scars. There are some success stories, but they seem to include lots of expensive treatments.So I'm wondering if there maybe is a subreddit about people who have accepted their skin for what it is. Or if someone's scars have faded naturally. I want to read success stories from people who have not done treatments (or few/mild).
    I've been bored with the games I usually play. My types have been:•Animal Crossing: New Horizons•Gas Station Simulator•Spiritfarer•Arcade Paradise•Pokemon games•Mario gamesI'm just looking for something get me back into using my switch!I downloaded Super Mario Wonder, and it's okay. I'd just appreciate any other ideas!. I've had my guinea pigs for a year now and have always let them use their cage as a litter box. I deep clean it every 2-3 days, as the ammonia starts to reek from their urine. I've seen online that you can potty train your pigs to at least pee (I can handle the poop outside of it) in a "litter box". Their favorite spots to go are in their hides, making it difficult for me to figure out how to train them to go to a box. How does this even work? What do I put in the box to coax them to use it? Please help! 🫠. I've been with him for four years. We've been through so much together. His mom died, we've had constant medical issues, getting education degrees and certifications, buying a car, looking into our first apartment, getting through COVID, and so much more. I've known for a long time I've wanted to marry him one day. Though a cliche, really since the day I met him. I'm finishing my Bachelor's in the spring, and I'll be getting a job soon after. I'm working part time, and he's working full time. He's been through so much in life before me, with such limited stability. He's expressed before he absolutely wants to, but wants to wait until we're living together, have jobs, and enough income. I understand. It makes obvious sense. We went to visit his family in another state this weekend, with this being the second time I've met them. His little sisters were cornering him to make him propose to me by Christmas (which made me laugh), and his dad made a comment to someone else that the next big event will probably be a wedding and gestured to us. I know my boyfriend isn't ready. I'd never forgive myself if I pressured him. I just love him so much and the thought of being his fiance and wife would make me so happy. He makes me happy, and I'll never rush him. I'm just so damn anxious and ready for it to happen because I love him so damn much 🤬🙃😂. I'm getting very depressed and suicidal again. I've been out of therapy for about a year. I just can't afford it with or without insurance. What do I do?. My guinea pigs have been using a ball-bearing bottle for over a year now. It recently broke somehow, so I drove about an hour out (to the nearest pet store) to get a new one. Once I got home, I realized it was different and didn't have a ball. It said on the package it's valve-operated and not ball-bearing. One of them quickly figured out how to do it with some help, but the other one is very shy and won't come too close to me. I'm worried he won't figure it out and I have to go to bed soon. Did your guinea pigs adapt quickly or should I figure out something for my pig?. My parents tend to spoil my brother a lot, not caring for the consequences sometimes. I found out today they intend to get him a frog, and when I asked if they have any idea how to care for it, they said no. Please give me things I'll need for it: cage? Subrstrate? Hides? Food? Water? Anything? I'm clueless when it comes to frogs and I don't want it to be miserable!. I am not Jewish, but my fiancé and his family are. I love his sisters to death, and the youngest is hosting her Bat Mitzvah near the end of October. I know the most common is money (in increments of 18), which I will most likely do, but I'd also like to give her another gift. I'm unsure what to get her. Any ideas?. I'm considering teaching virtually due to medical issues, but wanted to hear some feedback! Pros and cons!. Long story short:We're trying to sell our house and are having people do walk throughs to tour the house. We decided to take our Guinea pigs with us by just loading the cage into our car. Everything has been going fantastic. We have their food, water, extra hay, and blasting the AC. I had a doctor's appointment today. I planned to leave my keys in the car with the AC on for them. My husband and I walked in for a quick check up, only to realize he had put the keys in my purse and we didn't realize until after. We were inside for 25 minutes. It's 78 degrees Fahrenheit out, and when I came out, they were extremely sweaty and tired. I cried so hard. One Guinea pig was looking better than the other, but my one, Bacon, looked incredibly lethargic and sprawled out. It was very unlike him. I looked up symptoms of heat stroke and how to care for it. I immediately grabbed him to the front with me, swaddled him in a damp towel, and held him directly in front of the AC. He looked so much better after a few minutes and finally started relaxing. I'm just terrified that something could be wrong that I'm not seeing. What should I look out for? Obviously this will never happen again. Ever. I'm just scared. Please help!. I've never lived alone and my boyfriend and I are getting our own place. Anything I should look for/ask for about apartments?. So, probably a silly question. I will be graduating at the end of this year. If I officially am licensed as a teacher by December, how hard will it be to find a teaching position?I feel like schools won't accept new teachers until a new school year. Any advice?. I've been to a local pet store several time for Guinea pig supplies. They have an old (several years old) Guinea pig there. He's been there for months, cramped in a tiny glass box like one then would put dwarf and Syrian hamsters in. He can barely turn around. He looks miserable. I don't have any details about what's wrong with him/why he has not been bought. I already have two Guinea pigs. I don't have another cage for him, and I don't know if I could even put them all together. I just know I can't leave that Guinea pig there. What should I do? I feel like complaining will do nothing.I have two weeks. I have a few things already made, but I'm trying to think of good items and what I will need. Thanks!!!. I'm Heather, turning 24 in a few days, and I'm ready to find a bestie from another testy. I love video games, reading, memes, music, family (I promise I'm not Dominic Toretto), thrifting, food, baking, crafts, tattoos, etc, etc. I collect hobbies like gym badges.

I have SO much stuff and it's all laid out for you. You can take what you want, however much you want. Gifts/bells are not required. Please stay inside fence and do not take except what is being sold. Three at a time!Edit: CLOSED!. It's all for free. I have SO much stuff and it's all laid out for you. You can take what you want, however much you want. Gifts/bells are not required. Please stay inside fence and do not take except what is being sold. Three at a time!Edit: CLOSED. Love, once known as *leubh*, *lufian*, and more. The meaning of deep affection and adoration. A neurochemical reaction that builds just from two humans meeting each other. Pluto's myth that our souls were split in two, and we search for our other half. Love has different pronounciations, definitions in other countries, languages. To love is to be so brazen; placing your trust and life into the hands of someone who knows your weaknesses, your fears, and your struggles. Who has seen both the ugly and beautiful side of you. Who knows the severity of a good day and a bad day. It feels so good to be free in their arms. I've received it and given it so many times in my lifetime. Sometimes every week, every day, or every hour. Because I, just as others, feel love and adoration for those we come across. The ones we wish to die with. But on days where I feel we are absorbed as one; that our souls really are missing puzzle pieces that just click every time we hold hands, hug, or lay in each others' arms; love is not a big enough word for how I feel for you. Love is a description of your favorite pizza. Love is how you feel about that one television show you watched as a kid and you remember the theme song like your last name. Love is that perfect color in the sky when the sun begins to hit the surface. Love is the smell of the grass after it rains. Love is your favorite pair of sweatpants for your lazy days. You are more than love. You are more than adoration. You are me. I don't know how to explain it. We're not the same, but we are. We are one. It feels like two different people, and I see two different people, but it's more than love with you. And I used to say that you were home, and you are. Wherever you are is home. When I am with you, it is peace. When we fight, it's a blip. When we kiss, my chest aches. Not from lack of oxygen, but the pounding of my heart when you are so close to me. When you touch my arm, chills run down my spine. You think it's funny. Infatuation isn't the word, either. We can spend time apart. I don't feel a constant need to be with you; never apart. Though not to say that I need time away. It's more than just infatuation. Infatuation fades. It's a phase. It's temporary. And maybe love is temporary, too. Maybe it's not as existential as I make it out to be. It could be just my brain high on oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin. Making shapes out of clouds. They're just clouds. Or that, Plato was right, and you are my other half. It's not that hard. It's just love. I just want you to know that the way my body reacts and feels for you is unlike anything I know. I know love, and I know you. I've loved a lot of people and things; music and colors; oddities and poetry. I think I only loved you at one point. But it's not that anymore. It's more. It is so much more, and I wish I could express it through words. Without using the word love. Without using synonymous terms, or comparisons, or poems. I just wish you could place your hand over my beating heart and feel how much power eminates from my core. How it could power a city, a country, an entire planet. It's so strong, so constant, never-ending. It's so much more. I just wish I had the words. It's like clawing in the sand at a beach and trying to find treasure. Drowning in the ocean and trying to break the surface. Trying to move during sleep paralysis. Is it the worst feeling? No, of course not. We've both felt worse and been through worse. Finding the word I feel for you is not even the most important thing. It can sit on the back burner, sure. Maybe one day, when things settle down and I've come across more words in the universe, I will find something that helps you understand. And I'll tell you; you'll probably look at me like I have three heads. Or maybe you'll agree. So for now, I love you. But I hope you understand what that means.I'd prefer online. I'm eclectic and would love to be among fellow witches/sisters!. I feel I would thrive better as a witch being apart of a coven, though I'm unsure where to find one!. I've been considering joining a coven. I realize I may feel more supported, comfortable, and able to navigate the craft in a coven. How do I even find one?. This is my first Beltane, and I'm unsure how to celebrate correctly! Any suggestions are appreciated ✨. I've been reading it is suggested to mark your door for entering and exiting of a circle from the east, yet I cannot find a reason why. Does anyone know?.
    So, when you watch old movies, there's always a guy with a city name: Tex, Cleveland, etc. I always really vibed with that so when I wanted a chosen name, I found a city starting with my birth name initial. After using it among friends for for a few months, I googled it beyond just the basic searches I did before and found that people absolutely hate this name. I found a bunch of reddit threads about disliking city names in general, but specifically saying how ugly this name is. I found exactly two people over multiple threads that said anything positive about the name.I'm using my chosen name publicly for the very first time at a new job so I know I'm feeling extra sensitive about it. I also know my name is for me and I shouldn't really care what internet strangers think. I genuinely love it! Still, I can't help feeling really embarrassed by it right now.I (31NB) just moved to a new city in a new state less than a month ago so I don't know anyone here. I had some friends in my old place. I had my dream job. I had to move because cost of living was too much. I didn't want to go.My only friendships are online. We're all pretty active, often hanging out on call a few times a week. My friends went from declining my recent requests to hang out to simply not answering them. This move and all the issues with it has exacerbated my already bad mental health situation. I'm so insecure about annoying people or friends being upset with me and now that it seems like it's coming true, I can't handle it. I've just been crying and sleeping for days. My depression is usually pretty bad but it's unbearable right now.My new job starts in a week so I'll at least be able to pour my focus into that soon. But for now I'm really, really struggling. I'm so sick of being miserable.I'm going through a lot of change right now. An out of state move, job searching, money issues, and everything that goes with all of those things. Life change has historically been a time for me to binge, so a couple of months ago I got back to logging my food. I don't restrict, but it helps me to stay mindful when I log what I eat.For the past few days, though, it's like binge brain has sneakily taken over. I'll binge by eating multiple smaller meals or snacks without even realizing it happened. Then I go to log and think "Oh, I can't remember. I'll just start fresh tomorrow." Rinse and repeat.How do I stop myself in the moment when I'm in that fog? I don't want to get back into this habit.Please, I'm going insane. I THINK it's indie because I was listening to a bunch of it at the time but I could be very wrong.Hi! I'm working on the Cambridge sock pattern by Knitpicks and I'm confused by this part of the pattern:> **Foot:**> > Rnd 1: K2, P1, work Tanbark Stitch over 22 (26, 30) sts,> P1, K2 (top of foot sts), PM to mark sole sts, K20 (24, 28).> 28 (32, 36) sts at top of foot, 20 (24, 28) sts at sole.> **Cont in established pattern** until sock measures 6 (7, 8)"> from CO or 2.5" shorter than desired total foot length.The instructions for each line of the Tanbark pattern say to work until the marker without mention of the K2, P1/P1, K2 on each end.So, does "Cont in established pattern" mean to repeat Rnd 1 as stated or just work the Tanbark pattern without those beginnings and ends?. Like many (most?) here, I have struggled with ED for most of my life. Last year, I finally got serious about recovery, or so I thought. I started tracking my calories and immediately got sucked into the diet life. I lost about 20lbs. I honestly did find myself feeling so much better without bingeing, but the mental stress was high (and ironically inspired binges!).The whole time, I was pretty staunchly anti-IE, thinking it was nonsense for people who don't already have a healthy relationship with food. I remember saying "I HAVE eaten what I wanted without tracking - that's bingeing! If I didn't set rules I would just eat junk food all the time."But then, my friends, I took a break from counting my calories. The "break" ended up spanning from about October until... Well, now. During that time I binged like there was no tomorrow, gaining weight back, feeling horrible.I finally got sick of the back and forth. Last month I imposed "rules" about eating that were more like ways to learn about myself. When I wanted to eat, I would ask myself "why do you want this?" I would still eat the thing whatever the answer was, but it didn't take long to take note of how often the answer was "I'm upset/anxious/stressed/bored" without needing or even wanting the food.It dawned on me this morning that I've actually been doing a form of IE by accident... You know, that thing I was so judgemental about before. Recovery is a nonlinear rollercoaster sometimes, but I feel more at peace with my body than I ever have before and I'm excited to learn more.I'm sorry, IE. And thank you.TL;DR I didn't understand/was judgemental of IE until I started doing it by accident. Life with less food obsession feels GOOD.I work full time and go to school, which is hard enough without anxiety. Anxiety has ruined my attempts to graduate over and over again. I even failed out of school last time. I don't even want my degree at this point, I just don't want to be so deeply in debt with nothing to show for it.I vowed to never fail or drop another class and I was doing well, but life events and anxiety got in the way. I worked SO hard to get caught up mom. I stayed up way too late for two weeks even though it was a busy time at work. I burned the candle at both ends with a flamethrower and it still wasn't enough to catch up, so I dropped it.Today I saw how much money I've wasted by failing or dropping classes. It made me nauseous, mom. I am so disappointed in myself. I didn't even want to go to school, I didn't have a career in mind. Now I've spent my entire 20's in school, hating every second, with nothing to show. My therapist has told me that I shouldn't consider myself a failure, but this is a literal example. I just can't see how this will end up okay.I currently work in a call center and received a really great offer elsewhere. I gave my 2 weeks notice last Friday. As time goes on, I find the issues I have with the environment and my manager to be glaring. I need to get the hell out of here, and I'm hoping to make a quiet exit on Friday.These are my reasons for being personally okay with leaving early:1. I had vacation scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of my final week, so I'd only be missing that Thursday and Friday if I dip. 2. I have multiple solid references from this job (including a supervisor) that my new employer has already contacted. 3. I used to work in the HR department at my current job (and transferred because the belly of the beast is even worse), so I know we have a "no reference" policy. If my new job were to call my current job, they would only be told my title, salary, and when I started.4. My current department is officially overstaffed, so my leaving does not cause a huge impact.My only concern is if there are any legal ramifications for giving a notice in writing and then leaving. I'm in an at-will state and there is no policy about notice in our employee handbook.My other concern is that my boss knows where I'm going. Could she somehow call my new job and sabotage things for me?In other words, am I free to go?. I'm working on a Hue Shift Afghan right now and I've gone through 3 sets of interchangeable needles in the process. The problem is that the coating on the wood wears down and makes the needles really rough. I'm wondering if this has to do with the needle, my technique, or both.Two of the needle sets were Knitter's Pride Dreamz and the third was KnitPicks Options in rainbow wood. I've heard that KnitPicks and Knitter's Pride use the same supplier, so these are essentially the same needles. Has anyone else had an issue with wooden needles becoming rough over time? I've used my KP Dreamz and the straight wooden needles from KnitPicks for a couple of years now with no issues.Hi guys!As my title says, my grandmother passed away before she could finish an afghan she'd been intermittently working on for years. After a couple of months of my dad thinking about it, he let me have it so that I may finish it.Now, I've been knitting for years, but have only recently learned crochet. I can do the basic stitches (and I will be practicing a LOT before attempting this), but I am clueless in the department of identifying anything...So, I'm here to see if anyone can help me figure out what the stitches are and how I should proceed. [Here's a look at the afghan.](http://imgur.com/a/dS13X).
    Consider me to be a magnet with a north and south pole. My north pole is next to another south pole magnet, so close to connect, while my south pole is next to another north pole magnet, so close to connect. Meanwhile, I am stuck in this position not knowing the best option. One pole of me wants to restore the app we used to text on, thinking that you said something to me after I haven’t logged on in weeks. The other pole does not, for fear of heartbreak in case you never said anything at all. But what if you haven’t been on the app lately after seeing my status for not being on in weeks? What if you are still there, whether or not you are secretly waiting for me, or you are simply texting someone else on there.Regardless of my current position, I would have ultimately wanted to time travel and prevent this heartbreak. I am so sorry I could not figure us out and how to get us closer in time. I am trying to find my own way in life without my parents, and will be seeing my fate early next year. It would be awesome to get your advice, but my poles cannot decide how to act. I wonder if you write unsent letters but don’t even post them here and keep them to yourself. Do you lurk and read my letters? My stomach is in so many knots, just wishing I could have closed this gap before this heartbreak.I finally passed my test, and I had you in mind. I knew you wanted me to do this, and I finally got it done. Even if you are not here with me, your spirit still guides me into success and accomplishment. I am scared. Should I tell you? Or will you not care? I don’t know what to do.I deleted the app we texted on. I said to myself “let’s not log on for a day” then it became two, three, four, etc. Part of me wants to move on, but then what will I do? I am so picky with people, I judge people a lot before befriending them or opening up to them. I need to focus on school and not cry over you so much. But what if you message me while I’m gone? How would you feel? Then again, you can also just text my number. I want you to message me again so much. I miss you. I think I miss our friendship more than our relationship. It angers me more to see you have a new best friend more than a new partner. I do not know how to feel about it. You said you might stay in contact, but just know I’m always ready to talk to you again.I’m trying to move out, but I got back into my fixation with reptiles and owning a bunch of them again. However, I probably never will since I plan on being very frugal with my money since I’m moving out for the first time and would like to have a lot of money saved. This is pretty much my main way to get out of depression. How do I stop this and be more realistic with my life?. You,It's unfortunate we had to separate. You had every right to. If I could turn back time, I would do so much more for us to be together more. No one has supported me through this time. I am told to get over it. My friends no longer wish to speak to me. I am left alone with no one. You were the only one to comfort me through EVERYTHING. Even through your own rough times, you would drop everything to be there for me. The urge to just reach out to you, ask how you are doing, to ask if you want to do something with me. It is so strong, but I ponder if you still see me in a good light. You said you loved me many times when leaving, and I wish I could have saved us. I can't believe I didn't spend more time with not only the love of my life, but with MY BEST FRIEND. I know you don't want to be friends, and you were unsure if you even wanted to maintain contact. You wanted us to go our separate ways. Know that you were a true friend to me for several years. I am so sad, and I have no one to go to. I could go to you, but how would you react? That is what I am afraid of. I am so close to freedom, and when I am free, I hope that we can see each other and do something. Know that in tough times, I would not hesitate to drop everything I have and go back to you.. Do you know about California poppies? There are fields of them. I bet they smell great. It would have been lovely to walk through fields and fields of poppies and other flowers, holding your hand, falling in love more and more with each stride.Watching the sun set in a field, your arms wrapped around me, one hand tying my hair back as you kiss the top of my head, admiring the two most beautiful things in your eyes at the moment.Sitting in your lap in the bathroom, your arms wrapped around me, us admiring the beauty of our relationship in the mirror.Seeing your smile from your eyes to your mouth and you eat the food I made for you after a long day of stressful work.Sit under the shade of a large tree and daydream away, resting my head on your lap while you played your guitar.Sit on the back porch on an early Sunday morning with the birds chirping, with your head laying on my chest, dozing away due to the lack of sleep you got that night.Accompanying me on my first roller coaster. You were shocked that I’ve never been on a REAL rollercoaster.Watching you play sports with your friends, jokingly wearing a custom jersey that matches your name.Trying your favorite restaurants.And so much more things. More things than tongue could tell.I've realized why it's so hard to let you go.You are the only person that has shown unconditional love to me. Took me years to find someone like you, and I found you in the most unconventional way imagined. You have shown how to love myself, to love people more efficiently, and how to find what's best for me. You were there for me in my darkest times, the only light to guide me through the cave of unknown. It is sad that you are gone. You let me go, thinking I should be with someone better for me. You are the best for me. If only I could turn back time and try to improve us even more. You were my only friend, I have realized. The friends that I thought I could rely on are gone. They only cared about me when I was happy. It is heartbreaking to see friends no longer want me when I am not at my best. You cared for me when I was not at my best. I could not have asked for a better partner, a better friend, a better confidant, and a better mentor. You mean the world to me. I know you are still in love with me, but I hope I run into you in the future. If not, in another life, my love.I’m sorry this couldn’t work out. You insist it’s a you thing, but in reality it was me. I should have been more demanding of meeting you in person, I feel like I took your presence for granted and wasn’t expecting it to end like this. Now half of me is gone. Who will help me find a job? Who will help me move out? Who will I talk politics with? Who will I ask for opinions? It can’t be you… for now. I was told to prepare for the day you might start a conversation with me, but why keep my hopes up? There are so many more beautiful women closer to you. Every man is out of my league. You are the only man, and really only person to ever give me love and appreciated my natural beauty. It’s so hard knowing that you have probably found another woman, but I will always be here, ready to welcome you back. I fucked up and now I can’t have you back.I don’t want to go to school anymore. No point of going to school if I’m not gonna make anything out of it. I have lost interest in everything, nothing brings me pleasure anymore. I want to move out of the house, but at the same time where will I go? I have no one to go to. Everything is expensive here. My plan would be to buy a used car at full price and live in the car as I somewhat vagabond my life, but who knows if I will even make it to do that. I will never be able to tell my parents how depressed I am, they will hate me. I cannot see a therapist as I cannot afford one. Hotlines do nothing to help me.I don’t want to go to school anymore.

I fucking HATE MY LIFE.Please help me. You were the only one to be there for me in times of need. Everyone pushed me away, but you were the only one to pull me in. I wish I could have closed the physical distance between us, but it is too late. If I could go back in time and keep us together, I would drop everything in my current life and move in to your place. I fucking hate college, I just want a fucking hug. Only you could give me a hug. Please fucking save me.To help with my depression, I reach out to people and try to distract myself. However, it seems that everyone wants me to just “get over it” or “it will get better” or straight up just push me away. WHY?

I have no one to support me.Dear E,I am trying my best to do no contact with you. It is hard. Seeing you with the little green dot saying that you are online is dreadful to see. I could have done so much more in this relationship, but it appears as if I took you for granted on some days. We promised we would see each other, but we never continued the conversation due to distractions. We promised we would move in and get married, but we never continued the conversations due to distractions. I feel like an idiot knowing I could have done something to save this. It is too late. I am so so so sorry that I kept us in an LDR for so long. You said you loved me, said you were sorry, and asked for forgiveness when you broke up with me. I understand your pain, but please know I will always be here for if you ever want to speak again. We were together for almost 2.5 years. I did the math, we were together for 11.85% of my life. That is a lot. It will take me a long time to get over you. We planned on getting married and having a family, and now I must start all over again. Until we speak again, know that you are loved and wanted.I work in a retail/attraction chain where collaborating with co-workers is happening almost every day. Some co-workers I can easily up to, others I cannot. But lately it seems I cannot at all. I can talk about things about our job and the aspects of it, as well as funny stories from the past, but never about myself. I did open up to one of my supervisors about how lonely I am and my struggles with fitting in, but this was back in January, and I regret opening up, yet I don’t know why. I used to be the class clown who could talk a mile a minute at school 4+ years ago, but now I’m in the atmosphere of the class clown when they get home from school: sad as fuck.Anyone at work can use my info as gossip, which false rumors have been spread about me. That was back in late January, not sure if anything else has been said about me. But all those toxic people are gone, but it still hurts. What do I have to do to overcome this fear/anxiety due to judgment and fear or trust? The only thing I want is to have good friends at work I can trust.Turned 19 not too long ago, and after my whole life of my parents wanting me to look at college and careers, I’ve realized I’ve only been doing it because I’m BORED, not interested. Constantly told to do a career with animals because I love them, now I’ve realized I only like them because I’m BORED. I’m only at work because I would be BORED otherwise. I’m only on Reddit because I’m BORED. BORED. BORED AND DEPRESSED. I don’t have a fucking purpose except to be depressed, bored, and boring.I let my mother stomp all over me, dictating what I can and cannot do and I’m so fucking tired of it. Lost so many opportunities this past year because she says general hobbies are fucking childish, and that I eat junk food while she smokes a pack a day. All she ever does is complain, and she dumps it all on me. She wants me to go to college and do a career I’M NOT INTERESTED IN. I don’t even know what I want to be. Everyone around me is so successful but here I am, a fucking blob of nothing. I just waste air, food, water, clothing, space, EVERYTHING. Even my co-workers don’t like me. I am easily replaceable but I don’t give a fuck anymore because NOTHING WILL CHANGE. I have NO CONTROL over my life. It’s not going to get any better.I wish I didn’t have to wake up each day.I just got back from vacation yesterday morning, and it was… OK. Mom and grandma just push me around, always making me do everything. I come back and no one really wants to talk to me. No friends, except for two people on this app, no family, I have my dad, but that’s it. He doesn’t know my pain. I gained 10 pounds because of my grandma always wanting to go to a sit down restaurant, so I HAVE to eat with her. So now I have to lose this weight all over again. I got no sleep the night prior, and I woke up today, realizing how badly I didn’t want to wake up this morning.Now I have to leave for work in 20 minutes or so, or I could just leave early and sit in the empty break room and find some solitude. This will be my first day of work since I have returned, let’s see who ignores me. Half of me wants people to talk to me, half of me doesn’t to justify my point that no one wants to hear me anymore.Let’s see what happens. Until then.Last night I went to a wedding, everyone (seemed) to be happy. I faked it all. I know I will never get married because of how atrocious my physical and mental state is. I will never be able to go to a college, and I will never become a mom. If I die, however, I’ll just let my family down one last time by doing it, but no matter what, I’ll always let them down.So let it be. Optimally, I’d like to tell my parents I’m moving out, my goal being to live off the land. If I die, oh well. If I live, oh well. There’s nothing to do left. I just have to get up and do the same shit OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I’m tired of pretending to be happy. I just want to BE happy, not PRETEND to be happy. Done with this. Peace.I honestly hope this is one of my last posts, meaning I will die soon or find happiness soon.Wow it’s hard to not cry at work. Seeing things that remind me of when I was happy. When I had no worries. When there’s no one nearby the tears just come right out. And if someone asks what’s wrong, I know I’m gonna let it all out. And I’ll be embarrassed.I just don’t want to make it too obvious on my plans. If I manage to get in contact with my SO, I’ll tell him truly what I’m thinking of and my plans to disappear and not come back.When I first arrived, I was nervous. I casually approached a woman, asked if she worked here. She introduced me as An. She said she does. I looked around, gave me a tour of the facility, and she introduced me to you. You were very hungry, but that didn’t bother me. It wasn’t until a week later that we started to work together. You had (and still do) have your habit of testing out new people. You like to cut corners. For a while I was unsuccessful to work with you. I wanted to give up.Then one day, An said that you feel relaxed with me, and that I do a great job taking care of you before work. She said most of the rest tend to rush with you, but I don’t. She said that she could tell you are relaxed, because your bottom lip is past your front lip. I didn’t believe her until I saw. She said you tolerate some, but very few you really like. You really like me because I brush you well before I tack you. I’m calm, I don’t bounce all over the place. I get to show my soft, inner-core with you and An. My heart rate drops when I’m with you. I’m calmNow when we work, I have more confidence in us. We do a great job together. I finally sustained a trot because of you. I wish you could read this, but you can’t read. You aren’t a person. You are a horse, one that I trust more than most people. I’m tearing up because all my life I wanted to fee a belonging, and you do it unconditionally. Thank you making me feel welcomed, I will see you on Friday.I hate the stomach knotting and rock filling feeling I have in my stomach when I’m sad. I remember one time I cried so hard I became bloated, and it hurt. Mom didn’t understand what I was feeling, but I hate the feeling of this rock and knot. I don’t want to eat. I have not eaten much today. But at the same time I enjoy this, I enjoy losing weight. Why do I do this to myself, over and over again.I only lose friends, not gain any. I have so-called friends at work, but I can’t talk to them outside of work. I just read texts and overthink, or I don’t know what to say. Early February one of my friends I made at work gave me her phone number to text her. I was so shy and depressed I didn’t text her. It’s been 3 months, no point in texting her now because it’ll be awkward. Same thing with my friend I met 3 years ago, I told him how crazy life has been since I moved 1k miles away from our hometown. This was in December. He asked what’s been going on. I haven’t responded, Haven’t even OPENED the message. I’m such a pain. The only person I DO want to text because I feel comfortable around them doesn’t even text me back. Maybe they’re depressed and have a hard time responding but won’t tell anyone, too.I only lose friends, not gain any. I have so-called friends at work, but I can’t talk to them outside of work.

I’m going to end up running away and living off the land, or end my life. Everyone will give the attention I lacked when I was present after I leave.Been on this planet for a little over 19 years. I never fitted in. I didn’t have the comfortable life most had. My family, my ‘friends’ and my boyfriend are the highlights of my life, yet I don’t think I’m one of theirs. I think I accidentally scared my boyfriend away, and I wish I could say I was sorry. I did, but I wish he could talk to me right now as I type this, preventing me from posting this. He was the only person I ever felt comfortable crying to, he even kissed me over the phone while I cried. I still cry over him telling me to take deep breaths, and remember that I am loved and wanted. I broke down after my high school graduation, everyone was happy to see each other, meanwhile I had nobody to talk to. I cried because of my school memories, how they will never happen again, my best friends had moved away. It was terrible. He was the only person who knew of my suffering. It’s been some time since I heard from him, but at least I got to chat with him a little on Easter. I can only chat to strangers how I feel, they can’t expose me. I don’t talk to my friends outside of work, they don’t even know how much pain I’m in, because if I tell them, they can expose me to anyone they wish. I can’t talk to my parents because I’m not sure they would comprehend. They have no idea what’s been going on. This is the only way I can speak my mind. Hello to anyone who reads this!. Everyone left.The person I relied on the most, my secrets, my laughs, my cries, gone. My parents. Old yet forgiving. Unconditional love, gone.My friends from my childhood. Growing yet childlike. Older yet innocent, gone.Everyone is gone. They aren’t dead, they are hard to talk to. Now I have to sit here and wait for people while I cry.I don’t remember what I ate yesterday, probably just a banana and some crackers if I recall. I have not eaten yet today, despite me being awake for over 8 hours now. I feel like I have a big rock in my stomach and I’m just not hungry.
    There’s a switch that happens in your mid- late 20s.You lose most of your friends and it becomes harder to make them. Your life choices start to show financially.You realize you’re not young anymore and it’s scary af.It’s not too late but u realize how much time you’ve wasted. Your parents start to get so old. Or die. (RIP Mama) Looks start to fade.Work fucking sucks This isn’t a poem im 28 and goddamn life is hard.I’ve slept 12-16 hours one week straight. Have not brushed my teeth or showered. Only have the energy to lay down and doom scroll. I’m starting Wellbutrin today it’s supposed to make me horny skinny and happy again. I hope so. I currently don’t want to be alive. I started working at a sketchy nonprofit last month (Aug 11) . The office is in a warehouse type of building, kinda dirty and dingy. I am the office manager.Long story short, the office is infested with bed bugs. I had an inspector come check my apt and the office and he confirmed live activity in both areas. (I brought a chair home from the office for wfh days). My legs were covered in itchy red welts. I’ve just spent a lot of money paying for exterminator services and throwing out my belongings. When I reported it to my boss he assured me he would handle it, but instructed me to not go back to the office.Since I reported it a week ago, I haven’t worked due to my boss ghosting me/ ignoring all my msgs. I was officially terminated today for “poor performance”. This can’t be right, is it? Can I sue this piece of ? (I should mention my first day he provided me an onboarding document instructing me to take a chair home for wfh).
    Hi! I'm not sure if this is even the right sub for this post. But I have posted before on here for depression. I also suffer from OCD and severe anxiety. I have these overwhelming feelings about daily living. I'm terrified of starting a new job of my surgeries... I can't bring myself to buy a car even though I desperately need one. I'm overwhelmed by the thought of spending money. I need $ because I'm afraid soon I won't be able to work. I'm not going to get into details why. But I know it will be the final nail in the coffin so to speak. I keep thinking I have to get out before all these walls close in on me. I'm not sure what is going on. I've held a job for the last 24 years. But it's not going to last much longer. And in my condition physically and mentally. There is absolutely no way I can hold another job. I'm completely falling apart. I've lost 65 pounds. I don't sleep well. I am terrified of everything anymore and this wasn't me. I was never like this. Although I suffered from severe depression and OCD. I took medication but I had to stop after 20 years in it because of the physical problems it caused. But now I'm really thinking I can't do this. I don't want therapy it wouldn't help because my mind hasn't been right since my diagnosis. I'm all alone. I have no One I'm 46. I doubt I'll make it through the holidays to be honest. Last year I really came apart during them. And Im thinking I can't do it again. I feel overwhelmed by eating. I eat healthy. But something is seriousoy broken with me. I can't survive like this.Since 2020 my life has spiraled down hill. My candle is burning out fast from both ends. And I cant stop it. A diagnosis has completely changed my Life. And when you don't have help or support or anyone. It's that much tougher. I've lost all desire to do anything. I have absolutely no sex drive. Like 0 I have no interest in anything. Can't relax can't unwind. I used to at least watch TV I cant even watch more then 5 minutes without getting angry. I don't expect anyone to help me. I've posted a few times on here. I'm used to nobody answering. Im just kinda posting because it helps a tiny bit, I guess I know I'm too far gone at this point. I've struggled with ocd and anxiety clinical depression all my life. But now the physical condition has wiped any thought of a normal Life. No way I can even date in my condition. It's actually good that I have no desire to. But the thought of being alone and in the hospital has me thinking about..... nevermind it doesn't matter. Hope you all have a good day. Try to make the best of it. Don't make mistakes I have made. Sometimes there no coming back from them. I'm really questioning if it's worth fighting anymore. I live with constant regret. About my past. That this is no life to live for me if there was a simple way out I would pay to do it. I mean I've thought so my about ways. And I have some in mind. But there's no guarantees and I don't want to end up somewhere. That's not right that this society sticks you in a hospital or something because you don't want to go forward. How the f do they know what your dealing with. It just makes you feel worse about yourself being put in those places. I'm older I been through the systems before. I'm not going back!! I have no family or anyone in my life. So it's not like I'm hurting anyone.. I have severe depression and OCD.. plus other health issues. It's like why am I bothering. Then to top it off I have to live with regret. I don't want to go on meds!!!! That's why I have these regrets!!! It made me someone I hated!! But I was out in them at a young age because I wanted out then. But the therapy and the medication made things worse for me. Everyone treated me like I was sick. But the medication made me angry!!. It made me a person I didn't like. Now I'm off them I'm not angry. I'm just depressed. And I prefer it that way then the other person I was. I'm just rambling but I need to say this. Everyone suggested medication. I'm here to say I wish to God I never took it. I'm the outcast of my family because I'm so ashamed of myself.So I'm now 4 years sober from a long standing opiate addiction. I used Suboxone/ Subutex for a long time 20 years. It and nicotine helped me cope with everything. I looked forward to things, I kept to myself but I was content. It helped me alot. I always struggled with severe depression. And sub actually helped that in a lot of ways. I was so happy when I found them. I had a renewed zest for Life. But unfortunately they also were causing issues with my health. I was also eating very unhealthy on them. But kinda always ate that way they just made my cravings worse. But I quit all those things. Subs/ nicotine/ unhealthy eating. But all these years later. I'm a wreck. I'm so depressed I don't want to do anything. Nothing interests me. I used to love playing videogames or going shooting. Or being outdoors. Now I'm just so EMPTY . I can't do any of those things. I tried, nothing is the same!! It's just not the same anymore. This shouldn't of lasted this long. Usually when people get sober they feel better. Although I'm living healthier. I hate it more then anything! What good is living like this? I keep trying forcing myself and yet it's the same thing. I just lose interest so fast. I don't sleep well either. I barely sleep 4 hrs a night. Nothing I take helps that. And honestly I don't really want to take anything anymore. I think I reached my end point in life . I mean if there's no happiness or things to look forward to then what is the point really? I have no family so subs was really all I had. But because of the issue it caused I can no longer take them or anything j used to do. I know this stuff was bad for you. But man did i at least enjoy Life. Now it's just nothing.
    My current circumstances are alright, I habe great friends and am dating someone wonderful but I noticed that I feel so fucking bored of everything and start getting the ick of life and once I hit that point everything feels pointless and hopeless. Why? Is this me being "greedy" or is this depression?. My current circumstances are alright, I habe great friends and am dating someone wonderful but I noticed that I feel so fucking bored of everything and start getting the ick of life and once I hit that point everything feels pointless and hopeless. Why?. Hey guys, I am looking for the name of the song in episode 3 25:30 min. I wouldn't ask here if I hadn't searched the entire internet, I even wrote 3 Netflix accounts of different countries because I liked it so much :D So if anyone knows the song, please let me know!.
    I've been struggling with my depression since 2020, and a few nights ago, I reached my breaking point with it. It was either "I'm going to kill myself" or "I'm checking myself into the hospital again in an attempt to try my best to continue living". I decided that I was done trying to make this work, and I've begun planning my suicide. I'm going to hang out with my best friend that day, then I'm going to perform stand up comedy for the first time later that night (something I've always wanted to try but never had the balls to). Finally, I'm going to kill myself with a suicide bag in my room. Tomorrow I'm going to pick up the supplies for the suicide bag, then I'm going to see what comedy clubs are near me and when their next open mic is.Would rather die young at 19 years old and be remembered as someone gone too soon than live to become a disappointment.Is there anything I need to know going into it for the first time that could help? Any and all advice would be very appreciated, pretty nervous about it.If I feel like I'm being ignored (examples are when I'm telling one of my friends something and they clearly arent paying attention to what I'm saying, or when I send a question to someone and they leave me on read/opened for hours on end), I become so upset that I feel like I have to leave the room and gather myself so that I don't say something that I'll regret. Part of it comes from feeling like I was ignored a lot growing up, which isn't anybody else's fault, but it still urks me heavily. Is anybody else like this?. Forgive me if this doesn't make sense, I'll try my best to explain it clearly but I'm having a hard time finding the proper wording. I've been severely depressed for the last 4 years, and while there have been many dark periods during that time, I don't think I've ever been so casually comfortable with the thought of killing myself as I am now. I think about killing myself every single day without fail, and I didn't even realize how crazy that is until just now. I feel like I'm destined to take my life at some point, I've already got a plan for how I'm gonna do it. I'm just waiting for one really bad day.I'm thinking about getting my BSW here, so I'm curious to hear about other students' experience in this program. I (19m) have no idea who I am or what I want to do with my life. At the moment, I feel like my life has no purpose, and it sucks. It feels like life is passing me by as I struggle to find my thing. All I know is that I want to go on an adventure. How should I start?. I don't feel like a person. I dont feel human anymore. I feel like everyone is part of this great, huge experience that I'm not a part of. I feel like my life has no meaning and I just want to sleep forever.Every single time someone says "I love you", I almost cringe on the inside. Of course, I say it back, but I hate it. It's not like I don't love them, I just feel extremely uncomfortable receiving any form of love, and even more uncomfortable giving love back. Stupid question, I know.My right hand measurements are 17.80 x 10.16 cm, I use the pincer claw grip, and I have no preference for mouse shapes (I frequently switch between the GPX, Deathadder v3, and Orochi v2).For the last 40 minutes, I tried my best write a suicide note and was planning to get in my car and drive into a tree at 70+mph, but then suddenly the urge just stopped . This always happens. I will feel suicidal for around 40 minutes, then I'll just stop feeling that way. What is wrong with me, I don't know if I'll make it through the next urge. Whenever that happens, I guess.I have hidden myself from the rest of the world ever since I was 5 years old (I am 19m). Social anxiety is something that I have always struggled with, and I'm about at my wits end with it. This is all started about a month ago when, thanks to last minute plans, I went to a party at my friends university. I almost said no, but something pushed me to drive the hour out and go. I'm so glad that I went, because it taught me that I can be confident and extroverted. Ever since then, I have wanted nothing more than to get out of the house and put myself out into the world. I feel like something changed that night. I really hope this wave of momentum continues for me, because I feel ready to move on with my life and just live in the moment and have fun.my entire life I've struggled with social anxiety. It has caused me to isolate myself from the rest of the world and in the process I have missed out on so much in life. Up until a month ago, I never planned on changing anything about that. Then, I went to my first party about a month ago. It was then that I realized what I had been missing out on. Since then, i have wanted nothing more than to put myself out into the world and just have some fun for once. Its to the point where i actually changed my college plans. i was planning on just doing going to some small community college where I wouldn't really have any social interactions besides with my professors. i am now in the process of joining my friend (who i partied with previously) at his university. For the first time in my life, I actually want to live for myself and have fun and connect with other people.I'm planning on going to MSU and major in graphic design, but it would probably be a good idea if I heard more information from other students about it first before I apply. I want to get an associates degree in Graphic design, but I can't find anything online about this. Is it only bachelor's degrees?. So I have really bad social anxiety, and I feel like it would be great for me to get out of the house so that I can work on it. I only bring this up because it matters a lot when it comes to this decision.My parents want me to go to a community college, but none of my friends are going there and seeing as it's only about 20 minutes from my house and doesn't have dorms, it is the least preferable option. I would like to go to a big university (that has already accepted me) where I can see my friends and be roommates with them. I also think it would be great for my social anxiety for me to go there instead. Only issue is, it's obviously way more expensive, and I would have to wait until March or April to go, and my parents want me to go to college asap.For reasons I don't want to get into, I decided that I would start living life on my own terms, yet I am having so much difficulty trying to decide against what my parents want. How should I go about making this decision?. I don't feel human, I don't feel like who I was just a few years ago. That may seem obvious and stupid to say since we all grow and change, but I haven't been growing. I've been so miserable these last few years and I don't know who I am anymore. I'm always alone in a crowd. Even around my friends and family, I don't feel like I belong. I just feel out of place everywhere I go.I smoke marijuana fairly frequently, and every time I get high, it takes my mind back to my childhood and how much I miss just being a kid. I mean it when I say EVERY SINGLE TIME. At first, I wasn't sure why weed kept taking me back to my childhood. Then recently, I feel like I had a breakthrough. I got way too high a few nights ago and in the midst of thinking about my childhood and why I was so depressed, I realized what was at the core of it; I feel like I never got to finish my childhood properly. In 5th grade, my mom moved me an hour away from all my friends and family (including my dad), so I had to start all over again at a new school. Then, a year later, I switched schools again. Then 5 years later, quarantine happened and I didn't get to finish high school in person with my friends. I never realized how badly this affected me until recently, but I feel like it is one of the reasons why I've been having so much trouble moving on to the next chapter of my life since I never finished the one before it. I don't know what to do now.I've struggled with social anxiety my whole life, and I've always wanted nothing more than to just curl up in a corner and be by myself. The thing is, I can be very extroverted as long as I'm around my friends. I partied with my friend up at his university about a week ago, and it was wonderful. I was social, outgoing, and I actually got a lot of energy from talking to other people that weren't my friends. Ever since that night, and even bit before that, I've been longing to get out of the house and meet more people. To the point where I'm actually considering going to his university next fall so that I can leave this house and meet more people since the town I live in is kind of out in the sticks so there is not a lot of opportunity to meet people my age. Obviously, I am going to wait a bit to make my decision since this is a lot happening at once and I could very much regret a decision this big.I have severe social anxiety, so it is really hard for me to meet new people and make friends. I've been like this since for as long as I can remember. It has plagued my life and I never thought it would be possible for me to have a real social life and be outgoing, always been living in my head instead of in the moment and having fun. That is until recently. I visited my friend at his university to party, and it was one of the best nights of my life. I found out that I can be sociable and it is possible to meet new people and not want to die in a corner. So it got me thinking about what I can do to be like that more often.I've decided , after my friend told me I should, that I am going to apply to transfer from my college to his next year so I can join him in a dorm and go to school with all my other friends. I've had a really rough last few years where I have isolated myself from the outside world, and it has done me no good whatsoever. I need to make a drastic change in my life like this, since the "little-by-little" approach doesn't work on me (I have no consistency when it comes to doing things in baby steps).My GPA non weighted is 3.6, weighted is 3.7. My SAT score is 910 (I know it's really bad, I was an idiot and didn't put in much effort when I took it). If I were to submit an application with everything the way it is now, what would my be chances be?. This is my first year in college, and I've only had my first class this Wednesday, but I think I already want to switch majors to graphic design. I just get this bad feeling that I'm not going to be happy with my career come 10 years from now. Meanwhile I already do graphic design almost every day. I love designing new logos and graphics for things like my livestream and just other miscellaneous projects, and I like to think I'm alright at it, too. Should I switch this early so that I can get my refund on the other classes that I've taken and use it towards this, or should I give my computer classes just a little bit more time to make up my mind?&#x200B;UPDATE: I am switching majors from Information Technology to Graphic Design. I was worried about what my parents would say since they pushed me to go towards Information technology but I decided that at the end of the day I know what's best for me. Thank you all for your supportive replies. My game of choice is Apex Legends, and whenever I am in a fight with another player, my arm tenses up and my aim becomes super jittery and trash. The thing is, I have really good aim when it comes to aim trainers and the firing range. Does anybody have a solution or explanation for this?. I've been doing about 30 minutes of cardio every day and am on a calorie deficit of 1500 calories for the last week for so, and every day when I step on the scale, it looks like I lose around 1 lb. Is this a normal, healthy progression of weight loss?. I remember when I was in kindergarten, I was sitting by myself at the lunch table. There were these other kids sitting at a table right behind me. I tried to join their conversation, but they became dead quiet and they looked at me like I was such a weirdo. Then they turned their backs to me and continued their conversation.I've always remembered this, but I never realized how badly this impacted me until recently. Anybody have a similar experience?. About a year ago, I tried to lose a lot of weight, and while I was successful at first, I quickly gained all my weight back in a months time. I think the reason why I stopped was because I pushed myself too hard. I would often do a straight hour of cardio, which may not sound like a lot to you guys, but for me that was too much. I may have been losing pounds, but I was also losing motivation to go back to the gym as well since I would push myself to the point where I would sometimes dry heave in my car after my workout. I would often skip meals just so that my calorie intake would be as low as possible. I was happy to be losing weight, but miserable in the process. I've just started back up again, and this time I'm going to focus on making sure I'm MOSTLY comfortable with my exercise intensity (I say mostly cuz I gotta be able to go outside my comfort zone in the gym sometimes in order to grow). Instead of doing an hour of cardio, I've started off with 30 minutes. I feel much better after 30 minutes than I did after an hour.I've been friends with this guy since middle school (we are in college now), and for almost as long as I knew him, he was always very insecure and seemed to just despise himself. It didn't matter what I or anybody else said, he would always hate himself. Plus he had a shitty home life too, so that didn't help.As of late, he has been acting out of character. On one hand, he is very sociable now, and he has become the life of the party, which is super weird for me to witness but good for him. On the other hand, he has gained a delusional form of confidence. Like he can do no wrong, everything is everybody else's fault. He can take no criticism, he will freak out if someone tries to give him any constructive criticism. He never used to be like this. As long as he's finally happy with himself then I guess I'm happy for him, but these personality changes have happened rather quickly, and I'm kind of worried for him. Some of our other friends have noticed this personality change. How should I talk to him about my concerns?. Last night I was just chillin playing fallout new Vegas, and my friend called me and told me to come up to his dorm and party with him. I went "fuck it" and went. I do not regret it. I actually had a lot of fun and I was very sociable talking to people I had never met. However, the reason why I was so sociable was because I had taken 2 shots of fireball back to back and drank 4 beers afterwards. I am a lightweight, as I don't really drink much, so I got pretty drunk. I do not plan nor want to become an alcoholic, but I'll be damned if it didn't turn me into who I've always wanted to be.This year, which I thought was going to be the greatest year of my life, turned out to be probably the worst year of my life. Was admitted to a mental health institution back in early April, and since then I havent had a job or really done anything. I was scared to step back into the world and leave my comfort zone, and while I do still feel that way, I do feel strong enough to at least try to move on with my life.It's just an easy pizza delivery driver gig, but shoot as long as its not as stressful as the other places that I've worked at, I'm perfectly fine with the decrease in wage and status.So this year has been pretty for me lol. To sum it up, I was put in a mental health institute for suicidal thoughts back in April, and since then I've done literally nothing besides smoke weed and get high. I was terrified to try and move forward with my life, but now I'm going to college this fall and I've applied for some jobs now that my car has finally been repaired (my car broke down back in May so I haven't gone out much this summer, which sucks because i tend to get really depressed when I'm home too often). I feel like I'm finally getting back on my feet again, ready to move forward. Hope those of who struggling like I've been are able to get out of this rough patch.. Today's my 19th birthday, and there is a big WWE PPV an hour away from me tonight. One of my step-cousins, who I don't know very well, has a wedding scheduled for today that I never agreed or promised to go to. I was planning on going to this PPV a month ago, but all my friends are busy and my brother is working at yellowstone, so I figured there was no point in going by myself. I did have a small celebration with the rest of my family this morning, but I feel very lonely today tbh.Now I've decided that I want to go to the PPV anyway. I feel like it would be good for me to push myself and go alone for once, and maybe I could meet a few fellow fans there and have some fun. Plus WWE almost never had PPVs in Detroit anymore so it's kind of a big deal.Idk should I do it? I'm kind of tired of sitting around and waiting for something good/fun to happen to me, and I can't stand hiding from the world anymore.Edit: I got permission and I'm going! Parking is gonna suuuuuck but I'm stepping outside of my comfort zone so I'm glad I'm doing it! I'll be a little late since my dad wants me to at least attend the ceremony, but shoot I'll take it.I was just invited to this community, and I'm not entirely sure what this is yet, but I figured I might as well post something and see what this is about.I don't think I have ever loved myself. Even as a child, I never liked myself for who I was and I was terrified at the prospect of other people feeling the same way, so I started keeping to myself. Now I'm socially anxious, depressed, and I hate myself more than ever. Tonight has been a really tough night for me emotionally, but I feel as though through this pain I have found some clarity on how I feel and what I want to change. I've come to realize that, despite the fact that I do have fun with them, I need to find some friends. My two friends don't really care about me as much as I care about them. They're still cool guys, but I need a better, more supportive group of people around me. I also now realize that it's this loneliness that has plagued me my entire life that has driven me to these suicidal thoughts and urges that I've had in the past. I didn't know where the pain stopped and ended before, now at least I know where it starts: loneliness. Sorry for the essay-long post, I don't really have anyone to talk to about these things.Last night I smoked weed for the first time in a long time, and for a few minutes I just became like really sad. I kept thinking about what my life should've been and how I just feel like an absolute failure to my child self. Then I remembered that this same train of thought started to happen the last time I got high, which was almost a year ago exactly. That wasn't why I stopped smoking, btw, at least I don't think that's why I stopped. My mind kept going back to when I was a kid and how I miss when everything was simpler. It felt like my childhood was ripped away from me when I got to middle school for multiple reasons: my mom made me move an hour away from my dad so I only saw him on the weekends, moving away meant that I lost all the close friends I made in school, my mom also cut me off from talking to my grandparents because of some family drama, etc.,. I also acted out a lot in middle school so I was grounded almost the entire time, which meant I could barely ever hang out with the new friends that I managed to make and I never got to just be a kid and have fun since I was always stuck in my room. I think that me acting out in middle school may have been an unconscious, angry reaction to everything that my mom had taken away from me.I actually more in tune with my inner child today, I feel somewhat whole. Sorry for the essay, I don't have a therapist yet and I'm underage so I can't really tell anyone about this lol.Idk how to describe it but I feel like my personality (when I'm with my friends or when I'm comfortable in general) is very extrovert-like. Very confident and outgoing, but when I talk to other people I am absolutely terrified lol. For the last 5 or so years (this started a bit before quarantine), I have been almost always been tired throughout the day. Since I am always so tired, I have no energy to want to do much. Sometimes I'll receive a HUGE amount of energy that lasts for 20-30 minutes at most before I go back to being dead tired again. This has obviously been a big problem for me.I almost never wake up in the middle of the night and I can sleep for around 11 hours of sleep if I have no alarm set, so its not an issue of getting sleep. I am guilty of getting on my phone before I sleep, so there is that. My diet could definitely be better atm, but even when I am in good shape and sticking to a healthy diet, my energy levels are still very low.Should I see a sleep specialist for this, or does it sound like it could be something else?. Example: when I'm in a group Convo and someone interrupts me when I'm talking. I know that's completely normal but I feel like it makes me internally rage way more than it should, like to the point where I just wanna rip my hair out and scream at them.And OMG my brother does this thing where I'll be saying something to him and he pulls out his phone to text someone and he completely tunes me out. I never feel more homicidal than at that moment (not actually homicidal but as close as you possibly can be). One of my friends told me to look up quiet BPD because he thinks that the criteria for it describes me perfectly. I read about quiet BPD and I think I agree with him. Heres some of the things I experience:-intense fear of abandonment/rejection-very common suicidal thoughts and self harm-emotional instability (ex: will be contemplating suicide for 20 minutes, then I will feel completely A-okay immediately afterwards)-black and white thinking (either something is great or terrible, no in-between, same thing goes for people)-anger issues-constant feeling of lonelyness and emptiness-constant need to please people and assuming that everyone else is just better than me-idk if this is relevant, but sometimes I'll forget that I'm a person that exists who has friends, family, and a personality-ive seen a few people on here talk about how they daydream a lot so ig I'll add that too since I've always been lost in my head since I was a kidShould I see about getting evaluated by my psychiatrist or am I just being delusional?. My right hand measurements are 17.8cm x 10.16cm. I have a pincer claw grip and I have no preference of ambi or ergo shape.The smallest thing will absolutley set me over the edge, and for 20 minutes I will have the worst thoughts going through my head until they're just gone. Ill be having suicidal thoughts and sometimes urges for 20 minutes, but then they disappear and I feel pretty much all better.Just like 40 minutes ago, I came upstairs and asked my dad an admittedly stupid question and he gave me an appropriately sarcastic response. For some reason it really hurt my feelings (huge overreaction on my part). I went upstairs to my room and cried for 20 minutes with suicidal ideation going on in my mind. Now I just seem to magically feel all better. Is this normal?. I was super nervous but I went in person and cancelled my subscription. The interaction actually went pretty well. I held I eye contact (which is difficult because I'm autistic) and I even threw in a few jokes that seemed to land. When I went to leave, I accidentally bumped into a lady. We awkwardly apologized to each other and laughed it off. We wished each other a good day and that was that. I felt great afterwards. Huge little victory for me ✌️. It seems like a lot of the combat mods/overhauls are focused on turning Skyrims combat into dark souls, which isn't my cup of tea. I like Dishonoreds faster paced combat, so are there any mods that you guys know of to emulate that combat?. Every single day I (19M) feel like I'm getting closer and closer to actually pulling the trigger and killing myself. This last week in particular has been really rough. Every single night I'll have a quiet battle with myself, trying so desperately to come up with reasons to keep going. For a long time, my family has been the sole reason why I'm still here, because I don't want to hurt them, but a few nights ago I just kind of stopped caring about potentially hurting them. Even back in April, when I was put into inpatient care because of my suicidal urges and ideations, I wasn't this close. I think a big reason for that is because of how different I have always felt from everyone else. I just don't feel human most of the time, because when I look around and observe the lifes of my friends and family, I feel so disconnected from it all. I am not having the same experience that they are having, and I feel like I should be. I'm so far behind. At the moment, I don't have: a job, plans to go to college, a SO, something that I'm super passionate about, etc.,. I know comparison is the thief of joy, but it's something that I've done my entire life. Part of it may be due to potentially having autism and not knowing about it until I was 19 years old (I am currently in the process of being evaluated for Autism so I don't know for sure). I can barely function and I just feel so useless. I'm so tired every day, I have literally no energy to do anything productive. I'm running out of reasons to keep going. Considering going back to inpatient care but it's so expensive and I don't want my dad to have to pay for another stay at the hospital for me. He's having issues with money ATM. I'm stuck, I don't know what to do. These last couple days have been really rough for me, and for some reason, at midnight, I started laughing my ass off for like 15-20 minutes. I just had this funny thought in my head and it made me laugh way harder than it should have. Has anybody else experienced a huge fit of laughter after a tough time? Do you think it helped at all?. I know that DrDisrespect plays a character on his live streams, but are there any other content creators that do the same thing? I'm thinking about doing this and I was just wondering if there were any content creators that I took take inspiration from for this.For some reason, I just feel super uncomfortable with the thought of anybody seeing me being outwardly joyful or excited or happy. I come off to people as super robotic and boring because of this, but I can't help it.
    ive been getting good grades so far this year (all As while i usually get around Cs, maybe Bs) but ive been feeling very depressed. im almost never in a good mood and i cry daily. i dont think ive been officially diagnosed but i took a test with my therapist and got somewhere between 90 and 95 precent while the average person who doesnt have depression gets around 50. is it possible to have depression but also have good grades?. Hoping my mom doesn’t see this because I’ve seen her scrolling through here a few times. My (14f) mom had a soup mug that she loved. She wanted to buy a second for a while, but could never find them. My dog broke the one she had and she was very upset, so I decided to buy here a new one for christmas. I found someone selling 2 of them and my sister (15f, turning 16 in 2 days) and I agreed we would both give her one. I ordered them using my card, and she gave me $20 (it was $42 in total). I gave her $15 back since my dad offered to pay for $30 of it. The person I bought the mugs from messaged me and said she only had one since she sold the other and canceled the order. I messaged her back asking to buy the one, so she put up a listing for it and I bought it again. I told my sister that I bought it again, but I only got one so I get to give it to her. She said she didn’t care and told me that her and my dad bought my mom a snuggy. The mug got delivered today and I went to pay my sister back the $5 she gave me from the original agreement. She got mad at me and said that the mug was still supposed to be from both of us. I told her that it’s not and I already told her that. She said that the snuggy is just from my dad and not her. My dad offered to let her give my mom the snuggy, but she didn’t want to. I want to give it to her by myself because it was my idea and I did all the work of getting it. She thinks that we should have to give it to her together, but I think I should be able to give it to her by myself. AITA?.
    My mom exploited me online to people by having spy cameras everywhere in my room too. Now, I'm recovering memories of waking up to my underwear being on my knees and having to pull them up. My narcissistic mother always said she'd hear me say stop in my sleep on her days off, she's clearly the perpetrator. Considering she exploited me as a teen says otherwise. So much abuse and molestation from my family. You just go numb.Most people are full of shit. They're so quick to betray you, gossip about you, treat you lower just to make themselves feel better than you. I'm so sick of people. Not everyone is like this but from my personal experience and what I observe around me, most people are just awful! Angry for no reason, jealous for nearly anything, even grown people who are reaching retirement.. I took sleeping pills because I keep waking up in the middle of the night due to my depression and slept 14 hours. All day I've been sleeping AND STILL TIRED. Life is miserable.I'm so tired of wishing to die everyday. Everytime I wake up in the morning I'm so depressed like why didn't I die in my sleep. I constantly long for death but just keep suffering in this life. I'm so tired of this. Existing.Dealing with the incest is too much. Everytime I think of it is when I start to dissociate. How could you hurt your own sister like that? When I was going through puberty how could you use me to fulfill your own sexual needs. Everyday I cry, it's just so painful. It makes my suicidal ideation worse. I feel so numb .I just can't take the pain anymore. Incest is the biggest betrayal and everyday is a struggle. I get triggered easily by so many things. I'm done. I'm not wanted in this world by my family or people I just want all the pain gone forever.Hear me out. People post and brag about their achievements to make connections with other people likewise to fulfill some type of ego. Sure, LinkedIn can be a good source for jobs if only most were legit. I've seen people lie on their LinkedIn page from previous jobs just to compete with others. This makes some people feel underachieved. And the stuff corporate jobs post on their LinkedIn is cringe worthy.I'm so tired of existing. I just can't deal with the pain and stimulation of living in this world. You can't get over incest. I'm done. I've decided to kill myself. Hope everyone's happy.I'm one of the many victims of sick fucking nutheaded Christians who think it's okay to blame victims and pray for abusers. Like what the fuck is wrong with these people? Do they not have common sense? And it happens to many victims of abuse in Christianity. A popular preacher named John MacArthur shamed a lady for divorcing her husband because he was abusive to her. It took years but a person spoke up about it and finally left his church cult because they realized his actions were pure evil. Honestly if there is a god I wouldn't believe in Christianity because of how evil it's so called followers are.I volunteer with this sober community and I went to an event to bring awareness. Everyone approached my colleagues but treated me as if I didn't exist. A guy next to our booth noticed that as well. This happens to me all the time, I speak up in a conversation and either I'm ignored or they talk over me. ITS ALWAYS ME. I used to be an extroverted fun kid but now I'm a introverted shy adult because of the way people have treated me. I don't do anything wrong I'm a genuinely nice person. It seems if you're a good person in this world everyone hates you. I just want to die. I'm not wanted here.I've been in recovery for about two years now and eat regularly. To sum it up I restricted and starved myself for months and became very unhealthy. Now in recovery I'm dealing with problems such as stomach aches, new food allergies, easily faint, and anemia. Everytime I start my period I feel like passing out I believe it's because of my anemia. I got a cut on my knees early this year from paddleboarding and I nearly fainted. I had to have my buddies walk me to a chair to sit down. Idk what to do I can't take iron pills because it makes my stomach hurt. I just don't know if this is a normal thing? I get bruises out of nowhere on my knees from just walking .For some reason I only become friends with these type of people. Like they are attracted to me. I've just taken a break from making friends or any type of relationships now. I seem to only attract narcissists, crazy, sociopathic people into my life as a victim of childhood abuse. My therapy said it could be my nervous system being used to being around those type of people which is why I become friends with them. Anyone else experience something similar?. I have no family whatsoever. I had to go no contact because they all abused me. My mom exploited me, verbally emotionally abused me , dad psychologically abused me and my brother molested me. Too much suffering. I feel like a plastic bag. I suffer PTSD and depression from my childhood as an adult. Always on heightened alert. I don't want to exist anymore. No one knows the pain of being molested by your own sibling.I decided to go no contact with my other parent who just watched me be abused. I have no family now at all. Although it feels nice to not have any toxicity in my life it hurts that I have no one to rely on. No family. No one. Even animals treat their children better than I was treated. I'm so done.I've been looking at jobs in other industries out of curiosity and I've noticed they don't match the cost of living. I've seen so many positions that require a bachelor's degree with 2-5 years of related experience and pay $15 hr . It's ridiculous. How do you expect your employees to survive? And the ones with a decent wage require years of experience. How are people surviving these days is what I wonder.The term eating "ass" is licking someone's rectum for sexual pressure. Eating someone's pussy out is licking their genitalia same with giving head. That's where people poop and pee. They could have an infection for all you know. Why do these people get pleasure from doing that? It's a common thing they do... I just don't understand.Everyday I wake up depressed and go to sleep depressed because of the abuse from my childhood. The sexual trauma is too much. It's taken over my own intimacy and day to day life . My body has been violated by close relatives it's like I was just put on this planet to be molested. People always talk over me and ask why I'm so shy because all people do is treat me like shit. I'm done. I'm so useless in this world. I was the scapegoat of my family and now I'm the scapegoat of this world. I just can't do it. I never wanted to exist anyways. Everyday I cry in pain from the abuse I suffered from my parents. I'm suicidal and dissociate a lot which has made my life miserable. I feel so behind in society, while the other kids I went to high school are graduating college I had to drop out of college to run away from the abuse and deal with all the pain. I can barely function anyday. I feel like a loser in this world. No matter how hard I try to tell myself I'm not worthless and I'm not a loser I still feel that way because of the abuse and exploitation from my parents. Plus I'm overly nice and this world treats me like shit. I hate existing. Honestly fuck life I don't even like people or existing what's the point.Talking to a therapist isn't helping because they don't understand the pain I went through. My mom exploited me online to pedophiles where there were spy cameras watching me change, use the bathroom, shower, eat, phone and laptop were tapped. There was a chatroom where they said things about my body as a minor which traumatized me. Saying my boobs are far apart, I have nipple hair, or saying that they like small breasted women. They saw me topless because of my mom, I just can't deal with this pain on my own. Being sexualized as a kid and molested by my brother has really destroyed me mentally. Constantly dissaociating .I go to bed or take a nap to take the depression away then end up waking up depressed. The cycle continues, everyday is the same. It's so painful. Living with no hope just darkness and pain.I feel so worthless because all my family practically abused me so I'm nc with them. I sometimes speak with my dad but I feel so worthless since I never got the love I needed as a child. I get so depressed seeing loving families or people close to my age being supported by their families. I have no one. Just abuse and pain. I hate that I keep attracting creeps whenever I go outside. Even making friends with people who are sociopaths. I've given up on interacting with people.I'm numb. I just can't do it anymore. No one cares about me and people are so horrible and unreliable. I'm just so done. I don't know why I haven't committed suicide yet. I need to stop being scared and do it. I suffer from so much worthlessness. Idc anymore I'm sick of living in this planet.. You drive in your car and see a condom billboard, you watch TV and see random sex scenes, you go on your phone and see half naked women/men on your screen, you go to the grocery store and see a magazine while waiting in line of a half naked celebrity. People constantly make sexual jokes about everything. I hate how the word daddy is used sexually. I hate how breast are meant to nurse a child but are used sexually. I hate how sick these people are, especially those that create pornography. Im tired of seeing women overly sexualized themselves online then claim to be objectified. I hate how beaches nowadays are just pornography. I'm just so sick of all this over sexualization.I was molested by my brother and sexually exploited online by my mother. Recently, I went out to dinner and caught my uncle staring at my breast. Now I'm having memories of waking up at 6 years old to my underwear being pulled down to my knees. It's like everyone wants to molest me or commit incest on me. I'm sick of it. I don't even know why I exist on this planet. Women are so mean. I deal with too many creeps. I'm done.I'm just so sick of everything. I'm so tired of living in this stimulation. Everyday is the same. It's so depressing. I've experienced too much trauma early in life, there's no reason for me to keep going. Too much pain to heal from. I just want a truck or car to run me over. No one cares about me. I want to feel cared about, since I never got that as a child but no one could care less. It's time for me to go.. This world is so messed up, sure you may experience happiness once in a while if you're lucky but the rest is just suffering. It's pointless. I stalk my peers on LinkedIn seeing how successful there are, meanwhile I'm extremely depressed suffering from PTSD and anxiety due to all the childhood trauma I experienced. I can barely function on a day to day basis. I see all these young kids grow up in loving families go off to college, have the time of their life get into a relationship while I'm the unlucky one who was born into a shitty fucking family. I deal with all these triggers, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts because I was born into this nightmare called family. I dream what it would've been like to be born into a nurturing family.My dissociation is getting worse and it could be due to the fact I've completely isolated myself. Everytime I step outside or even drive everything feels unreal. I don't feel alive or present. I don't know what to do at this point. It could be a part of my healing journey but it's not safe for me to dissociate everytime I go outside.Every time I have the courage to go outside there's always something. I'm so sick of dealing with rude employees when it's their job to help the customer. I'm so sick of dealing with bad drivers not caring about others dying in a car accident. I'm so sick of dealing with nasty women. I'm sick of dealing with creepy men. I'm sick of people being rude/mean for no reason. I'm so tired of existing on this planet.. I was molested by my brother as a teen and sexually exploited by my mother online as a teen as well. There's this memory I have in my head of when I was 6, I'd always wake up in the middle of the night to pull my underwear back up because someone had pushed it down to my knee. Idk if this is an actual memory or something my brain made up? There is one thing though my narcisstic mother always said she'd hear me in my sleep yell the word stop. Honestly, idk if I was abused as a kid by my brother as well?. I was molested by my brother as a teen and sexually exploited by my mother online.

Idk if this is an actual memory or something my brain made up? There is one thing though my narcisstic mother always said she'd hear me in my sleep yell the word stop. Honestly, idk if I was abused as a kid by my brother as well?. Not only from my personal experience but from other former ex Christians they've all been victim shamed by Christians. It's like they love abusers. I'm so sick of their fucked up belief system saying to pray for the abusers salvation. I had a pastor pray for my abusers salvation after a lady on a small group told him without my permission what this person did to me. They're fucking insane. Christianity triggers my PTSD and so does the fairytale book called the bible. If there's a so called god out there id tell it fuck you for creating this shitty planet with so much suffering. I'd rather worship the devil because at least the devil doesn't kill thousands of people if they don't "obey".Idk what to do. I disassociate a lot almost immediately when I go outside. I've been scared to take meds but at this point I can't control my anxiety I need something. The dissociation is from my trauma and i can't control it. I feel like I can't even live at this point.My brother who is older than me molested me when I was 8,12, and 13 . This is one of the biggest causes of my disassociation because of the incest. How could you use your own siblings body for your pleasure!? Even animals know not to commit incest! I'm so traumatized idk if I'll ever heal completely even tho I'm away from that. I feel so betrayed. I hate how there's so much incest porn subreddits here on reddit!. I don't want to be here I constantly disassociate and only find peace in isolation. I can't be outside with people I get severe anxiety. I'm so miserable. People treat me so poorly I'm such an outcast in society. I have no one to turn to. It just seems like if you're a good person in this cruel world it'll hate you.Cheerleaders walk around in skimpy outfits to cheer on the fully clothed football players. Sure there are male cheerleaders but they have pants on while the women are dancing with skirts that are so short. Like how are we as a society okay with young girls in high school with short skirts dancing like that? Now modeling just has women walk a runway half naked or even with barely anything on. Not always the case but the stuff that goes behind the scenes with these models it's like they are just being objects. What are your thoughts??. I see these nature videos of elephants walking as a family, the mother protecting their child at all costs. Then, I compare to my life how my own mother who is not an elephant did the complete opposite and made sure my life was torture. Even animals are better parents than mine and they don't even have as much knowledge of the world as we do! It makes me depressed.. Today I attended a support meeting and got triggered by a person who talked about their child going off to college. It hurt me because she cares for her child and is willing to take time and effort to make sure her child goes to the school of her dreams. Hearing this gave me a crying spell because I never got any love from either of my parents while growing up just pain and abuse. When I see loving families I get so depressed, it's hard to control my emotions. Not having a family really does mess you up for life.Today I attended a support meeting and got triggered by a person who talked about their child going off to college.

They can make better money in other careers instead of taking their clothes off. Same with only fans. It's quite sad that people pay money to see others naked. You can't control yourself?. During my sessions when I tell my therapist about the trauma I've experienced in my life she becomes teary eyed. Yes this shows she's empathetic but it also makes me sad knowing how much pain and trauma I've experienced in life. Has anyone else made their therapist cry?. I was scrolling through LinkedIn looking at a former hs friend and seeing how successful her life is so far. She was mean to me in high school and ditched me when I didn't make the high school cheerleading team with her. And now she has her degree and a career going. I had to drop out of college because I couldn't take the abuse anymore. And me I'm suffering from all the trauma from my family and the way people have treated me poorly. While she's a mean evil women but is successful .Life is just so unfair. Gosh can't I just die. I was just thinking about this...the amount of porn that's on the internet is quite disturbing and disgusting. It shows how gross humanity is. The sad part is people who are married watch these videos. Teens watch it because they think it's "normal" . There's more porn and weird kinky communities on reddit than there is on this subreddit. I find it insane how many explicit images there are in the internet. People can't control themselves.I can't remember much of my childhood unless I see a picture of myself. I cannot think of memories from my childhood at all it's like a blur. Idk if it's because of my CPTSD or what. Anyone experience this?. If there is a so called god why would it put me on this planet to suffer? I've been sexualized my entire life, abused, molested, exploited and I'm supposed to be okay with all this pain? I'm supposed to exist on this shitty ass planet and just be strong? Why was I put here? Why did I have to suffer? I've done nothing wrong.
    I feel like all my problems are cancers on me which are killing me, and everything I'm doing to correct them (like running or exercising or forcing myself to be social or doing therapy or trying to make friends) is my chemo which takes its own toll and just wipes me out and leaves me drained and eventually I just want to quit but if I quit then my cancers will just start again so I have to grit my teeth and get up and keep going even when I see minimal or no results for my effort.I sometimes fantasize about if when my grandparents die (don't want them to, but they're in their late seventies, it'll happen some day) if I inherit a bit of money from them, maybe I could buy a few acres in Montana where I don't know anyone and quit my job and move away. I could get some little job I don't care about that's not going anywhere (looked at job sites to fill this fantasy in, there's a courthouse job I would qualify for) and just do my job then go home and maybe even raise a calf or something. I grew up on a farm so I have a little knowledge about animals. In my fantasy I just go to work then go home and basically see no one outside of work. And then in winter I sit by my little stove and read a book and I don't have to do anything for the rest of my life except read and think and walk in the woods. Nice dream. We have been best friends for four years now, literally talk every day unless work gets in the way. Been long distance for the last three years. But since he got a girlfriend he talks to me almost s quarter of the amount before. He hasn't even opened our chat in five days. I just miss him.Three times in my life I was completely miserable, everything was falling apart, I had no hope of it getting better, and I was obviously giving off every red flag that I was not ok at all. Only one of my friends in one of those times went out of his way to check on me (best person I know). Every other time even the people I was friendly with were just like "ew". I had a girlfriend during one of those times and she straight up told me "you need to get your stuff together so you stop making your problems other people's problems". I'm doing better now and rarely have bad days. But it really drove home that absolutely no one cares about guys who aren't super hot or super cool or have money. I don't think I'm being bitchy or complaining as a man too much, it's been my experience that if you don't have something they want (muscles, fun personality to entertain them) no one cares about you, both men and women. For the record I'm bi and I've experienced this both from men and women so this isn't me hating women. Long shot but I can't find any match for this movie. I think it released between 2000-2013 by the style I remember. It was set in the west and the m.c. is a white guy who starts the movie flirting with a prostitute who then dies in a fire when he gets into an argument with the next guy who wants to... Hire the prostitute. It then jumps forward and there's something about a white guy and black guy wanting to go into a nearby reservation (which is all green surrounded by desert, I think there might be a fantasy/magic element to the movie) anyway the black guy is killed by the Indians who get his horse and ride up on him carrying his gun. That's all I really remember any ideas??? It's driving me crazy. I saw only parts of it as a kid on I think the western channel.I only had one really good relationship and it ended 5 fuckin years ago. I try to interact with people and the last person I tried talking to told a mutual friend to tell me to stop. Wouldn't even talk to me directly even tho I didn't do anything weird or crazy. Honestly asking how can I do 50 more years as isolated as my last five have been. I just wanted someone to care about me and to love me and that I could love. I've recently started running again, and it's going very well; I'm up to running thirty minutes at a time, and I've lost four pounds in four weeks, so I'm on schedule. I started out at 190 pounds (I'm five foot nine), so I know that I'm doing ok. But I keep feeling like I'm disgusting. I gained a lot of weight right after graduating college because I was in an emotionally abusive relationship and kind of gave up. Anyway, I developed a double chin then and still have it, even though I have lost around forty pounds since then. Overall I just can't shake the feeling that no matter how much progress I make I'll still just be disgusting to everyone. I want to get better though. Let me know if not allowed, but I thought this group would enjoy this post; I like to write alternate history short stories as a hobby, and a friend of mine and I were recently trying to imagine a world where instead of issuing the 1890 manifesto halting polygamy, the Mormon church chose to migrate to Argentina in order to practice their religion uncensored by the United States government (We chose Argentina because Argentina had very liberal immigration policies in the last quarter of the 19th century, accepted large amounts of European immigrants, and there was a frontier of sorts, which would allow the Mormons some level of freedom). Our basic premise is that the church would develop into a more conservative, intolerant direction in this scenario, continuing the priesthood ban for black members, continuing polygamy, etc. Also, we're envisioning a militant strain in this scenario, where the immigrants are arming themselves as much as possible in order to ensure that this is their last retreat.I am not an ex-mormon, so was mostly looking for cultural elements I might be missing; How do former members think the church could have developed had it not been drug along by American culture into a more liberal direction? Could rights for women have deteriorated to the point that they were treated like they are now in the FLDS (where marriages are arranged)? How would a frontier society be governed, completely by the church? Who could have taken over the church instead of Wilford Woodruff to make this scenario a possibility? Or is this scenario completely unrealistic? If there's a more appropriate sub for this post let me know.I feel like all my problems are cancers on me which are killing me, and everything I'm doing to correct them (like running or exercising or forcing myself to be social or doing therapy or trying to make friends) is my chemo which takes its own toll and just wipes me out and leaves me drained and eventually I just want to quit but if I quit then my cancers will just start again so I have to grit my teeth and get up and keep going even when I see minimal or no results for my effort.I don't know why my ex simultaneously could never get mad at her old "best friend" for date-raping her when she passed out at a party but also hated me for our small normal relationship problems. I don't know why everyone I meet seems to assume I'm a loser. I hate existing.Maybe I'll feel better when I wake up in two hours for a job I hate with coworkers who make no attempt to hang out with me outside of work.
    I don't know how to stop being so jealous and beating myself up when other people get compliments, I always feel so ugly when anyone around me gets complimented and I don't. It makes me feel like I'm some sort of weird and ugly creature or something, and that everyone else is better than me. I just want to cry and isolate myself from everyone.Does anyone else experience this? Like you want to feel excited about something, for example a holiday or even a meal you're going to have the next day, but your mind tells you that you shouldn't because something bad is going to happen, and it makes you anxious and you cannot enjoy the holiday or meal you were excited about? I experience this every time I get excited about something now, and not only does it give me anxiety, it makes me feel depressed.Recently I've had such bad anxiety attacks, I had it under good control these past few months, but now after getting covid for the first time, this anxiety is back and it feels terrible. I lost track of how many times I've checked my blood pressure and oxygen because the anxiety literally makes it feel as if my body is shutting down. I really hope I can get it under control again, I seriously cannot live like this. So far lately the only time I can escape the anxiety is when I'm sleeping, so I want to sleep all day long because being up and alert feels awful, but I know I cannot sleep all day because it's going to make the anxiety even worse for the times I am awake...I just don't know what to do, I'm scared these anxiety attacks are going to stay coming frequently. I feel so exhausted already.I know that it is said out of concern, but it makes me feel so uncomfortable and upset, it makes me feel like I am a failure and that I am disgusting. It's so difficult for me to gain weight due to my unstable relationship with food, and my strange appetite that is constantly changing from high to low due to anxiety. I just hate being this way, I hate hearing people telling me I'm too skinny or that I'm losing weight when I'm trying my best to do the opposite. I hate this, wish I could fix everything and make everyone proud. I don't know what to do anymore, this feels so hopeless.Anxiety has really been messing with me lately. I currently have covid, so it feels even worse. I start to panic over any negative sensation I feel in my body. My mind is having the worst thoughts and I don't know how to calm down, deep breaths and meditation aren't working. Even though my symptoms are slowly subsiding, the anxiety is non stop and I'm sick and tired of this already, I just want to be and feel okay.I don't understand, why do I find the flaws I have as beautiful on other people, but I feel so wrong looking and I don't feel beautiful? There is something really wrong with me, I'm exhausted.I always find something wrong with me and I obsess over it badly. No matter what I do, no matter how I look, I always find something wrong. I change up my look a lot, and at first I actually feel a bit pretty, then I keep looking at myself and everything becomes distorted, and days later I feel disgusting and I keep studying myself in the mirror to see what the problem is, and I try to change my look again and again in hopes that it's just the looks I'm choosing that are the problem, when it is not. My face and body is the problem.Usually I just get slight pains, clicking, popping noises and my jaw almost locks when chewing and opening my mouth too wide. But now this time it actually feels locked and I haven't been able to completely open my jaw for a couple hours now...I'm only able to open up 2 fingers wide, sometimes 4 if I relax and massage my jaw. I was able to fully open up a few times but it was difficult and I could feel and hear big pops...I had been shivering a lot and clenching my teeth due to being ill with a sore throat + mild fever, so I'm suspecting that all the shivering and clenching messed with my jaw since those are my main triggers for tmj. There is no redness or visible swelling and there is only some pain when chewing and popping when I try fully opening my jaw or moving it to the left. Is there any way I can help unlock my jaw, do I just have to wait it out and keep monitoring in case it gets worse or do I need to go to the emergency room now? I'm very anxious...Currently sick with a fever, slight cough, headache + body aches and sore throat. I haven't had a fever in years, so I can't seem to relax. It's been nearly 24 hours that I've had a fever around 99-101, I know the average time to relieve a fever is 3-5 days, but I am still so scared. My body aches have shown improvement over night, and I'm not vomiting or sweating either but I can't convince myself enough that I'll be okay, and I'm terrified of going to the hospital for the fear of doctors finding something really bad or my symptoms being quite normal for an infection, so it'll be a waste of time and money. I also don't want to bother anyone to take me...I just really hope I get better but im having so much anxious thoughts.I feel like a failure of a daughter watching my parents become ill and age, and become less happier and more stressed. I feel like it's my fault. Seeing them now compared to 6 years ago hurts me so much, seeing other people around my age on the path of success, being able to support their parents and still having healthy parents makes me want to cry, I envy them. And it's not that I want different parents at all, I just wish I could go back in time and change my ways so I wouldn't be so anxious about everything and depressed, I wish I could go back and change my state of mind and actually become something in life so this stress wouldn't have happened in the first place. It's harder to get help now with all my issues, I struggle a lot with trying to push myself to be better. Sometimes I wish I was never born to eliminate the stress I cause.Does anyone else's vision and hearing get super weird when you have anxiety? I can't describe it well but it feels like colors are less pigmented and you can't hear 100%? It sends me into panic and makes me feel like I'm going to pass out...Genuinely feel like I'm going insane trying not to self harm. Like I've literally been rocking myself back and forth and shaking crying on and off because I'm trying so hard not to self harm. Even though I threw away the main thing I used to self harm, I know there's many objects I can hurt myself with and I'm fighting the urge to grab them and fighting the urge to just hit myself and pull my hair out instead. I can barely take it anymore I don't know how to get rid of my thoughts. I can't help but compare myself to other women. I always find a way to make myself feel disgusting and feel like I'm not enough. It has gotten worse ever since issues I've had with my partner where I caught them watching sexual content, and they would post other women, like photos and videos of other women and even complimented other women a few times in flirtatious ways. I let this slide so many times until I had enough and the relationship I had with my body, and with them was deeply suffering. I finally spoke about this all, and they have been completely understanding and aware how their actions have made me feel, they have changed to respect me now and we're both willing to work with each other through this. But my feelings have not changed. I still compare myself to every woman and I never feel enough. I'm incredibly insecure, I'm in constant pain, I don't know what to do anymore, I feel disgusted with my body and my face. It's gotten to points where I resorted to self harm. Everything is just so wrong, I feel completely lost and I don't know what to do, all I do is let myself down and cry and hurt myself. I try to love myself but it feels so fake.Recently I relapsed after 5 months of not self harming. Before I had only self harmed when my emotions would be very high and intolerable, and most of the time I would not cause myself to bleed because I couldn't take the pain, but now after this relapse I've been breaking skin easier, and I self harm even if my emotions are tolerable and I know I could do other healthy things to help me and it isn't worth it to hurt myself. And also I just want to cover up my old scars because it hurts me to look at the word I cut into my skin, so I figured the only way I can cover it is to keep cutting on top of this, and ultimately this has been fueling me to keep harming myself. I want to stop again though, and for good this time because it only seems to get worse and more dangerous, but I can't bring myself to stop and throw away what I've been using to hurt myself, my mind thinks about self harm every second of the day again and I can't stand it.EDIT: I threw what I used away and I feel happy about it for now.After around 5+ months I relapsed. I started self harming again on September 28, I told myself after this time I wouldn't do it again, but I did it again today. I hate my old scars being a constant reminder of the bad memories and pain I felt then, so in my mind if I cover the old scars with new ones, it won't be as painful to look at. This thought has fueled me to start self harming again, on top of my feelings and nothing healthy helping me as well as it used to.Literally every time things seem to be going okay and I feel stable, something happens to mess everything up. It's like the universe hates me. I'm so sick and tired of this, all my life things have been this way. Now I'm scared whenever I feel okay or I have my happy moments, because I already know something is going to happen to screw everything up and I have to spend those "happy" moments preparing for the worst to come. I'm so fed up and I don't know how much longer I can take this. I'm angry, I'm upset, I'm so fucking tired and I don't know what to do anymore.Today is the first day I've had a difficult day with showering. I refused to look at my body, and I felt disgusted and upset having to touch it to wash myself. I avoided certain areas because of how much I was disgusted, I still can't even look at my body. I had to do everything with my eyes closed or just looking elsewhere. I was just on and off crying, and even trying to hit myself. This is the first time I couldn't even look at my body.BDD is driving me crazy. I really cannot stand this anymore. I am so jealous of other's, I'm jealous of every girl he may see or interact with. And in my mind, I'm making up these scenarios where he goes behind my back to seek romantic attention from other girls and leaves me for someone he finds more attractive, and that could literally any other person because in my mind I am wrong looking and just icky to look at. Recently he posted something, and a girl commented and he liked her comment and even replied back to it, it was nothing even close to flirty but in my mind he finds me ugly and he doesn't like me anymore. Even just when he posts I get a rush of anxiety and dread, and I check who likes it and I get jealous if there's girls there, especially if he follows them back. ( I should note here that we've been through things in the past that have made this anxiety worse for me, regarding what he would post, like and comment on, for example he'd post and like pictures and video's of girls showing their bodies off sexually...I've set my boundaries now though and he has been supportive and respectful, I'm just still trying to heal from this )...They're always so beautiful and I could never compare. I keep this part mostly to myself though, I never talk about this with him because I know I sound crazy, there's no reason for me to think this way anymore. I just wish I was beautiful then I wouldn't be so jealous and this wouldn't ever be a problem.I haven't felt this bad in a while, I was doing okay, but now I'm feeling bad about myself again. I'm starting to compare myself to others like I used to, which was pretty extreme. I just feel so insecure and ugly, even with makeup on I don't even come close to compare to these beautiful people. I hate my facial features, I hate my body, everything looks so crooked and wrong. I'm so exhausted from thinking about my appearance, and I can feel the suicidal thoughts coming in again, I know I won't do anything but I wish I could stop this because this is awful. I just wish I was beautiful.Does anyone else feel like your head is shaking and vibrating while you're trying to fall asleep? I notice this usually happens when I feel really tired, or afraid and anxious...it feels so weird and you could even hear the intensity of the vibrations. I hate it so much, it freaks me out...My health anxiety has been so bad lately, I believe I have every rare disease known to man. I literally thought I was having a heart attack earlier or that I may have heart disease or some sort of bone cancer because sometimes I get random chest, back and shoulder pains at times. Also today I've been getting a bit if a sharp pain here and there again in my left abdomen so automatically I'm thinking I have ovarian cancer. Also, recently I had two rounds of lab work done and one of my vitamins was a bit low both times, so automatically I'm assuming I have lupus or something. It's just too much to fully explain and go over, but I hate living like this because I have all these health concerns daily, yet I cannot even make another doctors appointment for myself because my health and social anxiety is clashing. I'm terrified that I'm sick, but I'm so scared to get seen again and have all my concerns be known. Can anyone else relate to this?. Would it be stupid to ask someone if they have been actively respecting your boundaries? I've been thinking of asking my partner if they have been respecting me even behind my back...but maybe that is a silly question? I think I just need reassurance that my boundaries are not being crossed and I'm not being disrespected, and the first thing that popped into my head was that...should I actually ask this, or is there a better way to go about it?. I get nauseous every day, and recently it's been multiple times a day and I'm sick and tired of it. I'm 99.9% sure it is because of my anxiety, I just hate that it's getting worse again. For the past 3/4 months it's steadily been getting worse. Usually it happens in public and such, but now it's like even if I don't have an anxious thought, or if Im at home I will become nauseous out of nowhere. This is stressing me out so badly I can barely take this anymore. I don't know how to reach out for professional help but I'm getting worse. In 2021 I started developing an eating disorder because I don't have a good relationship with my body. Although I still have low self esteem and wish I looked differently, I thought I had gotten passed the eating disorder part by now, I don't purposely restrict myself from food anymore but now that I'm trying to fully recover and eat more, I don't have much of an appetite because of the stress this has put on me. I want to eat, I want to gain weight again but it's so difficult. It's difficult to open up about this to anyone I know because I don't want to feel like a burden, and I don't want anyone to worry about me, but I'm so scared and I feel so stressed out because I keep losing weight and I'm starting to lack vitamins. I hate this so much, and I hate myself for not being able to do better for myself, I feel so depressed and anxious. I have certain triggers, but they're so ridiculous and it's all me being jealous and having really low self esteem. My bf could post a video edit or slideshow or whatever it's called, and it could have even just one second of a girl in it, and my stomach starts to hurt and I automatically feel ugly and I get disgusted with myself. I then watch it over and over again just for that and I compare myself to the point where I just break down and get so upset. I don't want to even mention how I feel about this because I feel like I'm crazy and maybe even controlling for feeling this way about something so small. I just wish I wasn't so jealous because this is not okay :(. i feel depressed and stressed out, i can barely even eat, im nauseous and im tired and all i can think are negative thoughts. im getting the urge to self harm again right now because usually it helps me snap out of feeling bad but I don't want to do this. i just want to feel better. This is so embarrassing, but the thought of going to the dmv and getting my picture taken is killing me. I NEED to go, I'm already passed due for getting an ID. Not only is just my anxiety holding me back, but the fact that I'll have to get my picture taken is really holding me back. I don't even want to see how it comes out, because I already know it's going to be really bad and I'm going to obsess over how bad it is. I don't know what to do...Like for real...I don't think I'm imagining anything, I know I'm not imagining anything. I've seen myself many times, I've looked in the mirror countless times, taken pictures and videos of myself in every angle, I've mirrored it all, flipped it in all directions, It's just how I look...my face and body is crooked and weird looking. I just cannot stop obsessing over trying to fix it and hating it.This sucks so much, my anxiety has been bad today to the point I feel sick. I've been feeling weak and nauseous especially because my anxiety hasn't let me eat well. My stomach feels so gross right now and it's making me feel super anxious :( I hope I can sleep this out for the night and be better tomorrow.i just can't. i can't take it anymore. i miss the stinging feeling, i feel so alone. My mind has been a huge mess these past couple of days. i wish i could talk about this with a family member, or my partner or a friend. i just don't want to worry any of them.I feel like a disgusting person for being jealous of someone else's trauma. Yes I know this sounds so messed up, I don't know why I would ever think this way, I think maybe it's just my way of wanting attention or something, but it's so wrong and I hate myself for this. Does anyone else go through the same thing?. I feel miserable and disgusted by being jealous of what others have. Every time I see a couple being affectionate with each other, like telling compliments and such, I roll my eyes and try not to cry. It makes me feel so ugly, and it's so embarrassing. I'm in a relationship myself, I love my partner and I know my partner loves me too. I just get jealous because I want to hear compliments from my partner, like i see others being complimented by their partners. It just feels good to hear them and it even helps me feel a little bit better. But I feel stupid because ever since my BDD and anxiety has worsened, I haven't been able to send pictures of myself or anything ( we are long distance ) so how can I even expect to be complimented in the first place? I hate this so much and i feel selfish for feeling this way. I don't know what to do and I wish I didn't struggle with BDD.I know it might sound stupid but i just do not like the way that i look, i never really have and it's gotten worse now to the point where i have self harmed. Ive been clean for 3 months now but I'm feeling the urges come back again and i don't know what to do. I wish i could talk about this with a loved one but i can't because i don't want them to worry or stress about me, I just want these urges and thoughts to go away.I don't know why, but I feel like I fake all of my feelings, or like I shouldn't be feeling certain ways about things. Like even right now I feel like I'm faking feeling this way, as if it's just me exaggerating and attention seeking. This makes it really difficult for me to express my feelings because for example, if I feel sad about something I'll automatically think that i'm either faking the way I feel, or that I'm wrong for feeling sad if that makes sense. Does anyone else experience this? It makes me so confused and I'm tired of this.
    Can anyone recommend an affordable and comprehensive (psychology , psychiatry, dental, optometrist) medical aid that maybe offers lower rates for students? Thanks!. My partner keeps asking me why I can't just do things when I'm depressed. I don't know how to explain it, anyone else have some idea?. I've just started Sanderson's new book, and I'm a big confused. Maybe I'm an idiot, but what is the relevance of the cannonballs that don't have water and therefore don't cause the spores to grow? How is that responsible for killing the crew?Sorry of its a dumb question Thanks!. So my partner and I have been together for about 4 years, and I've told him I'm interested in trying some Dom/sub type playing.Neither of us have much experience with BDSM, and are pretty vanilla.Any tips please?. Any German clubs or speakers in Pretoria? I'm German second language and looking to practice speaking a little 😅. Hi everyone! I wanted to know if anyone is using the bokashi "tea" as fertiliser for the plants, and if it's working for you?. I was doing some reading and it looks like childhood trauma can often results in what appears to be level 1 autism symptoms. I.e. antisocial behaviour, hyper vigilance in social situations, comforting, repetitive movements (stimming) and so on.I guess my question is is there a way to know if it's trauma or autism? Or both?Thanks!.
    Im a really submissive man in bed, the thing is, everything a woman wants Is a man thats the one in control, im not saying that dominant women do not exist, but what can someone so many people desire see in a fucking loser like me? I hate myself for something I cant control, its so frustating, I wish I was a women, or either the perfect girl for me actually existed, whatever, its not like I can do anyrhing about It except trash myself. My moms boyfriend bullies me everyday with the excuse "thats his personality" but as soon as i say he did something wrong everyone will yell at me how much of a horrible person i am, yeah sure, and telling me for the 5th time today im a piece of trash its fine, isnt it mom? I fucking hate you all, its somewhat fun at this point, not even when i tried to kill myself a month ago they were nice to me, in fact, everyone hated me even more, im so tired, but hey, guess what? You dont care either, do you?. I stopped her only because i got to contact her parents right on time, but im still scared i wont be there next time, im suicidal myself and know how awful it is, i want to let her know that shes not alone, but i know im not the right person to help her. She said we could have a virtual meeting today, and i agreed, but its been over half an hour and i havent got a response from her yet, she just left me waiting like the idiot i am, so, if even her does this to me, what does that tell me? Im worthless, not even my therapist wants to help me anymore, im tired, i had to sell my gaming setup to make mom happy but even that didnt make her happy, i cant continue, i just cant. I stole money from my family and now im paying it back, im mad at myself about that, my dad, who left when my brother was born, told me to take care of my actions even thought he didnt take care of his own sons for all their lifes, im mad at my grandma to keep believing that the stupid motherfucker of jesus will come and save my from this dark spot, im mad because mom keeps giving up hope on me actually being a happy productive person, oh yeah, forgot she canceled Internet and sold my pc, which were my only distraction from the constant suicidal thoughts, and now im left with just my phone and some mobile data left, and also, to all the people saying its worth living, fuck you all, life is misery, i should just end it, but whatever, i guess i dont have the balls to have my mom yelling curse words at me at the hospital again, thanks for reading, i guess. Even people in "amiguly" told me in ugly af, i wont ever get into a relationship and that makes me so depressed i wanna kms, and EVEN if by some miracle i get a woman, it wont matter because i wont have sex with her because of my weird kinks and fetishes, so i wont satisfy her and she will dump me, its just, i cant get a job, cant continue with my studies, and family wants me to work and study at the same time or i will get kicked out of the house, im losing my sanity and dont know what to do, right now im in a bazaar pretending everythings okay so people buy my stuff but i havent sold enough to satisfy my family, im going to live in the streets soon, im going to die alone, nobody will ever care about me, its just one dissapointment after the other, i hate myself and i hate this fucking world. She told me in destined to fail in life because i cant get out of my depressive state, if the person that loves the most gave up on me, what hope i have left?. I went through with it, and failed, everyone in my family hates me because of what i did, and want to internate me in a hospital, so, you know, whatever i guess, also, im mexican, so i dont have all the options you got in the USA, i hate myself and i hate everything in life right now. Stole 100 bucks from grandma and she noticed (used her debit card) and now I feel so guilty I wanna kill myself more now than ever, today is my birthday so is kinda sad that the day after ill be gone but whatever I guess, also, im way too coward to take on the consequences of my actions, so this is the only way out, shes going to the bank tomorrow, and when shes gone im gonna do it, If you want to say something kind to me this is your moment and If you dont, I still thank you for passing by and reading this, have a good one.Ive been living with a parasite aka my aunt who keeps making our life worse and worse, and I thought of having a controlled overdose and say in my suicide note "MY AUNT HAS TO GO" idk, what do u think?. Im tired, dont wanna study, have a job, im too pathethic to have a girlfriend, If no one answers my call for help here in the next hour the truly no one cares about me and I have no excuse to not kill myself. Went to a naturalist today, and he told me to abandon the medicine ive been taking for over a year because "they are a drug that does not help me" and my mom believed him, so now im supposed to get better with fucking homeopathy, great! I dont know what to say, im probably just gonna try to kill myself again soon just to prove everyone this is not the way, but what do you think?. Tell me why I shouldnt kill myself tonight, or tomorrow, why I shouldnt? My friends dont care about me, I dont have a girlfriend, my family wants to throw me away in a pshyciatrist hospital like the piece of trash I am, I dont know what the hell its wrong with me and why things arent getting bettet, I just wanna die so bad, I dont wanna live anymore. No girlfriend, no friends, I dont get out of my house, dont have a job, dont go to school, even failed to kill myself a year ago, im ugly, pathethic, worthless, uninteresting, stupid, and a fucking liar, I dont vent with anyone except on reddit, where no one fucking cares, so you know, im not good at anything, im just a complete failure in life, and im only 17 years old.I just see so many pills in there, ready for me to have another overdose and maybe this time actually kms. No girlfriend, no friends, I dont get out of my house, dont have a job, dont go to school, even failed to kill myself a year ago, im ugly, pathethic, worthless, uninteresting, stupid, and a fucking liar, I dont vent with anyone except on reddit, where no one fucking cares, so you know, im not good at anything, im just a complete failure in life, and im only 17 years old.I ruined everyones life by just existing, my mom wanted to go to Europe but no, I had to be fucking born, my dad didnt even assist to my birth, and even this accept me as his son, I now live with grandma, my mom, my younger brother, my moms boyfriends who bullies me all the time and my mom does not care and only calls me exagerated and that hes only playing with me when in reality he says really hurtful things, and my aunt, who has been a parassite in our lives for the past few months, but nobody cares how I feel, because If I tell anyone im just "being dramatic" when in reality I live constantly scared of my own mother because she used to scare me when I was 4 just for fun you know? Also, my mom used to hit me too but of course she "doesnt remember" and the list could keep on going but I think you get the picture, my friends havent sent me a single message to see how im doing, since ive been not going to school, im starting to believe nobody cares about me, I want to cry, I want a hug, i want a girlfriend that tells me everything its going to be ok, I want a lot of things, but even god hinself, If he even existes, hates me, thanks for reading, but, I dont want to keep going.Anyone else here is into women that are wearing karate gi and are barefoot? Because oh god, I love them so much, and I feel this is the right place to talk about this fetish. I fucking hate every single bit of myself so much is unbearable, but I cant be honest about it because my therapist is gonna force me pinto family therapy, and I fucking hate it, my only other option is internate, which I also hate the idea of, dude, sometimes i just wanna die so bad but no, of course not, nobody cares about my opinion or what I want, they only want whats "bettet for me" im bettet just dead, but whatever, im not the one who has control over his own pathethic little life right?. I just wanna kms, but If I comment It to anyone they want to internate me, great solution mom, idk what to do, im tired of fighting and just want to listen to the voices and get over with this shit, but I know that If I try it its gonna get worse, and only worse, nothing gets bettet, ever, OH COME ON NO ONE IS GONNA CARE ABOUT THIS POST ANYWAYS, ah, I just feel sick, like im a worthless piece of trash, a feeling of inferority to women, and that I have to worship every women I see to make up for this social diferecence, I have weird kinks, im a virgin, I dont have any real friends, come on, I even lost my minecraft account, the only thing that distracted me from suicidal thoughts, im a complete failure, I deserve nothing but suffering, punishment, and death. I need your help, I got ratted and its telling me my Microsoft account does not exist, what can I do in this case?. I cant with this anymore, im a taller, a thief, a liar, a manipulative person and in general a horrible human being, I haré myself and want to kill myself everyday, im a worthless piece of trash who only deserves to die in the most painful way possible, but ola, someone kill me already because I dont have the balls to try it again. I cant with this anymore, im a taller, a thief, a liar, a manipulative person and in general a horrible human being, I haré myself and want to kill myself everyday, im a worthless piece of trash who only deserves to die in the most painful way possible, but ola, someone kill me already because I dont have the balls to try it again. Ive been searching for the past few days and still nothing, I dont think you can pirate this game can you?. Ive tried a lot and I cant find the right link, but im really interested into the game, I just thought this might be the place to ask you know?. Tried taking an overdose 2 weeks ago on monday, and it went so horribly wrong, aparently im not even good enough for killing myself huh, took 40 pills in total, it made effect in like 5 minutes, and the nearest hospital was an hour away, and somehow im still alive, my family wants me to be happy but right now my life is way worse than before, i cant do any of my hobbies, and i cant even go to school, i dont know how im supposed to pass this semester without going, im tired, i just wanna listen to some music or play some videogames but surprise i cant because mom wont let me do it. Ive hurt so many good people, and im pretty sure i ruined the life of my crush, and how the fuck im supposed to be happy if everything i do everyday its stare at the roof while my mind its being invaded by my own thoughts? i want my life to be over, i want to die, its a "miracle" im still alive and i hate it. So basically a friend and my crush was in my friend group and I stalked her, like a lot, I still have an unhealthy and creepy obsession with her, and that made her separate from the rest of us, which sucks because she has problems in her home and we were the escape from that toxic enviroment, and I ruined it for her, like, I was a complete jerk aswell. The thing is recently I confessed all of this to my friend group and blocked them of all social media, and since im a teenager, we only see eachother in school or in a hangout we organize. My crush blocked everyone on all social media aswell so I can contact her to tell her how sorry i am. No, theres no excuse to how I treated her and im fully aware im a complete bastard. Right now I feel like I dont deserve any friends if im going to treat them like that, so I pushed them aside, and yeah, thats pretty much it, I want to see what u think would be the best thing to do in my situation, I already tried to talk to them, and they werent angry at all with me, in fact, they wanted me to still be their friend, but I dont feel like I deserve them, and I pushed them aside again. If you dont understand anything, its because english its not my main language, its spanish, so if u need extra explanation in any of those languages I will give itEdit: OK so I feel like I need to give more details, i had depresion problems since I was a kid, and they only got worse with the time, im 16 years old aswell as my friends, and they know about my mental health situation. I had therapy for a year and it worked pretty well, but my mom couldnt keep paying therapy and I had to stop going, theres no free mental health services (at least that I know) in Mexico (im mexican) and I live in a little town thats an hour away from an actual city.My dms are open, or u can respond in here, whatever u want. If i dont respond inmediatly its because im taking a shower, or already went to bed, idk, just wanna let all of the shit in my head go, and for some reason its easier when its with a stranger in the Internet. So, uhmm, today was an interesting day for me. I recently started taking new medicine, and everyone was aware in case of any secondary effect, because this medicines are kinda strong (anti depressants btw), well, everyone except me. Today, I woke up, but it was already late for school, but I, being the smart person I am, decided not to take breakfast to get to school in time. My first class goes by, and I have a lot of free time, because the teacher of the next 2 hours didnt go. I decided to take breakfast, but instead of the usual place I go thats near the school, its pretty far, and since I dont own a car, I went walking. Midway there I feel a bit strange, but nothing I cant manage, so I keep walking. 10 seconds later I had a seizure and then passed out. Police came to the scene, called an ambulance and then my mother. So yeah, pretty rough day to be me, and even worse because the cops stole all the money that was in my wallet.TL;DR: Didnt take breakfast, had a seizure then passed out, and police came and stole my money before calling an ambulance. Jesus, i cant take life anymore, i tried talking to the school pshycologist, and that was a big mistake, beacuse now my mother knows about my problems, and i really didnt want to share them with her, and what was her reaction? Shes acting like if nothing happened and im happy with life, man im just tired. I have been going to therapy for a year now, i take my medicine and everything, but i just cant be happy, why is it so hard? I have this feeling that everybody hates me just for being myself, and thats kind of right, everyone sometimes like a part of myself, but no one loves me for who i am. I dont think im the best person alive, but i really dont like being ignored all the time in school. I had a crush, and i talked with her a few times, and then she started ignoring me, just like everyone else does. Yeah, i know i should have myself for motivation bla bla bla, but right now i just want someone that gives me geuine love, affection, anything, just someone that likes me for who i am, the entire me, not just the part thats convenient for them. I want a pillar to rely on, some person that actually wants to give me a hug, listen to my problems, let me cry without saying bullshit about me, just someone that actually loves me, thats too much to ask for? If not, then, why i dont have that person in my life? Im about to cry while writing this, and i really dont want anyone in my house see me cry, so ill stop here, but i really really need some genuine love, not someone that just uses me.I just dont have the will to keep going, im about to give up and just kill myself, I always have to pretend someone else because nobody likes the real me, not even my own family. Whats wrong with me? Why I cant be happy?. I dont know whats wrong with me, no one wants to stay nearby me, im so tired and I dont see a purpose for keep living, I dont get whats that thing that makes life beautiful, am i doing something wrong?. Im, I dont know if I can post this here, but i just wanted to ask, this is for women, so I have a fetish with girls that practice martial arts, like you know, domination and that stuff, and I just wanted to ask whats your opinion with that, I think this should be very uncomfortable and weird, and if thats the case, im sorry for being weird. In every video I see in youtube, when theres a martial arts between a woman and a man, the woman always wins, theres a reason for this? Also, im not into the wolrd of martial arts, but i think this is a good place to askEdit: OK ok, sorry for my ignorance, at least I understand that thats pure trash, ty strangers that know more of this world. Estoy algo apagado emocionalmente últimamente, y quería ver si podrían darme algún consejo.
    I just want hugs and kisses. I want snuggles and nuzzles. I can't stand being alone. I'm 23 and I'm just alone everyday. I can't even hop on social media or watch TV without being reminded of Happy couples or friends. I just want to cry everyday.
    I F/48(unmarried and UGLY AF) turn 49 next Sunday and I’m sincerely praying that I don’t make it to next week. I hope something or someone kills me by then. Perhaps I should’ve posted under Suicidal instead 🤔I can’t even afford to live on my own, because no matter how much money I make, the rent EVERYWHERE, is always JUST out of my reach!!! I’ve NEVER been in good health(since birth and it’s gotten MUCH WORSE) and I’m in excruciating pain 24/7 for the past 10 years. So working a second job is just not possible for me. I did it in my 20’s and nearly killed myself from the lack of sleep. My ENTIRE family HATES me because I’m ugly, and don’t make enough money to completely financially support them(why should I have to?! They’re NOT MY responsibility)I just want to live on my own! I do NOT want a roommate, because I can’t trust anyone! I took in a roommate once and they robbed me, so never again! My friends cut me off because I can’t afford to pay EXTRA money to let them continue to use my streaming services for free anymore) and apparently all I was good for, was to help them out. Rent is RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE EVERYWHERE!! Even a useless studio is $1500+ and I can’t even afford that(not that I even want a studio) no matter how much more money I make, where I could afford the place at its original asking price, the rent is ALWAYS raised to a point where it’ll ALWAYS be right out of my reach!! It’s BEYOND FRUSTRATING!!All I ever wanted for myself is to move down to Florida. I love it there. I love the warm weather, palm trees, and laidback lifestyle, but I can’t afford anything there…not even a total shit hole. I see people just move on a whim and make it work. Not me. I’m obviously the Fucking problem then, if I can’t even afford rent anywhere. So yeah, since I can’t even afford to be happy, what’s the point of living?! I FAILED MISERABLY!! FML 🤦🏻‍♀️.
    Does anyone else find it hard to justify working a horrible job that you hate? None of my friends really understand. I think a lot of people can tolerate shitty jobs because they like life otherwise or generally care about living. It seems pointless to do something for 40 hours a week to prolong my shitty existence. I'm as miserable at my job as I am when I'm not working. I can't even enjoy my days off because I just spend them being miserable or counting down the hours until I have to go back.Hello all! I've been having trouble making friends, so I figured I'd give it another try. I work 3rd shift at a 24-hour gym. I like to play guitar, listen to metal and hardcore and punk music, watch movies, watch wrestling, and I've been getting into fitness and meal prepping. I have a dog named Rupert. I think McDonalds is the greatest restaurant in the US. I am addicted to coffee and diet soda. I've never wanted a family, and I've never really been interested in relationships. It's hard to relate to a lot of people my age because I'm not into gaming or anime. I'm straight edge, so no drinking, smoking, or drugs. I'm pretty left politically, and I think all people should be treated as equals bare minimum. Please be able to say more than 'yea' 'idk' 'lol'. It sucks when it feels like I'm pulling teeth to get someone to type at least a full sentence. Also, I have absolutely no interest in talking about sex or kinks or anything. I'm not gonna shame ya, but it ain't my bag, baby.Hello all! I've been having trouble making friends, so I figured I'd give it another try. I work 3rd shift at a 24-hour gym.

I'm not gonna shame ya, but it ain't my bag, baby.So last year, I was in rough shape. Diagnosed with t2 diabetes, high liver enzymes, and sleep apnea. I decided it's time for a change. Quit drinking alcohol and I've been sober for a year now. Started keto and I've lost 75 pounds, and my A1C and blood sugar are so well controlled, my doctor felt comfortable saying I don't have to take my diabetes medication anymore.
    16M. My head seems too wide. Cleft chin looks ugly to me. Curls don’t curly properly half the time. Skin is horrible and eye bags are deep. My legs are skinny as hell and my body could be much better. My forehead feels too big.Like, the list can go on and on and I could keep droning about everything I dislike on my body. But why do I even feel this way? It’s so annoying. I’ve deleted all social media last week, so I don’t understand why. Sometimes I reenact the things I’ve done throughout the day in front of the mirror and physically recoil and cringe at what’s looking back at me. It feels horrible. But other days I feel hot as fuck. Like my feelings of myself oscillate on my mood.Most of those things can be fixed, it just feels too daunting and not worth the effort and. I don’t know lol.i've barely made it through high school unscathed and now i'm starting to send in applications for college? how tf am i even going to survive this. my eyes are tired and i want to sleep, i can't cry anymore. the future is scary and i'm trying to have it all figured out and i'm scared i'm gonna screw it all up.'If you have one foot in the past and one foot in the future, you're pissing all over the present.' - katya, thank you katya. i'll cherish that. I’ve seen so many people rant about living lonely and depressing lives to the very end that it almost feels hopeless and pointless to dream of getting better. I need a bit of positivity.I've started writing my CommonApp and supplemental essays on a shared Google Doc with my parents, and when I'm done writing any essay, he just puts it into ChatGPT or Bard and then copy-pastes whatever it regurgitated back into my document. Sure, I get that he's trying to help and just wants to make sure I can get into the best place possible, but whenever I tell him that the writing style is blatantly not mine and that admissions officers can easily find out that the essays aren't genuine, he just says it doesn't matter whether or not it's genuine or authentic, it just needs to be good. But the stupid part is that these AI tools don't even add anything to the essay, they just take some words or phrases that I've written and then glamorize it to sound extra as fuck. Which is dumb as hell, but I don't know how to get my dad to believe it. Help?. Woohoo another depressed gay. Shocking. But actually, is there a point in living after college? No, this isn’t another one of my suicidal rants, now’s not the time for that. Just a genuine question. I’ve seen too many people go on and on about adulting being a living nightmare, so why not just knock yourself out permanently afterwards?And yes, before you ask, I’ve used Reddit posts as my sole source of information because, come on, is there any other place that is any more reliable than here? Didn’t think so. Tune in next week for another utterly rational and reasonable epiphany!God I need a major personality rehaul.i just read through my cousin sister's commonapp and supplemental essays from 6 years ago and holy shit her's are miles better than mine. this is crazy, all of her essays genuinely seem like actual valedictorian-styled literature and in comparison mine are barely breathing in the gutter. and i've barely started the supplementals.i'm so screwed lmfao. Weird title but my (16M) family don’t really like my curls. My mom used to ask and beg me to brush it and I would get upset so she stopped commenting about it, but I know she doesn’t like it. Which is whatever, I don’t really care, but sometimes I feel like if everyone thinks it’s ugly and unruly and unkempt, doesn’t that make my curls exactly that and therefore there’s no point in even trying to take care of it because whatever I do it’s still gonna be ‘shit’. I know my hair can have a lot of improvement and I’m getting there, but it’s kinda really demotivating and shitty overall. Don’t know what I’m even saying, was crying even though it’s such a small topic so wanted to vent. Oh well.You've lived in this house for the past 12 years, and in this country for the past 17. You have less than 9 months to get everything in order, bid everyone goodbye, and leave for college on the other side of the world. You'll have to leave everyone in this community and build new relationships. From deleting all the Pokemon off of the account of the boy you thought was cute, from dancing your ass off with her to Just Dance every day, from making cookies and cakes at her house every week, and from learning karate in the clubhouse and getting a fake black belt so you could kick ass with all the other kids. You'll probably never see *any* of these people again. How are you going to pack all these memories into two suitcases and leave? Sure, you'll come back every year and meet your family, but you'll never truly live here. You have to bury all these memories and grow new ones in a different home, in a different country, with different people. You need to pack up the past 17 years of your life and start anew. Maybe it'll be better. Maybe it'll be worse. But it'll never be the same, and that’s what’s making it all so much harder to cope with. God, I never thought I’d be the type to miss high school. Time to go cry about it again. title. 16M and I know it's weird to keep track but over the past 27 days, I've cried 17 times, and I've been crying every day for the past week. So, almost every other day. These range from crying a tear from each eye when I look at an ugly photo, to full-on bawling my eyes out at 12 AM. One of my friends told me it's a good coping mechanism and I know it's not a bad thing to cry your emotions out if anything it's probably a good thing, but just wanted to know what I can do to make it better.. My parents have been reallyy wanting me to ED to NYU since I plan on majoring in Economics and the thing is with my scores I’d have a good chance of getting in, but we’re upper middle class so the financial aid we get won’t be much, and 80k a year is absolutely insane and I have no idea why they want to pay that much out of pocket. I personally don’t see any reason to be spending this much on undergrad, but they say it’s more prestigious and I’ll get better job opportunities. But I feel like I could get the same job opportunities at other colleges with a much lower tuition. Just thinking about having to pay over 250k for four years makes me feel incredibly selfish.Anyone willing to back me up with some stats to convince them otherwise?. Ever since I came out to myself, I did realize how difficult it would be for me to be gay in the future, regardless of whether or not I did anything 'gay', but only now am I kind of realizing how much of a curse this feels like. I know it's stupid, but I was just watching a video of my favorite YouTuber, and she was talking about how being gay wasn't proper and implied it was haram. This is just some person on my screen that I happened to like, but after I heard that I felt so impure and disgusted with myself. I just tumbled into the same spiral I do every other day - my parents will never accept me if they ever found out, and forget about the rest of my family. Even if I ever came out to them, how would I ever live without them, when I can barely stand my own company? How many similar revelations am I going to have before it's too much? Why do I feel my heart break whenever I see homophobes on social media even when I know it doesn't affect me in any way outside this piece of glass? Gosh, it all seems so bleak and boring and not worth experiencing. Let's hope I can cry this out tonight and have a better day tomorrow.Every day I open Reddit or Instagram, there's always another story about another homophobic bigot hating on people for god knows what reason. So many men's personalities around me are being a homophobe, and my own family might be too. It's difficult, and there's no point in acting like I can live a perfectly content life without attracting bigotry, and I'm lucky to have hardly experienced any so far because I haven't come out or turned 18, but better safe than sorry I guess.it hasn't been long since i've come to terms with being gay. i don't live in the greatest country for lgbtq+ individuals and i'm in far from the best family, but there's not much i can do about it. i hate to stereotype, but none of the people i've met who liked ldr have been straight guys and i soo deeply wish i could just state my opinions without people immediately questioning my sexuality. it isn't who i am. sure, it's taken over my life, changed the course of my entire future, and made me question my entire self, but it isn't who i am. and i so badly wish that i could get into hip hop or rap music, but no matter how hard i try, ldr has been the best fucking artist i've ever heard and all her songs are such a vibe.i just wish i could be happier with myself and not care what people think of me. i guess it only comes with time.so, I know that you shouldn't comb curly hair when it's dry cause then it just becomes a ball of frizz, but my mom has been hounding me to brush my hair even when I refuse to cause it looks really bad when I do. But then, the barber that was cutting my hair told me that if I didn't comb it, then my hair would start falling out and ever since I've been kinda concerned. I have 2b/2c hair, and I don't really take care of it very well (I just shampoo twice a week and condition thrice a week) but I do comb it when it's wet pretty well. It's just that, once it dries, it goes back to being really reallyy hard to comb through, even with my fingers.Advice?. I'm gay and a teenager. Maybe it's cause of puberty, but, once I realized I was gay, I also realized that I was physically (stress on physically) attracted to more than half of the guys in my grade. But my friends never think that and say I've got low standards. Problem is, I can't ever figure out if I want to be with them or be them. So it makes me insecure and I end up having a hard time talking to pretty much half the guys in my grade in a platonic way. But, usually, most of those guys end up having a cuntish personality but I still find them mad attractive (again, stress on physically).Is this a part of being a horny teenager, or is this never gonna change? Is there anything I can do about it?. I'm gay and a teenager. Maybe it's cause of puberty, but, once I realized I was gay, I also realized that I was physically (stress on physically) attracted to more than half of the guys in my grade.

But, usually, most of those guys end up having a cuntish personality but I still find them mad attractive (again, stress on physically).Anyone else feel this way?. Up until last year, I was shut-in and extremely introverted. I even believed I had social anxiety at some point (which ended up being false), but after I switched schools I opened up a bit more and now I can comfortably strike up a conversation with my classmates. Well, atleast with half of them, anyway (my grade's only got 50 people). I don't know what I did differently or realized, but there's been a good number of people that try to talk to me willingly and it's great. But, I don't really know if I have any 'friends' - well, I did have one or two good friends, but they've graduated. I can't see myself hanging out with them for more than 30 minutes to an hour or confiding in them with something. Of course, I'm fine talking to whoever I can right now, but I'm just afraid that once I begin college and everything that comes after, I won't be able to keep this up and I'll just end up with a boatload of acquaintances, but no friends.[ Removed by Reddit in response to a copyright notice. ].
    My doctor has been advising me to give antidepressants a try but I tried it. And I really really didn’t like how it made me feel, I feel like if I took them I know I’m going to do something stupid and it also affects work and I need to work. I don’t know what to do. I’m in survival mode right now, only having enough motivation to go to work. I don’t know what to do. How are people expected to survive like this. Surely there is something else apart from medication and CBT therapy.I need advice should I just go to a hospital ? Should I report this to someone ? I live in the UKSo apparently I have plantar fasciitis in my feet. I went to the GP to complain about foot pain that is now travelling up my leg. He inspected my foot and my legs and found that one leg (the one with pain) is looser at the knee then my other leg. Asked me if I’ve had any injuries and I said not that I’m aware of. He printed off a paper about plantar fasciitis and said I need to lose weight. I explained to him I go to the gym, I’m dieting and I’ve been playing badminton but I have PCOS which is the reason I’m struggling to lose weight. To which he responded well you just have to consume less calories and when I tell you I wanted to explode and lash out against him. But I didn’t because I respect people. He continued to say there’s no cure so he doesn’t know what to tell me. He basically said I don’t know about the entire thing apart from the plantar fasciitis. I would’ve thought he’d offer to send me off for X-ray for my kneeI’m just so frustrated and tired with healthcare. I hate going in but my family pushes me to go because they tell me whatever is happening with me is not normal but then I go in and this stuff happens. I’m laying in bed after being hit with a heavy wave of depression. When it’s good, life is great. When hit like this, makes me feel like pulling my hair out. I feel sick. I can’t help but think, if I die then the back and forth stops completely. Am I wrong for wanting that? I really don’t care. What chiropractor services have you used and actually helped you in liverpool. Heyy I was just wondering if anyone in here has experience with gaining weight or not losing any weight because they weren’t eating enough or as consistently. I’ve seen some articles where this is the case and there was something that mentioned the body goes into distress.I’m just wondering if this is real. And what have you done to recover and maintain.I’m 26F, 235lbs. I’ve started implementing exercise in my daily life to couple with better eating habits. I’m eating healthier however I’m still struggling to eating consistently. Every time I go to gym, I leave feeling unwell. It’s either uterus/ ovarian area starts hurting, I have diaherra or recently throwing up. Today I did a work out after work and at the end when I sat down, I felt so naseous. As soon as I left the building and reached outside, I threw up. It feels like I can’t win. I don’t think I didn’t anything too intense. Is this normal in the weight loss journey. I’m 26 years old. I’m a British citizen since 2016 however I am not from here and don’t really know the laws and entitlement. I’ve been renting all this time and I am tired. It just feels like such a waste of money and it’s only benefiting landlords who never listens to my concerns over a property. Last night I was taking a shower, and it started raining outside, my bathroom ceiling started leaking over my head and I just couldn’t help but feel defeated because I have to move houses again. The last one was due to the landlord being disrespectful and belittling because we were women additionally wanting to increase the rent because he didn’t think we could find somewhere else to go within the short time. But we did. And we ended up here. The time before that we moved because of the pandemic but it was such a well managed house so that was a loss.Anyway, I’m making 26,620.00 annually with out tax. I’m good at cutting back. My sister has offered to join forces in getting a mortgage, she’s predicted to earn the same annually with tax if not a little more once she goes full time into her role. I’d prefer to not get a mortgage with her because her spending can be out of control. I’m looking for advice either way.I’m wondering if people with PCOS are more prone to becoming diabetic due to insulin resistance. If you do have both, what were your warning signs and how has treatment been going?. I am struggling. Every day I feel tired, with or without 8 hours of sleep. I recently was put on antidepressants but this makes me sleep more because I was struggling to sleep properly before. I’ve stopped taking them because I still felt tired after sleep and even more so on the medication. I’ve started going to gym which is going well apart from it taking even more of my energy. I know I’m not the first PCOS person to go through this so what are you all doing? Share your secrets.Ps: I’m avoiding coffee. It gets me to normal energy levels but I struggle to sleep at night. Hey so as the title suggests, I’m considering doing a fast to help reverse insulin resistance. I’ve made dietary changes such as limiting the sugars I eat (no candy or desserts) and no dairy which I’ve already notice is making a positive change in my body. However I read in a research paper that fasting for 3 days in obese persons gives a good kick start in reversing insulin resistance. The fast would be no food, just water for 3 days. I’m just wondering if anyone has tried this before?I know it will affect energy levels so my plan would be to do this when I have time away from work.My main concern for wanting to do this is because I’ve recently started antidepressants that are meant to help in allowing me to get more sleep which I do but I still wake up feeling the same amount of tiredness and I strongly believe it is due to The insulin resistance. It’s affecting my daily work focus.I am really a peoples person. I’ve realised as I’ve gotten older that I love to be around like minded people. But I’ve also realised that my social battery around the wrong people, drains A LOT quicker and I’m left with frustration and wanting to take extreme actions.Makes me always think, I wish people were appreciative of the fact that I am trying SO hard. It doesn’t affect their life and I may have no importance to their life but please just acknowledge my strength. But how could they if they can’t even see that I’m struggling because I’m so good at masking.The art that shows a person shackled under water but seeing the world so clearly without being able to interact with it — it’s the best depiction of depression. I’m so tired. I’m not having the best few days. I’ve been down and really devaluing myself. I’ve done a good job on making certain changes to my lifestyle and diet that has made me feel better but then I have days when I think about wanting to have babies. But then I remember I don’t even have a partner. But then I think, who would even want to be with me with the issues I come with and how much harder I have to fight for things. It just makes me really sad that no matter how much I try to do better, it will never be enough in this society. No one sees me as attractive. No one cares about my thoughts or my heart. It really hurts. Mentally I’m not okay and I am so anxious to speak to a health professional about this. I’m waiting on my bus to go to work today and all I’m thinking to myself right now is that I want to go back home and cry my heart out. I really just want to stay home and cry for a week. But I know if I allow myself to do this for even 1 day, it’s going to throw me back into the deep end. I hate this. I feel like I could be so much further in my career if I didn’t have to battle my brain every single day at every second. On top of that I feel like I’m going to have a break down at a time when it’s the least needed. The people around me just don’t understand, they don’t really try to. I really want to give up and if I knew what would be on the other-side, if it were just a quiet mind, I’d have jumped a long time ago.******Warning: TMI talks of period in depthSo basically I’m at war with my period which is the norm for us badazzes with PCOS 😎 however the thing is I’ve found peace with my period after struggling with it for so long. Like I manage bleeding heavy, I just wear thick pads. And I bleed for a week most times if I’m off meds, so I just wait it out. The biggest thing is that I don’t feel severe cramping anymore.A new problem presents itself now. Every other month, maybe like 3 - 4 months when my period comes down, it’s a shit show. I bleed extra heavy on the first 3 days, almost like a faucet. If I was standing during those days, I could fill a thick maxi pad within 1 hour. And even then, my ovaries or uterus muscles (whatever it is) feels so sore like something is trying to burst through. It’s like not even is coming out. I get blood clots that pass, which is normal for me. But what’s really bothering me is that I can’t sleep during these first 3 days cause if I lay for more then 30 mins - 60 mins, when I get up, if I uncross my legs on my way to the bathroom, it’ll be a flood gate before I get to the toilet.Is this really normal with our condition? I can feel tiny cysts bursting sometimes as sharp pains but that’s been happening outside of my period. Which again is normal for me but these days it’s accompanied by sharp pain and bleeding. And this has also stop me going to the gym because running and lifting induces this pain as wellI called in sick today at work because I just couldn’t do it but I’m thinking if I should use this chance to call 111 because Im still in the process of moving GPs. So the journey is like a 4 or 5 hour drive I believe. How much would you spend on Liverpool to make the journey or a similar one.I’m sat on a coach for about 5 hours and just thought I’d write this out in case someone needed encouragement today as I know I do sometimes.This medical condition is not easy to deal with. And no one will truly understand how emotionally, mentally and sometimes physically draining it is apart from those that have our condition or similar tasking conditions. A lot of us experience too much from a young age due to this condition ranging from being over-sexualised due to our bodies maturing faster then others, from being bullied due to our ‘masculine’ like features or even being bullied because some of us choose to embrace our masculine features and made to feel not feminine enough, from being made to feel overly sensitive because of an emotional imbalance, from being made to feel less then a woman because of fertility issues, from being made to feel less then by some family members by passing comments and many other things a lot of us struggle with. Even bullying amongst ourselves because some people with PCOS don’t struggle with certain symptoms such as excessive weight and identity crisis. We all struggle.It’s hard to figure out how to feel about this condition when the world is pushing false ‘facts’ on you about your own condition. Where science is still figuring it out. PCOS never goes away but its influence on you can change. Think to yourself. It’s my body. It’s my life. It’s my thoughts. You’re enough and you will always be enough. Confidence attracts the right people to you who will not judge your body and struggles. You’re not the problem. Regardless who says you are. YOU are NOT the problem. Say it like a mantra. The mindset and beauty standards of society is the problem. And I am so thankful we’re slowly becoming a society capable of forming our own opinions and promoting diversity instead of the ‘one size fits all’ we’ve had growing up. Think to yourself as well, every time we share something publicly about PCOS, there’s a chance it could reach a younger audience who may not have anyone to speak to in real life. Someone who can identify with your symptoms and it makes them feel less alone, more human and possibly boost their confidence. We can educate eachother.The excessive hair that I grow, makes me feel like a grown ass adult. It’s a reminder that I’m no longer a lost child. The weight that I have makes me feel supple and loving and cuddly. Going to the gym doesn’t feel like a chore, it feels like something new and a way for me to burn out any negative energy that attaches itself to me. And miss menstrual cycle that is indecisive as to when she wants to come, I’m building a bond with her because she’s apart of me and I use to hate her so much. We are human. We deserve love and understanding just like every other person but it starts with you. Without it, you’re inviting people to negatively treat you the way you negatively treat yourself. We are going to have bad days, bad weeks maybe even some bad months. We have to pave the path of love for our body. So I happily pluck my chin hairs when I’M ready and I shave my body parts when I’M ready and I practice loving myself in the mirror every other day.I feel like there’s something genuinely wrong with me. Brewing under the service before it explodes. I don’t know how to navigate myself anymore through life. I’m getting up and I’m going to work. If my colleagues drag me somewhere, I go with the flow but it’s like leading around an unprotected child. One of my coworkers made a comment that was so true, I was in a taxi and wasn’t paying attention to how far I was to my destination or if I was on my way and my coworker said I could’ve been kidnapped and I wouldn’t have known and it’s true. I’ve been forgetting to lock my house front door, I’ve forgotten my key in the door itself on the outside a few times. My sister has been angry about this which of course is within reason. This is not normal and I’m struggling so much. I’ve tried seeking therapy but it’s so hard because I automatically go into ‘survival pretend’ mode and they see me as a normal person not struggling despite what I’m telling them and then when it finally becomes too much and I crack, I just stop showing up. I identify with the symptoms relating to depression and borderline personality disorder, obviously I’m not a doctor and I can’t diagnose myself I live in the UK, is there anything I can do to actually get help or for someone to atleast identify what’s going on with me ?. I feel like there’s something genuinely wrong with me. Brewing under the service before it explodes. I don’t know how to navigate myself anymore through life. I’m getting up and I’m going to work.

With BPD, we have lots of intense emotions bottled up, swirling around in us and leaking out gradually ( I mean in those people that fight to keep everything on a tight leash). I’m sure there must people out there that have found ways to release these emotions in a safe way even if doesn’t really allow you to release everything. Any good lash techs in Liverpool? I want to get individuals done, a Russian set that’s not too thick and of course someone professional and sanitary with their work. Preferably someone with an instagram page. Where’s the best place to get deep tissue massages that’s not in someone’s house. I met with my old coworkers today. When I started that old job, it was a hotel about to open and we were doing strenuous physical activity for almost 7 hours a day. Throwing big boxes, running up and down 9 flights of stairs etc. during this time, I was eating more then I would normally and veggies was included. I lost 20lbs in a month. I was happy.As the hotel operations actually began and I started doing the work I was contracted for, the weight returned. I was doing longer hours but all of it was spent in an office setting and I went back to my minimal eating. Then I left the job to move overseas to a new job to support my sister there because she was alone and mentally struggling.The job I went to was not physical. I only stood for 7 hours a day interacting with guests at the desk etc. My eating again was minimal, even more so because I ate whatever they provided (sometimes just fries and a slice of store bought pizza) and that would be all for the day. If I don’t eat at work, then I get takeout and that would be my only meal for the day. I have put on 40lbs since leaving the job which amounts to a yearIve been back in my previous country for a week now visiting, I’ve met with my coworkers today and I could see the judgement in their eyes. Just before coming back to visit, I’ve been going to the gym doing cardio and weight lifting exercise, drinking a lot more water, trying to get more sleep, and working to eat more consistently and balanced. But all people see is the weight gain. All I see is the weight gain. The scale just keeps climbing unless I eat minimally. Atleast then it stays stagnant. My parents have commented on every inch of my body, my life since I’ve come back and I feel so useless and disgusting. I’m struggling mentally, physically. My body is begging me to lose this weight, I’m only 5’4 but it’s so hard. They comment on my belly all the time and my sagging breasts and my lack of an ass. I’m so tired and frustrated. They know I struggle with PCOS. They know what it does to me but in the moment when they complain, they forget all about it and this is how I know they don’t care. I’m so tired. Very random. But I’m a big girl (240lbs), and I was exercising (cardio) 45 mins for I think 6 days straight at the gym. In addition to that, I stand at work for 7.5 hours for 5 days a week. I stopped for a week because I was getting uterine pain. 2 days ago after it’s nearly been a week, my legs feel really sore, specially my thighs. They felt perfectly fine before. Does this happen normally? Is it just a late response ?. I know this might sound weird or even alarming but I don’t know where to ask this. When I go to my GP about things, I feel like an idiot who doesn’t know squat about life. But anywayI’ve been going to the gym off and on for years to lose weight. I love weight lifting before and hated cardio. Now I like moderate cardio however whenever I go to the gym and exercise, I develop a pain in my uterus area and eventually bleeding follows in my discharge. I’m 240lbs, maybe this is to be expected because of the weight load? I’m also not exercising aggressively I feel like. This pain has always put me off going to the gym. I don’t want to mention it to my GP because I feel like they are just going to write it off as a fat girl making excuses.But maybe this normal for us PCOS girlies since our ovaries have little cysts all over, maybe they become agitated. Has anyone experienced this along with their weight loss?. Warning: might be TMISo I recently bought these 500mg Berberine supplements after seeing how popular on TikTok it was for PCOS. I’ve been taking them only for 2 days so far. My stomach bloating is almost non existent. It also feels like it’s helping my digestion and getting my body to let go more eg. Pooping came easy on day 2 and I was releasing gas. My doctor recently told me I had a zinc deficiency but the medication irritated my stomach since I had ulcers being treated. I can’t wait to try again after taking Berberine for a week or two. I’d love to know what are others experience with it like a comparison of what they expected vs what actually happened. IMPORTANT UPDATE: the discord has been taken over my someone else. I am not apart of it and no longer have access to it. The name was PCOS warriors. I’m not sure if that’s still the name but hopefully this helpsLike the title says. I’m starting a fitness journey and I would love the support of other women on a the journey, finished the journey, thinking of a journey. PCOS is hard and challenging in every way. Support goes a long way. Even if it’s just friendly memesUPDATE: Hi everyone, I have an update. I have the chat set up, please feel free to join the discord chat using this link https://discord.gg/3VRj3cvR otherwise the channel’s name is PCOS warriors. Please bare with me, I know little about discord 😅. I’m on my second day at the gym. I haven’t been to the gym in years and it’s because I would get pain in my lower abdomen area. So far everything feels fine. I’ve been doing 15 mins of interval training on the elliptical machine and 20 mins rolling hills (alternating 2 to 5 incline) at 5.5 speed on the treadmill. I don’t know what to do for abdomen and arms just yet but I’m wondering if that’s a good start or if it’s no where close?And I know I have to listen to my body, I know better to push myself but I’m not in the best mental space and my brain wants to give up on anything. I can’t tell the difference of doing enough and not doing enough but I want to lose weight so I’m asking for the advice of the girls who have lost weight or are currently losing weight.I need advice. I’m (26F) talking to guy (30M) and he has a high sex drive. He has been on and on about sex and how much he loves it from the beginning. However we have also had conversations willingly by him about his son, his last relationship, what he’s into etc. I have never had sex. I’ve only done sexual acts. I use to get horny alot as well but I haven’t felt as revved up lately because I crave an intimate genuine connection. I’ve communicated this and he’s okay with it but he hammers on and on about sex and I genuinely feel like he does have trouble controlling it and I try to be understanding but I’m having trouble determining if he’s serious or not.For women when it comes to sex, they tend to set a period of time or a mile stone goal when first romantically talking to a guy if they’re looking for a relationship however I am trying to understand what do men think when getting with a girl for the first time. Do they have expectations on how long they’re willing to wait to get into the honey pot ? Do they ever set their own time limits or milestone goals?Edit: Guys I do have trouble with self worth. I’ve been single since 2019 and have been trying occasionally to find a connection with someone. It’s hard because it always comes down to sex and a lack of patience. Title. So I wanted to get back on inositol. I really did my body good in the past but I hated taken pills. Now I’m going to try the powdered version which I heard is just as effective but I’ve seen warnings around the internet that coffee cancels out inositol in the body. Does anyone drink coffee while taking inositol? I wasn’t a big coffee drinker in the past but now it’s like my life depends on it lol. I’m going for my first smear test and I’m really nervous. Does it hurt ? How big would you say the clamp is using an object as comparison. I’m only doing this because I really want to rule out my cervix for some issues I’m having but I don’t want to waste the doctors time. Any tips on buying a car here in Liverpool and where are some good places to go?. I want to take birth control to help regulate my hormones however I won’t be sexually active. Anything I should be aware of or try to avoid ?. Any safe and sanitary businesses providing laser treatment for hair removal in Liverpool?. Basically I feel tired all the time. This is me working as a receptionist only having to stand on my feet during an 8hour shift 6 days a week. I have no kids. I’m depressed. But bottom line, I’m tired all the time and I know the gym would do me good since I’ve gained a lot of weight (easy peasy with PCOS) and I’m out of shape. When I use to go to gym (which was very brief) I’d feel exhausted, barely can focus at work even whilst drinking coffee. Can’t have energy drinks since I’ve got a sensitive stomach. Are there any recommendations or tricks as to what I can do to increase my energy ?. The previous tenants left a debt on the electric meters. My sister called the electric company and they gave her a code to use with a new key at one of those TOPUP stores. I’m in the place with my mom and the key hasn’t worked and she’s freezing. All i did was stick the key in and nothing has happened. Am I doing something wrong? Should I doing something with the blue button on the meter ? I’ve noticed other Liverpool homes have the same kind of meters. I’m currently on hold with Eonnext emergency line but have been waiting for 20 mins.Any recommendations for reliable moving companies in Liverpool?. *** I’m so sorry this is so long but wanted to provide as much context as possible**I am so angry with my landlord. My sister and I signed a 6 month contract for £825 for a 2.5 bed house. The property has had issues from the time we moved in which we’ve been reporting since we moved in. Radiators leaking water, boiler’s pressure kept dropping, block drainage in the back yard, broken appliances we found in the house, the house was still dirty when we moved in. We really needed a place because my sister was moving from student accommodation (term ended) and I was moving back from overseas. We already thought that 825 was too high compared to every where else but the place seemed okay, it was a good locationWhen we reported issues, the landlord’s husband started coming to our house outside of the agreed time and let himself in after 1 knock.1 month before contract ending we decided we would renew because we didn’t want to have to move again and if it came down to it, we’d just demand for the landlord to send a professional to fix the issues. But they decided to raise the rent to £900 if we wanted to renew. We have always dealt with the landlord’s husband, never the landlord. My sister told him we wanted to meet with the landlord to confirm all of this and he showed up by himself. My sister said she did not want to speak to him about it without the landlord present but he persisted so she told him we weren’t happy about the place and can’t believe he’d raise the rent when we are still struggling with the same problems. My sister, whenever she tries to calm herself looks away. When she did momentarily he shouted at her to look at him when spoken to then he ended up leaving and slamming the door.The next meeting we spoke to the landlord who basically set their mute and said she stands with whatever her husband stands with and she doesn’t understand why we are being difficult. They also mentioned having people view the place while we were still inhabited inside but we declined because we weren’t comfortable with this. This is also not stated in the contract. They insists that they will have to and we told them no.Now we finally found a place, happy to be moving and going through an agency this time but when the landlord was contacted which was the husband, he said we pay our rent late when we absolutely never do !Now we have to provide a guarantor which we are happy to but this has us both BEYONG pissed because we’ve never had to dealt with something like this.There’s more to the story but this post is already too long so I’m happy to answer more questions Are we wrong ? Do we have any kind of legal standing ? What do I do?. Have to be able to show proof of their work. Comment down below your work and what you do. I’ll inbox you about pricing. Sis is tired of throwing it all in a ponytail 🥲. I’ve struggled with acne and hyperpigmentation since I was a teen. I’m 25 now and have a good handle on my acne where it’s mostly non existent and the hyperpigmentation isn’t as bad as before but I have wide pores. Some products minimise their appearance a bit but it’s still very noticeable. I want to permanently get rid of it and at this point, I’m willing to go through a cosmetic procedure. Any tips ?. So I met this guy in February on a dating app. He’s been very sweet. Fast forward to May when we finally meet, he’s even sweeter in person personality wise. He constantly pays attention to me, he’s been a gentleman, he wants to spend his free time with me wherever possible, etc etc. fast forward to now in august and I don’t feel like being in a relationship with him anymore. The reason why is because from the 2 visits I’ve made to his house, he’s a messy person. His house smells like sweat, his bathroom is dirty, surfaces are dirty and need a good clean. He also doesn’t take full showers from what I’ve noticed, I think he just rinses up and puts on the same shirt. I came to visit him for a week and on day 1 I want to go home. It’s so bad that I want to go to the grocery store to get stuff and clean his house myself cause I need to shower and stuff. Another problem is, I’ve noticed that he’s lazy when it comes to work. He’s been open about sleeping on the job, sometimes leaves an hour early when he can and watches movies all the time while working which is fine, you know if he can get away with it whatever but he’s constantly complains about things (the cheapest things) being expensive and he doesn’t have money. The 3 times that we’ve met up, all 3 times just days before he shoots me message to say he’s spent all his money and has something like £20 left and he’s sorry and we won’t be able to do whatever we had planned. I’ve paid for everything when he came to visit me but after going to him twice and realised I’d still have to pay for us both to do stuff together outside of the house, I decided I’m not spending any more money but still ended up doing it for food because I have to eat.And honestly he’s a very sweet guy but im having trouble to understand why he’d be in this predicament. I’ve tried to gauge his mental but I don’t pick up on anything and I tend to struggle with depression. Im more then sure he’s earning more then the minimum wage and even so, im earning minimum wage and im getting by.What do you think?. Hi I’m looking for an app that has a built in exercise routine or one that allows you to input exercises to create a routine. I just want something to use as a guide for the beginning stages of my weight loss journey.What are the best exercise techniques for a female to lose weight?The body type is 5’3 or 162cm weighing 220lbs or 95kg+. The end goal for weight is 170lbs for now.PS: I have PCOS which makes weight loss harder so feel free to post PCOS specific exercises if you’ve experienced the same.
    I’ve noticed that recently, as my depression has really gotten bad, that I’ve become really hostile, grumpy, pessimistic, and just an overall, for lack of a better word, depressing person to be around. I no longer enjoy things in my life, and the once lively, happy, and positive person I used to be is gone. I push people away and get angry easily and I look at the negatives in everything. I hate that I’ve become this way. Is it just me? Am I just being an asshole and is this unique to me, or does anyone else feel this way? Idk I feel like because I’m depressed and hate my life and have developed such a negative outlook for my life, I’ve become that way towards everything and everyone else.I heard someone say recently that “every school shooter ever was mentally ill.” That really made me think about the fact that even though every organized mass shooter in history might not have a DIAGNOSED mental disorder like depression or schizophrenia, but if someone is compelled to harm others in such a way, then I myself would consider them mentally ill, almost by definition.This made me think about self harm and my habit of cutting myself. I am extremely nonchalant about my habit and treat it as just as any other type of escape. Some smoke cigarettes, some go for a run, I cut to escape my problems and cope and validate my feelings. I don’t think a “sane” or “healthy” person would choose this outlet. If I think rationally about it, I wouldn’t say cutting is a healthy habit to have. But thinking back to the logic from above, because I cut, does that mean I’m mentally ill too? I believe so. I think the fact that I do such a thing makes me not ok.Like really, what’s the point to this thing called life. If each individual day is more or less the same shitty day, it’s hard to convince myself that there’s something better ahead. I feel so empty and without a purpose. Nothing keeping me here. Is this truly as good as it gets? Is THIS life? What am I missing that everyone else seems to have? Perhaps the solution comes in the form of some radical life change. But I just CANT. I can barely get through a single day, let alone motivate myself to make any meaningful change. It just seems so hopeless so why even try? My life feels so empty. It’s begun to anger me and make me bitter. I feel like I can’t take much more of this stupid shit anymore. Can anyone else relate?. Every day is the same shitty day, and yet as much as I hate it, I feel so incredibly trapped and stuck in this situation for the rest of my life. The things I used to do that brought me temporary joy and escape really don’t do that anymore; in fact they make me sad - sad at the fact that the things I once loved no longer have that affect. I feel I am destined for a life of mediocrity and sadness and emptiness. It’s the emptiness that really makes me depressed and gets me down. Nothing seems to fill that whole in my life.Does anyone ever have this feeling of emptiness all the time? Like something’s missing? Like there’s a big hole within you that no matter what you try, will NEVER be filled?John Mayer has a song called “something’s missing”, and I have never ever heard another song that perfectly describes that feeling to me.“I’m not alone, I wish I was, because then I’d know I was down because”I always feel alone. No matter how many friends or loved ones I have around me, no matter the situation, I feel alone. I could be in the middle of a party with all my closest friends, or at a family dinner with all my “loved” ones around, and I could still feel this terrible fear, dread, and anxiousness about being alone. Sometimes I wish I actually WAS alone, that I DID have nobody, because then this emptiness I feel would make sense. Instead, I’m just left wondering “why do I feel so alone? Look around, all these people want the best for you, but you don’t want it.”“I’m dizzy from the shopping malls. I searched for joy, but I bought it all. It doesn’t help the hunger pains and a thirst I’d have to drown first to ever satiate”No matter what I try, I still feel this emptiness. No amount of spending orExtravagant trips will fill that hole. “Id have to drown first to ever satiate” this “hunger” to fill the hole. “Friends? (Check)Money? (Check)A well slept? (Check)Opposite sex? (Check)”I have it “all” and still feel this way“How come everything I think I need, always comes with batteries?What do you think it means”No amount of new hobbies or distractions will satisfy me, nothing will fill this hole. My interests are temporary, they excite me for only so long, they come with “batteries”.Idk. I really relate to the song and if anyone else feels similarly, I recommend listening to it. Maybe you too will relate.Does anyone have certain things they do when they cut? Like music they listen to while doing it, places they go to do it, things you say while doing it, etc.? Most of the time when I cut, I making jokes as I do it, I listen to Iris by the goo goo dolls, and take a picture of my arm afterwards and add it to a hidden album on my phone.
    I grew up my whole life alone. My father left us when I was around 5 and hardly wanted to see me anymore. The one evening a month he would "book" to see me, 90% of the time it fell through and he wanted to see his friends or go out instead. I got tired of him never being there for me, never teaching me or taking me anywhere. We had an argument about it when I was around 13 and I never saw him again and I'm now 31 and recently he died in a car crash.My mum looked after me in terms of minimal amount of food, drink and housing (council) never taught me anything or encouraged me, never took me anywhere my whole life unless someone else paid for it. Hardly showed me an ounce of affection or real love. She told me she couldn't love me because I reminded her too much of my dad. She now has two new kids (twins) that she replaced me with and is trying to have a family she really wanted with a husband. My pap would tell me he feels like my dad due to my real one leaving me but never backed this up with any real love or affection. Never taught me or took me anywhere, just worked every second he could and let my nan deal with things involving family. My nan was depressed since she was a teenager, had electric shock therapy when I was really young and was never the same afterwards. All she would tell me throughout my life is how much she hates my pap and didn't love him and was just "best friends" who live together. That life isn't worth living and is crap. She showed me very little affection or love unless it was taking me on holiday with them sometimes or giving me a little pocket money. She would talk to me and tell me about adult things when I was young and nothing else. Every relationship I've ever been in I've self sabotaged and couldn't love them properly. (Just like my marriage currently) that's failed. I can't love myself or do anything to fix myself. I have no personality and no drive or passion for life or anything. I'm 31 years old and cannot drive, never had a job, never left the comfort of computer games and TV series. I feel more emotions watching people on the TV than I do my own daughter. I know I love her and would do anything for her, I teach her things and take her lots of places and play with her frequently. I tell her I love her all the time and give her affection. But deep down I feel like I just can't love the way I want to or what normal people feel for other people. I hardly speak to any of my family and they don't try to talk to me. I tried speaking to them about these problems and they just tell me I'm an adult now and they can't change the past and that I'm making things up. I moved away due to mental health problems and abusive neighbours up to the north of England away from everyone I've ever known and now I'm really alone. (other than my daughter) without driving I can't get any jobs, without a job I can't get driving lessons. I'm in a rural area and there's little jobs, even shelf stacking requires two references and experience. I'm smart and could really do something in life maybe if I sorted myself out. I've had depression and anxiety from these issues and dropped out of uni twice because I couldn't handle it. I've messed everything in my life up and now in a hole so big I can't even see daylight. I don't know how I can break this cycle, how I can become somebody. I feel like I'm just waiting to die and am not a real person. How do I start to love people/feel emotions properly.Do I need therapy? I just wanted to vent also as I've just realized what's wrong with me. Tldr: emotional neglect, no love or affection, no guidance or experiences in life, nobody actually loves me properly and I don't know how to change from this hollow husk of a human and actually try and live.They caught up in corners in the last few minutes, this is a joke.&#x200B;[https://gyazo.com/0d5fa7d58419502418c4fb8a96e7dce1](https://gyazo.com/0d5fa7d58419502418c4fb8a96e7dce1). 31 male had bad cold and or chest infection for a week now and recently started tasting a rotten taste when I yawn? What could it be as it's worrying me. Symptoms: Sore throat (gone now)Lots of mucus in lungs/airways when breathing it makes popping and blocked mucus soundsSometimes slight pain in left lung when breathingCoughing up white/yellow phlegm Rotten taste when yawning. 31m non smokerHey, for months now I have had a constant dull ache/tightness on my stomach and flanks between hips and ribs. When I feel them they're sore/give of a dull ache kinda like soreness mixed with numbness of that makes sense. My doctor's keep saying they're normal ab muscles but I don't think they are. Ultrasound can't really see anything wrong and I'm panicking about possible lymphoma? Any advice or guesses would be great thankyou. I am 31, suffer from depression, don't have a job (haven't worked in 8 years), don't have any higher education. I know the first step would be to get a job, learn to drive etc. I see people living their best lifes (or atleast trying to) Hobbies, days out, holidays, and i just don't know where to start or where to go.I want to camp, to hike, to have no fear doing things that i would like to do but i just cant get myself started. I don't know how to live a normal life. I feel like im so stuck in my own ways that i'll never make it out of this way of thinking. I WANT to be someone. I want to be out there living life to my fullest potential.I want to be a better person, a better father. Everything seems to difficult.I've been off work for the last 7 years with anxiety and depression. I really want to change my life around for me and my daughter (5) I constantly see people doing what they want and it makes me envious I can't do the same things. I would love to work, I would love to start camping, I would love to learn to drive, go on holidays by myself. Just be a normal person but it's so hard for me to leave my comfort zone. One of my fears is starting over, working at a job meant for school leavers. I know it's not the right way of thinking about it but I can't help but feel shame and anxiety about doing these jobs. I always watch people online doing fun things and genuinely trying to make the best out of life and have hobbies when I find it hard to even leave the house. I want it so bad.What can I do to change this mindset of self defeat and start making something off myself that might one day make me happy and proud.I am 30 and have a kid, I dropped out of uni 9 years ago in the second year. I haven't worked due to depression in 7 years, and i don't know what to do anymore. Every route for me looks bleak and depressing. Working in retail? Would rather die.Working in warehouse? Would rather die. I can't go back to university due to having a kid, if I did go back to university I wouldn't be able to see her much at all. (50/50 custody) I would like to join the army but again I cannot due to having a kid and not wanting to abandon her.It just seems like due to mental health and my own mistakes I have no opportunity that spark my will to live. To be able to have pride in a job and to know that it helps people in a meaningful way. I can't be the father I want to be. My daughter loves me.more than the world itself. I have put more love and effort than even her mother has. The time we have together now is special to her and reducing it for any reason even work would make her sad. (Mother isn't that loving) I have no friends and no family. No support system at all. I'm so alone other than my daughter. I'm so lost :( I also have no friends or family at all. No support system. How do I change my life around ..Yeah. I can't break out of this depression. I wish I had the guts to end the second by second struggle, torture and torment. I haven't worked since I was 23, I can't drive, I have no hobbies, I have no passion, I have no friends and I have no family. I hardly eat or drink as I need little energy to sustain laying in bed for 12 hours a day. The rest of my day consists of fighting my own mind to even feed myself a little and grab a drink of water, sitting relaxing staring at the back of my eye lids. I dropped out of university twice due to mental health, I feel like if I did even try I would be stuck in warehouse or retail work and that makes me want to die even more. I have a wife and daughter and I still can't manage to get out of bed other than to walk her five minutes to school. This depression is even affecting my relationship with my wife as I can't feel love properly anymore. (Because I have no love for myself and growing up with a family that never showed me real affection) It affects my relationship with my daughter as I can't be the dad I want to be. (I still have a good relationship with her) but I want to be more. She wasn't planned but I thought that she would give me the strength to want to change but that's not the case :( I don't know how to get out of this rut. I just want to die. Medication just turned me into a zombie when I was on them but maybe it's better than feeling like this. The only fun I have is dreaming. How do I fix this :( I feel too far gone.We got together when we were young, I was depressed and she has OCD. Everything was fine and happy because we both could support each other with our problems and have fun. I never thought that I wanted much from life due to depression and didn't want to get a job. My wife has OCD and cannot get treatment for this due to already trying things that didn't work, and not being able to take medication due to anxiety based from the OCD. Ive got to a point after 7 years where I want more than the life I have. If I wanted to look for a career and try and make something of myself, me working full time we would be no better off financially than we already are on full benefits + extras (UK pip, carers allowance etc) The thought of committing to working full time for no gain and to basically pay for everything myself is a major problem for me to start trying. She does try to make YouTube videos and hopes it'll take off one day but I feel like that is a pipedream? I know in the future I would probably earn more and we'd have a little bit more to do some things with but then if we wanted our own place, hobbies and holidays that would all have to be saved from me. And knowing she's home all the time doing to things she wants while I'm working puts me off too. I know I'm being selfish and knew what I was getting into (even though I didn't think of it as much as I should) I can't help but feel it may be better of starting again? Working on myself etc I do love her but it feels like my life will always be held back by this? I just want some advice or any questions to help me make a decision. Tldr - Wife Is mentally ill and cannot ever work, I want to work on myself and start looking towards the future with a career and don't want to be the only one working. Edit: I'm not good at explaining so sorry if it's a little bit confusing or i havent added enough information. Please ask if you want to know anything else.We got together when we were young, I was depressed and she has OCD.

Tldr - Wife Is mentally ill and cannot ever work, I want to work on myself and start looking towards the future with a career and don't want to be the only one working.I have been mentally ill since I was a kid. Only now have I semi-awoken from my slumber and want to try in life. I have been to college and achieved a level 3 national diploma in networking and systems support. (A long time ago) I have dropped out of two years of university. If I was to try and go back to university I would have to try and get the extra year for personal reasons due to only having two years funding left. So that may be a opportunity I could possibly look into. My problem is I don't want to work minimum wage jobs that I deem to have no pride in. I don't want to work retail for the rest of my life, I don't want to work in warehouses. What other opportunitys do I actually have at this age? It seems that all my opportunitys have gone. They're from my mental health and my choices but I feel as though people who had problems just get left behind. Any ideas or advice?. Hello :)I don't know what I should do to be quite honest. For nearly a year now I have been struggling with feeling love towards my wife. I have felt like this before a couple of times but pushed the thoughts away by distracting myself or telling myself that I was just depressed and struggled to love people fully due to not having much love or connection with my own family growing up. The main problems I have are:- How do I know the difference between "Love" and "in love" as though I have care, and love my wife. I don't think this is what love should be. - She suffers from OCD. So she cannot work ever in her life, she struggles to even leave the house. I feel as though I will be working my entire life supporting us both on one job not having the life I could have with a partner that could work and provide extra money for activities and a house etc. She doesn't want to have an friends or social life. She doesn't want to go out drinking or dancing as people will be around her or touch her accidentally. She's comfortable staying at home gaming, and doing hobbies. - Years ago she told me she always wanted to be a man, that she has had gender dysphoria since she was a kid. She would call herself Liam online and on her personal things like letters etc. This drastically affected my sexual view of her and I feel like I would like a more "womenly" woman. She told me she wouldn't change her gender even though she wanted to, to be with me. She dresses in men's clothes and shirts and has short hair which I don't find that attractive. (when we first met she was really girly and dressed like it) but a few years into our relationship she said that didn't make her comfortable and wasn't what she wanted. - Her OCD impacts my stress. When you leave the house you have to change your clothes everytime. You cannot touch anything or get into bed without changing. You have to make sure you remember to wash your hands everytime you try to give her any affection. Which for me ruins spontaneous actions and excitement. Her OCD means she's not that loving to our daughter physically, because she cannot hug or tough her without our daughter washing her hands or having a bath or changing her clothes. Other than care and attention the only physical affection our daughter receives is a quick hug before bed and then my wife will have to change her clothes again. - Shes a slob around the house even after years of asking her to clean more or put things away. She will drop food on the floor and leave it hours to days before she would clean it up. (Unless I clean it for her) she uses items and leaves them scattered everywhere and not out things back in their place. For example: making a tea shell leave the kettle halfway down the counter, water all over the side, used tea bags in the sink, cups on the side. She smokes and leaves ash everywhere all over the floor and table top and on my side regardless of how much it annoys me. She just doesn't do anything ive asked her to be better at for years. I have to do nearly all the tidying. She'll poo in the toilet and leave skids and chunks over the toilet as she cannot clean it due to her OCD and just expect it to clean itself with bleach. Or clean it after I moan at her for it. Everything seems to be after I have to moan again and again about the same things for her to do it. Then she'll go straight back to doing the same things again. I know I married her knowing she has OCD but I was young, I wanted someone to try and love. We had a daughter that wasn't planned and I thought if I tried hard enough and waited long enough that I'll love her. I didn't know it'll be like this. I didn't even think of the consequences or the problems or the future. I am to blame for my situation. I have made massive mistakes. Now I'm deciding if I want to leave, I'm torn and obviously bonded someways emotionally to her. I don't know if I'm just frightened of being alone and starting again or I want to stay and try. I don't live near my family and couldn't move back so I have no support system. I'm heartbroken for the life I have/had and heart broken for her and my daughter knowing I might leave and see her less. My dad left me when I was my daughter's age and I feel like I was just meant to repeat the cycle. He hardly ever saw me again and obviously I wouldn't do that to my daughter. I don't know what to do or feel. I'm lost. I just need some advice, someone to ask me questions and help me make the right choice. Anything else you need to help me I can provide. Thank you. Hey guys, i was on venafaxine ( effexor ) 225MG for around 5 years. I am struggling a lot with several health issues that started with ending the anti depressants. I cold turkeyed them which i know is not advisable because i didn't know any better at the time and had an epiphany inside myself that they were harming me and that i was feeling numb inside due to them. (feeling like a robot) For the first three months i was fine but since then my body/mind has completely broken down. I am thinking the delayed withdrawal effects were due to an excess in my system and when i stopped the tablets i still had some in my fat cells that could be used by my brain. Anyways i was wondering if anyone else was withdrawing from long term anti depressant use and still has issues. Symptoms - &#x200B;* Gut issues (Acid reflux, heartburn)* Constantly getting infections* Brain fog* Dry eyes, eye pressure* TMJ/TMD* Ear popping, tinnitus* Anhedonia* Don't process emotions properly/fully* Muscle aches* Heart palpitations* Cognitive slowness* Depression/anxiety worse than before taking AD's. ( I had situational depression beforehand ) Now i feel dead inside.* Neck tightness/stiffness* Really oily skin/hairThese issues don't seem to be getting any better and i have been off nearly a year now. I really feel like they have damaged me beyond repair. :(. Hey guys!A little background -* No father* Mum who didnt fully love me or nurture/guide me* Depressed family* Dropped out of university due to mental health* Started anti depressants at 23 and turned me into a auto pilot drone for 7 years* Don't know how to driveNow im not fully blaming my upbringing due to my own choices in life as well. I am partly to blame for my life.I have not worked in 7 years, no degree and basic GCSE's. I would love to join the military but i have a daughter that i couldnt leave. I find that i have no more opportunitys at my age to change my life. I would love to go back to university but i cannot because noone would house me during it, i live in the north east and there ain't many jobs/apprenticeships other than administration. I feel as though all the things i now want to do ( Military and university for nursing) are out of my reach and i'll live a life in retail or warehouses until i die. ( and with my depression and the job having lack of meaning to me i wouldnt be able to do it.I'm just so lost and dont know where to turn. I know most will say suck it up and work minimum wage jobs and try to work your way up but i want my life and job to have meaning, i dont want to work retail and become a manager in the store, i don't want to work in warehouses.What opportunitys are there left for me to change my life around and get something that impacts society and gives me meaning?Any information you need that i didnt put down that may help you give me advice please ask.So I'm having an issue with spiders biting me in the back of my neck. The bites get swollen and infected quite often. They have two little holes next to each other. This has been going on since I stopped anti depressants nearly a year ago! .Is it something to do with hormones and sweat? Anti depressants mess with everything and since I stopped I have been ill a lot. But the biting pro lem is annoying me. I have everything set to max and while leveling in dragonflight i get 50-70 FPS only. Ryzen 5 260016gb ram2070 rtxIs this normal?. When I move my neck around it crackles, cracks, grinds and pops. But what I was wondering is can this crackling of the neck happen when I breath? Doctors said my lungs sound fine but when I breath I can hear crackling noises that seem to come from my throat/neck. It's annoying the hell out of me.Hey guys, so my abdomen feels really tight lately and I checked around and there's lots of little lumps/bumps in my abdomen. Is this normal? Male30 years oldNon smoker. Basically I feel that I don't want to be with my wife anymore, due to not loving her the way she should be loved and me wanting a different life. She suffers from major OCD and is basically most of the time housebound. She cannot and will not ever work unless she finds something to get paid for while at home. (Like YouTube or something craft related) as she cannot work from home due to anxiety as well. (Using phones etc) she also a few years ago said she wanted to be a man and has always thought she was a man since she was a kid, but wouldn't do anything about it to stay with me. This has also affected how I see her, she doesn't act like a woman. I was early 20's when I met her and had nothing going for me and very depressed and didn't think much Into it back then. (My fault) I didn't realize how much this illness of hers would greatly affect my life and just went along with it thinking it'll go away in time. I've had thoughts of not loving her alot of the relationship but always held them back due to thinking I just had to keep trying and things would work out. Basically I am 30 now and we have been together 7 years and married for 4. We have a 5 year old daughter together that I love dearly and have spent a lot of time with everyday to make her happy. I want to leave my wife but I don't want to leave or miss or make my daughter unhappy or have any problems growing up. My dad left me when I was 5 and never hardly saw me after that and I know I have problems stemming from that. If I left I would see her as much as possible but I feel it'll affect her either way. Is it better to leave now while shes 5 than when she's older? I'm really struggling right now and don't know where to turn. I also keep having thoughts id be making a mistake leaving my wife like I would miss her etc. But I feel that might be because I will be alone when I leave or I am just comfortable with her. How do I know for sure I want to leave her? What do I ask myself to fully be able to make a decision. She's a lovely person and sensitive, but I just feel she's not the person for me? We have friendship but no real romance and with her future I just feel I could find someone and build a life better. I know it's selfish and I'm terrible for the decisions I've made. How do I make sure my kid is least affected by this choice?. Since I was young I've never been nurtured or loved much from my parents. My dad left at 5 and hardly saw me after that, and my mum struggled on her own to look after me and my brother. She's never had any hobbies or life ambitions, which resulted in us growing up with no guidance and a lack of hobbies. We never got took anywhere or did anything my whole childhood. I was lonely and found internet gaming and spent nearly ever free second on a game to pass the time and escape reality. School work was either too easy for me or too boring and with the lack of nurturing I didn't realize how much it all meant. I have had depression and anxiety from a child due to these issues which have also impacted my decision making and motivation. I tried to go to university twice and dropped out first year both times from just not going in to the lessons/lectures. After dropping out the second time I just played games in my nans house due to them loving in a holiday home for a year, where I met a girl online which I thought I loved. But deep down I had a feeling I didn't love her properly, but pushed the thoughts away thinking my depression made me not love properly anyway, or that I was supposed to or could fall in love properly if I stuck it out. We ended up living together and having a child (Not planned) she suffers from OCD and I could recieve carers allowance because of this making me not have to find work. I've never had much passion or interest and always thought I wouldn't be able to handle working, or that it was modern day slavery and I couldn't put up with it. That I had lost all my chances due to bad decisions and bad mental health to gain a proper career in something I wanted to do. So working retail or warehouse work just made me feel even more dead inside, which made it easier to accept benefits and play games all day other than looking after my daughter. That's a short rundown of my life but here I am. I don't want to be in this marriage anymore but feel stuck due to having my daughter. I have no work experience or qualifications to speak of. I am 30 years old and feel like literally dead inside and suicidal every waking second at the thought of all the bad mistakes I made due to my own problems and attitude mixed with life upbringing issues. At nearly 31 what can I do to change my life around? The thought of working minimum wage jobs either in customer service or warehouse work for the rest of my life just makes me want to call it quits now. Outside of work I still have no hobbies, I cannot start anything or try anything. I don't understand what's wrong with me. Any advice would be appreciated and any questions I'll answer if you need more information. Thankyou. Since I was young I've never been nurtured or loved much from my parents.

Starting the relationship on anti depressants, and being on them the entire time (7 years together of which 5 married.) I have over the last year coming off them completely realised that i do not love my wife the way that I should, or the way she loves/loved me. I have near unconsciously just been going along thinking this is what I wanted and that I was fine with how things in my life are. Also knowing that deep down I maybe couldnt hurt her sooner and kept on trying/waiting for things to fall into place.I told her around 6 months ago now that I wasn't happy and we have been pretty much ignoring each other since, we still live together currently and are in the process of deciding what to do on many things involving our living situations and our daughter.We live far away from both our familys, and for the last 7 years I have been a carer for my wife as she suffers from major OCD and I have been the primary carer for our daughter.So here's the problems...:1. We're currently waiting for a place with a council (UK) nearer to both our familys for our support but also to give our daughter more people to see and spend time with. But this would mean that we have to live together for 1/2 years until we got a house in our familys town before i could think of getting a job there / moving out to my own place in the town. This put a lot of stress on both of us but also hinders my ability to start a new life/work on bettering myself. But also would be very beneficial for our daughter to be closer to her family. Basically i am stuck between moving out soon and waiting for a chance to move back closer to family.2. My daughter starts school in September but i am the only one who can take her to school due to my wifes mental illness. So if i was to move out now in this town then she wouldn't be able to go to school, as my wife would not let me take her to live with me. (No car or money to take her currently if i was to move out, as i cannot live in the surrounding area due to no flats being in this part of town) But if we was to move back closer to family my wifes mother could take her to school. (Even though i would want to)3. Moving out while not being near family i would be more lonely than i am now + having no friends.4. How do i forgive myself for the guilt of hurting my wife and hurting my daughter when i leave? My father left me and my mum when i was five and i wished that i would never be in this situation. My father never hardly saw me after he left but i would see my daughter as much as i could. Do you see the issues and how theres not one straight forward one without massive problems? If i move out soon around where we live now she wouldnt be able to go to school, and she wouldnt have the chance to be nearer family. If i stay and wait for the move in another town then i could stay here and take her to school, but also delay my own life. I feel immense guilt and pain about all this situation. If i need to explain anything more or you have questions please feel free to ask.TLDR: Marriage breakdown, don't know whether to move out now and build myself, or wait to move closer to family for support and my daughter being with more family. If i move out now my wife wont take her to school due to mental illness. Immense guilt and sadness.. Hey guys! I just wanted to post for some advice about my situation and how I could improve things or advice about the decisions I need to take. Long story short is:My family was always depressed, distant and never nurturing or loving. It's affected my ability to enjoy things or even start anything, like hobbies and knowing who I am or what I want in life. My father left when I was five and hardly ever saw us again after that unless it was the odd day every month or two. My mother obviously hurt by him I feel couldn't love me properly (and told me this at a young age) because I was like and reminded her of my father and struggled looking after me and my brother alone. My nan was basically lobotomized from electric shock therapy and was depressed all my life, and my pap used to tell me he saw me as his own son due to my father leaving us but never acted or showed love or taught me anything. Noone taught me about anything involving real life or character building. So I ended up neck deep into online video games until near enough today where I've realized I've ruined my own life from obviously my upbringing but also my resilience to it and lack of motivation or drive. I've dropped out of university in my twentys twice and never achieved anything but student debt. I've only worked for short periods of time due to depression and anxiety and have not had a job for over 7 years now.So since I dropped out of university I started anti depressants (max dose effexor) and met a girl online that I liked, she gave me attention that nobody else ever did. We met up and I didn't feel the love I thought I was supposed to feel but I thought I couldn't really love or feel things the same as I was depressed. We eventually moved in together and she became pregnant, I was 50/50 at this time about the relationship but thought I had to work on things and not give up. We then moved away from my home town and left family behind thinking it would be nicer nearer the country for us and out daughter. And both having family's that didn't really care and being on anti depressants that numbed me completely I thought this was a good idea.So that's a little back story, here's the problems.I came off my anti depressants as I didn't want to be ruled by having to take a tablet to function and wanted to try to live properly without it. After some major withdrawal from coming off cold turkey I realized and knew that I had not been fully conscious of my decisions and neglected how I really felt all this time about my partner. I realized I do not love her the way she loves me, and that I am unhappy. I feel extreme guilt for hurting her and essentially leading her on for 7 years, married for 5. I know deep down that the tablets aides in my ability to not think or feel about it but I also know I played a role in not having the guts to hurt her sooner and leave. So I have a broken marriage, and a daughter I absolutely adore and would kill me if I had to leave. But I know that if I ever want to be happy I need to leave this house which in turn means I won't see my daughter everyday, put her to bed everyday and take her places everyday. And I know it'll destroy my daughter for awhile and probably affect her life when I do. Ive been able to not work due to my partners mental health disorder but getting carers allowance and PiP (UK) Which is a blessing as I got to spend all my time with my daughter, but also a curse as I never was made to do anything to improve myself or struggle to survive and having to work to pay bills. Being away from family hurts as well as I am lonely, they were not great but I would like to try to build a relationship with them. But I am hundreds of miles away. So I have a broken marriage and extreme guilt, losing a best friend, while having to think about leaving this house and not being a proper father and giving her a proper family which I wished to have growing up. I also am scared and lack motivation to start work as I'll be stuck in dead end jobs possibly forever now I don't have a chance of redoing university. I'm so lonely and broken and broken so many people. I feel like I can't go on anymore. I also have no friends. Quick summary: broken marriage, have to leave my daughter (Same house) hundreds of miles away from any support system, no friends, no hobbies or passion due to lack of nurturing and guidance growing up and no job or career. Just wanted any advice or anything to help me push through this storm. I don't know what you can say to help but I needed to share. Anything else you can ask that may help I will respond. Thankyou. Hey guys! I just wanted to post for some advice about my situation and how I could improve things or advice about the decisions I need to take. Long story short is:My family was always depressed, distant and never nurturing or loving. It's affected my ability to enjoy things or even start anything, like hobbies and knowing who I am or what I want in life. My father left when I was five and hardly ever saw us again after that unless it was the odd day every month or two. My mother obviously hurt by him I feel couldn't love me properly (and told me this at a young age) because I was like and reminded her of my father and struggled looking after me and my brother alone. My nan was basically lobotomized from electric shock therapy and was depressed all my life, and my pap used to tell me he saw me as his own son due to my father leaving us but never acted or showed love or taught me anything. Noone taught me about anything involving real life or character building.

Just wanted any advice or anything to help me push through this storm. I don't know what you can say to help but I needed to share.I just wanted some advice on how to leave my wife. We have been together for 7 years and married for 5 of them. Since I met her I have been on anti depressants and recently came off them 6 months ago, during these months I have slowly realized I don't think I love her anymore or never really have because the tablets removed my full ability to feel love properly. The problem is I wouldn't be able to leave for months. Do I tell her now or when I have somewhere to move?. Don't give up the good fight! We're with you all the way!. I love the fact Safemoon has started to market again!The only problem i have is that for people that aren't aware of Safemoon or cryptocurrencys may not know what the advert is actually about. This leave's out A LOT of potential investor's!!On the advert it should say "cryptocurrency" Or "The future of banking" Something to let people know outside the crypto bubble what we're actually about and not just some fancy looking background with #Safemoonwallet on. LOVELY BACKGROUND... HASHTAG - for only those that use twitter #Safemoonwallet But... WHAT IS SAFEMOON?. <3.
    My girlfriend has pushed me, her family, and everyone she loves away. She feels numb and she said her people meter is very low. She says she can't do physical touch like holding hands/hugging or anything. It says it makes her feel weird. She hasn't texted me or called in many days, she leaves me open and only sometimes answers when I ask a question. We met up Friday and she said that she misses me and loves me still and she still wants me. She said she still loves me and at the very least we're friends right now. This sucks because all I think about is her and I want this to be over and I get my cuddly, smiley girlfriend back. She has also started 3 new medications, is talking to a therapist, and has started vaping again to cope with this depression. I know it's bad because she started vaping, she told me in the past she didn't want to do it again. All I think about is her and I've prayed more than I've ever prayed in my life for this to get better. Is there anything that I can do to help, she says I can't do anything and only professionals can help. We don't live together, we used to see each other 3-5 times a week. Now it's dropped down to once every three weeks.I just feel alone and lost and want her back. Does anyone have any tips on what to do to support her? I was thinking I needed to do things for myself because I'd been waiting for her. It's getting me nowhere. We've dated for 3 and a half years. She said we've made it through a lot and we can make it through this. I'm just scared we won't, I've had so many people leave me and I'm scared she's next.I got the game on Sunday, I’m having a lot of fun but I am stuck! I’m trying to get to the 4th shrine so I can open the door. I pray to the angle and I have the map ability on my purah pad. I’m not sure how to use it, I tried using it and I can only stamp location not travel to it. How do you travel?I know you can’t travel right to the yellow dot but close to it yes?. My AirPods stopped keeping a charge and would die after every use. I’ve had them for about a year and a half and got them with some Hanukkah money. I bought them at Costco, I kept the box as one does with any Apple product. They scanned my card and the box made sure the charger was in there and took my old AirPods away. She gave me $200 and I went and found the display with the AirPod cardboard signs took one and brought it to the register. It was $20 extra with tax and all but I got AirPods for $20 today!. My girlfriend has suffered from depression for as long as I have known her (the last 3 1/2 years) . This last Monday I asked if she wanted to hang out and she said no and she was having a bad mental health day and she need space for the day. I gave her that space and things have just gotten worse. She says she doesn’t want to speak. She says it has nothing to do with me and won’t tell me what triggered it or what’s happening. I bought her flowers, chocolate and two books. She didn’t want them. I left them at her door step and then her step mom asked her what was wrong and she doesn’t want to tell anyone. She only told me and her aunt. I feel like her dad and step mom should check on her but I can’t tell them because she told me not to. Friday (my yesterday) I kept telling her I love her and she kept leaving me on read. Finally she told me to stop texting because she doesn’t want to talk. I understood until I went to bed I called to to say I love you and goodnight she yelled at me saying she didn’t want to talk to anyone and how she wanted just one day! I got frustrated and said it’s been several days. She was crying and she hung up on me. I didn’t call back even though I wanted to so bad. She’s completely shut me out. She told me she wanted to self harm and had to fix it. She says I have to trust her. I just don’t know what to do because I want to trust her but it seems to just keep getting worse. I havn’t texted her since the call. I feel mad at this fucking depression for taking my girlfriend. I need advice on how I can support her.

I just discovered that the train goes through many cities and I need something to do besides lay in bed all day. It sounds like an adventure but also kinda of dumb because I have no destination. Also it’s free for me.For everyone who keeps saying my sister sucks, she meant the “main character” as being a good main character of the start of a story not a self centered person.Update: I went on the train ride by myself! It was really cool and I took some fun pictures. I had to get off half way through because I got called in to work but I went for about 3 hours and I had a blast and I saw a lot of cool people in costumes because there was a Comiccon thing going on. I was sad I got called into work because I really wanted to finish my trip but I will finish it someday. Thank you all for the lovely comments and hyping me up! -love Jack Reacher. In case no one has told you! You are trying your best and I know you are doing what you can and that is good enough for today! I’m proud of you!!! Love random internet stranger. I don’t watch porn, I much rather read about sex or imagine it. It I accidentally see porn I’m grossed out. I feel like a weirdo because everyone likes porn.My best friend (23f) came out as a lesbian 2 years ago. She had one serious gf they dated for about a year and half. How ever her gf was very abusive and cheat constantly. I told her for months that her gf was not good for her and she needed to leave. I listened to her for months crying and telling me how awful she was. Finally they broke up because my friends start to like this other woman she worked with at the hospital. They dated for about 4 months and again this woman hit my friend and class her slurs. My friend cried for 3 months after they broke up. I told her that they’re someone out there that will love her for her and she doesn’t need to work for it. She is in therapy, her therapist said she needs to start going on dates with multiple people for a few months before getting into a relationship. She got on all the dating apps she found this woman who’s 20 never been in a relationship my friend liked her for about two week then broke it off saying she just wasn’t feeling it. The girl blocked her and that angered my friends and she said she was an asshole. I told her she probably broke this girl heart and to not be so harsh on her. Then at the beginning of august she started talking to this trans guy, they went on a date and slept together. They sexted and flirt constantly. Then the man told her that he had a crush on someone else. Which angered my friend. I told her she should be so quick and catch feeling because they are aloud to date other people. Now all she does is complain she’ll never find love. I try to tell her she will but she doesn’t want to hear that. I don’t know what to tell her anymore. I’m tired of her complaining. Things take time and she should stop rushing her feelings.I'm sitting on the porch, waiting for the rain. It's blowing wind and keeps thundering and lightning, but there's no rain. It's just my dog and me, he's laying in the dirt. Not scared of the thunder, he just lays his head down and occasionally looks up at me or looks at a car that's zooming by. We live right off a highway with a small mountain in front of our barn. The cool air feels nice, running through my hair. The sun is starting to set and the clouds are a beautiful yellow and pink color on one side of the sky then a dark indigo and purple on the other side. The thunder is soft but heavy sounding but the closer it gets the more it sounds like a firework popping off. After about half an hour my grandpa comes walking up from the garden asking what I'm waiting for. I tell him about the rain. He sits down and waits with me. We talk about work and thunder. He tells me “The stronger the lightning the louder the thunder” We wait until we witness a strong lightning strike and then a roar of thunder. Soon it starts sprinkling and I smell the beautiful rain then it starts down pouring. My dog comes and sits next to me and we sit and watch the rain.I just finished watching juno, what are some other fun awkward teenage movies? I have prime/Hulu/Netflix/maxPlease give fun suggestions!. If you don’t know there was a submarine that went down to explore the titanic wreckage. There are 5-6 passengers. I’m unclear on all details. I’m really freaked out tho. Honestly it makes me feel so small and helpless. I’m no where near and ocean and I know awful things happen all the time but being trapped in a small space with depleting oxygen is something I don’t want to imagine. There’s not even good enough technology to go rescue the missing if they’re trapped in the wreckage. The cost guards says they’re working on it but what can they really do? Now it’s all over my tiktok, and I’m checking the new outlets hourly for updates. I just really hope and pray everyone’s safe and is found. It’s giving me same feelings when I found out about some miners that missing underground a few years ago. After a few days they called off the search but it still makes me sad thinking that they could have been alive. I know the submarine only has about three days of supplies. I know deep down that it’s not good odds but I’m still hoping. But I’m scared and anxious.Literally I’d be scrolling through Reddit, and see “my sister calls me 3 times day” and I start reading it hoping it’s not my sister…. Even though my sister doesn’t have Reddit. Guess I’m just feel insecure, does anyone else go through this? Or just me?. I had a panic attack today in the shower. I was hyperventilating and sobbing in the shower. I was a horrible snotty mess. I was so upset about an argument I had with my mother on Monday. I told my best friend and my girlfriend they asked if I was okay and that was the end of the conversation. Then I told my sister she did acknowledge it and ignored me. I already felt like shit. That made me feel a thousand times worse. I this…I feel so alone even though I have good people but nobody talks through stuff with me and I just feel like I don’t matter.I glanced to see what my brother was looking at it……it was a dick! I can’t….I’m so uncomfortable right now. Learned my lesson. Never looking over at the brothers phone again. 🤮. I feel a bit lonely and need people to talk to about life. I was scrolling through TikTok. The video played of a pastor saying how it’s not wrong to be gay or question your gender it’s just wrong to act on it. Which made me feel really shitty. Because I’m gay and have a gf. I love her a lot and I also love God and it just sucks because every time I feel comfortable with myself I see something that crumbles me down. I just hate being gay!. It’s my birthday I’m 27, kinda crazy how far I’ve come. I just wish life wouldn’t go so fast. I’m waiting for life to start I feel like and sometimes it feels like it’s almost overI get my first tattoo on Saturday I’m scared and very excited. How bad is the pain? Will I cry?. I’m at the library. I’m sitting in the corner. There was this dude in his 20s. I’m guessing, sitting a few feet away from me. He’s playing a race at a game, and half of his body is underneath the desk. I didn’t think much of it until I saw his hand jiggling/shaking underneath the desk. I’m not sure if he was jerking off, but he kept looking around and stopping putting his hand on the desk every time someone walked by. He had AirPods in. I was assuming he was listening to porn. He suddenly got up and left. I was trying not to pay attention, but I was baffled and kept side-eyeing to figure out if he was jerking off. The library seems like not the most arousing place, but to each their own, I guess.Update: back at the library today, and the same dude is in the same spot. Again the guy's arm/hand was underneath the desk until someone came and sat next to him. I told my mom what happened, and she said if it occurred again, I should inform the librarians…anyone has any thoughts on that?. Why are people so fake? Why does everyone want to hang out with rude asshole famous people? It's so fucked up. Fuck my grandpa, he's an asshole, and yet everyone wants to hang out with him! My grandma is so lovely, and she doesn't even have that many friends! Karma doesn't exist because if it did, my grandpa would be the loser.Dear Wendy’s, please stop giving me one sauce when I order two nuggets orders. Also, it would make my day if you put in the ketchup packets I asked for!. Dear Wendy’s, please stop giving me one sauce when I order two nuggets orders. Also, it would make my day if you put in the ketchup packets I asked for!. Dear Wendy’s, please stop giving me one sauce when I order two nuggets orders. Also, it would make my day if you put in the ketchup packets I asked for!. When I shake a man's hand, all I can think about is how he’s probably touched his dick within the last couple of hours with this hand that’s touching mine. It stresses me out as a lesbian. Is this a me problem, or does anyone else experience this thought?. Big hugs to all who need one. You are doing your best!. I'm so tired of having to watch football at every goddamn family event. It isn't enjoyable and pointless. I'm tired of getting judged for my likes when all my family acts like football is the only thing in the world that matters. Ps why does my uncles act so gay for the players and then they judge gay people. Like fuckkkkk football. My brother came out to our parents today. I came out to them over three years ago. My parents are classic conservative Christian parents. It wasn’t received well. I don’t think it was received well for my brother either. I feel stressed and sick to my stomach for him. I fucking wish homophobia was not a thing. I hope he’s okay… Any words of encouragement?. I wish my family would except me. I wish I didn’t have to live in the shadows. I’m in so much pain over this. I want them to meet her. To know I love her, I want them to come to my wedding if we ever get married. I hate when they say we love you unconditionally because that’s a lie. I hate hiding; I want to run and be free. Please don’t be upset mom and dad. Just no I didn’t feel safe enough to tell you.I'm just alone. I have no one to talk to, even though I have many families, a gf, and friends. I hate my sister’s boyfriend. He keeps her away from me. My brother and I fight constantly. My girlfriend and I are in a secret long-distance relationship, which sucks. We barely talked last few weeks. I want to scream. None of my friends will answer my snaps or texts. I think life’s not worth it. I'm slipping into a a hole. Fuckkkkk life fuck everything.I’m the asshole, and I already know I am. She came out to the family. I don’t think she’s whatever she is; she’s just doing it to create drama. She’s a bitch who screwed me over bad. I don’t want her to screw up my life anymore. I couldn’t give less of a fuck about her.I'm scared, so fucking scared. I'm gay, and I live with my very conservative parents. (My dad is a pastor, and my mother believes that everything is evil) I’ve been in a secret relationship with my GF for two and a half years. I came out to my parents three months into the relationship. They didn’t take it well and haven’t talked about it since. I’m scared I hate lying to them. My cousin, who’s, I guess, bisexual, came out to her dad today. It’s only a matter of time before everyone in the family knows. I’m so scared that my parents will start asking about me again. I’m afraid my parents will make me break up with my girlfriend. Fuck! I feel like crying. I’m so scared. I know I shouldn’t, but I feel frustrated with my cousin. I know it’s selfish but I just want to die right now.I need recommendations for a family movie. To watch with my parents it can be rated R or pg-13 but no sex scenes is preferred (my dad will make comments) something on Netflix, Amazon or HBO preferred. I am a woman and I love being a woman but honestly just like walking around with no shirt sounds amazing and just being a hot dude would be awesome some days. Just being able to pee in on a bush or in a bottle would be cool. Like I really wish I could just switch genders all the time.
    I'm in my final year in college, majoring in a subject I give zero fucks about. I was the high school topper, always passionate and interested in learning. Now, the University I am in slowly drained out the part of me that was excited and driven, and now, I barely go to college, struggling to have the minimum attendance required. The professors are passion-less and have an insane amount of headweight, I don't know who let them teach, and I don't know why I am learning the things I am learning. I study the night before exams, and somehow, I top the class. I feel undeserving of this because so many people from my class are from economically backward families and are first-graduate students. They put so much effort into the degree and exams. Anyhow, I'm at the edge where I have to make some important career choices. I don't have a calling. Or anything really. The world confuses me. Suppose I work for an MNC. I get good money and all, but wouldn't I be working my ass off to make someone else richer? I wouldn't even know why I am working or what really my contribution is to the company, and I don't want to be stuck in the meaningless battle toward hierarchical powers in a company that gives no shit about me... What about government jobs? The IFS post really draws me in. I am interested in political sciences and all, but I don't want to be stuck among officials who know the rules just to manipulate them in their favor. I realized the world is cruel and unjust and insidiously selfish, and now I have to deal with this. Four years of college with no real friendships, learnings, or potential career paths, and now I have to deal with it all. I feel more lost and directionless than I ever have been. College is supposed to help you figure yourselves right? Am I the only one feeling this? I feel like the only true career path that leaves me satisfied with a good night's rest would be humanitarian work. And I have no clue how to go there. I want to travel and see snow, mountains, and the northern lights and live a vibrant life. Not a luxurious one. But a vibrant one. A life filled with too many photos and memories. And how do I earn the money for this? Is this all life really is: Do a job, earn money, have maybe some things off your bucket list checked, and die? And hey, only the real, real, super lucky ones get to have true love from partners and friends. Everyone is a jealous, miserable piece of shit, and you must deal with that. And hey, you will turn out to be one for sure, no matter what. How did I not realize any of this until now? Why does growing up have to be so.. IDK scarring? confusing? conflicting? painful? UGHHHHHHHHHH I don't want this. I feel like my best years were behind me and now I'm stuck in a place where everything and everyone around me is seemingly able to at least pretend to keep their shit together, but mine is just everywhere. HELP PLISSSSSSSSSS.
    I know that there are things I can do and changes I can make that will improve my mood, but I don't want to be happier, I want to die.
    If a person with dyed hair was bitten and turned, would their hair go back to it's natural color?I have a feeling it does, but how cool would it be if it didn't? Like a person can have teal (or whatever) color hair forever.I've been doing fairly well for several months. To the point that I didn't need to talk to my therapist every month. Today, though, has been bad. A year ago I quit my job due to horrible, unfair treatment by my manager. In 2 days I have a meeting with a Judge about my unemployment claim. The anxiety is bringing up memories of the mistreatment I went through in a previous job. Prior to Walmart. It's making think of a situation where I was abandoned by HR and went through severe verbal and mental abuse by associates under me. I hate thinking about that time. I've been crying all day. The memories won't stop.I'm off to go distract myself. Wish me luck.I've been wanting a Leah Clearwater barbie for stories I'm going to do on Instagram, but I don't want to be considered insensitive. I bought an articulated Pocahontas barbie, and I plan on cutting her hair to match Leah's in BD. I chose a Pocahontas because she's the only native American doll I could find that didn't have a big smile on her face. I just now started to wonder if I would be canceled for it. I just love Leah so much and I wanted to play out her scenes in the Barbie world.Hello. I'm about to win a Pocahontas barbie soon, but her hair is messed up. It looks pretty rough. So how do I restore it?From what I've gathered here and there, I can shampoo and conditioner it with regular products, and detangle the hair while the conditioner is in. But I've also seen people dunk the hair in hot water after. Should I do that?. I just want to set it up with my Barbie collection and stare at it. LOL!!!Anyone else?. Has anyone ever scrolled through the Twilight dolls on ebay? There are are new in box, unboxed with original accessories, unboxed nude dolls, and unboxed with random outfits. I've noticed that the unboxed with random outfits are priced so outrageously! I saw Victoria dolls dressed in ugly outfits, that don't even match Victoria's personality, priced between $37 and $50!!! Plus shipping! There was one Victoria doll dressed in a Flintstones style dress, no shoes, and priced so high it made me laugh out loud. Then there was a nude Bella doll with severely matted hair, priced over $32. Just makes me wonder what the seller is thinking.Should I print out my Twilight fanfic or my favorite fic and put it in the local Little Free Library? LOL!What would you do if you found a fanfic in your neighborhood Little Free Library?. We are very excited to announce the Payroll Analyst recruitment is now open. We look forward to this opportunity for internal and external candidates and ask that you consider applying and spread the word.https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/saclibrary. Okay, let's get a little girly. LOL! What kind of purse would each of the women in Twilight use?I think:Bella would wear a backpack purse.Esme would wear a fashionable tote bag.Rosalie would either wear a cute crossbody or little handbag.Alice would wear a crossbody, but one of those that look like another everyday item made into a purse. Like the Chinese takeout box fashion purse.Leah would wear either a backpack purse or a crossbody.IDK, I thought this would be a fun/different post. Do you agree with my choices, or do you have different answers? Can you add onto it? I.E. what would Jane wear?. Hello!Do clothes from Poppy Parker dolls and Blythe dolls fit regular Barbies?There is an outfit from a Poppy Parker doll that I'm very interested in, but looking at pics of those dolls makes me question whether the outfit will work for a Barbie. Same with the Blythe outfit.I'm currently collecting the entire lines for Butterfly Tattoo, Pearl Beach, Sun Jewel, and Hula Hair Barbies. Meaning, Barbie AND her friends. How do you collect? By full product lines, or just Barbie only?IDK, I just have bad feelings about leaving out the friends when they all go together.From the SacramentoLibrary: "We are very excited to announce the Information Technology Technician recruitment is now open. We look forward to this opportunity for internal and external candidates and ask that you consider applying and spread the word. Check it out and apply"https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/saclibrary. Exactly what the title says: We're you more of a Barbie only kid? Or did you like Barbie's friends?In the 90s, I used to ask my mom for mainly Teresa dolls because she has brown hair, like me. I also used to like Skipper because her outfits were cuter imo. I also didn't lean towards Ken, I preferred Steven.In order my favorites were:Teresa, Steven,Skipper,Kira,Ken,Christie,Barbie,As a (new) collector, I would like to have the whole gang. Example: right now I'm collecting all the Butterfly Tattoo dolls from the late 90s.Is it okay for a 33 year old to collect Barbies? Is it wierd?weird? Is there anyone else on here who collects?. Is there anybody on here, or that can direct me to a page, that can repaint my Barbie's eyes? I'm making a DIY Twilight doll and I need her eyes to be amber, or gold, color.So I just bought a red headed, articulated barbie on ebay and the clothes to a Bella barbie. She is not like the Victoria doll. She has straight, auburn hair and some freckles painted on her face. For now, I will dress her in Bella's barbie clothes, but I'll continue to look for something that's her own. Pictures to come!!. I've been donating books to a little free library on 24th Ave. The cross street is Atlas Ave. But I just put in "Sisters of the Lost Nation" a few minutes ago.Where are some other little free libraries in Sac. Maybe close to Sac City College?. I have come to realize that I have a serious problem with sleeping pills. I take them every night and now I'm taking them while I'm at home during the day because I'm so sad and angry with my life. I just like to feel the drowsiness creep in and being able to escape my life through sleep. It's been months of this happening. I just sent off an email to my doctor about this. I'm scared of what's to come next. I don't want to lose my husband due to this addiction, but I secretly blame him just a little bit for how stuck our life has become.I can't believe I let it get to this.Hello! I just recently found out about a little volunteer run library specifically for those who are LGBTQ+, and I really connected with the person who told me about the library. They explained that they have to work with a very small budget to add books to their collection, and they usually use ex-public library books for their collection.I really want to help them out by donating some books to their collection. Can you list some LGBTQ+ books to me that I should look up and buy for them?.
    It is amazing to me how many people exist. Anytime I leave my house I’m blown away how many people there are. And that’s just one town in one state, makes me think about the rest of the world. Are there too many people in the world? I also don’t understand why people have so many kids.Just venting wondering if anyone else feels the way I do. I’m 25, I pursued college straight out of high school and now have a job in the medical industry. I worked in fast food from 16 up until I got my medical license. Now I’ve been a professional for 3 years and I’ve realized that I hate working. Ive struggled with depression for 6 years. I have horrible social anxiety, I hate talking to people. I think it’s genetic because my sister and dad have really bad mental health problems. On the outside I look fine, normal, but inside is a constant battle in my mind and without medication I would likely be an absolute hot mess.I love time to myself, I enjoy cleaning and cooking, and I honestly just would love to be a housewife. My husband and I don’t have kids yet, we can’t afford it (we can but we would struggle). I just would love nothing more than to be a stay at home mom. But we can’t afford for me to not work. We can not survive off my husbands income, especially with wanting kids in the future. It’s literally exhausting working full time AND keeping up with cooking and cleaning and just everything you have to do in life. What happened to living off of one income? Now you have to both work full time just to afford the damn PG&E bill and rent. Is this just the way of life? You just work until you’re old and close to dying? What makes me dread doing life is working. I would even work from home if I could and trust me I’ve been looking for remote jobs for like 6months. Nothing even comes close to the pay I have now, it doesn’t financially make sense to leave my current position to work remote. So I’m stuck and I hate it. Having to go to work everyday makes me wanna just die. I hate interacting with people I just want to be left alone. Everyday I wake up and feel a sense of dread that I have to work. But it’s 2023 and everything is so expensive so this is it, I’ll just work until I’m old. Always struggle in the middle class and work my life away just to afford to live and eat.
    I am a (20m) and things still haven’t changed and due to a series of unfortunate events that have happened to me over the past several years, i’m starting to lose my own sanity, to give some context i’ve been diagnosed and have been living with a series of multiple different mental illnesses and one of them is of course major depressive disorder but over the past several years my mental health has just been declining ever since specifically for 5 almost 6 years now and there are many reasons for this such as loss of friends and family, self hatred, self harm, abuse and much more, i’ve been having a lot of suicidal thoughts as of lately, i currently am on 2 different types of medication and i also currently go to therapy and it has helped but nothing major has changed and as of lately more and more things just keep happening to me and i don’t know what i did to deserve this treatment, there was this girl i was talking to about 2-3 months ago and things were going well at first but then one day things just flipped, she stopped talking to me, didn’t answer my calls, would take days to respond, etc and later i find out she was sleeping with some other guy who just so happened to get into contact with me through her phone and started humiliating me, saying things i wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy, me and her fortunately never dated but still, despite that i feel sick just thinking about it, i can’t even look at other girls the same anymore even though they have nothing to do with it, i have no desire for intimacy anymore, no sex, kissing, or anything related even the slightest as simple as holding hands and i haven’t for awhile now because of it, i don’t even have the desire to be around girls yet alone pursue a relationship ever since it’s happened, it’s all ruined, i’ve been broken, there is so much i want to do and the thought of revenge has been lingering in my mind for awhile now and i don’t know what to do, i’ve been super depressed and tired and because of what that disgusting thing of a person that guy had said to me, i’ve been having suicidal thoughts and even worse i’ve been having homicidal thoughts as well. I haven’t spoken or seen any of my family for months now even before all of this has happened with the girl i was once talking to 2-3 months ago, and even thought it’s all already been said and done and i haven’t talked to either of them since and i probably never will… at least i have no intention to, i don’t know what to do anymore, i’ve completely lost my mind because of everything that has happened to me over the past 5-6 years and now this, what did i do to deserve this? i offered her everything i had and it still wasn’t enough. I’ve tried many different things to keep my mind occupied from all the suicidal and homicidal thoughts these past couple of weeks and it works for a little bit but at the end of the day it always ends up coming back to me, i’ve been ruined, my desire for love/intimacy has been shattered, i’ve always considered myself asexual from the beginning and i still am, but now i just don’t want anything to do with anyone anymore, would being single forever and living in isolation just be better? would me going down the path of revenge on the one who did this to me be the best option? should i just look at everyone as my enemy? people always tell me to just “let it go” but i honestly just can’t, my mental health is declining rapidly, i’ve been having suicidal and homicidal thoughts, i have no desire to love or be around anyone anymore, i want to get my revenge on that bastard, what should i do? if anyone who has taken the time to read this, thank you, i apologize for it being so much to read but i just had it get it all out somehowsend me answers please, thank you all. i’m a (20m) and as of lately i’ve not been doing well with my mental health at all, i’ve been dealing with mental illness for about 6 years now and one of the illnesses is major depressive disorder and because of that, i’m afraid, with all the horrible things going on in the world with murder, war and just overall hatred i just wish people would be more kind to each other, i started breaking down crying last night just thinking about all the horrible and horrific things that has happened to people all over the world, i just don’t know what to do anymore, i’m tired of seeing people die, i’m tired of seeing people suffer from all these horrible things that people do to one another, how could anyone do such horrible things? i just can’t anymore, i’ve fought hard long enough and i’ve honestly been starting to give up as of lately, i’m just tired of living, i’m tired of everything, everyday just feels the same constantly on repeat, nothing new, i don’t wanna continue living in a world where people are always so mean to each other, i just don’t wanna continue living anymore, lately i’ve been dissociating to try to forget about it but the thoughts always end up coming back, i cry all the time just thinking about it, maybe dying would just be better rather than living in a world where nobody cares, i don’t know what to do, what can i do? i just want everyone to be happy and to love each other, is it really that hard?, to anymore who reading this, send me your thoughts and answers please, how can we make this world a better place, how can i stop breaking down crying every night after seeing and hearing about the horrible things going on around the world, help me please, thank you.I a (20m) can’t stand to look at the sight or thought of any sort of intimacy going on in my life rather it be kissing, sex or any sort of sexual interaction from one person to another, i’ve had sex a few times before in my life and as of recently these past few months my mental health has just declined and because of that, sex or even watching porn makes me wanna vomit, not only does it make me sick but it makes me so frustrated just looking at it yet alone the thought of it too, but intimacy for me personally has just been ruined for me, i can’t get too much into it but due to being cheated on and such in the past just the thought of someone else being intimate with someone who i was originally with just makes me sick, and due to the current state of my mental health it doesn’t make it any easier and also because of that, i have no more desire to pursue any sort of relationship with another girl, i doubt i’ll even ever have kids someday, which none the less, i don’t want to have kids period, i don’t know why i feel this way and it’s just been ruined for me, if anybody else can relate to this, send me answers please, thank you. hey, so something that has been on my mind a lot as of lately is that i simply don’t know who to become anymore, i a (20m) live alone with my cat, but anyways, i simply don’t know who to become as a person anymore, i try to be a good person and help others and be kind to everyone regardless if people are kind back to me or not, but someone as myself who has been thrown under the rug one times too many, i don’t wanna do this anymore, i don’t want to be a bad person but at the same time it’s like the world is testing my patience trying to make me become this selfish, cold, heartless person, i don’t want to become that person but it seems that’s how it’s suppose to be, to give some context, throughout my life, i’ve been homeless due to the person who i thought was my best friend kicked me out, my mom has been in and out of jail several times, my dad was never around growing up, i’ve been betrayed, abandoned, backstabbed many times while my intentions have always been pure, i’ve been disrespected more times than i can count, i don’t know what to do anymore, to those who read this, what do you think i should do, should i keep being kind? should i be more cautious and defensive? what should i do moving forward? send me answers please, thank you.does anyone else with depression feel intense amounts of tiredness and fatigue throughout there day? i’m a 20 year old male and i’ve been dealing with a variety of different mental illnesses but when it comes to depression, i’ve been feeling super tired and weak and lots of fatigue as of lately, i have an appointment with my psychiatrist on the 12th of October this month so only a few days away as i’m making this post and i’m gonna be getting put on medication to help with depression and other mental illnesses too that i’ve been diagnosed with, can anyone give me suggestions on what has helped you with this issue and same to those who are on medication to help share what helped with your mental illness and symptoms, thank you all.something i’d like to ask the people apart of the X community including myself is, what does everyone plan on doing now? considering that jahseh is gone. what i mean by this is since a lot of content has released throughout the past 5 years of jahsehs passing such as photos, videos, interviews, clothing, etc. i’m sure that there isn’t much left to share of jahseh right? so because of something like that what does you guys the fans plan on doing? do you guys plan on still listening to his music? move on and let him go? what do you guys plan to do? also what do you guys think jahsehs management team will do from here, do you think they still have some more stuff to share of jahseh? let me know what you guys plans to do. i try to stay optimistic and think there will be more to come but let me know what you guys think. thank you all ❤️🦋. Something I was wanting to ask the X community here on Reddit was, how do you guys cope with the passing of jahseh? The reason why I ask is simply just because lately I’ve been struggling to cope with his passing considering he meant very much to me in many ways and I tend to sometimes breakdown or tear up just thinking about him, so I was wanting to ask everyone how do you guys cope knowing the fact that he is gone? Or at least what do you guys think is the best way to cope with his passing?. Something that I would like to ask from the X community is, is there gonna be anymore content left of X in the future such as music, interviews, photo shoots, etc. The reason I ask is because lately I’ve been thinking about X a lot and I’ve just been not only curious but also afraid of when the day comes when there will be nothing left of X. So if you guys know if there will be any big plans in the future feel free to put it down in the comments. Thank you all <3. Is it just me or can literally any X fan tell you when and what they were doing the day they found out X passed away.
