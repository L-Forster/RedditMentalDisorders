I apologize if this post seems confusing, but my ex-girlfriend left me in a terrible manner after 3.5 years, and it’s been 9 months since. Since my ex, I’ve started seeing a woman I genuinely like, but my bipolar disorder has become tumultuous again after just 2 weeks.Once more, I found myself contemplating suicide after just 1.5 weeks due to the chaos in my mind and the desperate need for peace. I immediately reached out to my care team to avoid any impulsive actions and managed to secure an emergency appointment for the following day. I’ve now started a new medication to help calm my racing thoughts and bring some stillness to my mind.Tonight, I was with this new woman, but it seemed like the medication wasn’t enough. I messaged my friends with a fake SOS to create an opportunity to escape, as my mind was spiraling negatively. Now, I’m overwhelmed with self-doubt, questioning if bipolar disorder is entirely controlling my life. I wonder if I’m just relying on defense mechanisms or if it’s time to take responsibility and act like an adult.Has anyone else experienced a similar situation, and if so, do you have any advice for dealing with it?. Hi, everybody.I often find myself thinking about my bipolar at random times and questioning myself all the time, every action, interaction with people when I’m in that state of mind. When I’m in that period, I usually think about whether I’ll lose this battle with my bipolar at some point and when that might happen. Usually, I can shrug it off, but with each episode, it becomes more intense. The ‘demon’ inside me whispers in the back of my head, ‘it’s only a matter of time.’ Does anyone else also struggle with this?.
    Every psychiatrist in my area isn’t accepting new patients. The only one I could get ahold of told me to go to the er and that gave me nothing. Therapy doesn’t help. Wasn’t sick enough for the psych ward. I feel lost and hopeless. I can’t live like this forever. Talked to a telehealth psychiatrist about maybe getting antipsychotics and antidepressants, started explaining my symptoms and he immediately told me to go the ER and explain my symptoms, cancelled the meeting.I go to the ER explain everything and they just have me sit in the er room awaiting a psychiatrist for five hours. Nobody shows up so they discharge me. Waste of time honestly, they can’t bump me up in priority or send me to a psych ward cause I wanna live and don’t wanna harm others Seems it doesn’t matter I had no idea how I got there, was hallucinating, and was having severe mood swings. Why’s it hella hard to get a diagnosis and meds. I have type 1 bipolar, and I’m going to be working with a therapist for a possible schizotypal pd and PTSD diagnosis as well as hopefully finally getting on anti depressants and anti psychotics and it feels like I’m not normal enough to fit in but act normal enough to just be whimsical aloof and strange. Even during psychosis it seemed like everyone knew something was wrong, but it wasn’t enough to spark actual genuine concern because I express all my symptoms only in solitude. Is this a normal thing? Because for me it’s become the only thing. It feels like I’m hiding it but it’s almost impossible for me to not hide it. I can’t even talk to my girlfriend who I’ve told everything while I’m having an episode only after the fact and honestly I only share about 10% of specific events because it feels like the same story over and over It just seems so unreal to me. I often ask myself if it’s worse to see and hear strange and horrible things and not react than to react But hell, I don’t even know anymore, I can’t tell if people are scared of me or I just look like I’m not much of a talker, I can’t tell how people think of me or if they notice or not and I can’t tell if my perception of how I act and how I’m perceived is dillusionary or real. It’s just all so confusing. First day of Manic cycle, please I've been up for 24 hours now, I'm tired but not it's this weird in between. It seems as soon as i go to go to sleep I'm wide awake, but my eyes hurt so bad smh. Unpopular opinion: Game is a masterpiece[What is Psychosis REALLY Like?](https://youtu.be/jjWGMNKgVDg). I saw a ton of hate on Reddit for Layers of Fear 2; but I personally think this game is absolutely amazing and shows off psychosis really well https://youtu.be/jjWGMNKgVDg. [https://youtu.be/jjWGMNKgVDg?si=6Nu5oLotsEcwrRnZ](https://youtu.be/jjWGMNKgVDg?si=6Nu5oLotsEcwrRnZ)I posted this yesterday and have gotten about 17 views. My click through rate is at 0.5%; those who do watch watch more than usual at an avg of 3 minutes.The premise is someone who's actually experienced psychosis reviews and comments about horror game about psychosis. I'm curious if this is a good niche to explore.. I got diagnosed (Bipolar Type 1) not too long ago, and when I tell friends about Bipolar they automatically think about Type 2 and don't understand why I have hallucinations. I've had to resort to calling myself a schizophrenic in order to get the point across. Is this okay? Like it seems like the only way to get the constant paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions across..
    I've flirted with / propositioned a few friends and made them uncomfortable, I feel so guilty for making them feel unsafe. I apologized and made an emergency appointment with my nurse to get on a mood stabilizer again.&#x200B;I don't know how to not hate myself for this, I feel like the only way to keep myself from hurting other people is to isolate myself. Has anyone had something similar happen and were you able to recover friendships? They don't owe me anything and I don't want anyone around me while manic anymore.
    It’s almost impossible to get help/medication for bipolar in my country and I’m too poor to afford private therapy.. does anyone know if there’s any way I can take control of my bipolar by myself to some extent?? Or am I a lost cause? I’m so tired of living like this and it’s destroying everything around me.I love my cat and I make sure to play with her as much as possible during the day so she’s not bored in the night.. but it doesn’t seem to help! When my boyfriend goes to bed it’s fine apparently but as soon as I lie down she starts screaming and howling and dragging all her toys into the bedroom.I feel so guilty but I don’t know what else to do. I’ve tried getting those “self-sufficient” toys like the ball track ones and springy snakes and stuff.. but she refuses to play with anything on her own because she always wants me to be involved! Any advice or alternative toy recommendations are appreciated~. Hi, so my Razer Deathadder Chroma which I've had since like 2016 has stopped working - I'm looking for something similar in terms of weight, size, and functionality. Aesthetically I think I'm considering going white this time. Should I just get the Razer Deathadder Essential or are there other similar mice out there that would be better?. 26F, 81kg, 162cm. Blood pressure healthy range, APG 2, blood oxygen 99%. Last blood test only said iron was a bit low. Drinks within units, social smoker. Diet is very healthy. Activity levels vary.The problem: ever since I started measuring my sleep heart rate I consistently drop to the 30bpms during deep sleep about an hour before I wake up. I read this can be normal. However over the past few months I’ve been getting this random chest tightness and sometimes it even makes my throat feel a bit closed up or accompanies chest flutters. This is sometimes made worse or triggered by lying down flat. I’ve been trying to log what foods I eat in case it’s an allergy (I get hives sometimes for no apparent reason but this never happens at the same time as the chest issues).Currently I am having a tight chest after lying down and experiencing a brief head rush. Measured my heart rate and it is 38bpm which seems so weird to me since I’m not asleep. I’m not an athlete either.Can anyone explain this to me or give some advice? It goes away eventually but I’m just a bit confused as to why it’s happening.
    Y’all I am lost right now. I have been diagnosed with type I w/ type II episodes and schizoaffective with CPTSD and GAD for 7+ years. I AM SO DEPRESSED. I am barely functioning and super uncomfortable all the time. I haven’t had any idealations to self harm or worse, but I don’t feel like I am headed in any sort of “light at the end of the tunnel” direction. I have struggled with deep depressive episodes my entire life. Since I was a small child. I remember some of the early ones being really bad, but I feel like this is the worst I’ve felt in a long time. My main symptom is lack of interest. In everything. I am taking my dog for a walk daily and attempting to eat well, but I am drowning. Someone please give me a new idea. I have alerted my doctor, but I don’t have supportive family and I only have one friend to talk about this with and she’s going through her own stuff. I know a lot of it is stemming from not feeling well in my home environment (got a roommate in August and it’s not going well).
    I’m like freaking out I have to get my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow and I’m not excited lol! They know im in recovery so they won’t be giving me any narcotics after the procedure but I’m not worried about that. I’m more worried about my mental state afterwards. The worse part is I normally get paid today and I have yet to get paid so I can’t even properly prepare for this! I’m so anxious…. Hi I keep seeing the recipe on here and planing on making it today. I do have one question can I use just normal espresso instead of instant? I also assume I can use semi sweet chocolate it will be ok right?. Hi I’m still sorta new to all this and have a very cheap machine, I can’t control the pressure of the temp and if I grind the coffee to grind I only get bubbles. So I found if I brew the coffee than froth my milk and switch back to the coffee mode I get more but my coffee becomes very sour and almost no flavor, I read online and it just add a pinch of baking soda and it will bring down the acidity, so I did this and it did bring it down but not a lot of flavor. I guess my question is, is this a coffee sin and does it ruin the coffee, should I only let it brew once? Or should I just buy a mocha pot?. Title, I’m in recovery and I have lots of recovering addicts that I can talk to but some of them just don’t understand mental health, like today I was trying to explain spoon theory to a roommate and he kept laughing at me and saying it was stupid and just because I had a bad day doesn’t mean I can’t fold my laundry. I just want to know if there is someone/someplace I can call and just rant without worrying about what the other person is thinking or going to do because I said something I shouldn’t have. I feel like I can openly talk about my intrusive thoughts and SH urges with people cause they will just think I’m crazy and making it up. I just feel so lonely, but I can’t tell people that because they will just tell me but look at all the support you have, it’s true but I just feel like I can’t openly share about something’s with these people…. My only really good friend last week has completely ghosted me, I’m in recovery we would go to meeting and even had a commitment to bring a meeting into a hospital. He didn’t relapse, but just stopped answering my phone calls and text. Idk what I did, it sucks because making friends is kinda of difficult for me cause I’m a little weird. Im sober, people arnt supposed to ghost me, I have no idea what I did wrong and it’s eating me alive, all the other people in my life that have done this to me at least gave a reasonable answer to why. Im just really fucking upset because I could truly call this man a friend and he said the same thing about me, but now I feel like I’m hyper vigilant about everything I say/do because I don’t want to lose another friend. This is a whole lot of self pity and I’m about to write some inventory on it….I’ve tried a lot of cleaning chemicals but they seem to be making my floors sticky the only one I’ve found that works the best is the shark auto mop thingy soap, but it’s like 20 dollars I think I’m looking for a more affordable option that cleans tile floors really well, I have a spin mop and the shark auto mop thingy but I only use that on small messes.I hate going to the hospital for non psych issues because I always feel like they might bring up the time I tried to off my self or any of the million other times I’ve been in the hospital for psych reasons. Like today currently I’m sitting in the er because an earbud broke off into my ear and went deep (I did go to urgent care and they sent me to the ER) . I just hate the whole vibe and the lights and just ahhhhhh. Luckily it was a quick time and they got it out, I just have so much “PTSD” with hospital…. So I just started supernatural and the second episode is about wendigos, it’s so similar to the ep 5 ep 4 where they are in the woods trying to find the invisible creature. I’m super excited to get into this series!. I’ve been on lithium for a little over a year, it’s helped me so much. Just lately I’ve been hitting this wall of numbness and spacey, I didn’t mind it at first I was always a spacey person but today I was riding my bike and I spaced out at work I was spacing out a lot it’s starting to happen more and more. I don’t mind the decreased sex drive, clenching jaw, and thrust. I feel like I’m going dumb and I don’t like that, I don’t want to get off it because if I get off it than I’ll just go balls to the wall again and I can’t put myself through that nor my family and friends. I just feel like I’m numb and soulless. Just a friendly reminder to brush your teeth and to floss. I struggle with it the most out of anything in my routine. So if anything please do it 😄I just flossed and brushed for the first time in about a week.
    I feel so worthless, empty that I just want to isolate from the world. I feel like a monster that doesn't deserve love or appreciation. I want to live in isolation. I am so depressed and scared. I don't know how to cope beyond taking meds and coming here looking for help. I feel ugly, loser, bad person, disgusting or at least that's what I have been told during all my life by my family and my ex boyfriend. The days pass fast and nobody is on here, everybody is busy, everybody never answers or cares unless I offer them money. I have no self worth and I am tired of trying. I just can't hold so much more this.Thise was a relationship with a narcissistic that destroyed me.I'm a 30 yo loser, with no friends and that falls in love with anybody that gives any bit of attention just to end up being rejected! The person I like usually finds someone better. Is like I am never enough. I just want to isolate and be happy without being hurted. It might be something bad on me. I know. I am so stupid.Somebody wants to talk? I am so sad tonight. I am bipolar and was chatting with a guy for months just to end up being in love and rejected like usually.Recently I experienced the death of a beloved one, and since then I find myself ruminating about what is the meaning of life? I don't really find happiness on getting a bunch of money, fame or power. Philosophy says the true meaning of life is being happy bur how? I remember when I was an small girl and had so many dreams about beauty, money and love thinking I would be happy. Then I got sick, got the money and the beauty but lose it all as well, I was never truly happy and now I wonder what else? What is the purpose of my existence? I am pretty aware that I will never be able to be loved and I am here just existing. Just depending on a pill...I am scared to death of being in a relationship and being in love. However when I got manic is like if a completely different person took my body and started to install dating apps and talk to humans there. When my depression hits I have heavy panic attacks because of that dating app. I have figured out to better focus on other stuff rather than being on Tinder. I don't know how long will this last (probably until I get manic again) but to me is so refreshing being by my own and focus on other hobbies. It's mentally draining to constantly deal with ghosting, rejection, insults, drug addicts, crazy people, people who want sex, etc etc At this moment I just want to ease my brain and I hope I can continue with this even if I am manic or not. And as the title says I was banned during my uninstalled/installed of that app. I am happy now :) I just want to isolate from everything.My mental health has been so bad lately. Having constant anxiety and depression. Makes me miss being hypomanic! I am not being productive at all. I just spend the whole day in my house/bed because I am scared. I have been taking my meds and more but I still feel very sick.My only online friend usually tends to make bad comments about me like criticize my every day progress and my life in general which constantly causes my anxiety to go to the roof and panic attacks today I explode and told him the truth that I am mentally ill and that I am doing my best to overcome this and not letting this to define me but after that rant I feel so embarrassed because I wrote him like 100 texts saying and explaining him how his constant criticism affects me. And he only say "relax". I know we shouldn't be friends because he is pretty much toxic but I don't want to be alone :(((. Between the super extroverted easy going talkative human or the depressed human there is me hidden from everybody a shy introverted calmed human being. I wish I were more stable from time to time.I met this person online and it has become my best friend but they have a bitter personality and often make bad comments about me about what I am. But most of the causes of them are my illness. And everytime he criticize me I have a bad panic attack for sure so we were arguing today and I told him to stop because I was going to have a panic attack because I am mentally ill. I don't know how he will react to this, because who would like someone that gets mood swings, panic attacks and heavy anxiety? Thank you to this amazing community for all the support it has given me! Thank you.
    I'm having a hard time thinking of anything to share. I want to get the most out of my 3rd Iop groups. What are some topics I can use for sharing?. I'm about to lose the 3rd job this year. I can't get ready for work in the morning due to severe depression and anxiety. I miss 1 sometimes 2 days a week because of this. I'm diagnosed bipolar 1 and gad. I've been in 3 iop programs in 3 years and see a therapist weekly.I have been in a psychotic depression for 2 weeks. I applied for short term disability through my HR dept. so I can attend an iop. Im still waiting on my Dr. to fill out the paperwork. If any of you have been through the same, how much of your base pay did you recieve? I don't want to end up homeless and it is physically impossible to work rn. I just hate not knowing what to expect.Im having a lot of anxiety when getting ready for work, I end up calling out once or twice a week. I have this heavy feeling in my chest while all I can think of is how much of a fuck up I am. I have also been having some SI. I see a therapist once every 2 weeks and when I bring up the fact Im missing work she says I should go for a walk. I don't want to bring up the SI because I would need to prepare rather than getting swept away. Im taking lithium, lurasidone, lamotrigene and xanax as needed.I've been having anxiety and intrusive thoughts that result in me calling out of work once and sometimes twice a week. I get up an hour and a half before i have to be at work which is a 15 m commute. When i get up i take .5mg of xanax otherwise i will start dryheaving. I chill for about 20 minutes before i start making lunch. This works for me somedays but other days i can't get out of my head. What should i try different? Im on lithium, lamotrigene, lurasidone. I see a therapist every 2 weeks.I've been stressing myself out lately. Mostly because I'm unemployed and the benefits run out in a couple of weeks. It's that pit in the bottom of my stomach feeling that's bugging me. My therapist wants me to get out of the house and do stuff, but I'm broke. What have you used to cope with stress?. I couldn't hold it together. I started 3 weeks ago and called in sick twice. I go through extreme bouts of anxiety in the morning and by mid day I can't remember, concentrate and focus on anything. I hate this illness.I just got a job after being unemployed for 8 months due to my mental health. I called out for a day on my second week. I have bipolar disorder and my symptoms are hard to manage some days.Am I protected from getting fired for missing a day here and there by the ADA?. I just atarted a job 2 weeks ago after being unemployed for 8 months. Last Friday I called out after dry heaving, having racing thoughts, feeling hot and sweating. Stupid anxiety. I don't want to make calling out a habit and lose this job. Are we protected by the ADA for calling out due to mental health?What have you done to fight the morning anxiety?. I've been out of work since applying in July of 2022 and im about to starve and lose my home. Why does life suck with teeth?If I go back to work will I have lost all the time I've waited already?. It's a patient sitter job at a hospital. I would be watching SI, dementia and violent patients. It's 3 12 hour nights a week 7pm to 730am. My therapist don't want me working nights because I need a good sleep cycle.I was working nights when a manic episode in May got bad enough I started hearing things. I went on short term disability that covered 8 weeks which I used to relax and tweak meds. I was still ill after 2 months so I went inpatient for a week and then took 2 iop programs during my recovery. Im still not right I have problems concentrating and almost like Im in a fog. Probably from the depression Im living with.My bills are being paid by my wives family since August. I feel terrible for not being able to provide. Im 43 for f sakes. My wife doesn't understand me and why I get episodes. She wants me to get a job doing anything.Should I turn down the offer?. [New Jersey] I collected short term disability from May to July until it ran out. I was still in treatment until Monday November 7th. The company I worked for has since been sold, so I no longer have a job to go back to. Should I file for UI? Do I have a right to file and collect until I get another job that can accomodate my disability?. I was energy orbiting a large warm bright cellestial body before I was flashed across the universe to occupy this body. What can I do to go back there? Am I supposed to ride out the cycle trapped in this flesh prison before I go back?.
    I apologize for any term miss use. I’m not really used to talking about this. Please correct me in the comments of if I said something wrong. I also apologize for any misspellings or grammatical errors, English isn’t my first language. Hello everyone I (M19) have been struggling with bipolar issues for fairly long time. Unfortunately when I turned 18 they have begun to severally worsen. Also I am unable to get medical attention for the next 90 days because that’s when the health insurance provided by my employer kicks in. As time went on I’ve begun to get increasingly more concerned about my behavior during severe manic episodes. They are usually triggered by high stress, brain chemical imbalance, or illness. During these episodes it really feels like I’m “splitting” into “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”. To eliminate in this time I struggle to remember things that I did, I feel like I have very little control over my actions, have difficulty eating food, have intense urge to cause physical disfiguring to my self, and seek out dangerous behaviors. It is this last issue that concerns me, as I have to desire to cheat on my long term partner. I know that this is a common symptom for many people. My boyfriend is lucky very understanding about this as he had difficulties with dealing with bipolar people in the past. He says that me cheating on him would be a dealbreaker and would cause the end of our friendship. I’m not exactly sure what compels me to have these thoughts. I’m not sure what I would expect to gain from doing that. To be clear I haven’t cheated on him. But I want to take precautions to make sure that this doesn’t happen. So far I have thought of him put a screen time lock on my phone so that I wouldn’t be able to download hook up apps. However I I’ll still be able to reset it which concerns him. He wants to mark my phone as his “child’s” phone so that I wouldn’t be able to reset the password. I’m not in favor of this idea because it feels like it’s too controlling and brings up bad feelings regarding the way my dad treated me. My next big concern is that I would end up going on a spending spree while on a manic episode. This also hasn’t happened, but as a broke college student I can allow that to occur. How do other people deal with this issue? Any and all suggestions are welcome and appreciated. Thank you so much for reading, have a good day.So from what I understand, CRISPR can and has been used on mushrooms. What confuses my is if the process is any different.I have been very interested in synthetic quarts lately. I fond [this](https://www.thoughtco.com/growing-quartz-crystals-at-home-607657) article that talks about the proses of making synthetic quarts but it’s very vague and unclear. I was wondering if any tried this method before, or has any suggestions on how I could recreate it.I’m a junior in high school and I moved to another state at the start of the school year. Unfortunately making friends had been a bit of a struggle, but I did find a group of sophomores to hang out with. Among them is this kid Matthew. He’s pretty cool and a lot of people are saying that he is bi, and based on his behavior I believe them. He complements my appearance a lot, but in such a specific and genuine way that it comes across as flirting. But whenever anyone asks if he’s into guys he plays it off as a funny joke, or just “invokes the fifth” so he might not be comfortable with it yet. But then why would he tell some people? Why would he sometimes get weird around me? He’s pretty cute and I would love to be more then just friends but I don’t understand how I could understand what exactly his behavior means.I’m a junior in high school and I moved to another state at the start of the school year.

    Hi all,I’ve been struggling these past two weeks with a pretty hard mental crutch. For some background, I’m diagnosed as Bipolar 1, OCPD, ADHD, and Generalized anxiety disorder. I currently work a high stress white collar job (12+ hours a day). Recently, my psychiatrist tried changing my medications from Seroquel to Geodon. I noticed within a week that I wasn’t doing fine. The first flare up was in a one-on-one meeting with one of my superiors. I noticed my hands get sweaty, I would get dizzy, my heart would race, I would even start seeing minor colors/hallucinations if the other symptoms started getting bad enough. My first time experiencing this I had to dismiss myself from the meeting because I thought I was going to puke. In the bathroom, I only dry-heaved, nothing more. I ended up leaving work. I calmed down, though I didn’t know what was wrong with me. Later that night, it flared up again while laying in bed and I thought I was going to pass out. I ended up calling paramedics and they walked me through how it was obviously all in my head and I need to learn to breath and calm down. I have been doing fine lately, especially now back on my Seroquel. However, I get this really weird phenomenon whenever I am talking to someone at work one-on-one. It can be just a casual chat with a senior employee, but every time I always get this feeling of dizziness or nausea. The longer the conversation goes on, the worse it gets. Its horrible. My psych prescribed me Klonopin for whenever this flares up, but it is constantly happening since the first episode and I don’t know what to do. I’ve never been one to get social anxiety, in fact my social skills were one my stronger traits….Not sure what to do.Hi all,I’ve been struggling these past two weeks with a pretty hard mental crutch.

Woke up around 7AM on Saturday, studied until midnight again. Sunday, I woke up at 7AM again, studied until like 10PM. Today, test day, I woke up at 4AM and studied until exam time at 8AM. Passed (honestly didn’t think it was too challenging, 7 was harder). How did I do it? I didn’t touch the textbook once. Once I got off work on Friday, I watched the Knopman chapter videos for 7 through 15, plus 20, (the rest was a lot of cross over from the S7, which I still had retained so waste of time). I watched them on 1.5-2X speed. Took notes. Saturday I started with the Knopman benchmark exam and scored a 73% exactly. I reviewed it, took hand-written notes of my mistakes, and then went onto Knopman’s chapter assessments for 7-15 and 20. Same thing, hand notes with any uncertainty. Scored around 60%-80% on those. Next, I did Kaplan qbank questions, 25q for each chapter (continued this into sunday). Again, handwriting notes. In addition to what I did Sunday, I rewatched chapters 8-12. I then ended my night with reading key concepts plus some qbank 30q quizzes on all chapters (handwrite all mistakes). This morning, I reviewed my powerpoint notes, did one quiz, then read the key concepts one more time. Additionally, I hand-wrote out any equation I anticipated using to help memorize them. In the uber ride to the center, I reviewed all my handwritten notes. Finished the exam in about 55 minutes, spent the remainder to review. Needless to say my brain is fried. In total, I did around 700 questions. Don’t be like me, space out your studying hahaDisclaimer: ADHD hyperfocus under stress likely contributed. Just had a euro homie buy me some zyn Gold. Pretty fire. I people have some sundews in my old college terrarium I am looking to get rid of. I would be willing to package the whole thing, over 50+ young sundews along with the whole setup. They’re just sitting in my college apartment overgrowing because I unfortunately can’t take them with me as I am moving…if anyone is interested in finding a forever home for them please let me know; I really really don’t wanna throw them out ): DM if you want some pics of the terrarium and/or if interested. Zyn website lists them both as “unflavored,” so whats the difference…. Hey all - Noob question here: I just finished the first book in LotR, so no spoilers please (never seen the movies or anything, legitimately my first exposure to Tolkien’s work) but I had one question that I kept pondering that you all likely could give an answer to, perhaps with lore or just a greater understanding of the LotR universe. Broadly put, why does Sauron have followers, an army and all, to begin with, if he is this proclaimed evil Dark Lord? I understand it is fantasy, and it may be a question answered as simply as “Well otherwise there wouldn’t be a plot!” but I am genuinely curious? I’ll keep the question bland to open it for conversation, but I am curious if it ever explains how he established the power he has in Middle Earth, or if there is an actual answer to this question, besides simply for the sake of a plot. Again, do avoid spoilers please!. Just wanted to pat myself on the back and share my story: Almost a year ago, I was prescribed Vyvanse. It didn’t do much at 30mg, but after trying other medications, and increasing dosages, I’ve finally met success. I’m currently taking 70mg, and I have never felt better. I’ve suffered a long time with ADHD and pretty severe Bipolar II (and OCPD and BPD, if you count personalities disorders). I had been seeing different therapists, then psychiatrists, then neuropsychiatrists, for just over 3 years. Finally, since my 70mg prescription a month ago, I have felt so much better. I’m no longer drinking nightly like I used to; I’m back to getting in shape, like I was when I was younger, & just taking better care of myself; I’m read books when I never had the attention span or mental patience before (currently reading the chronological Bible, and LotR; feel free to drop suggestions below); my anger and overall mood has been so much more controlled; relationships are healing; and my university studies, and discipline, have significantly improved substantially. It’s like I finally feel motivated to find attributes of life and success worth striving for. I wish everyone else the same good results on their mental health journeys, and I hope I can maintain this good path.Hi all - I currently have a terrarium with roughly 3 different species of sundews. Its the size of a fish tank (because it was one), equipped with a thermometer, humidity gauge, full spec LED; using a peat and sphagnum moss substrate. However, I want add a new plant, mushrooms. I have never grown mushrooms, or explored outside the realm of carnivorous plants. Has anyone ever had the two grow together in a terrarium, or can recommend any species of mushrooms that could co-exist well with my sundews? Still researching growing mushrooms, but just throwing the question out. Thanks!. Hi all - I currently have a terrarium with roughly 3 different species of sundews.

I got 5 minutes in, to when you run the Ubuntu installation commands, and my computer crashed and wouldn't even run in safe mode...ended up needing to reinstall Windows :/ Everyone else, enjoy LU. Hi all,I'm currently growing **D. Capensis, spatulata, and tokaiensis** from seedlings. its been great. Almost 2 months and they're getting pretty big. However, now I have moved my terrarium to my dorm. It gets pretty hot in the room. The sunlight is not direct, and pretty minimal, on the terrarium unfortunately. At home, I just use my full spectrum LED. With my full spectrum on in my dorm, temperatures reach around 90F in the terrarium. I also have a plastic wrap DIY lid to help keep in humidity. With or without the lamp on, that may add to the heat. However, without the lid, the terrarium dries up way quicker with how hot the room is. Should I just keep the same set up I have had at home (Lid for humidity, full spectrum LED), where the temperature was closer to 75-80F, but now around 90F in my dorm; or should I change part of my setup to try to keep it cooler? The best I have reached without the lid or light is only 83F. I guess it's a matter of weighing humidity/moisture versus desirable temperature.Tl;dr is 90-95F in a terrarium too hot?. Hi all,I noticed some gnats flying around my terrarium tonight, and I’m going to be a pessimist and assume it was fungus gnats laying eggs (just lost my last batch of seedlings to them 😐). I killed off the gnats and sealed my terrarium so more can’t get in, but lets just assume they laid eggs - how do I kill the eggs before they hatch.
    30/M I was diagnosed in 2019. I’m sure most of you have been where I am. I’ve never kept a job more than two years. I got a Covid vaccine in 21 and it gave me myocarditis. Due to my inability to actually go into work any longer, I was let go from the highest paid, highest responsibility job I had ever had. Just when I thought my career was gonna take off and I would be financially sound, it all crashed down. Since then I haven’t had a job more than around 9 months, I think. Well, I started this new job recently. It’s a different field and I’m just learning. I kept wanting to change my career and try new things cuz I hated working in the plants and swapping from days to nights all the time really messed with my emotions. I have constantly struggled with being initially excited for a job and then feeling absolute soul-crushing burnout within a few months. Now I’m not making enough money though and I’m struggling to learn. I was always a terrible student in school. I can’t focus, I don’t retain info well. I forget almost everything. I keep messing up at work and today I was late because I set my phone on silent and so my alarms only set off vibrations. My fiancé had to come home and wake me up and she was mad at me because if I lose this job right before Christmas, we’re gonna let the kids down and struggle really hard financially. I also started smoking pot again, which was a terrible idea, and now I can’t go back into the plants until my hair is clean. I quit the smoking like three weeks ago, but I have to let my hair grow back out. I feel like a failure and I’m scared to go back to the refineries and fall into a depressive hole or into mania and have hard episodes and hurt myself either physically or through compulsive bad decisions. I guess I just wanted to get this out. I don’t really have anyone to talk to right now.In the project I’m working on now, human magic users are given access to magic through a ritual. Each of those persons are picked by someone who performs the ritual based on power potential, but no one knows what exactly that persons enhancement will be.Now, one type will be given essentially your basic physical enhancement. Faster and stronger basically. Another type with gain the ability to shift into a different form, like a dragon, a giant eagle, and all that. I want the third type to have access to magic and I can’t decide whether they will have access to a great plethora of “schools” or magic or whatever, or whether I should make them specialized so that they have access to some unique magical trait. And if that access should be specialized, what can I do to make those traits unique. To help you with the dilemma, think that these individuals are built into teams. Everyone is unique in the potential they have for greater power. One guy can lift a truck while another guy can lift only slightly more than an average person. One guy changes into a squirrel while another changes into a griffin. Thanks for the help! 🙏. Came into town from Baton Rouge, LA. Working mostly, but want to get out see what y’all have to offer! Would love to see local music, country, rock, or metal. Like standup and cold beers too! Hit me up, be my friend, tell me where to go.I followed r/Deathcore to keep new music flowing into my life, but I gotta tell you guys. All the debating over whether or not this or that band is this or that genre, and especially whether this or that band should not be part of this genre, really bums me out. Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I’m a metal head and no fucks are given here, sir. That’s some juvenile ass shit and gatekeeping is for douchebags. End rant.I’ve been drinking and using since I was 13. Quit the hard drugs about 10 years back, but never got away from the drinking. Well, two weeks ago I found out my fiancé cheated on me. Just happened to leave her phone at the house and I went to bring it to her at work. I got curious and looked and there it was. We fought (or more like I yelled and she cried) and my first move was to go home, smash a twelve pack, and smoke a bunch of weed. I pretty much stayed that way until six days ago. I had been proud of myself for quitting meth and staying off of it. I never even went to meetings or a therapist about it. Just quit. I’ve made a fool of myself a million times, been in fights, gotten kicked out of hotels and restaurants, but somehow always excused the alcohol and weed. I was just sitting on the couch, fucked up, and something whispered in my ear that I should look at myself. So I did and I didn’t like what I saw. I don’t know what I’m going to do about the cheating, especially since my kids are involved. I love her, regardless, so maybe I’ll try to make it work. But here I am, ya know? Trying to be clear headed. But I’ve got no friends, or at least no sober ones who want this for me, and no family outside of my fiancés family and my kids from my previous marriage. I feel alone and scared and I guess I just had to put this down somewhere.Despite that, I have just finished the dishes, I have taken all of my meds today, and I have practiced good hygiene. I haven’t woken up to a clean kitchen in the last year. I’ve barely even been brushing my teeth. I’ve bounced around a few different jobs all year, but remained working for most of it. Things have just been hard. This little stuff makes me feel good.I’m 30 years old and have used alcohol (and just about everything else) since I was around 13. I stopped with everything but alcohol in 2013, but have found myself smoking weed every day and drinking almost every day since the end of 2022. I also tried some of the things I promised to stay away from over the last year. I’d like to quit all of it. My house is wrecked cuz I’m usually too messed up to care, my career is in shambles, and most of my relationships have deteriorated. I need to find a group of people who get it. Where should I go first?.
    I have bipolar 1 and I've struggled with working for the past 10 years. I've started many many jobs, just dont last very long. The shifts seem so long. . I really want to be able to work. So I accepted a seasonal job at UPS as a driver helper today. If anyone here is successful with working, can I have a few tips and tricks on how to make it work?.

So not asking for medical advice just wondering if anyone else has this problem? I’m on so many meds (lamictal, minipress, Abilify, duloxatine, topamax) does anyone have super bad memory on any or all of these meds? Thanks!. I have been clean for some time but I wanted a little token to remind myself I have been clean for that long are there self harm free tokens like for AA or NA? Or are there any good thoughts for one? Thanks!. My last stint at the old grippy sick vacay was after a r@pe that spiraled me into a major depression and SI. But I find myself missing the hospital for some reason I don’t know if it was the schedule, the people, the lack of responsibility, the check ups or what but I would like to explore more so how do I make my life more like the hospital and more comfortable and relaxing and just better overall? Or am I more crazy then I originally thought?. Hey there I’m from the US and would love a friend to email every day or so!

Would it be weird if someone with a mental health disorder such as bipolar had a medical id bracelet or dog tag etc? I was just thinking for medical emergency purposes?. I have always stayed away from asking or talking about my medication because we all are affected differently but I just upped my dose of abilify to 20mgs and my psych told me if that doesn’t help my mood and depression I have to start taking lamictal. What should I expect on this new higher dose (I was on 15mg) and if I have to take lamictal what should I expect on that?. Hey all I forgot to add this super important detail my car is a lease under my father’s name and he lives in NH. Is it possible to register the car under my name or transfer the registration without moving the car back to NH? TIA. Hey there! So I’m new in town and I was wondering where do I get my car registration? I used to be able to just go to town hall and do it in my tiny town I used to live in.Like wtf— okay! Go to get killed for being Catholic? Or get raped for being Catholic? Or abandon by your family for being Catholic? Goodness people just don’t understand!!!. I have an eating disorder, there is said it! It’s not like the ones you always see where people wither away and die from under eating or anything. I am so focused on food -24/7. It’s all I think about how much where it comes from what’s in it how many calories etc. it consumes me. I have tried diet pills injections calorie counting medical doctors therapist nothing works. I have gained so much weight it sickens me. My boy friend even talks about my weight. I used to have a “feeder” boy friend that would feed me for his sexual pleasure which outright ruined me. I just I can’t live anymore all I do I think about my weight and eating and how fat I am and how I can’t control myself. What can I do?.

    That's it I've felt like I was spiralling into one lately and I've had a very irregular sadness that's been on and off the last couple days I'm not generally a smoker but I do sometimes maybe 1 cigarette a week but I was doing it super tough the last 3 hours uncontrollable crying and was doing some extreme self harm but now that I've had one I feel so normal again. I can't regularly do this at my house because my parents are currently trying to quit and don't want to be reminded of any tobacco/smoke and I'm currently on 400mg of Quetiapine a night was just wondering what people think of that. Obviously I experience a range of blurry vision through out the day but lately it's been a massive adjustment every morning feeling worse then usualDon't know if I'm in a weird visually exhausted period or maybe spring allergies (southern hemisphere) but anyone similar experiences or advice for management. The abdominal pain has been going on weeks but the foul breath has only been the last four days. I'm on Ozempic (M21) and also have the constant need to shit.The abdominal pain lasts up to 5minutes but can happen a couple times an hour or once every 6 hours, moving and standing up stops the pain a little bit.The breath is terrible my whole body smells weird to me but my breath super stinks and feels very trapped inside me.When I shit it's very fast and not a lot giving an unsatsified feeling constantly.I've been keeping an eye on my food and water intake and I'm not over or under consuming and am very routined right now just don't know where this is coming from, flaired as gut and stomach because I do also have a lot of belly noise and general pain. Hey everyone just wanted to know how other people experience/ manage feeling a constant need to talk. Not just during mania I have a constant need to be talking to someone about my thoughts, their thoughts, the day, whatever. I can generally talk to anyone but lately no one's been talking back to the extent I feel I need it. It's been really hard actually a constant lingering loneliness and sadness unless I'm interacting with someone in some way. I'm only taking 400 Quetiapine right now if anyone has any medication ideas that could help me my therapist says to just surround myself with people, but again everyone can't be 100% there for me 100% of the time, and somedays I can handle it but other times I get stuck doing an excessive amount of self harm and/or drug abuse :/ I know there's no easy fix but I am desperate to hear anyone's thoughts. I've started banning mania from the suggest content now because of just how much it has been over used and used wrong, today I saw someone saying"Are these cute or am I having a manic episode" over a pair of shoes, and I checked her whole profile to see if she had any posts about her mental incase she does ACTUALLY have bipolar but of course nothing. Just being used as a hyperbolic synonym for excited and undecidedI dunno it's just really disheartening as Instagram is the only social media I use actively but everytime I've gone on it lately it's been content that really bothers me. Other stuff like relationship reels (about cheating) or about men generally being incompetent, but the mis use of mania is really really frustrating and I've had people in my real life start using it incorrectly now too. Any advice at all... cause idk :/ not that there's anything you guys can do, but I'm sure some of you have been struggling with this as well.Hey (M21) I've been taking ozempic for the last 4 months and haven't really lost any weight number wise, I was advised to take it after being on metaformin for the last 6 years as a stronger replacement that'll hopefully work better stabilising and encouraging weightloss. However, I really don't know at this point if it's working,I've been eating less and have do generally have a pretty poor appetite which is good and working but everyday I instead feel very debilitating hunger pains. My whole lower body cramps and sometimes in my chest, I feel like I'm going to puke which I used to in the first month, and I was told these pains should stop with time, but it's getting so debilitating that I don't know if it's worth continuing. I take my 1mg dose on Saturdays and it's Monday morning for me right now and I had a full 28 minutes of intense pains that truely felt like I was going to puke or explode. For the most part I eat and drink well except for special social occasions and the pains feel less intense on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I have other very specific complaints about the way my body feels as well but I don't want to crowd this post too much more, the general desire to eat is always there, I truely feel like the only way to feel better is to eat- but I don't do it, it just sucks and hurts all the timeWondering for advice/ different experiences or coping strategies. Bit bored of my playlists n really want some whiny emo vocals on some industrial/electronic sounds- not really in a scene way but any emo adjacent music w techno shit is pretty nice anyway:)). My family and I were keen on going this year but last week my dad got diagnosed with type2 diabetes was wondering if anyone knew what food there is there that would be safe for him to eat, I've had a lot of trouble in general finding out what foods are safe for diabetic besides no sugar but don't know how sugar free the show would be with all those kids anyway. Help from australia and saw a crab video with a bunch of "Maryland 🦀" comments,, way too many for me to think it's drawfee fans,, is this like a thing?! I thought it was just a bit help. always working on new playlists for my mental and was just wondering what songs y'all really connect with!! when im feeling super manic i get caught listening to genius, pitchshiftergenghis kan, miike snowwitness, mindless self indulgence (fuck jimmy euringer) kinda i want to, nine inch nailsnothing will be the same, ferdinand (left boy)the way we move, innerpartysystem &#x200B;bit random but its what the brain wants :)). Hey everyone it's been a couple weeks and days coming but I have just realised I am in the middle of an episode and it's interfering super hard with my current assignment. I'm an art student doing a animation storyboarding project where we had to recreate a scene with a camera movement that we really like, it's meant to be a fun quick project we were told we could have a minimum of 4 boards and still pass. I'm 60 boards in deep for a 40 second scene which is not even half way completed. The project is kinda loose with due date but I should have finished it by tomorrow and I really wanna stay up all night and work on it but it'll kill me.The scene as well is a lot more complex then the rest of the classes as I've already seen their work and emotionally is very important to me and is from a show with bipolar and that's really gone to my head about representing real bipolar experiences. None of this matters to the assignment and I've tried three times to change to a shorter, easier scene and I just can't finish them I want to show off this scene I'm doing right now. I don't know if it's appropriate to talk to my teacher about what I'm experiencing because all I feel I can gain is perspective and sympathy and I have a habit of emailing my teachers during manic episodes about developing the best portfolio and how amazing my work will be and how passionate I am. I just want any thoughts really my friends aren't interacting with me during this episode and it's getting to me a lot as well. I'm calling my dr tomorrow because I also need new meds and there's also an option to get a medical certificate but I still want the work to be done and I will work to have it done by tomorrow anyway, but it just feels crazy to drag all these real manic feelings with me with the assignmentI've been getting mad at myself as well for trying to force me to work and also sleep safely and it's just been driving me crazy please any thoughts at all. Hey guys just wondering if theres any safer ways to fly and keep your eyes safe, I found my bad eye kept wigging out and drifting, straining, losing focus and sweating I assume from the air pressure. On the plane here I did take my eye patch on and off and even though it helps relax my eye for the focus and strain it felt suctioned to my face which felt terrifyingI have to take my return flight next week and it's a whopping 32 hours so I'm hoping to know if anyone has any general advice. Hey don't mean to be posting here so much lately but- as title says I heard a distant slow sounding woman's deep voice say 'hello' in my head today. I dunno if I should be worried because it's really disturbed my day now and I only ever really get voices when I'm experiencing mania- but she only said hello.It's been quite hard lately I've been really trying to make sure I'm not doing too much but I've been really close to impulse purchasing really expensive stuff too, I spent $100 yesterday on a piercing and sent my friend another $100 for meth (which I've never done before), but I should have been keeping the money as I'm going overseas in a week and a half with only $500 to last the month (I'll be staying with friends and family so I'm not in a terrible situation but still worries about money are definitely real) I don't feel manic at all, I don't feel any euphoria and am purposely trying to not over produce art which is what I usually do when I have episodes, I don't even know if I'm experiencing one right now, I hope people get it. Hey everyone so I've been on Quetiapine for 8+ weeks now and for the last two weeks I've been excessively sleeping through the day. I take 50mg in the morning and 50mg at night, as I find it hard to get through the day with just the one intake- I've been left without instructions or care advice but I believe this is for helping managing my psychotic symptoms and general anxiety+ mania, which is working I haven't had any hallucinations or hyper activity while on it, but I've been getting really depressed lately from missing the early hours of the day (I've been waking up at 7pm and falling asleep at 5am the following morning)I don't really know what to do from here I'm seeing my psychiatrist late this month and was wondering if anyone has any new medication advice/experiences and changes that they went through with the medication- I'm only taking this medication for bipolar management, any tips or help at all thank you,Feel free to ask questions- the sleeping has been the only real disturbance and side effect I'm experiencing:). Hey was just wondering about other people's experiences with quetiapine I'm 4-5 weeks on one tablet 25mg every morning to help with mania bipolar (psychotic symptoms) and it totally has been working and I've felt a good delay on anxiety during the day but when it hits really late at night it feels like my body is making up for all the anxiety I didn't get during the dayI don't know how else to describe it really I just get delirious and lightheaded and super heavy hearted- very very anxious and I can't sleep at all I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this it's really disrupted my sleeping and who I'm sleeping with I can't think of any other changes and it feels so physically delayed and I feel very sedated and highIf you have any general recommendations anyway I'd be happy to listen I did take a light valium to sleep one night and have tried smoking to calm me down for bed but the smoking hasn't helped at all I still feel just as irritableEDIT: at a much higher dose now 100mg a day and don't suffer with these problems anymore I think they're working super well for me now:)). If not is there anything like it, I need to get a onscreen timer for my figure drawing class and I realllyyy don't wanna switch to Photoshop for this class too. Hey! Figured this would be a good spot to ask for some advice, for a game art introduction course our major is to create a Vslice for a game, as one of the only students in there that aren't coming from a video game/coding degree I feel super clueless with actually making the game fun and playable outside of narrative and visual choicesMy concept is for an all ages playerbased closer to lifestyle and exploration games but I also want to provide survival elements like needing feed and sleepI've really got only foraging, fishing and cooking as gameplay ideas but I do want to play around a bit with the cartoony and dreamlike narrative it hasAny advice and questions are welcome :)). As title suggests I've been really struggling finding anyone in Adelaide with a speciality in bipolar or mood disorders with psychoactive symptoms and really have run out of ways to find them, I've had my GP go thru the public system but with no help I was wondering if there were any super great private psychiatrists Happy to travel anywhere in Adelaide just really want someone face to face to talk to. Hey guys, genuine curiosity on the way other people define keratoconus, I understand it can look different to everyone the ✨ nature of the disease ✨ and such but I often feel guilty for saying Low vision, visually impaired, blind, and disabled interchangeablyI don't want to start any heated destructive discussions but am sincerely interested in the way other people attach themselves to these terms. Legally I'm blind and get disability support, but sometimes I don't feel the biggest wave of imposter syndrome as I recognise there are much more severe diseases and impairments and I am grateful for the vision I got, however I'm also grateful for the support (OTs and mobility instructors through guide dogs) I have received through the disability insurance and I would never nearly function as well I can without it.I'm happy to hear personal experiences and opinions, because obviously that's what I'm asking for :). I've covered with an eyepatch so I can continue working on my uni work right now but is there anything I should do It's felt like this for three days but today it feels worse and I've noticed I've lost a lot of colour in my left eye (bad eye) I just saw an optometrist a week ago and can't see one again for another week or so because of that,need advice very worried I'm an art student in my finals for the semester and can't fall behind nowEDIT:UPDATE: went to the doctor, was right to be worried my eye ruptured for a second time and is swollen full of blistersHONESTLY TY FOR PUSHING ME TO GO TO DOCTORS AT THE STAGE I WAS IN MWAH Ty redit people. Hey was just wondering if anyone who has keratoconus has had extra issues after experiencing covidI had covid I'd say 8 weeks ago and since then I've found it a lot harder to see, I assumed since issues, this was probably because of general eyes shifting, but I was just interested if this could be a potential side affect post covidIt's become a lot harder to do anything and I'm speaking with my op when ironically he's finished covid isolation. \^\^big fan of ips and just wondering if anyone here has any good recommendations,&#x200B;kinda thinking more of their sound from the debut self titled album or their song 'Redemption' if unfamilar and wanna recommend bands n e way they have a bit of a emo/ industrial(?) sound :).
    So, I don't think I've ever been manic, I have no idea tbh. I was only diagnosed a few months ago, but had been on medication for bipolar without realizing it for years, so I didn't need to change anything I was doing. Things have been pretty tough these past few months (my partner and I moved to a new state away from friends and family, and I have chronic pains/illnesses that we are still trying to get diagnosed, so this has messed with my career/future which is a whole other thing, but anyways) and I have been finding myself being a bit more positive and optimistic about things. I've been trying to get better with this, but I'm worried I might go overboard and *make* myself manic. This is gunna sound stupid, but it's like in the Sims when a Sim is hysterical and then they go to very hysterical. Like I'm worried I'll make myself more positive (while still having some negative thoughts every once in a while) and then go overboard and accidentally make myself have a manic episode. I don't even know if this is how it works, but I'm just wondering 😂. So, this year my partner and I are supposed to visit his family for Christmas. I am terrified. We've gone there before but never when I've had to use a cane or forearm crutches. I have only recently started using them, over the past 3-4 months, and I'm worried his family will stay stuff about it. My partner is adamant that he will make sure to tell them *not* to say anything about them (like "teasing" me about them), but they are welcome to ask questions. I look totally healthy so it makes sense why someone would wanna ask some questions, and I'm happy to answer ! He also has made sure to tell me that he will *not* allow any sort of negative comments to be made. The problem is that I know his mom will want "alone time" with me because she has 4 boys and no girls. 1) I hate these times anyways because we've had some like ... Issues and I find being with her very uncomfortable, but I've done it *for my partner*, not for her but 2) I've never done it with mobility aids before and I'm scared about it. She's a nurse, but one that isn't very knowledgeable about chronic pain or illnesses. She's said before "I'm glad you're doing yoga and walking because that's really what fixes these issues. Everybody is always like "give me a pill, give me a pill", but they need to actually be taking care of themselves to fix this", and that pissed both my partner and I off hardcore (but we had just gotten home from getting groceries and we had gotten home when she said that and we didn't wanna get into it so we just hung up instead of arguing). But I think at some point, someone (most likely her) will say something like that again. I'm not very confrontational, but I'm trying to be so that I can set boundaries better and stand up for myself, so this is terrifying. I was just wanting some advice. My partner also has mentioned that maybe I should "play up" my pain (not like, lie about it but more like ... Actually show when I'm in pain, I'm *very* good at masking the pain, unfortunately, but he's saying to just let the mask slip a bit and show them how it really is), but I'm *terrified* to do that. But I also know that if I don't, they'll also just be like "she's faking" ... What should I do here ?. I want to paint some of the thousands of cardboard boxes it seems we have for our ferrets to make them look real cute and less ... Cardboard box-y 😅 do I need to be careful about what paint I use ? I just planned on picking some up from Hobby Lobby, but then I remembered how sensitive they are to things and they'd be sniffing the paint so I wasn't sure if it would be dangerous for them, even if the paint was dry. If I need to be careful, could I have some recommendations ??. Our boys eat raw diet and it's all blended together and they get about 55g (average) for breakfast and dinner. However, since it's gotten colder, we've noticed that they seem to act like they're starving ! One of ours isn't really one to eat so much either, he usually leaves just a bit left for later if he wants it, but he's even licking his bowl clean like his brother (who's our very fat boy). I know they eat more in the colder months, but how much more should I be giving them ?. I only just started vaping (I have chronic pain and wanted to experiment with some strains to determine what ones would work best so that I could eventually just start using the flowers to make tinctures rather than vaping it constantly) and I'm confused on what I could do with the AVB. Like *can* I make it into a tincture ? I know I saw recipes for like butter or cookies or things like that, but I think a tincture would work best for me. How would I do that ? I also was wondering how do you know when it's burnt enough ? Like how do I know if it's ready to be used in something like this ?. I have the POTV One and I was wondering what I could do with the leftover leaves, like the "burnt" pieces ? Can I use them to make a tincture ?. I have 2 ferrets that are my ESA's, not service animals, so I can't really bring them out in public with me, plus, they wouldn't want to do that either, so whenever my partner and I go out, we leave them at home. I am also at home with them almost 24/7. We just moved to another state so I don't know anyone here, I don't work yet because I have chronic pain and I'm trying to find a job that will take me with all the accomodations I need, so I'm home most of the time, the only time I go out is when my partner and I are going to do something like groceries, errands, dinner, hangouts, things like that. I'm noticing every time we go out, I get extremely paranoid and anxious about leaving our ferrets at home alone. We went out yesterday and I couldn't stop obsessing over the fact that someone was going to rob our house while we were gone (there was a dude walking down the street when we had left and he kept just staring at us and our house, so I got nervous about the fact that we don't live in the best neighborhood and he just kept staring like he was making a plan) and that our ferrets would be stolen from our house. I've also had a ton of times where I'm terrified that our house is going to burn down while we are out and no one will be there to protect or save our ferrets. I'm not sure what to do about this ...How do you get rid of fleas ? We've cleaned, we give them Advantage at the first of every month, and we are still finding one or two on our boys. What do we do ?. What kind of jobs can someone with chronic pain have ? I have my bachelor's in social work and I'm not sure what to do. I can't be a therapist because I'm unreliable now ... I feel like I'm out of options. Please send advice for some jobs 😭. I've been looking for a good rheumatologist but I feel like I'm not finding any ones that I'm confident in. I also would rather search for places, rather than doctors, but maybe it's better the other way around. Can y'all give me some advice for how to find a good one ?. I have never smoked before, I've only used edibles, but recently I got the POTV ONE dry herb vape because I wanted to try some instant relief from my chronic pain that wouldn't keep me on the couch all day. But I have a 4 piece grinder and I saw stuff about pollen collecting at the bottom of it, but what the hell is it ? Do I need to use it ? How do I use it ?. My partner and I are going to a concert 2-2.5 hours away from our house and we will have to leave our ferrets at home. We usually feed them in the mornings around 9am, since I get up at 8:30, and then again at 7-8pm, since that's when they get up again. But it'll be like past midnight by the time we get back. We will be coming back home, not staying in a hotel. Will they be okay ?. If I got a referral from a doctor do I have to go to the doctor they referred me to ? I'm a little worried about some of the ones I was referred to and I feel horrible saying this and I really really *really* don't mean it a certain way istg, but some of the doctors are likely to have thick accents and I have audio processing disorder and am a bit hard of hearing and with chronic pain being an invisible illness and already having a tough time with doctors actually listening to me, I just don't know if those are who I should go with. I wanted to just find another place and use the referrals I got, but since they are referring me to a specific doctor, am I allowed to just use those with another place ?. So we have to bug bomb our house and I am terrified. I have no idea how to make sure that our boys are safe. Can someone please give me some advice on what to do here to make sure they aren't in any danger ?EDITA: We are going to be "camping out" on our porch until it's done, so my partner and I and the boys will just be on our porch and then once it's done, we plan on cleaning up the house so the boys won't be in danger of anything. I just don't know what to clean or how.So, I have chronic pain and I have just bought my first dry herb vape and am trying to find certain strains to help the pain. My hope is to find one that will help with the pain but not make me feel *completely* out of it during the day, which I have found that Jack Herer, Harlequin, and Sour Diesel may be good options. My problem that I'm having is, I literally can't find a place that sells them. Like can those just not really be found alone ? Do they have to be mixed ? I'm not understanding what I'm doing wrong and why I can't find the ones I'm looking for.I (23F) have been with my partner (24M) for almost 6 years now. His family didn't like me when we first got together and we've had some ups and downs with them, but they're trying to get better and I believe that people deserve second chances and since we have seen improvement, everything is chill.However, I have 3 different autoimmune diseases/chronic illnesses/chronic pains and they have been causing a *lot* of issues. People who don't have any of these like to give unsolicited advice; "have you tried yoga ?" "Maybe if you got vegetarian/vegan that will stop your pain" "you should exercise more", blah blah blah. I eat just fine, I'd say average, and I do exercise every day. I do everything I can to ensure I'm taking care of this broken ass body because I don't like the pain. But none of it really does anything, it's just more about principle and trying to do what I can now to keep my body in good health. Yesterday, my partners mom called while we were on our way home from the store. She asked me how I was doing and I said I was in a lot of pain because going to the store hurts me since we walk around so much. She then says that walking around is the best thing I can do for my pain (it's not, it hurts to walk for too long, that's why I have an elliptical) and that she's tired of hearing people (she's a nurse) say "give me a pill to stop the pain, give me a pill" and that if they just exercised and took better care of themselves then they wouldnt be in pain. Now, I know she's not *trying* to be rude, but it pissed me off. My partner and I just ignored her and moved the conversation along, but I'm regretting not saying something. I am not usually confrontational, which is one of the reasons why my partner didn't really "defend" me, he didn't need to and he knows me well enough to know when I feel like he should step up and when he doesn't really need to, and this was a time where I feel like he didn't really *need* to, and I wanted to get inside because I was hurting so badly so I didn't want an argument to happen either. But I feel like I should've spoken up and explained that that's not how it works with chronic pain and that it doesn't matter what I do, I am still going to be in pain until I find the right treatment plan. So, WIBTA if I corrected her the next time she says something like that ? I don't want to hurt her feelings, I want to educate her on this. Especially since she's a nurse, she's likely to deal with people with invisible illnesses and I don't want her to discount their feelings based on her belief that exercise and healthy eating will solve everything.Okay, so, I've never once used buds to get high, I've only ever used edibles, so, I'm *very* inexperienced when it comes to this. But I wanted to try a dry herb vape because I want to test out some strains so I can see if those strains work for my chronic pain, but I have no idea what I'm really looking for. I also need to make sure that I don't have to sit and smoke this whole thing, like I want to use it, put it away for a while, use it, and repeat. I've seen Pax everywhere and that seems like a good option, but I'm not sure if that's a good one, I'm trying not to go over $200 and right now the Pax is on sale so it's $200 plus I'd get a discount for it being my first purchase with them so that would make it even less. Is this a good choice ?. So, I usually eat edibles, I get them from a pretty good store where I am, but I am looking to try and make my own tinctures because I have chronic pain and I want to figure out a custom tincture that works best for my pain. But I have literally never touched weed buds before and I have no idea what I'm doing. I know I need to decarboxylate the buds, and I was trying to figure out how I could do that in an air fryer since leaving my oven on for that long worries me, but everything I've read is all over the place and the information is different every time. If someone can give me some advice on that, that would awesome, but this post is about something else 😅 I was wondering if it would be safe for me to try vaping/smoking certain strains to try and test and see what works best for me. I have asthma so I'm worried about that, but I also wouldn't be using either of these long term (especially if I can figure out how to use the freaking air fryer as a decarboxylation device) so would this be okay health wise ? Just as a temporary fix until I can do my own tinctures ?. I have chronic pain and I am trying to create my own tinctures for the pain. However, I have no idea how to do this. I've read a bunch of articles and they almost all give me different information. The oven seems to be a pretty good option, but I don't like the idea of leaving my oven going for that long, and I looked up decarboxylation devices and they are rather expensive. I saw that the air fryer might be a good option though, and was wondering how in the world I could use that ?. I have chronic pain. I want to learn how to make my own CBD/THC oil to be able to make my own "medical marijuana" but I have no idea what I'm doing. I've found some articles to help, but what I'm confused about is 1) where to even get the products I'd need and 2) what strains should I be getting that help with chronic pain ? I think that making my own would be cheaper AND I could use that CBD to make my own CBD products, like bath salts or whatever. I just don't know what I'm doing 😅. I have chronic pain and I have been searching for a good CBD oil but I don't know what potency to get. I tried some before and it didn't do anything, so I'm assuming it just wasn't enough. But I was wondering if there's a way to find how much I'd need and a good brand that's not like ... $100 😅. I have a GTR Mini and I just got a portable elliptical that I can sit down and use (I have chronic pain so standing can be a bit much sometimes) but the GTR doesn't track steps on it. Is there a way to manually add those or something ? I want to track them but I can't figure out how.I've been looking into getting ring splints since my pinkies are bent at the middle knuckle constantly, I can't flatten them, and then my DIP joints are pretty flexible and it can make things difficult. But how in the world do you figure out what *kind* you need ? And they're so expensive it seems like, are there any places where I can get some nice looking ones that aren't $100s ?. Okay, so, I am in college working on my master's (technically, I chose to take a leave of absence for a semester) and I am going to go into Social Work. However, I started having very bad pain that I'd never felt during my previous semester, so during the summer. The problem is, I haven't had to work with the pain as well as working a job, dealing with normal household chores, and doing school all at the same time. The pain I was having at the end of last semester was nothing, it would only start hurting a bit when I was about to go to bed and when I would wake up, but now, it's constant. Every day I have a horrific flare that starts at about 5-6pm every night and lasts until I go to bed and every day I'm stiff and in pain now. I am planning on going back to school this next semester but I'm so worried about how I'm supposed to deal with all of it all at once. I'm getting nervous because what if I can't be a good social worker because of it ? Do y'all have any tips on how to do this all at once ?. Anybody watch the episode of Top Gear where Matt Smith was on and he was talking about how a little girl was hiding in his bushes with a book and asked him to just say "Hello, I'm the Doctor (or something along those lines)" ? I keep thinking about it as I rewatch Doctor Who and I keep thinking about how sad that little girl must've been. I was a pretty emotionally neglected child (my parents tried their best, but they weren't very emotionally mature themselves, and I was the oldest daughter so, y'all can see where that's going, I'm guessing) so I was pretty imaginative and spent a lot of time alone. I watched Doctor Who and all I could imagine was being there with him and being his companion. I thought about it so so so much, because at the time, anywhere seemed better and maybe I wouldn't feel like I was a weirdo or a freak or invisible. He'd make me feel seen, and heard, and loved, and I could be just as weird as he was ! And I imagine that little girl felt the same way I did, and it breaks my heart because no little girl, no *child* should feel that way. I hope it helped her through whatever she needed to get through (if there even was something, I'm just speculating).We just found two fleas on one of our boys and we are ordering flea treatment stuff right now, but is there anything we can do in the meantime ? Will an oatmeal bath help get rid of them ? I read something that said that bathing them in vinegar can help, but I don't want to do that before I know if it actually works.What do y'all think would've happened if they had let Abel stay with the Irish couple ? I'm just curious; there are a thousand ways that could've gone but I wanted to see if anyone else had any ideas that I didn't !. I had to put a pause on my master's program today. I was supposed to be going into my first semester of two of my graduate program for social work. But I had to take a leave of absence until next semester because of everything going on in my life; my partner and I just moved states about 2 months ago and the house we are living in at the moment has a ton of issues so we were forced to file for rent escrow (meaning we have court dates and such for all this, and if we are let out of our lease, then we will have to find anorher place), I was diagnosed with bipolar at the same time, and I've discovered I likely have 3 different chronic illnesses (ankylosing spondylitis, Ehlers Danlos, and fibromyalgia). With all this happening, my partner and I talked about it (along with my advisors and such) and we all came to the conclusion that taking a leave of absence is the best choice. Since I'm in social work, I have to do something called a practicum, which is basically an unpaid internship, but since I have my bachelor's, after 90 days, I would've been able to get paid. But since I dropped my classes, that meant I had to drop the practicum, which is really what's breaking my heart. I was very excited to do it and very excited to learn. I just know that if I pushed myself through these next two semesters that I was going to end up neglecting my classes and that would mess up my GPA and I couldn't risk that. I'm also a first generation graduate. I'm the first one in the family to get a bachelor's degree and I will be the first to get a master's. As the oldest daughter, I was always expected to pave the way for sisters and I feel like I've let them down. I'm not leaving forever, just taking a semester off to figure things out. But I was wondering if you guys could give me some encouragement for all this ? I really feel like shit about it and I feel like a complete failure ...What counts as a bath ? One of my ferrets is an idiot and steps in poop sometimes when he goes in their litter box and he had some on his belly that was stuck, I managed to get it off with some warm water, but I want to give him a bath to really clean him off. However, my partner and I just gave them a bath like 2-3 weeks ago, I think. We only use oatmeal in the bath.Idk if this is a place to go but I use these patches from Salonpas and they have menthol in it and I seem to only be able to feel the cold of the menthol. It happens when I use Tiger Balm and Icy Hot as well. It's like my body is incapable of feeling the heat that's supposed to come with it. Anyone else have this ?EDIT: I just wanted to say that I put some of those patches on my upper spine and I can feel the menthol pretty strongly, but I'm having a hard time feeling it on my lower back, which is where most of my pain is.I don't know if I have EDS, but when I looked stuff up about it, I have some weird hypermobility things, like my arms bend further than normal, same with my knees, I can "click" all my fingers, I have flat feet, and a few other things. I don't have stretchy skin and I've never had a dislocation except when I was born; I was born with hip dysplasia so my hips were dislocated.However, I've been thinking about that. Maybe I do have EDS and maybe I never had hip dysplasia at all ... Again, I don't know if I have EDS, I'm not trying to get a diagnosis here, just some support. I'm very scared about the idea of having this. I also am working on getting a diagnosis for ankylosing spondylitis and fibromyalgia too so adding this chronic illness to the list just scares the hell out of me ... I don't know what to do and things are getting to be a bit too much for me ...Idk if you'd call it John's manifesto but it seemed right 😂 but I like to imagine the part where Jax throws it into a fire as the moment where he realizes he's going to go down the same path as his father; the moment he realized he would never be the same Jax before Abel was born, no matter how hard he tried to fight it. I think it's morbidly beautiful.I haven't been diagnosed very long with bipolar disorder, but I've been trying to find resources to help me learn more about it and help me figure out how to work through this, but I can't find any good ones. I'm not the most scientific so I was looking for something a little bit more chill, but if I have to read things more scientific then I will, I just have no idea what I'm doing, I'm very scared, and all I want to do is get control of my life again.I'm currently in the middle of a manic depression episode and have been for months. I've been feeling like I'm two different people sometimes. There are times when I feel very lovey and all I want to do is make things more positive and try and get some things back in order and then other times I'm extremely irritable, angry, and just downright not fun to be around (I'm working \*very\* hard on this part, don't worry !). I feel like I have no control over my mind and body; I can't remember anything, I feel empty, numb, and irritable, and I dissociate a lot now (I am currently talking with my psychiatrist about possibly having depersonalization/derealization disorder), and I have a few other very stressful things happening in my life so it's not helping the bipolar disorder. I just feel like I'm multiple people; as I said, one day I'm happy and positive, the next I'm angry and irritable, then I'm exhausted and depressed, and then I'm happy again, and it's never the same cycle, but having it happen multiple times a day is exhausting sometimes and it just makes me feel like I have different parts of myself, like the angry one, the depressed one, the happy one, etc. Does anyone else feel like this ?. I would like to dye my hair but I've never dyed it before. I have dark blonde hair so I imagine I have to get it bleached, but I worry that'll really destroy my hair. Any advice on how to keep my hair healthy ??. Hey guys. I have a lot going on at home (my partner and I moved to another state a month ago and the house we are renting is worse than what was shown to us so we are currently in the middle of filing an escrow and doing whatever we can to get out of this place, and added onto that I also have an autoimmune disease/chronic pain) so my stress is through the roof. Today, though, is especially bad. I don't know why, it just is. But currently, my partner is at work and I'm home alone with just our ferrets and I'm pretty paranoid. I keep thinking someone is coming to the house or that some awful is about to happen. I was just wondering if there was any advice on how to deal with this ...I've talked with a few psychiatrists and therapists about the fact that I feel like I don't have feelings, my brain is *super* foggy, I feel like I'm just *here* (like my body is on earth, but my brain isn't), I don't have a good memory (I even forget what I'm talking about in the middle of a sentence sometimes), I feel disconnected from my feelings of love and affection (I'm in love with my partner, but I don't *feel* that anymore and it's driving me crazy), and I'm horrible with time (days feel either super short or way to fast, and I barely remember what I did that day by the end of the day). I've looked some stuff up about this disorder and I do believe I have it, I have been chronically dissociated for like 3 years or something insane like that and it's getting to a really bad point. I have bipolar disorder and am currently in a manic depressive episode so if I have it, the depersonalization derealization disorder is making things 10x worse. Does it seem like that's what's happening ? What do I do ?.
    Hey yallIm really not doing well. I had a psychotic episode about a year ago and it ruined my life entirely, and I dont think I can continue to go on like this. I havent had any help all year, been dealing with this on my own. I really need professional help so I decided I need to be hospitalized, I just dont know how it all works.I just have a few questions about it and if anyone can help me it would really save my life here.Firstly, how do I even go about it to begin with? Do I just google mental hospitals and show up at the door? I am in a very good area for healthcare generally, I would say specifically but I think its against the subreddits rules.Second, can I like have some kind of input as to how long I stay there? Or do they not let you out until they think youre good to go? Third, and im sure this will be hard to answer, but how does insurance work in this situation? Im pretty broke but I have good insurance, again id give details but I dont think I can, but am I gonna take a big financial hit for this?Lastly, will this even be that helpful to begin with? A lot of people I know tell me it made their situation worse, but I dont have any other options really. Thank you very much for your help, god bless.TW: S*icide I really need help, I dont have anyone who can relate or listen to me in my life, I have been completely alone on this for a year. Check my post history if you want more details, and thank you for reading.Ive been undiagnosed until this year (25 M) and I am not on meds. Last year I had my first real manic episode (stealing, sex, spending money, DUI) which resulted in psychosis triggered by shrooms. My life was ruined, I had to leave the city I was in and move back in with my parents, and I lost everything and everyone.Its been a little over a year since I went psychotic. I managed to eliminate ate most of the hardcore symptoms (couldnt sleep, hearing/seeing things, constant anxiety, extreme dpdr) through doing a 15 day water fast in February. Since then, ive been trying to piece my life back together. I started working out, im in a new relationship, finally was able to start working, and im with my parents still.The thing is, I really dont know how much longer I can go on. Everything was ruined and I feel like a completely different person than a year ago. I barely relate to my old self but I desperately want my old life back. Everything is awful, I can barely hold my relationships right now, working is near impossible, im constantly angry and irritable, I spiral all the time, I have thoughts of s*icide every day, im always crying over what ive lost, I have no motivation to move on, and the worst thing is im losing hope that ill ever be able to fully recover and be my old self. I feel constantly inflamed, sick, tired. I dont even have good or hypomanic days like I used to, at best I feel not horrible. I cant feel joy like I used to and I have lingering dpdr, I cant sit still and be alone like I used to, everything is just awful.So my questions are: Is it possible to feel normal again or am I just fucked?Will this keep getting worse with age?What should I do to recover?Before this I was bipolar but I really enjoyed life, and I was a really exciting and interesting person to be around. Nowadays im a shell of my old self, and I barely want to be here but im too afraid of death.Thanks for reading, I love you all and I hope the best for each of you.Hey guys!I just now broke a hard dry (first attempt, got to 4 days out of 6 attempted). I am gonna keep going with water fasting until I get to a week. My question is, when can I attempt a week again? I was going to do a week refeed and go right back into a dry fast, will that work well?Edit: wanted to add context, I am an experienced water fatser (15 days longest, been doing adf and 5 day fasts the last 3 months)Edit 2: doing it for healing purposes!. Ive had this symptom and its probably my main problem thats ocd related, I just cant really find too many people who have it - which makes me question if its ocd at all. Ever since I was a kid, I have had physical impulses that vary over time. Sometimes its verbal (like right now I have this thing that when im thinking of a word with a j I have a verbal tick to say the j part, especially while im running long distance). I have impulses to touch things, which get way stronger if im in a situation where I need to stay still. If im in bed with a girl going to sleep, its really hard for me to stay still, I always move around out of this impulse. Sometimes I have to block out something out of the corner of my eye with my hand. Sometimes its tapping things three times, but generally its touching things im “not supposed to” and I have to fight the impulse. Its generally subtle but most people close to me notice it eventually.Anyway, is this a normal OCD symptom? If so, what are the best ways to curb it?. Im relatively new to water fasting, I did 15 days in January (for my first time ever), ive been doing adf for a month now, and currently on day 3 of 7 of another extended fast. Im doing it mostly for the autophagy benefits, I really messed up my brain last year and fasting really saved me. Anyway, I really wanted to do a longer fast so I can clear up my brain completely (15 days fixed like 80% of my symptoms), but I feel completely awful during extended fasts. Everyone says after 3 days it gets easier, but for me it definitely doesnt, it honestly feels harder the longer I go. Ive tried a couple of different electrolyte brands (im sticking with snake juice for now), and I use plenty of water. I just wanna know if this is normal and I should stick it out. My symptoms are mainly fatigue and weakness, hunger is still there, I get emotional and feel kind of depressed and out of it, and I get a lot of head pressure. This has happened every time ive gone over 30 hours. My goal is to do a 3 week fast by the end of the year, and my idea by doing adf and this current week fast was to maybe prepare my mind and body for it so that the longer one will be easier. Is this a bad plan? Are my symptoms normal?. I just got a new remote job, but I dont start until the middle of next month. I just need help with my bills this month. First time borrower, will provide any info needed to help out!. I was really surprised that this happened, I did fudge up my previous restaurant experience a bit (I worked as a barback for a short period of time then had to suddenly quit for a move). I just have no idea what im doing and I’m pretty nervous to walk in and act like I do. What are the most important things I need to know in order to not look like a complete idiot? Thanks for yalls time!. Hey y’all On the 3rd I ended a two week long water fast. No food, just bottled water. I was going for three weeks but I had to move cross country (driving) bc my dpdr/hppd. The water fast didnt cure everything but it almost completely cured my two biggest problems: anxiety and insomnia.Within the first week I was no longer constantly anxious, and I was able to sleep normally again. Check my post history if you wanna see how bad things were. Couldnt sleep more than an hour a day for months. This also greatly reduced my dpdrGive it a shot! Do your research though. DM me if you need any tips.I just recently had to relocate from the west coast, and I just need some help with my bills now that im done moving. Any help would be greatly appreciated:). Hey everyone! I am about to drive through OKC for the first time and I am having a strong craving for some good chicken fried steak! One of my favorite meals ever honestly.I wanted to try Kendall’s, but its closed til 4 unfortunately. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks y’allEdit: thanks for all the suggestions! I definitely got some good choices now, excited for a little food coma on my drive out. Hey everyone!In September I had a mental health crisis which put me out of work for a few months, im improving and able to work again but I am short for some bills this month due to being out of work. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you!. In September I had a mental health crisis which put me out of work for a few months, im improving and able to work again but I am short for some bills this month due to being out of work. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you!. TW suicidal ideations I got diagnosed with Bipolar I recently so this is all new to me now. I just always thought these symptoms were normal character flaws of mine lolMy friends, family, gf (lost many of these due to this), or whoever can set me off so easily. Then I just get in this mood where I cant talk to anyone and have to be alone. I just get super angry and spiteful out of nowhere. Little things (justified or not) will cause this huge reaction where I just shut off. Its always the same cycle. Something will bother me slightly. I just get into this spiteful/angry/end it all/brooding mood. I get really quiet around everyone. If I dont leave the situation its just festers until I snap. So I usually just leave and do some crazy shit like drive really fast with loud music and scream to myself. Other times ive made self destructive or erratic decisions like binge drinking or even moving across the country to get away from everyone. Last night my friend pissed me off while I was out so I had to leave. I get all suicidal and wanna just sulk by myself. Then I just wanna end it to make people feel bad. It just sends me down a spiral. I end up sobbing and screaming by myself and then the next day its like nothing happened and im no longer mad at them. Makes me feel like an asshole. I just hold grudges until im “normal” again. Ive been doing this my whole life and I just thought it was normal.This shit sucks, sorry for the long rant.TLDR; Took shrooms while depressed 4 months ago, everything went to shit. Haven’t felt normal since Hey everyone and big thanks to anyone who reads this, im in a dark place right now and I have no support.I have Bipolar II and OCD for context, unmedicated.I had a really crazy summer last year where I was going out and drinking constantly, doing drugs, having a lot of sex, lying a lot, cheating, the whole shabang. I was constantly doing crazy shit and I felt great. In September I went back to my parents in North Carolina from Los Angeles to visit. I slowed down a bit and got really depressed. When I came back to LA I couldnt do anything but sleep and cry. I was getting anxious about my girlfriend at the time and I didnt know why. I took a gram mushrooms to find out and thats when everything went to shit.I had a depressing shrooms trip and then couldnt sleep for about a month. I had constant anxiety and dpdr, my vision was fucked (blurry, light sensitivity, floors would occasionally breathe). I was a mess. I couldnt work or function at all. This went on until I went back to NC for a while to seek help. Over the holidays I was able to sleep again (its very different now tho, I have extremely lucid dreams and never feel rested). I started feeling more like my normal self again but everything is really off still. Everything feels like a weird dream. Im constantly anxious and I sob every day. I just miss my old life, ive felt like I fucked my brain up. Its definitely getting better with time but im still anxious and super depressed, and I have no idea what I did to my brain.Whats weird about it is since the beginning the symptoms come and go in severity every day. Usually in the evenings itll almost go away entirely and ill feel almost completely normal. Ive had plenty of moments in the last 4 months where ive gone out and enjoyed things with friends and family. From the outside things dont really look too bad, but from within things are horrible. Constantly out of it and foggy, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety.I went to a family doctor who prescribed me xanax and paxil. Paxil made everything way worse so I stopped (couldnt sleep at all, felt sick and jittery). Xanax helps a lot but I am hesitant to take it often. I went to therapy but this process is really slow and I havent gotten much out of it so far. I took a bipolar friends Seroquel for a couple days (stupid idea I know) and it didnt do too much but make me sleep a lot. Sorry for the long post, but this seems like a really unique problem and I dont know how to address it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks for reading.Im 24 and ive been living with it my entire life. It was never a big problem because it was mild until last year. I had a really crazy manic episode for several months over the summer, which ended in a suicide attempt and a really bad shrooms trip which triggered hppd and horrible anxiety/sleep issues.Ive been coping with this bout of depression for a few months now and I cant get anything done. Every day is really difficult nowadays. Im just asking this because I dont have insurance and medication isnt an option financially right now. Is it even possible for me to deal with this without medication? I am just afraid things will get worse.I was prescribed Paxil 10 mg a day a couple weeks ago. I haven’t taken it more than 3 days in a row because when I take it I have really weird reactions to it. When I take it I feel kind of on edge at all times. I cant sleep at all. Im tired but wired at the same time. I get a weird headache, I get shaky, and worst of all I feel kind of sick. I also have some weird bowel movements too and my stomach hurts. Kind of just feels like I got some kind of illness. Im not sure what to do because my anxiety and depression are debilitating, should I stick it out? I heard from some people that it gets worse before it gets better.I know this is a really specific tip but its been really helpful for me. I leave it there long term (up to a month) for free when I visit my family on the east coast. Just gotta register it with the front desk at the station. I asked and its completely kosher with them. 24/7 security too. Hope y’all are well! I have OCD and Bipolar II for context. My anxiety shot up 1000% the last few months and for some reason it peaks right when I wake up and disappears almost entirely at night. I just wake up at 5 am freaking out about stuff that I otherwise wouldnt think much about before, and id get this feeling in my chest thats just awful. Im losing a lot of sleep over it. I just wake up feeling despair and anxiety, I feel really sick too, but then it kinda tapers off and then goes away entirely at night. Like id think about the same thing that would stress me out in the morning and it wouldnt bother me much at all.My doctor prescribed me xanax and paxil. I took the xanax to sleep a couple times but it didnt do too much. Maybe just a low dose (.25). It helps a littlewith the anxiety but I still feel like shit when I wake up. I took the paxil once and I felt horrible so I stopped, should I just try again with that? Also, do yall have any practical tips for things I can do to work through this? Lastly, im interested as to why my anxiety comes in waves like that. Is there any explanation for it?Thanks!. Trying to spread a little positivity in here. I am nowhere near recovered but things are looking up! I beat dpdr once in 2018 following a bad weed experience and some flashbacks, couldnt sleep for a month and my vision was fucked. I just continued to live my life and it went away within a year, forgot all about it.This time is way worse. I got it from a bad shrooms trip in September. Life has been very difficult since then. I havent slept right at all, extreme anxiety, despair, numbness and feeling disconnected, my visions awful, my brain is numb and I haven’t felt normal since.The last couple weeks have been way better though! Went back to my parents in North Carolina (I live in LA) for the holidays, and I started kind of sleeping normally for the first time in months! I am able to ignore it during the day if im busy and ive had good times going out with friends. I also have been feeling things again which is nice. Ive been taking a Natures Made Gaba + L-theanine supplement which has helped a lot. My doctor prescribed me with xanax and paxil but I havent been taking them, I am seeing some progress and I wanna see it out.Again, this shits horrible and every day is a struggle, but things are looking up. This is beatable with time. There is hope!. So I got this friend I met through my roommate who ive known for almost two years now. Ever since ive known her she has been going around telling people that she’s autistic and it bothers the shit out of me. Her reasoning is that she took an online quiz that she found through a tiktok, and that her autistic friend said that she might be autistic. Apparently this is enough to support a full diagnosis. Its even to the point where she told my roommate that he’s probably autistic too (he’s definitely not). To her credit, she is a very blunt person who can be considered rude to people, and shes generally hard to read. I have no clue if that makes her autistic or not but this is how she justifies that.Id introduce her to some of my friends and she would eventually tell them that she’s autistic, and they’d just go with it, but nobody has ever called her out on it. So the other day we went out bowling and I was pretty drunk (great drink specials at the bowling alley), and when she told a friend of mine that she’s autistic I kinda laughed a little. She then started to pry about why I laughed and we got into a full blown argument about how I think her self diagnosis is BS. She pretty much summed my argument up to thinking that shes using the autism diagnosis to justify her rudeness to people, when in reality shes just a really hot girl from Venice beach who hasnt had to learn proper manners (which is more or less how I feel). Shes been pissed at me ever since, my friends find it funny tho.Honestly outside of that shes a cool person that I like to hang out with. For all I know shes right and she really is autistic, which I never said was completely impossible. I just think she should get a formal diagnosis before she goes around telling people that. I think its generally kinda fucked up to pretend you’re autistic and makes people who actually have the condition look bad. I also understand that theres a better way of putting that than bottling it up then laughing at her while im drunk, but I tried to be reasonable about it up until then. So reddit, AMITA?. My mom made me go to a general family doctor and after me explaining my condition for a couple minutes he gave my a depression and anxiety questionnaire then prescribed me xan and paxil. Xan .25 to sleep every night and paxil for the depression daily. Im really hesitant to medicate myself that easily. Especially having qualms about the xan. Would it be a bad idea to take them or am I overthinking it?. Im not sure how illegal this is but its been super clutch for me to get a good seat.Lets say youre frugal and got a middle seat in the back of a spirit flight (like I just did yesterday). Instead of boarding when you’re supposed to and taking the seat you bought, wait until youre the very last person to board. Then when you get on the plane scan the aisles for a free row with nobody in it and take it for yourself, works for me every time.Just flew from Vegas to Charlotte front row with the whole thing to myself so I could sleep. My seat was in between two people.Edit: a couple comments saying this is a bad idea if the flight is full, im just confused as to why exactly. Its the same seat regardless youre just getting on later, if its full just go to your normal seat. If theres another reason tho im open to hearing itEdit 2: Somebody mentioned this but I didn’t think about it, this only works if the seats are pre assigned! So southwest this would be a stupid idea because you choose your seat isnt pre assigned.
    Yesterday I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, my doctor told me to start taking 30 mg of Duloxetine this week then 60 mg next week. I told my doctor I’m bipolar and asked if this will react to my condition. Since I’ve stopped taking antipsychotics and mood stabilizers a couple years back.(I prefer taking natural remedies ie: working out , support system etc) She said I shouldn’t have any issues.I took it , and didn’t sleep, I feel extremely irritated and out of it, shaky and feel just overall weird.Is this a start of a manic episode? Is this just the side effects of the medication. Should I keep riding it out?Has anyone had any similar experiences?. any company’s that specialize in fantasy/elvish inspired wedding dresses? Or dresses? I’m looking for a gown in Light pink or green! Thanks for the help!.
    This past week i would feel my eyes burning and realized i hadn’t slept for over 24 hours and I know it seems stupid but i keep forgetting to sleep. I just think all day and do things that it doesn’t cross my mind and I’m rarely tired. How can i??. I woke up screaming and running out of my apartment i sat in the hall crying thinking i wasn’t real and it took a long time to calm down but then when i laid back down to sleep i kept jumping and waking up? i thought maybe just nightmares but i was barely asleep when this happened, Do you think this is because of the meds, its only night 1 so doesn’t seem likely, I didn’t take last night and it didn’t happen so maybe? and yes i will talk to my doctor but looking for advice from ppl who know best thanks. I’ve realized that when it gets colder out and snow starts to come out i always get off and weird, maybe because the less sunlight but i notice i’m fine and stable throughout most of the year but then winter comes and all my symptoms start to show more and i always stop taking my meds, anyone else?. I seen the logan paul suicide forest video a couple minutes ago and wondering if he stabbed the guys body or cut his finger off and took it home is that a crime? Or if he would of stole his phone or jewelry off his body?. I don’t know if im hearing a voice or if im just thinking in a different voice, it doesn’t sound like my inner monologue voice its a female and i am not but it feels like im thinking it? I feel like it should be easy to tell if im hearing a voice but i dont know. How did you know? sorry if i didn’t explain well. I’ve had the boots for a year and they are so comfortable even when i first bought them they never hurt my foot, I got the shoe version and they hurt so bad they feel tighter than the boots and they are the same size. Do i get a size bigger or try and break them in?. If you hired a hitman to kill you cause you couldn’t do it yourself and changed your mind but couldn’t get back in contact with him would the police put you in hiding? * I know hitman are really hard to come by cause it’s 100% always scam*. Ive been off my meds for a little bit and I want to try something else but this is probably one of my biggest fears for medication, I know i should ask a doctor but I want some answers from the people who would know personally first. I feel like my life is over, everyone is going to see me differently now and why is the word schizophrenia so scary when I got told my heart dropped theres no way. I feel like they got it wrong i feel so scared of what my life will look like now. I need someone to talk to that has this disorder because i feel so alone.
    I feel really scared about bipolar. I feel I manage mine well - I am on medications that help regulate my moods and my mania. But I still get hypomanic for months at a time, and I'm truly terrified of what that means for my brain over the next 20-30 years. Every episode of mania brings on some brain damage right, and sometimes now when I'm "doing well" I'm already running on fumes, I'm so scared of what it's going to mean for my brain down the line. I want to have kids, and I'm so conflicted about passing this on. I have therapy scheduled this week, so I will be able to continue working on this myself, but wonder if anyone has tips for how to self soothe about the diagnosis.. I have been sober for 632 days and it feels incredible. It's an amazing choice I make every single day. It's been 320 days since my alcoholic father's death. This father's day was my first dad-less. That's all!. I am a producer in my 30s at a production studio in nyc, specializing in different types of animation. I have been a producer for 10 years. I am so sick of it. I cry ALL THE TIME because of work stress, people's attitudes and treatment, and it's just not tenable for me anymore. I work very hard and have found a lot of success in my work, my clients and my crew like me, and I have had a decent career overall, but I am so unhappy in the tough moments that I don't think I'm cut out for this field? I'm just too soft? Idk. I know a lot of people change careers, and I feel like my skills are transferable. But... where do I even start?! I am a creative person who fell into production while working at a large post house early in my career. I would prefer to not be a project manager with spreadsheets/paperwork side of the job, and instead find work that involves liasing with a team (my strongest skills IMO) and making some sort of art (the dream). Anyone whos been through this... or any advice..... please :(. feeling really proud of myself. I am excited about every single day from now to add on. Sending you all my love - If I can do it, I believe you can too. <3. I am so excited to celebrate a birthday sober - and with sober friends. I don't think I ever thought this could be possible. I am so excited to live the rest of my life this way.I work for an animation & VFX studio. Our reel is pretty solid with a rich history of stop motion, 2d and CG animation. My team's ideas and pitches for bids are often great, and usually during the walk-through the creative really shines through and we can connect with client or agency creatives and get them on board. The treatments themselves however, suck. Is there any advice on how to best design a deck that sells the creative as hard, and as well as well do? We use Google Slides mostly and have a 'minimalist' design that we use, but even a rep told me it was boring. It feels like we are never focusing on the right parts of the ask from the agency and spend time on style frames for the wrong aspect of the production. Any insight on how to get past shitty treatments and pitch something solid?. Hi guysI need full knights armor for a commercial shoot tomorrow. Do you have something I can rent from you?

The #SToLO campaign stands for Standard of love, about how our community needs to raise it's standards towards itself, it's lawmakers, community members and everywhere beyond. See meet up here: https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-SiCAsTyf/events/235757231/ Personally, this is my #Stolo:I feel entitled to our country’s unalienable rights. If you need reminding, they are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If life is the first right to which all human beings obtain, then #blacklivesmatter is a given. Full stop. The first definition online for liberty is: the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views. Therefore, liberty means that I have all the power when it comes to decisions about my body, my life style, my love life and my thoughts. Nobody has the power to overturn what I choose to do or become. Finally, the pursuit of happiness is something that ties perfectly with the first two in that my happiness is my own, and I can achieve it however I see fit. I was going to add “to the full extent of the law”, but then I stopped myself as there are many laws that inhibit personal liberties such as sodomy laws which were only repealed 13 years ago (see: Supreme Court case overturning Bowers v. Hardwick in 2003).My Standard of Love/ #StoLo is based on these rights for myself and all men, women, of any culture, regardless of age, social status or identity. I have a firm belief that I deserve to receive love, respect and whatever else at this high standard I have set for myself and those around me. In fact, I am entitled to them.What is your #StoLo?.

I tried reaching out to the film commission and haven't really received much word back, thought maybe this sub could get some traction.We need:* Latina woman, age 18-30 (daughter)* Latina woman, age 40+ (mother)* Variety of men and women & ethnicities, age 18-30 (to be students of the college)If you're interested in coming out, please send me a headshot/photo! My email is rebecca@zenfilm.comMyself and our director will be coming to scout next week, and can meet and do a casting call if anyone here is available.Our company is Zenfilm from Houston, here is a link www.zenfilm.com IF you have any questions, feel free to ask!thank you!. I am shooting a video a video and need hockey players! We are going to be at the Houston Aerodrome 9/4/15 at 8:30am. I am buying lunch for any players that day! Please let me know if you're interested!!! :). First of all, thank you everyone for letting me vent. I love this community. Sorry it's not really related to the community. Here goes.On May 25th (Three months, tomorrow!) both my partner and my cars flooded in the huge surplus of rain that hit Houston, Texas. We were parked in our parking garage,we slept soundly through the storm, not ever thinking about the cars. Well 7am in the morning came on us hard when our cars were filled in water up to the rear view mirror.By 9am, we were making claims to Geico on the app. We set the inspection date, one for each car, and went to get a rental car. Geico kept not showing up on the inspection date & coming randomly and calling saying why can't they see the cars- They're in the basement of our building, we would need to let them in. That went on for about two weeks, and finally both cars were inspected, and totaled. After another 3 days or so, they gave us the "payout" amount, and we thought "alright, let's buy cars with this money Geico is going to give us!" And as a week went by we thought "Okay lets go gets cars now and Geico will pay us soon". And now, three months after the floods, about to make our third car payments on each new car, and they're still not paying us!We have began to call them every Monday, Wed and Friday, trying to move things along. At first the guy who looked at the cars didn't list the proper options, and then he didn't report it correctly, and now, for the past 3 weeks, he hasn't updated the information to send to our lien holder. Does anyone have any advice on how to get this moving and finished? Should we involve a lawyer?Thank you. I moved to the US in 2000 and my dad's son from a previous marriage stayed behind. I was young and didn't understand why, but didn't question it much. Over the years I would ask my parents where he was, and they had no real answers. Recently I got into my genealogy through ancestry.com and found him. I sent him an email today, and don't know if he will want to get back to me. I'm so nervous but so happy I finally found him. Now, I know he's alive. Now, I know he has a great life (Not the drug filled life my father led me to believe)..
    Im a 25M and it just seems that no matter how hard I try I always end up right back to this feeling. Bipolar can be so lonely and I feel like I have no one to relate to. Im lucky that I’ve made really good friends but all of them are constantly doing so well and hitting every milestone that I am not. I’m proud of them but it hurts sometimes to see them so happy. Ive spent the last 4 years trying to manage this but I feel very stuck. I have trouble keeping a job, live at home with parents, and keep trying to go on dates and get into a relationship but it never works out. I feel like I’m not the type of person who gets to live out these experiences. The only time I’m happy is when I am living in someone else’s creation be it a book, tv show, or game. It makes me feel like a failure/loser. I just want something of my own to be happy with. I don’t really know what to do but its so depressing. Right now not even making music or doing anything creative is helping me out. If you have any advice or anything please feel free to share.“They were sitting at the fountain where he’d taught her about displacement. How to make something heavier than water float by making it hollow. She looked at the rippling surface of the water and wondered whether she’d float now too.”What a depressing line given the context of her mourning her father. I really enjoyed Teresa’s POV in this book. Just finished the book too and it was such an incredible ride! Excited for LF.I havn’t started learning yet but want to add it to my list of songs in my solo performance coming up in a few months. I can already play stuff like Choro de saudade by Barrios and have a good grasp on techniques like tremolo picking and artificial harmonics. I’ve been listening to the song nonstop and can recognize that there are parts in the song that are difficult but i’m wondering what you guys think? Btw i’ve been playing guitar just about everyday for 10 years. The main theme motif being played in different contexts whike youre freeroaming, fighting, or escaping from enemies is so satisfying. Not only that but the sound design music wise is top notch. Lush synths alongside detuned synths and distorted/scraped stringed instruments really does create a great vibe. I already like the soundtrack more than the first game and im hype to discover more especially since I have a sweet spot for synths in general! Hope you guys are enjoying/noticing how good the soundtrack is too!. I own and am for sure going to read all the main books, but I dont know if ill be able to read all the novellas on my first read through of the series because of money/time reasons. I want to get to all of them eventually but if i were to read a few of the most important ones in between some of these main books, which would you guys recommend?. I want to get good base weapons for those blueprints but i’m too low of a legend rank to get guru on prison and i dont have the bozak dlc. Most weapons i get at legend level 8 is machetes, handsaws, sledgehammers, batons, and a cleaver here and there.Im playing on hard if that makes any difference.Edit: basically i need tips to find high damage pipes, crowbars, wrenches, small hammer, military shovels, ine handed axes, and picks because i never see them anymore. Don’t have anyone to celebrate with so I just wanted to share this somewhere. Tried quitting 8 different times and only lasted around a week to a month every time but this time its actually sticking. I’ve noticed lots of improvements in the last few months especially when it comes to recognizing what problems I need to work on and how to solve them. I thought i’d never get to this point so I just want to say something for those of you who are going through attempt after attempt and still not getting to where you want to be. Think of every attempt to quit as a step forward instead of a step backwards. For some people, it takes many different tries and approaches for the brain to finally let go of weed. It isn’t easy but after the first month it gets easier and each month after that its easier than the last (at least in my experience). Lastly, I personally found that everything you can get out of weed you can get out of a sober life. It took me a while to see it but its true. Just hang in there and never stop the drive to improve! If anyone needs any advice or help feel free to dm me!. I just reached the halfway point of the game and wanted to start a discussion about how awesome I think the direction of the story is going. It’s been hard seeing all the negativity surrounding this game and I think it’s about time I hear from the people actually liking this game. I know ill probably get shit for this but I also really liked how they started off the game and then gave context to the whole thing later on. Its really cool how it all connects. The acting so far has been phenomenal and the game constantly has me on the edge of my seat! I literally have to do jaw exercises because i can’t stop clenching playing the game. So without endgame spoilers, what have you guys enjoyed? What has been your favorite part of the experience so far?. I just got the dlc for the game and just restarted the game again to play through it all the way with the dlc as well. My question is, when should i start the frozen wilds? Do y’all have a recommended level or should i wait until after i beat the main story?. Im looking for any bands that follow the softer/atmospheric vibe! What would you guys recommend I check out?. I feel like everytime im in a firefight and try and aim for the head i either miss and get headshotted or I panic aim and its a mess. Any tips?. I have had the game since it came out and still haven't beaten it. Ive played a decent amount of hours and am just about to get to skellige. My only problem is that I've frequently taken huge breaks and only remember some of the main plot points from the story. Should I keep going from where I am or should I start the game over?.
    Hey I want friends! Lmk :). TLDR I’m drowning Hey guys. 27f with type 2 BP and OCD. Thanks for being here. I’ve struggled with hygiene pretty much my whole life due to executive disfunction, fatigue from depression/lows, and sensory issues with water/brushing teeth & hair. Recently my senior kitty passed away very traumatically, starting with me putting him in the tub when I woke up (he was covered in a bodily fluid) & realizing the extent of what was going on. When I got home from putting him down, my partner was kind enough to clean out my tub, but I’m still having a hard time going in there. All this to say, I’m having a really really hard time showering and brushing my teeth. It’s been like… one shower in a week. I’m not naturally a sweaty or smelly person, so unfortunately I can “get away with it” without anyone noticing. Same with my hair- if I put it up it looks totally normal. My partner is very understanding of my BP, and honestly I wish he would get on me more about my hygiene, but that’s not his responsibility obviously. Last night I brushed out my depression bun and it hurt so bad from the tangles and mats. I got upset at how dead and damaged my hair is, so I pulled out some scissors and cut some dead ends, which was encouraging and helped a bit. Now the other huge concern- my teeth. I have spent THOUSANDS on fillings, crowns, even had to get a molar removed from my infected wisdom teeth. Every time this happens, somehow it doesn’t motivate me. I feel like giving up on my teeth entirely. It feels like they’re just going to fall apart no matter what I do, which is so invalid considering I’m letting them get worse instead of taking good care of them. Teeth brushing in particular is triggering to me because of it being used as a power trip as a child (I’d lie about brushing bc of sensory issues/sensitive teeth, my mom would corner me in the bathroom and physically force me to let her brush my teeth). Because of that, I have a visceral reaction to brushing my teeth (shuddering, goosebumps, etc). Currently I went to the dentist and they want to do crowns on every single one of my front teeth. I’m only 27 :( I’m scared to trust them to do so much work since I’m going to have to maintain them for the rest of my life. I’m scared they’ll misalign my bite and give me neck and jaw pains. Idk where I’m going with this, just needed to get this out not just on paper or to my therapist. Thanks for listening & sharing your opinions/experiences. I love you guys ❤️.
    Hi everyoneWhen hypomanic, even with my med, I have a very hard time focusing on my work, I'm crawling out of my skin right now but I'm supposed to be working on an important paper, sitting still is hell. Any tips for focus?. For a few days now I felt like wanting to do something, like an urge to do something. But no matter what I start ( I do tons of things, leather work, wood work, longboard, biking, birdwatching, archery, and other stuff) It dosen't give me the satisfaction and dopamine it usually do, so I stop and goes to nother activity, going back and forth in the living room like a lion in a cage, crawling out of my skin of agitation and tension, but unable to feel anything positive or rest. Is it part of having bipolar disorder ?. I have recently been diagnosed with a bipolar type 2 disorder which turned into more of a cyclothymia over the last 5-6 years. OCD only comes back once I'm in a down phase every month or so, and last for a few weeks, before going away again for three weeks. According to my psychiatrist, this is common. On top of that, irritability associated with bipolar is sometimes the trigger - how not to doubt about your relationship when just hearing you partner breathing makes you crawl out of your skin out of irritability ? That's why it is important to get checked by a professional, even if ROCD can seem trivial, don't let the shame stop you from seeking for help as it can be the tree that hides the forest. Search in your past for signs of hypomania if you feel like your OCD is coming in cycles.The bipolar meds are helping me now.I'm suffering from bipolar disoder and obsessive compulsive disorder. My psychiatrist was a bit surprise because I don't have some typical personality traits associated with OCD, but I had them when I was little. What happened is that hypomanic episodes left me more open minded, anxietyless and social than before. When hypomania hit without irritability, my OCD magically disapear and I become fearless. When OCD comes back, I can't handle any change in my routine without a panic attack, which, combine with irritability, makes a terrible combo. Do you have a similar experience with both disorder?. Bonjours à tous,Je sais vraiment pas à qui demander donc je demande à Reddit.Mes grands parents vont me léguer un terrain non constructible de plus d'1 hectare avec un étang. Comment je peux estimer les frais de notaire et les impots pour la transmission ? Je suis un peu perdu c'est un beau bordel. I use light therapy each year in the dark season since 2019 and it helps treamendously for winter depression and keeping a good sleep schedule. I can not stress enough how fantastic this thing is.BUTas bipolar people, remember that starting light therapy can trigger mania. Keep in touch with your doctor while starting it. It used to push me into hypomania then mixed state for about 3 weeks before I got a treatment, but the positive effect following are worth the try.Hi folksI've always struggled with concentration. I wok 50% of the time behind a screen, and that part of the job has always been hell for me. I sometimes needed 5h just to get started. I would crawl out of my skin, fidgeting all the time, having ADHD like symptoms. Since a few weeks I started taking Aripiprazole for my bipolar disorder symptoms, and I've never been more productive. I haven't feel that stable and calm mentaly since I was a child, it's awesome. Sitting on a chair is still difficult, but I can get away with it by taking regular break. What's your experience with concentration as bipolar people?. For me, one very little thing that tells me hypomania is comming is an URGE to listen to the darkest atmospheric black metal ( hello Verdunkeln) at very high volume. It makes me feel extatic. My taste in music tend to shift when hypomania is comming. What are your signs?. Sometimes being bipolar feels like having a superpower: getting high on your own neurotransmitters then have a bad trip about it for a while. r maybe being like Obelix, who fell in the magic potion when he was little.I am suffering from bipolar disorder ( a mild case, more like cyclothymia), which mean I will never have the chance to experience psychedelic substances like psylocibin or lsd, because if these substances can send healthy people to the stars, for us bipolar, it might trigger a dangerous trip to another galaxy and through a black hole that likely will end up in a psychward (if we're lucky). The more I listen to podcast about psychedelic experiences (hello Joe Rogan), the more I realize how some of my hypomanic episodes seem to have common points with what people experience under mild doses of mdma, lsd or psylocybin.here are a few things that matches in my experience:- a feeling of deep connection with the universe, filled with love.- a deeper sense of connection with nature that last afterward.- an infatuated self esteem- a religious experience, like a feelig of connecting with something greater, divine in nature.- a "feeling of understanding". like being sure you understand everything about the universe, you own mind, or a specific subject. yet once you get down you realize it was just a feeling and you didn't understand anything factually.- and, of course, delusion: I once was sure I've been chosen by extraterrestrial angels to accomplish a mission which was yet to be revealed to me. I once was sure I was a prophet. I wanted to re-write the bible (this one is common among manic people though) In another episode I thought I was a shaman for a few weeks and had an urge to build myself a drum, so I bought a deer skin (I still have it, I'm going to build that drum). I'm glad I only had hypomania so I was still rational enough to keep most of this for myself, and not talk about it to everyone. (except for my sister once, and a female classmate who totally freaked out, and a few friend when I was drunk).If some of you experienced both : mania or hypomania, and psychedelic experiences in their life, I'm really curious to know how you would compare the two.Do you think it is even comparable? hit the comments bellow and share your experiences.How does your bipolar disorder rythme change when you get into relationship? Does it accelerate? Because I think it is the case for me, mainly because of the strong emotions involved. I'm interested to know if this is a common experience.Hi everyone I've been suffering from different subtypes of ocd throughout my life. But I also get obsessed positively about the things that interest me, and get the same obsessive urge to go further into it, to the point were it is just as difficult for me to not check it on internet in inappropriate situation (work, social event etc.) It's different that just a hobby. In fact, the only difference with the disorder associated obsessions is the absence of the crippling anxiety. Am I the only one? How does your "positive obsessions" feels like?. Hello everybody,Do you struggle with irritability along with OCD? If yes, how does it manifest itself for you? I know when a rocd relapse is coming because I start to feel extremely irritable. I saw a psychiatrist for the first time a few days ago and her first guess is that I am suffering from something on the spectrum of bipolar disorder. The next time I see her, I will mention my struggle with obsession and compulsion in relationship and see what she think about that.
    I’m considering moving abroad to somewhere sunnier as the weather here sends me off during winter.I have an idea that once I move to another country and have a new start away from people and situations here which trigger me from the past I’ll be better.Has anyone had any experience with this and knows if it will actually help feel more peace and stability? (Surrounded by narcissists)Thanks!.

    I feel so lost.. like I have no idea what I’m doing anymore and I’m tired. I guess I’m not the most open person, I got my bipolar diagnosis 5 years ago, beside my parents most people in my life don’t know and those I have told they do not understand. And I guess that’s okay too because most of the time I don’t understand myself either, it’s very frustrating and confusing. Right now I work two jobs and I study and whenever I’m free I take care of my brother. I know that I should go to the doctor and that I should go back to therapy I just don’t have time for my own needs really. I feel so alone in this, I’m overwhelmed and yeah tired. Does anyone have any advice for small things I can do throughout the day that doesn’t take much time? Especially for anxiety. Thanks for reading this!.
    Hello. I have been on a high but my energy level is already dipping. I’m scared of crashing into depression again. What can I do to soften the blow? Thank you.I’ve been hypomanic for a while now and I’m scared of the inevitable crash. What do you advice I do to give myself a soft landing? I am tired of giving chunks of my life to bipolar depression.What exactly counts as a mood swing ? Do they always have triggers? I was in a good mood earlier, then I ruined dinner and I feel horrible. Does that count a mood swing or a normal emotional reaction to something displeasing?. I’m passionate about becoming a web designer even though I don’t have much experience or skills. However, I feel like working in tech might be bad for my bipolar, especially with all the pressure at startups etc. Any one working in tech here? Does it affect your bipolar? How do you manage your stress and symptoms? Should I just leave the idea?. I haven’t slept well in about a week. I’m about to begin cleaning my room at 3 AM. I feel like a stereotype right now. Heading to the hospital as soon as the day breaks. Fuck this stupid stupid disease.How long do they typically last? Is there any chance I don’t crash into depression after this? I’ve made new friends and I feel optimistic about my career and prospects right now. I do not want to go back to the pits I’ve been in all year. Do I have to check myself into the hospital?. I want to bash my head against the wall or something. I used to sleep for 8-10 hours, easy. Now I can’t catch 6 hours without sheer willpower and I am on benzos that have the most horrible side effects. I know that’s the only thing keeping me from full blown mania, but damn. I hate how one moment, you feel like you understand this fucking bs, and the next you just want to scream because what the fuck is happening. Ughhhhhhh!. I know quite a bit about this stupid disorder and I sometimes wish I didn’t. When I got diagnosed, I took an online course and read books recommended by redditors on bipolar disorder. I know that I’ll eventually get depressed again with the way my mood is spiralling and it’s causing me to feel worse about everything. My last depressive episode lasted nine months and I cannot believe I held on for that long. I’m scared that I can’t go through that again and I wish I didn’t know it was coming, so I would just live in the moment. I don’t know if this makes any sense.I hope you remember to be kind to yourself. I hope you are met with the love and consideration you need. I hope today gives you renewed energy to kick bipolar in the ass and live your best life. Anyway, tell me, what are you doing today? I’m going on an advocacy walk and after that I’ll binge watch modern love.It’s so difficult to live with this disorder and people don’t try to understand we’re just humans who have to figure out how to live with something we didn’t cause and can’t completely control. There’s so much stigma and hate directed at BPD people and it makes me feel like I deserve the ill treatment I’ve received from people. I just saw a post on a sub about how crazy borderline people are and it’s making me feel even worse about myself.I’ve had such a horrible day, got triggered by my ex who keeps slandering me. I thought I was over everything but apparently I’m not. Spent the whole day crying and then I read the most tragic story about a bipolar man that was killed by the police and it sent me down a spiral till I wanted to sh. I kept biting myself because I couldn’t think straight, then I remembered something I saw online, probably on this sub where someone who wanted to sh got a marker and wrote on their skin instead, so I did that. I feel less agitated now. The past few weeks have been a fucking ride for me. Fuck all this.I got hypomanic and I’ve had my meds adjusted with sleeping medicine included but I can’t keep a regular sleep schedule anymore. I’m about to travel which will further throw my routine off. I didn’t go for admission when I was supposed to and now I feel like I’m spiralling. Spending money, being extra generous, almost got teeth grills 🤣. I don’t know where I am in the bipolar spectrum right now but things are definitely off. It’s past midnight here and I’m being over active on social media. Someone seize my phone now.I don’t even know where to begin. I’m really struggling to get ahead in my career. I want to learn a new high paying skill and before my first manic episode I made some reasonable progress, but I was working two jobs to make ends meet and things were very slow. Now, my brain is shit. I can’t remember a lot of things I used to know and I can’t focus. My doctor doesn’t think I have ADHD but I feel like I have the inattentive type since I am outwardly calm and “put together”. I’m the first child from a culture where you just have to get your shit together so I have an image of being okay and I’m good at pretending. Even my bipolar isn’t “that obvious”. I’m not sure making any sense. I’ve just been crying because I don’t know what to do. I was hypomanic a little while ago and even then, I couldn’t make much progress in getting my shit together and working on my portfolio. I feel like I’m fucked. I come from a poor family. I cannot afford to give up but I’m so fucking tired of feeling like my brain isn’t working. I’m very ambitious, I just don’t know if I’m made for this.When I got manic for the first time, I was at a general women’s ward in the hospital because I just had a surgery and the resident psychiatrist hadn’t reviewed my erratic symptoms. I got discharged against medical advice because I became paranoid but the psychiatrist placed me on a mood stabiliser and antipsychotic medication the day I left so the episode ended shortly after. I’ve managed to stay out of the psych ward till now. My doctor has been recommending admission for the past few appointments and I’m about to give in but I’m scared. What should I expect? Please send encouraging and positive messages to me. I don’t want to talk myself out of getting the help I need.Update: I didn’t go in. I’m spending more money than usual but I’m not sleeping too poorly. Keeping my eye on things myself. Wish me luck even if that’s stupid. 😂. After a depressive episode that lasted nine months, my doctor decided to give me antidepressants. It has triggered hypo mania and I just want to scream. When will the right balance be found? I wish I could slap bipolar in the face.I’ll be honest here and say that I’m only in therapy because it’s recommended. I lost all belief in it helping after I became bipolar. I don’t know if it’s the depression speaking but I don’t feel hopeful that I would come to a place where I can thrive and not be in the shadows of this illness anymore.Talking about my feelings feels like a waste of everyone’s time and using the tools my therapist recommends is so fucking stressful. When I was being managed for depression, therapy actually worked for me. I felt like I could be better and I worked towards achieving that. I guess it was due to the fact that I knew it would end some day. With bipolar, I always have to be in therapy to cope well. Or so they say.I’m not sure I’m going for session next week. I can’t remember the assignment and I honestly don’t want to do it. Am I really going to spend the rest of my life picking out cognitive distortions and reframing the most difficult situations to make myself feel better? I don’t want to.My therapist and literally everything I’ve read on this freaking illness says to keep a routine but it’s so hard for me. I wake up at any time, lose track of day and I can’t help thinking I’m stuck in depression ville for this reason. The only thing I’ve been consistent at is going to the gym. Please share tips and advice on sticking to a routine.My life is horrible. My room is a mess, I can’t bring myself to take a shower. Let’s not get into other aspects of my life. I have no career to speak of or anything to be proud of. I want to disappear.I moved to a new,cheaper city when staying at home became too much to handle in 2021. I got an apartment with my cousin and things are going pretty well. My house feels like a home. The issue here is I’m currently unemployed and may not be able to afford rent on my own soon, not even my portion of the rent. My cousin plans to relocate soon and I have nowhere else to go. Getting another apartment is too expensive for me because I’m broke. My only option is to move back to my parents house in a few months and that’s scares the shit out of me. I also feel like a failure at the thought of this. I’m too old for this.It doesn’t really make sense to me that people aren’t allowed to choose if they want to live or die.I have bipolar disorder and I’ve been in a depressive episode all year. My doctor doesn’t want to prescribe antidepressants because it could cause mania. I read that some mood stabilizers work more for mania, while others work better for depression. Is it possible to combine one for mania and another for depression? Eg carbamazepine and lamotrigine. I’m exhausted from being depressed but I don’t want to get manic. I just don’t think I have it in me to wait it out. Looking forward to reading your responses and suggestions. Thank you.I’ve always wanted my life to look a certain way and before bipolar I was working towards it. It was hard but I was doing it. Now everything has gone to shit. I’ve been unemployed for a year and I’ve been too depressed to function as normal since January. Everyone is worried about me and giving opinions about my life and I absolutely hate it. A family member is trying to pull strings to get me a job but it’s high stress and I just know I can’t function there. I’ll probably get manic and mess things up. I don’t know how to turn the offer down without seeming like I’m lazy and I don’t want to work. I have tried hard to find remote work that is at a slower pace but I’ve not had any luck. Bipolar has ruined my life and self esteem.I have too many disorders and problems. I don’t know how to cope with them. Some days are not so bad but others are horrible and a part of me is always expecting the worst. I have managed to fight for my life till now but it seems to be getting harder. I have no faith in myself anymore or in my life getting better at any point . I feel hopeless and what is life without hope?. I’m really exhausted. I am taking my drugs and trying to stick to my routine but it’s so hard when I don’t even want to be alive. It’s been months and months of this sadness and darkness. Is it normal to be depressed for over eight months? I feel like my life is wasting away.I don’t know how to navigate this awful disease. I’ve been so depressed, I feel like I can’t breathe. The only thing keeping me alive is my best friend’s daily calls. My doctors don’t want to prescribe an antidepressant because of mania but I’m not functioning right. I just want this to be over. Life doesn’t feel worth it.When I try to do anything productive, I feel so anxious and overwhelmed. Someone said I’m probably in freeze mode. Am I just lazy? I’m so tired of not being able to do anything to move my life forward.Sometimes I have mean thoughts about people I love and care about out of nowhere. There’s no violence or anything, I just think mean things like “shut up, idiot” etc. Is this a bipolar thing?. I’m on my first trip out of my country and I’ve been looking forward to it for years but I can’t stop crying. I feel so dead and empty inside. I have cried so much, my head hurts. I feel like kms because my life is so empty. I have nothing else to live for or look forward to.The wiki on drugs has very few posts and I’m so anxious to know what I’m getting into. Yes, we react differently to drugs but I really want to read other people’s experiences. Please respond if you’ve used it before. Thank you.I can’t stop shaking. I feel like I was slappped.Hello, I hope everyone is having a good day.Before my manic episode and bipolar diagnosis, I used to be very disciplined and focused. Now, I find it hard to be consistent at anything no matter how hard I try. I was wondering if this was a common experience.What does stability look like for you?. I was diagnosed with BAD in September and I’ve been on Depakote since then. However, I’ve gained a ton of weight that makes me uncomfortable in my body and affects my mood. Exercise hasn’t helped and dieting is really hard with intense food cravings.I want the meds changed to something weight neutral but my current provider isn’t on board with it. I intend to get a prescription elsewhere but I’m worried I won’t be taken seriously. Is it wrong for a patient to look for a doctor that’ll give them what they want? I’m med compliant and a literal model patient, all I want is to not hate my body simply because I have to treat bipolar disorder.I’ve gained quite a bit of weight since September. I hate my body so much, thanks to Epilim/Depakote. I just left the doctor’s office in tears when he said there are no alternatives. Im pretty sure I’d have gained more weight if I wasn’t exercising and mindful about what I ate to a degree. This sucks. I just might cross from overweight to obese soon.In the middle of my day and I feel the overwhelming urge to cry. I’m so tired and sad. I need a source of income, I want a life I can be proud of. Tired of coasting. Just wanted to rant.I’m feeling more social, more motivated and alive. Not in a manic way though. I’m a little sad I can’t just enjoy the feeling because I’m wary of things going overboard. How are you?. My sleep has been really bad since I switched from Risperidone to Aripiprazole and I’m not seeing my doctor till next Monday. Being manic isn’t fun so I’m fighting against the urge to overextend myself so I don’t end up spiralling. What calming, grounding activities (meditation aside) do you do when you can’t sleep?. I had some coffee a couple of hours ago and I feel very weird. Weightless like I’m hypomanic. What do I do? I don’t want to end up in the hospital.
    every. single. night. i wake up around 3:30 after having a dream my fiancé is done with me. in the dream i am usually having severe mood swings, or begging him to see me through a change, promising to do better. i would think this stemsfrom being insecure about my mental health and how it affects my relationship. my fiancé is completely supportive and loves me. i am medicated and it feels like i have found the right combination. i really just hate these dreams, i wake up so sad and feel that i am alone. then i am glad it was just a dream. i guess i am wondering if anyone else has experienced this? something also weird about this- i am curious and sort of want to be in the dream every night? am i reliving previous trauma and or wanting to experience the trauma again? this is just so weird. thank you.
    Hi guys,I'm a bit nervous as I haven't posted anything on here yet and I have bipolar II and ADHD. I just wanted to share my story and if anyone has any tips or something please let me know. This is alot for me to share so please be kind... 🙏🏽 My boyfriend of 6 years broke up with me and started dating a 22 year old he just met. Since then, I have done alot of crazy things and it's been an emotional roller-coaster. Some of the things I've done I'm not proud of. At the start I was very angry and I think I might have been hypomanic because I was making songs about him saying that he better watch his back and I'll f**k his dad (I didn't lol) and posting them to soundcloud, sending the songs to his friends. I was going out binge drinking every weekend since then and I slept with a few of guys in our friend group to try and get back at him. He has now blocked me on everything and doesn't want to have anything to do with me anymore, understandably I guess. I also impulsively dropped out of my hairdressing school and applied for a visa to move to Canada. I have been going on cruises and holidays with no money and my friends have been paying for my activities etc. which is nice but I ended up getting kicked out of my sharehouse because of it (I missed a week's worth of rent). I then moved in with my grandparents who kicked me out after a week of being there because I came home drunk at 1230am and they said they are too old to help me and I should go to a mental hospital. I was then homeless basically for a week but managed to secure a bed at my work accomodation.Then my friend told me I need to get my shit together and paid for my psychiatrist appointment. Since then I started taking Seroquel along with my antidepressants and ritalin for my ADHD and I have noticed a huge improvement in my mental state. I ended up moving back in with my mum and my relationship with my parents is now better than it ever was before because I'm not constantly in an irritable mood. Now that I've become more stable I feel a bit embarrassed about my actions. But the past couple of days I have been very depressed, not going to work, crying over everything (I was watching the Kardashians and started crying) and I haven't seen my ex at all for ages and all of a sudden I feel like I'm seeing him everywhere but I don't know if it's just my mind playing tricks on me. I've also become attached to one of my ex's friends and kinda fallen for him but he said he doesn't wanna hurt my feelings and doesn't want me to get attached so I guess that means he doesn't like me like that and it's okay I understand because maybe I'm too crazy but then why did he sleep with me?I'm now thinking about writing apology letters to everyone and moving to Canada ASAP when I have enough money lol idk what to do... I'm so over everything 😭.
    Hi all, google didn’t seem helpful, but hopefully someone with a successful and happy relationship can share how they went about telling their significant other about having bipolar disorder. I haven’t had a physical relationship in over a year and haven’t had an emotional one in over two. I got my diagnosis during the latter, so it goes without saying that I didn’t really have to figure how and when to tell her. But now that I am trying to get back into the whole dating game, I can’t think of a situation where explaining I have Bipolar Disorder doesn’t push someone away. Any input, particularly on the when part, is immensely appreciated. Thanks :).
    Instead of going my normal route of complete self sabotage and public tomfoolery, I decided to check myself in to a crisis center at onset of whatever mood I was in. I'm out now, I'll hopefully be back on meds soon, but something is different about this episode. I feel volatile and extra sensitive, which isn't normal for me. I've missed 4 days of work because I don't feel comfortable being around people, in fact tonight I had to pick up some groceries and y'all...I almost cried. I was so overwhelmed by everything, the lights, the people. Idk what's happening to me and I'm panicking. I have to go back to work today and I'm afraid I might make an ass of myself.I work with an office full of scorpios, all November-born, including myself. It's pretty weird to see myself in them so clearly, we all play the same games, silently in competition, it's like Game of Thrones in there. It made me wonder about how other scorpios interact with each other. Have you ever had a conflict with another scorpio or do you tend to get along? Have you ever been in a relationship with a fellow scorpio, how'd that go?. Everytime I read through the subreddit I'm perplexed by how many of you have significant others. No offense to anyone here, it just baffles me as a 25 year old man living with bipolar 1, how the hell y'all managed to find someone who puts up with you? Furthermore, how were you able to get past the paranoia and delusional thinking in the beginning stages of a relationship? The whole process leads me to overthinking, and that stresses me out, then I get hyper, and then I crash. Is the only answer medication and therapy?. I've noticed a pattern in relation to potential lovers, friends where if I start feeling a genuine, vulnerable sense of connection it triggers a "firewall". For context, I have alot of prominent scorpio placements, sun, moon, Venus, mid-heaven and chiron, all together in the 10th house. The problem is that I catch feelings obscenely quick, and they are intense, which has a tendency to scare people off and, in turn, scares me as well. So I've developed a coping mechanism where if I feel like I've been too open I shell up, become cold and distant as a defense mechanism, and admittedly wait in my shell to see if anyone knocks...they never do, and if they did, I'm not sure I'd even open up. How do I deal with this?. I experienced a sudden moment of clarity about how apparent my bipolar is in the workplace and I'm mortified. Either they get the nice workhorse, the uncooperative grumpy cat, or some mixture of the two. I haven't taken my Latuda since late January and to no fault of my own either, my psychiatrist took a very long vacation, I forgot to reschedule. In the meantime I've attempted to build a routine around work thinking that would keep me stable. Spoilers: >!It did not!<. Staying with a job for more than 6 months with less than 20 call outs is a personal record. My coworkers are nice but we're still young (early to late 20's) and prone to--how do I say this nicely?... Immature social dynamics. So the office being eerily reminiscent of Highschool and the utterly Sisyphean nature of our work hasn't provided the proper stimulus my brain needs. Meaning that I'm barely conscious for most of the week, zoned all the way out, keeping my head down and doing my job. Apparently work too hard and may have unintentionally rubbed my co-workers the wrong way. So now I focus on pulling back, taking breaks and just fucking off to my corner when the demand isn't too high but they don't like that either. It's begs the question where do I settle, or rather who the hell else is hiring...My mom has been going through it recently, between car issues and the death of her God mother, she's been cycling pretty bad. She's been making some impulsive moves lately that I tried to talk her out of but she persists. How can I be of assistance while staying mindful of my own mental health?.
    Hello, it seems that I have been more or less so officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder as I seem to be going through a manic episode according to my therapist. I have already done things like drinking (never drank before), walking in the dark at 3am, snapping at those I love, sending delusional messages to people, getting F's in all my courses, not sleeping, having an intense urge to shop, almost broke up with my boyfriend, etc.... I have had intense depressive episodes and some short week long bursts of euphoria but never a mixed manic episode (apparently that's what my therapist is calling it) such as this one. I feel incapable of controlling myself at times and I was wondering if anyone who has dealt with bipolar disorder longer than me has any advice to help me get through this. Thank you.. I was put on abilify and I hate it. It makes me feel like a zombie and all I do is sleep and eat on it. I have the attention span of a goldfish and I hardly feel real excitement. Everything feels meh. Not great, not bad, just meh. Is this what normal feels like? Meh? Well my psychiatrist is changing my medication to olanzapine and instead of going to get it I’m just gonna go cold turkey for a bit. No abilify, no anything. I miss having emotions.I just barely started learning Spanish and I was wondering if there are any resources on campus or just in general that anyone knows about. I can’t take classes cause I’ve already finished my language requirement in another language and I have wayyy to many classes to fit it in. Thank you!. And my abilify is giving me horrible side effects like dizziness, blurriness, sleepiness, tingling, paranoia, etc… it’s the only pill that’s worked so far at keeping my mood stable tho 😭😭😭. I was thinking about selling edits of posters and things of that sort and selling printable downloads. But I do not know much about how to start selling downloads. Would you guys recommend it and does it sell well?. Was on vacation for a week and some people liked my stuff and I decided to go through most of them and give them offers. Lost three followers in a few hours 🙃 No more offers for me.So I was really into manifestation and Neville’s teachings for a few months but ultimately got overwhelmed and dropped it. Lately I started an online shop. I was selling items like once a week. Well I thought to myself “what if I just try it out again and see if I can get more sales.” I closed my eyes and imagined myself packaging multiple orders, I then let it go and focused on other things. Well in the past 24 hours I sold 5 items! I was getting a bunch of interactions and I actually close it down for the rest of the week cause I’m gonna be on vacation. I have never had such an obvious manifestation it was crazy!Also an extra story:I did not sign up soon enough to get an assigned room for college. I was basically depressed and planning to take a gap year at that point. But I decided I wanted to go to college this year. In my mind despite everyone thinking I wasn’t going to get a room thought, “somehow imma get a room” and imagined it as a single for just myself. There was more news coming out that tons of students were not getting housing like freshmans (I’m a senior). I kept faith and still felt I was gonna get a room and was telling everyone that despite the news being different. Well I got my room! And not only a room but a single exactly where I wanted to be! I’m so absolutely ecstatic!. So I just started a Depop, most of the clothes are my old stuff along with some family members. Thought I'd try to sell them online for a decent price. But recently, I have been going to the thrift stores (as I've always loved to thrift) and noticing some items I know can go for more or reach a specific audience. I've bought a few items and am reselling them for what I believe to be good prices, but there is some guilt gnawing at me. When I went to a thrift store today there were resellers buying tons and tons of clothing in bulk till they had piles of clothing. When I thought of being associated to them I felt immediate guilt. I was thinking about getting into reselling but now I'm questioning it. Has anyone else felt guilty or questioned the ethics of reselling items?. They are back!!! Surprisingly, Poshmark responded to me in the same day and told me my account was temporarily flagged due to me responding to comments about sending photos to people’s emails. Super happy I’m back and getting a lot of likes!. I just got two interested buyers and when I went back to the app all my listings, notifications, and buyers were gone! I'm really confused. I just uploaded a bunch of stuff last night as this is the first time I used the app. Is this a glitch or am I banned?. What was your experience like? Any difficulties? Thinking I might need the emotional support from one of my pets when I’m on campus.Edit: To clarify I do fall under support for disability. Also, I would be bringing a cat.I closed my eyes for a brief second and saw a vivid image of two translucent hands cradling the earth. The skies were a gorgeous mixture of purple. I felt that these hands knew me inside and out. I then saw an image of one of the hands piercing the earth with a large stick. The fear inside of me became immense. I'm not entirely sure as to what this means but perhaps I control this stick from piercing the earth is what I've thought. Maybe it represents something else.So I noticed that my dog (11 year-old Shih-Tzu) used to look a bit more fit. But now her belly is hanging more and all she thinks about is food. When she isn’t barking for food she’s licking us constantly (don’t know if that’s apart of this but feels like it). I started giving her less amount of food (when I feed her) such as just kibble and hardly any wet food, hardly any table food, and taking her on walks more. But she still begged for food constantly. Found out my parents give her tons of food when they feed her, table food (even food she’s allergic too), and different dog snacks in a day. I’ve talked to them about it but all they say is she should be spoiled. My dogs getting older and less and less active so I’m just worried about her becoming even larger and the consistent licking is worse than ever before. Does anyone have any ideas about what I should do or possibly change in my actions? Or is there nothing I can do and this is apart of her age?. So I have been meeting with a psychiatrist and therapist (have also met with multiple physiatrist at the hospital) and nobody can exactly pinpoint what is going on. They've thought it could possibly be bipolar, BPD, C-PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, to now Schizoaffective disorder. Years ago I had a diagnosis of OCD, severe depression, and dermatillomania, but I went through CBT and am doing much better from OCD symptoms. I've felt like I've gotten plot twist after plot twist and it seems like everyone is scratching their heads like, "What the heck is going on?" I just seem to have a variety of symptoms that span a lot of different mental illnesses and my medication has been changing consistently. I've dealt with side effects from medications such as heartburn, allergic reactions, dizziness, and grogginess. Kind of feel like a science experiment at this point lol. Shits been difficult to say the least. It's pretty isolating not knowing exactly what is wrong with me and having such a long history of mental illness. I was wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar where they got everything but the kitchen sink thrown at them in terms of diagnosis. How did you guys deal with it? Did you ever find the right medication? Did you end up getting a diagnosis? If so, how long did it take and how did you feel when you finally got the right diagnosis? Hoping that I can find some people who relate.. I'm seriously starting to feel that I want a mental disorder so then I can have an excuse for myself and make things easier in my life. I have been diagnosed but I'm starting to feel that I'm making up all the symptoms and only doing them so I can fit a diagnosis. I keep getting diagnosed with more disorders so I'm starting to think that these are not true because there is no way I have that many disorders. I have to be making it up as I go. I feel like it's only a matter of time before I start seeing symptoms for the next mental illness because I will create the symptoms or I will try to follow a list of symptoms to get a diagnosis. I think that by thinking I have a mental disorder things are only going to get worse because I am reaffirming that I have a mental illness, thus making it real. I keep looking at stuff about people with mental disorders and I feel that I'm going to become one of them if I don't be careful and all this research is starting to rub off on me more. I am going to stop taking my antidepressants now because I think it's just trying to make me feel worse. I'm scared I'm becoming schizophrenic because I'm just getting diagnosed with one disorder after another and I feel like because I'm looking at all this stuff I am therefore ensuring that I get that disorder in the future. I've been scaring people with the way I've been acting but I don't know how to stop. I'm starting to almost feel like I should end things before I make myself more mentally ill. I AM MAKING MYSELF MENTALLY ILL. I can feel myself getting new disorders. I wanted to research to know what my therapist and the doctors were telling me I might have but now I'm feeling like it's done more harm than good. I feel like other people in my life think I'm mentally ill because of the random breakdowns I have. But they don't understand. They don't have my mind. I can tell everyone is starting to lose patience with me. It's only a matter of time before they all fucking get tired of me and I run out of excuses. I feel like I've just been rotting and obsessing over my mental health and not doing anything about it. I don't want to be taken to the psych ward again. Last time they wouldn't let me out and it was scary. I can't fucking do this anymore. I'm done with treatment. I need to fucking man up. Get my shit together. I keep making excuses. They're gonna be so mad when they found out how late I'm staying up. They're losing their patience. I can tell. I don't know how much longer they are going to allow me to act like this. I feel like I'm making myself going fucking insane but I don't know how to stop. At this point I want to be like this. I'm doing this to myself. What the fuck even is mental illness. This shit can't even be real. At what point do we keep excusing people for their actions. Life is hard. Get the fuck over it. I can't live like this. Jesus Christ help me. I'M MAKING MYSELF INSANE. I don't want to get better. I want excuses. I want an easier life.I’ve been diagnosed with a few mental disorders in the past but lately I think that I don’t have those illnesses anymore. I feel that due to me being 18, I am dealing with teenage hormones and that is why I do things that are “off.” I think that I’m just overreacting and that I’m making myself mentally I’ll at this point. I’m convinced I’m somehow acting this all out despite my mind not fully understanding how that is working. I think I’m using mental Illness as a crutch to act the way I do, thus I’m not changing because the doctors are telling me that I have certain mental illnesses when I don’t and I’m believing them so I’m acting like I have it. Yes, I do odd things, but everyone has quirky little things they do or random fears. I’ve been fine and I think I act mentally I’ll because I like the excuses it gives me and the pity. I dropped out of my semester in college and didn’t do any of the work. I think this whole time I’ve been trying to convince myself that I’m mentally ill so I have an excuse for the way I’m acting. One doctor said she can’t diagnose me with a new disorder that my therapist was saying I might have because she doesn’t have enough information and I’m young. I was angry but I think it was because now I don’t have an excuse for my actions. I’m tired of this. I want to stop pretending I’m mentally I’ll and get my life together because it’s been fine before. I’m almost starting to believe that mental illness is a false idea as well. We just give people excuses for their actions. At what point is enough enough. I’m tired of doctors acting like I’m a severe case. I’m not. I think they are just so used to people acting in a certain way that I’m just acting a little out of the usual. I don’t even know if I fully believe what I’m saying or this too is a coverup to seem more mentally ill. Like maybe this whole rant is only to make myself seem like I’m mentally I’ll or have a certain disorder.Why am I still alive? What the fuck. I'm a lazy fucking dumbass who just wastes away during the day. It seems like I'm constantly blaming my depression on something and excusing it for the way I act. In reality I'm just a sensitive fuck who only cares about myself. When I finally think I'm getting better suddenly I'm depressed and thinking of suicide again. I can't keep living like this. It's been years of this constant on and off. I dropped out of college for the time being and it's just this constant back and forth from I'm feeling good to I'm feeling like shit. I had a narcissistic fucking ex who treated me like shit but for some reason every time I think about him I cry. I'm fucking terrified of the idea of seeing him in town and bumping into him, I feel like I would just break down. But at the same time I was an asshole to him too. I randomly would get angry at him, I'd start crying out of nowhere, he once gave me gifts and I slammed the door in his face, when he finally opened up to me about his insecurities I called him every name in the book and told him that he was causing me to stop eating. I was horrible. I still am. I feel like it's only a matter a time before I start doing those things again to other people and my current boyfriend. I'm a disgusting person and I don't deserve to live. I hate myself but at the same time I'm obsessed with myself because I always make myself out to be the victim. I wish I'd just die. I wish I had the guts to go through with it. I'm so tired. It's been years. I can't do this anymore. I tried overdosing but like a cowered I stopped myself from taking too many. I don't want to be a coward anymore. The biggest gift I could give to people is my death to save them from the eventual harm I'll give them in the future.Man….. I went to the hospital recently (more like forced) because I was planning on committing suicide by the end of this month. After the hospital visit it seemed like things were looking up but I just hit an all time low. I literally have trouble just getting out of bed and I don’t eat until around 9. I just sit and scroll on my computer for hours and skip all of my classes. I have trouble caring about anything. I feel like it’s only a matter of time before I lose all my connections and although my boyfriend says he’s here for me I feel extremely guilty. I want to be alone. I don’t want to be anyone else’s problem and I fear that if I don’t leave him soon he will grow to have disdain towards me. I’m tired. It’s been 6 years of depression and I just feel like I can’t do this anymore. I don’t care anymore. Everything takes so much energy and I despise it. I wish I could just die already. I’m so fucking tired. I want my pills and I want to overdose.I’m ready to do it.Update: I was about to go out for my last meal but then my boyfriend wanted to tag along. He noticed something was wrong. I can’t do it today, he’s talking to me right now and I feel calmed down.I have multiple mental disorders which have made life a living hell for me. It feels like it's getting at times only for it to come crashing down so suddenly. I lived with consistent anxiety before but now I feel numb to everything. I've started doing things that could cause health problems in the future and everyday just feels the same no matter what. The only thing that brings me joy is the idea that it will be all over soon. Today, I cuddled with my boyfriend and he asked me if I was ok and I said yes. I feel guilty holding him and being affectionate with him, knowing that I will not be around soon. I feel like breaking up with him so I can be left alone and feel less guilty about leaving him behind. I'm so tired. I skip my classes, stopped caring about my grades, and can't even imagine a future for myself anymore. Any dream or goal I had just feels so meaningless and doesn't give me excitement. I have a suicide plan written out and I have been following it. I've known for many years that I would end my life at some point. I have fully lost hope. I plan on stopping my meds and I have opted out of therapy. I feel content in my decision, in giving up. I honestly have no desire to change like before. I plan on going through with it by the end of this month.I have written out everything about how I'm going to do it and everything else that has to do with my death. I plan go through with this next month. I've had enough of struggling throughout these years with severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. I think I am ready to end it now. I feel calm looking at my plan, like it will be over soon. I won't have to deal with this pain anymore. I won't have to continue being the person I am. She'll be gone. I've attempted a few times before and played with suicide but now it feels real. Like really real. I feel numb honestly. I'm mostly just scared about what lies beyond death, nothing else really. Everyday I think about it and wish I had the guts to just fully go through with it, but now I do. I've fully planned out the last day. It's coming up. Weirdly enough, this is the most excited I've felt in almost a year. It's time. Everyone has a choice to whether they live or die and this is my choice. Finally.Trigger warning: Mentions of suicide and self-harmHello guys, I woke up quite late today and was very depressed. I have fallen into a slump lately, I'm doing the bare minimum to get by in my classes when in high school I was a straight A student among many other things and I was happy. Though now I wake up extremely late now, skip my classes, stopped going to the gym, eat like crap, and stay up till 3 am every night. Working towards my goals have been tiring me out, to the point I don't even apply for things I want to apply for. This has led me towards self-harm at the anger of what I've become and suicidal thoughts everyday. I was thinking though today about all the things I love about my life, like the new people I've met, my family, how I've gotten out of my shell and try tons of new things. I want to continue having these amazing experiences, but my laziness has made me extremely depressed. I know that my depression is something that I'm doing to myself right now and it is not out of my reach to fix it. The question is, how do I change now? What are some things that have helped you get out of an extreme slump of laziness? Cause it's not that I want to commit suicide because I hate my life, it's because I want to get rid of the person I've become.. I don't know who to talk to so I guess I'll post here to get this off my mind. I have been self-harming on and off but now it's becoming more frequent and I believe that it's come back into my life again. I had a huge meltdown over an essay. I'm in college and I used to be an extremely well performing student, at the top of my class. But lately I just feel like shit and my grades have been dropping more and more. I new that I was being lazy, procrastinating on my essay till the day it was due. I got so angry I started punching, slapping, biting, slamming my face against the desk, and scratching myself. I called a hotline because I thought I might get to the point of attempting suicide. They then said that because I had harmed they would have to call an ambulance and I panicked (they didn't end up sending it). I have now done it again, getting my whole arm scratched up and I'm scared because I have a date tomorrow and I don't want to somehow accidentally show him. I just feel guilt, guilt for what I've done in the past to my friends and my previous boyfriend, and how lazy I've become. I feel useless and disgusting lately. I feel like those in my past absolutely hate me and I understand why. The other night I became so frustrated with myself that I took a knife from the kitchen and tried to get the guts to stab myself in the arm. I'm too scared to die, so this is the best escape I have. My life looks good on the outside, with new friends, going out every weekend, being active in clubs, and dating someone new. But in reality I'm borderline suicidal and I like to torture myself mentally and physically. It's hard keeping this up. I don't know how much longer I can live like this.It seems that no matter how hard I try my mind is always thinking about death. My life doesn't seem too bad right now, but I can't help but feel that I'm trying to fend off the inevitable, that someday I'm going to crack and go through with ending my life. I've dealt with random outburst and mental illness my whole life, suicide has always been that idea that lingers in my mind. I've tried to attempt a few times, but that didn't get me anywhere and although I'm frightened in the moment when there's a possibility of death, when it ends I just want to do it again. I thought I was doing fine, that life was finally looking up until I had a complete outburst and harmed myself and almost swallowed a handful of sleeping pills a few days ago. It's terrifying, thinking that everything is going great one moment to wanting to cause myself immense harm in a matter of minutes. I can't trust myself. I've ruined good things in my life due to my random outburst and depression. I lost my friends and my boyfriend. I can't get over the guilt of what I've done. Everyday I think about what I did even though it has been 7 months. Even though I had what I had wanted for so long, it didn't stop my depression and instead I hurt others, not just myself this time. I'm scared. I went to the hospital a few months ago and I don't want to go back. This time if I go through, I want to fully go through with this. I'm in college now, finally living out what was supposed to be my ultimate dream. I have the friends now too and go out often. But it's still not fulfilling. It never is. Is this how it's always going to feel? Constantly wishing for something more? Feeling depressed even though you supposedly have everything. I can't continue to live like this. I just want it to end.Anywhere I can buy a real decorative plant for my room near ucsd?. I seem to have left my blue hydro flask at the Robinson building complex (more towards the front). If anyone finds it could you please contact me where to get it? Thanks.Uhhh so you guys do know that if the strike ends up working tuition is going to be raised for undergrads. Ucs aren’t getting any money from the state right now to pay grad students more so that’s what’s probably gonna happen. Ucs already cost more than some private universities and I literally cannot pay anymore. But most likely TAs aren’t gonna get everything they want and are gonna have to let go some demands. Just want people to think about it, especially undergrads cause we’ll probably be the ones paying for it the most. Imma delete this later cause I already know I’m gonna get hate. I think those that are struggling the most (living in homeless shelters) should definitely get more help from uc, but overall… idk. Seems like it’ll just cause everyone else to go more in debt.So the strike is going on and a few of my lectures are canceled. Im basically done with midterms (other work is due online) and one of my classes still has lecture but has it recored but the other one doesn't record it. I've been struggling with some serious depression and homesickness and just want to go home for break already but live far away. Should I just go home now for Thanksgiving break? Or is there a possibility the strike will end soon?. Hello, pretty sure I left my brown bear face pencil case in price center. Lmk if you’ve seen it please. Also might’ve lost it at mosaic. One of the two places. I’ve had this pencil case since middle school so I’d really like it back.I've been wanting to practice my Japanese (I've been learning it for a few years but still not close to being fluent...) and I was wondering if there is anything on campus I can join to speak it and practice my language skills.So I'm a first year transfer student and I've been having trouble getting any type of help for my classes or schedule. I've been hearing from fellow transfers now that I'm taking the wrong MMW class for ERC (cause apparently I should be taking something else other than MMW 11) and I have no idea what to do or how to contact advising about this because each email I send my question to just tells me basically that they can't help me and I have to talk to someone else. Any other transfers dealing with this and overall feeling annoyed with how UCSD treats us? I'm pretty confused about my schedule and everything now and don't know where to get help.Hi everyone! It's been a bit difficult at times to keep a completely positive mindset about this but my journey in a month has been absolutely magnificent! I'm positing about this to help myself stay motivated and now that everything I desire truly is mine. My life has changed so much for what it seems like overnight! I have been testing the law with smaller things for weeks and have even manifested some bigger things! Here are some of the things I've manifested-\-Old friends coming back (told myself that everyone comes back to me). I've had friends that I haven't talked to in a month to over a year come back!\- Manifested money (very unexpected. Came from a family member who had never done something like that before)\-Coffee (many times)\-Good self concept and overall lots of happiness! (even manifested a mental illness away)\-Hair looking good\-A cat visiting the house multiple times\-A pink pen\-And lots of compliments!This isn't even everything and I have become a firm believer in the law through these things. I feel like I'm already on the bridge of incidents to one of my most desired manifestations (sp of course hehe) even though I cannot physically observe the progress. I've even been trying revising and it has given me peace of mind (was able to bring back a friend due to that). To anyone second guessing the law I'm here to tell you it works! And this is coming from someone who had firm beliefs in other things. To anyone feeling like giving up do not! Remember to keep calm and stay in the state that everything you desire and who you want to become has already happened and is yours.So basically I've been starting manifestation and I was really believing in it and seeing how I had unconsciously followed it before in my life. But I have been coming across the phrase "I am god" and it has been making me uneasy. I was thinking of it more like I can manifest my desires but God (not me) leads me to these desires to manifest. So like it's kind of my own will but kind of not and also the things that happen between manifestations (just everyday ordinary circumstances) are controlled by God. Though I've been hearing that you have to get rid of any type of outside force other than yourself. But is it ok to continue in my way of thinking? I don't really see how that would halter my progress as long as I truly believe in my manifestation. Because in the end I have manifested before and some pretty big things while holding onto my belief of an outside God.So basically I've been starting manifestation and I was really believing in it and seeing how I had unconsciously followed it before in my life.

    I'm having a difficult time at work and I've received a warning and an investigation into my poor quality. Looking like they may decide to let me go within the next few days. It's a big manufacturing facility. I have never disclosed my bipolar disorder with HR but I've considered doing it if it can potentially help save your job in the short term. Has anyone gone through this process and did it help? Thank you.When kramer eventually sends george to Joe's to buy his fruit, george comes back with about 5 or 6 bags full( 5 mangos, plums with red on the inside, avacadoes, looks like he has a watermelon) and says he owes him $28.60. How much do you think that much fruit would cost in today's money?. Recently rewatched a bunch of old episodes. I know this was supposed to be kind of a sad episode since Lenny's daughter died, but does anyone else get completely disgusted at the judge when watching this episode? I know it's just a TV show but the 3 brats on trial got off punishment free. And the judge was pretty much okay with them manipulating the autistic girl. I had to stop and go take a walk after this episode. I often watch law and order when trying to relax and saw a good episode that deals with bipolar disorder(season 8 episode 9). After some investigation you find out that the main suspect is bipolar and his grandfather is also bipolar. The grandfather hides his mental illness from everyone and also doesnt want anyone to know the kid is bipolar. You soon learn that both can appear "normal" at times and at times are very quick to anger. I thought it did a good job in showing the denial that sometimes comes up about mental illness. The grandfather's actor did a great job of showing some of the behaviors that people with bipolar have. I thought I would share this in case other people found it interesting.I live in Massachusetts and was able to get on our state health insurance plan recently, since I am not working right now. I have a chronic illness that I take meds for and will require regular doctor visits the rest of my life. I am able to work, but am starting to feel very defeated when it comes to looking for work. when you report no income, all of those health expenses(and they can add up) come down to next to nothing when you're on mass health. And you also pay nothing when you're on a plan and have no income. But if I go out and get a fill time job, I'm back dealing with private insurance which I have done before. Most companies you're paying around 200 a month for insurance plus the cost of prescriptions/labwork. I have done mostly general labor/warehouse jobs which are never very high paying. If you have a certain amount of income at the end of the year, you are hit with 1600 dollar tax penalty. Our Healthcare system really leaves me feeling stuck at times and you can understand why a lot of people just don't work. There is not much incentive to get out and make 15 bucks an hour and have so much taken away just to have medical expenses covered, when if you report no income you are free and clear. I have always watched seinfeld on reruns and have never really watched the whole series in order until it was on Netflix. After going through the whole series I really enjoyed season 4 and how they tried to have so much continuity between the episodes. The storyline of the pilot really tied the whole season together. There were also some of the series best episodes in this season(the bubble boy, the contest, junior mint). It felt like in season 4 each of the main 4 characters was written perfectly and they really found their stride for the rest of the series, even though season 3 has a lot of good episodes too. I have been receiving treatment from a psychiatrist and a therapist for bipolar for over ten years. I found that it was easy to find a good therapist but I have gone through 3 psychiatrists and have had issues with all of them. My current psychiatrist is very knowledgeable and I feel like he makes good decisions, but he is incredibly disorganized and hard to reach on the phone. My other ones were so eager to push medications on you and I was given meds that made me manic and ended up in the hospital. Why is it hard to find a really good psychiatrist? Is it just a field of medicine that really good doctors don't want to get into? I think that there is probably so much liability involved when you are dealing with patients that are mentally unstable. And we also don't have reliable and one size fits all treatments for a lot of disorders. Maybe they don't want the added stress and get into a different field. I have been seeing my current psychiatrist for over 6 years and have made great progress with him. He was the first one to diagnose me as bipolar and to start treating with lithium which has been my most effective treatment. I'm thankful for that, and thankful that he has provided me some reliefBut the entire time of my treatment he is incredibly difficult to reach, outside of my primary appointment times. When I need prescriptions filled he often doesn't respond to the pharmacy, and doesn't get back to me until a few days later. I leave messages and have the pharmacy send a fax. I have had times where he filled a prescription that I don't even take anymore. Right now I have been trying to update my insurance with him, as I can't get my current meds without doing that step. There is nothing more I can do on my end to make things easierAt what point do you consider seeing someone else. And what's the easiest way to go about that?. I recently rewatched season 4 and I forgot how many funny moments are jam packed into the pick episode. I feel like every scene is a classic. Especially when newman comes in for ten seconds just to confirm that he saw a nipple. Or george getting back together with Susan to immediately realize it's a mistake. Top ten episode for me, maybe even top 5. Does anyone else agree upon rewatching years later?. So I have had long stretches where I have held down a full time job and been on private insurance, but the last two months I have not been working and had to get on Masshealth(I live in MA). I have had to do this once before when i haven't been able to work due to my illness. When I have worked for private companies, most of the time I was paying close to 200 dollars a month for just the insurance. I am on lithium and latuda. Which can get expensive every time you pick up meds. On top of that you have co-pays for doctor visits, and for lab work. I'm sure other people on this sub share similar frustrations with the costs. When you are unemployed and on the state Healthcare, you pay next to nothing for insurance, the meds become a whole lot cheaper, and usually there's no copay. I am thankful that I'm able to get coverage but the system is still extremely flawed. I REALLY want to get back to work. I want to be stable and able to hold down a full time job and live the "American dream". I want to earn a paycheck and also get out on a good routine every day. But why should I work if I'm consistently set back financially for having bipolar? There's almost no legitimate way to get around it. I recently had an increase in my lithium dose and I feel like it's made a difference In terms of a racing heartrate. Obviously anyone can feel like that when they have anxiety but it has gotten worse the past few weeks.tremors in my hands have gotten worse too. My doctor ordered an EKG just to make sure there is nothing else wrong. Has anyone else gone through similar feelings with lithium?. My psychiatrist wants to start me on latuda. I have been on lithium and a small dose of celexa for years that has kept me relatively stable. But I am struggling lately. Anyone have experience being on lithium and latuda?. First of I want to say that I'm thankful for psychiatrists and for what we have now compared to years ago. There are treatments out there and they do help a lot of peopleHowever, everytime I have to adjust my medications it feels like the doctors are just playing a guessing game. They don't really know how a lot of the meds work and what the effects are gonna be. I recently had my lithium dose raised and now my heart is pounding, and my hands are shaking like crazy. I'm being sent to my primary care for an EKG. I would think in 2022 doctors would have a better sense as to how the meds are going to effect people. I have been going through the whole series on Netflix and I never realized how influential the busboy episode was. In terms of how there were always intertwining storyline that come together at the end of each episode. In this case it's Elaine's boyfriend running into the bus boy in the hallway. And larry david took off with that idea on curb your enthusiasm. Had to go to a family gathering about 2 hours away today. Between the anxiety of highway traffic and then feeling motion sick after going through windy roads I was wreck by the time I got there. felt as though I was agitated and on the verge of feeling manic. I think it's also that feeling of being confined in one space that brings me anxiety. After a good stretch of weeks for my moods I felt very discouraged. Does anyone else feel as though long drives are a real trigger for them?. I hear this more and more from people to describe the labor shortage. People do want to work, they just want to stop being treated like a number on a spreadsheet. I worked for our local supermarket chain and I also worked in bigger corporate environments. At the local company, managers took an interest in getting to know you. They understood that work is not the only thing going on in your life. They resist a lot of automation, which really me feel like I was valued more. And at the end of the day I wasn't miserable so I was more motivated to stay and work overtime. People do still want to work; if anything a lot of people are working harder than ever.I recently had an increase in my lithium dose because my levels were low on my last labwork. I have been on lithium for years and have had occasional shakiness/tremors in my hands, but now it seems I'm having that feeling all over my body. It seems to come and go, and is often worse at nighttime. Is this normal with an increase in the dosage? Has anyone else experienced something similar? thank you. First of all, I am very thankful that over the years I have found a combination of medications that keeps me relatively stable compared to me at my worst. And I'm thankful that new treatments are always developed. But I have some frustration with the meds and psychiatry in general and I'm wondering if anyone else shares these feelings. So I'm a 28 year old guy and I have had many different meds since I was 18. Every time there has been a change I have had major side effects. And psychiatrists often have no idea what side effects you will have or whether that med will work for you. And I'm not an expert about how the medications work, but I know that doctors are even unclear about how a lot of them work. I know that lithium was kind of a fluke in how it was developed in terms of psychiatric uses. I know the brain is obviously really complicated but why does treating bipolar just seem like such a guessing game in 2022? So many other illnesses have much more accurate treatments, is because they are more profitable for the medical industry?. I'm currently looking for a new job as I've had some medical difficulties where I couldn't work for 6 months. Had an interview question yesterday that really made me shake my head at our entire system and big companies in general. The interviewer said ,"So besides our benefits and our hourly wage, why do you really want to work here?" Keep in mind this is a pest control company. A job that almost NOBODY wants to do, and those who are able to do it most definitely know it's a brutal job. We work to support ourselves, and to take care of our families and medical needs. It is a means to an end. Work is NOT the most important thing in people's lives. If we get something else out of a job or learn things along the way then it is just icing on the cake. I accept that you have to start at the bottom, but stop acting like you're looking for people to rise up the ranks and really make a living with a labor type of job. I'm willing to do hard labor to make ends meet, but don't expect people to be passionate about breaking their back to line the company's pockets.Im a 28 year old guy currently looking for work. There have been times due to my illness that I have not been able to work. So my employment history and my resume is not the greatest. I was recently on an interview and I had questions about their insurance, and the interviewer responded with "why, do you have some medical problems that need to be taken care of?" I was so aggravated by this question that I really did a bad job the whole rest of the interview. Medical needs are supposed to be confidential and if youre going to use that against me in the hiring process then nobody will want to work for you. Anybody else had a similar experience?.
    We come alone, we go alone? I am officially dying alone. My last attempt to possibly believe that someone would genuily liked me vanished today. I have been dating this guy for around 8 months, he met me in the worst scenario of my life and became like my best friend, I'm currently very sensitive because I was fired of my job, lose a family member, I am in a terrible mental place ranging from depression to being manic, living with parents and being broke, during the first months everything was fantastic and I was in love but he started to became bitter and bitter and bitter saying me everyday I was a loser, I was worthless and that I was 30 years and had no relationship nor kids. Today was our last conversation where he told me I was a piece of trash and told me he has been talking circa 30 women. Now my mind keeps telling me that that was true. I am so deppressed. I can say today was a good day, a little bit of anxiety but overall fine. After spending the whole night analizing what can I change and what can I not change. I had an "A-ha" moment where I realized the only one to blame for my past and present is ME! I am stucked in a wave of self pity and victimization that only leads me to the wrong people. What had I done to myself? What had I done to my body? And most important what had I done with my time? Realizing I'm not a child anymore, I am a grown up human being. I am making changes and adjusting my life to them because I deserve it. Every rejection, ghosting and one worded answer was my own fault, I am tired of self sabbotaging myself this way. I let myself being fat, ugly, unemployed and crazy. I have to deal with this terrible illness during all my life but I don't want it to be an impediment to achieve my dreams. I am tired of wasting my time on dating apps, gaming and shit. I am valuable, I have achieved so much, I am not defeated, maybe I have this mental illness but I shouldn't let the world to know. I'm tired of telling everyone my life, people don't care nor they will do anything to help you, I am tired of being a burden to my family and not being self sufficient and blaming everyone for my disgrase. Yes I'm mentally ill, yes I'm manic right now but I have figured out that journaling everything on here will help me during my depressive episodes. And also would help me to REMEBER I AM STRONG AND IF I DID IT ONCE, I CAN DO IT TWICE. Thank you everyone for your support and compassion on this community. Everyone of you are in my heart. The positivity of everyone of here is fantastic. Thank you very much..
    Giving myself permission to take it easy today.Always been super hard on myself. Wanted to get a ton done today but didn’t. My anxiety was really high and I couldn’t concentrate enough to study. Usually I beat myself up on days like this. But instead I allowed myself to take a day off. This is huge for me. Especially not beating myself up.Just wanted to share. Seems like I’m making great strides in my mental health recently. Happy Halloween!. I’ve been using nicotine most of my life. Used to be smoking, but now it’s pouches. Discovered it makes me more anxious and messes with my mood.It will be hard the first few days, but I want to be as stable as possible. I don’t want nicotine addiction to mess up my life.What has your experience been with quitting nicotine? Has it improved your life? Was it hard to quit? This will be hard because I love nicotine. But I love being stable more. Looking forward to reading everyone’s experiences!. I am going to finish my software development program (The Odin Project) and begin applying to jobs 6 months from today. April 30, 2024. It will be difficult doing this while working full time. But I’m done not putting in the work.I have an opportunity to change my life. I will do this. I will make another post once I complete the program. It starts now.I see a therapist, do EMDR, meditate, take my meds, and usually exercise. I’m wondering if there is something I could do that I’m missing.I’m also sober from everything but nicotine in the form of nicotine pouches. Currently lying in bed with my anxiety pumping through my veins.Is anxiety a normal part for life? I hate the feeling of it. But maybe I need to accept that sometimes I’m just going to be anxious. What is everyone’s thoughts on this?. Had a rough day today. Got confused when my training was for my new job (it was today) and I missed it. I wanted to drink, smoke, watch porn but I didn’t. I got a haircut, got new tires, and worked on my coding. Wanted to brag on myself because this is very new behavior for me. Guess the EMDR really is changing me.I’m learning software development. Im discovering just how greatly useful the command line is. Im looking for a book that I can become an expert on it. Thanks!. Sleep is very important to us bipolar people. I have used it in the past and it really helpedThinking about renewing my subscription. 30 bucks a month isn’t cheap, but I think it would be a good investment Anyone here use a whoop? What has your experience been with it? Do you think it’s worth it?. So I took a low paying security job because the schedule allows me to get my web development studying in before work. It’s ok to have a crappy job if I’m moving towards a better life right? I just second guess myself.I self published a book through Amazon. For a long time nothing happened. But I think it’s starting to get traction. Guess word of mouth does work. I’m excited about what could happen in the future. Hopeful. Wanted to share. To more book reviews!. Doing security work. Really chill. Sit down most of the time. Starts at 4 pm. Works because I’m studying web development. Can get a lot done. Not a forever job but definitely good for now.

I heard GitHub contributions look great on a resume for future full stack developer jobs. I want to start asap but don’t know where to start since my knowledge is so little. Thanks. I can study way easier now. Kinda like a cheat code.I’ve been meditating very consistently for an hour a day. Tonight after meditating, something subtly changed. I felt more aware and a part of my surroundings. Like my mind made a pivot and I’m seeing a new world. It’s a bit scary. Does anyone know what may be going on?. I’ve gone many years just picking it up every now and then but not learning or practicing. I miss it, but the fire to play is gone. How do I rekindle that flame? How do I get to love playing everyday again?. So I’ve started a YouTube channnel. Just one video so far. But I’m afraid nothing will come of it. Before I started it I was studying web development. I really enjoyed it but my previous therapist said it wasn’t what I really wanted to do. I’m at a crossroads and I’m not sure what to do. I know it’s my choice but I’m looking for insight. Thanks.

I’ve struggled with what I wanted to do with my life ever since I dropped out of a masters in social work program. But now I know, it’s to help people. Vague I know, but I have a plan. It will take months to get traction, but I will do it. Wish me luck!. This isn’t a revelation, but man, one wrong move can ruin things. I didn’t get up to exercise this morning. And since I didn’t get my exercise fix, I watched porn. Now I feel groggy and lethargic.But tomorrow I get another opportunity to make good choices. That’s all I can ask for.Stay sober and go kick ass everyone!. Watching football with family and friends. Playing with my nephew. Caught myself laughing. I don’t hate myself for talking or being a part of the conversation. I think my life is going to be great. It’s been a rolling fire for a long time.

This is the way 😁.So I applied for an apprenticeship job where you learn programming while getting paid. It’s through my state’s center for data sciences. How can I prepare and what questions should I expect. Thanks!. So I applied for an apprenticeship job where you learn programming while getting paid. It’s through my state’s center for data sciences. How can I prepare and what questions should I expect. Thanks!. I have been very sick for over 20 years. But the past year, and especially the past 2 months, my mental health has dramatically improved. But now I’m stuck with everyday problems. Like money. Like dating. Picking the trajectory of my life. What kind of person I want to work towards becoming.I feel blessed I have these problems. It means I’m mentally well and stable. Just wanted to share the good news. Later.So my depression and mania are finally managed. Doing good besides not having a job at the moment. But when I try to do anything creative, be it write or play music or make a YouTube video, I come up with a ton of excuses. I know their bullshit but in the moment seen real. How to I create stuff without self sabotaging?. I start a new sales job Monday. I asked my boss if door to door was how we get leads. He said no, but through canvassing. He also said we don’t do cold-calling. So how exactly are leads found with canvassing?. About to go to an interview for a sales job. My current job isn’t working (3 year old teacher). I’ve read there is a lot of flexibility in sales. I know I could do well. Anyone currently in sales I would love to connect with. Thanks. Can’t figure it out.Been single my whole life. I’m currently doing EMDR and it’s really working. My therapist said being single right now isn’t a bad choice. I’m just lonely and scared. Is waiting till I’m healthy the smart choice?. Right now I hate my job. It isn’t what I thought it would be. Today I drove all the way to work then called in sick and left. My life sucks. I thought after getting my mental health in order my life would magically be great. I’m angry that my life sucks, and this is a good thing. I’m motivated to become my own boss. I’m moved to not stay in this crappy job. I have been running from my problems for a long time.I know I will be successful. I just have to keep going and keep improving. I’m not going to let a job ruin my mental health or outlook on life. I can choose to stay positive and not give up.Hope everyone is doing well. Life can be hard, but I know I can kick ass as long as I keep working. To the future!. I’m starting it tomorrow, well at least the first step. Curious whether anyone has followed it. It’s conditioning work doing snatches.I have just started learning html and css. I want to start working on github projects, but my knowledge is minimal. Where should i start and what can i do with my limited skills?. Took me a while to both understand this and put it into practice. But man, life is so much better sober. Do I miss the manias/hypo manias? Sometimes yea. But my life isn’t a mess anymore. I can make non-manic plans and follow through with them. I can exercise consistently. I don’t have to second guess my actions about if I was manic or not when choosing them.I know I can have a great life. And for me, it starts by staying sober.Now that I’m stable and healthy my life is so much more different than when I was sick. Got the idea of writing a book about the journey and about the difference. Think it will be fun and healing. Called From The Ashes.14 days sober from all my addictions. Feeling way better. Much more stable, clear headed, and happy. Wanted to share. Longest I’ve been sober from everything ever. I wonder what it will be like after 6 months. Wish me luck.Took me 20 years to being able to manage this disease. I’ve got a long way to go in terms of really doing great, but I’m finally stable. Long time I know, but I didn’t give up. Take care everyone.Signed up for Toastmasters. Been reading books on speaking. The few times I have spoken to large groups it went well. Just wanted to share. Also think being bipolar could be a boon since I’ve been through a lot and could help me reach people in need.I go for 1 hour in the evening. It’s not too crazy but definitely pushes me. How long does everyone else meditate for?. So my big concern is being firm from the start. I want to be warm and kind, but know my class is going to be really rowdy. Last teacher quit after two days. They said after a while I can ease off on the firmness. Looking for advice. Thanks.Going to be teaching pre-k. Wondering if they would be too young to learn meditation. I’m all ears!. I have moments where I’m all in. Like wanting to learn coding. But I then ask myself why I’m interested and I don’t have a good answer. Or I’m gung-ho on becoming a YouTuber and a public speaker but get distracted by something else. Don’t understand it.So I tried the web development route. Started with HTML the moved on to CSS. But I was just bored. I have recently looked into python, and it seem super interesting. Is python a good route for someone who was bored with web development?. So I’ve kicked all my addictions at the same time. Alcohol, nicotine, porn, and fast food. I’m glad I did, but now there is a lingering depression. Curious to whether this is common or not. Probably is but wanted some feedback and on how long it could stay. Thanks!. I’ve gotten sober and started to lose weight, but I can’t for the life of me stick to a wake cycle. How did y’all do it? How did it impact your life? I’m sick of feeling hung over in the morning because I slept in. Help.
    I have never been able to hold a stable job with my bipolar disorder. My psychiatrist told me it’s very hard to get disability. Anyone know of resources to help me financially? My wife makes to much for assistance but we have lots of expenses/kid. Full time work is extremely difficult for me to stick with.I have zero experience or knowledge in IT. I’m about 50%don’t google it support cert and currently enrolled in a college a+ training course. I’m getting lost with the material as it gets more in depth. Is it more beneficial for me to get an internship on the weekends to learn tech support or a computer repair tech? Has anyone did an entry level internship? If so how do you go about doing that? I feel as though hands on is the best way to learn and see how this stuff works. Thanks. I’m about 50% don’t the google it professional cert and decided to take a college class to learn a+. Zero experience or knowledge about computers. Everywhere states that a + training is for total beginners like me. Well I’m so lost in the sauce it’s not even funny. Every PowerPoint is a new concept that requires an in depth level of understanding and my brain cannot tie every concept together. I spend my whole weekend and weekday after work on this material. Is there any resources out there that explain these concepts in simple terms? This class uses the Comptia course material straight from Comptia. Google it cert is even more in-depth with its concepts than this so I’m starting to think this just isn’t for me. Any help would be appreciated. I’m already taking the google Google IT support certification course. Was wondering if there are any other bootcamp style IT Tech support courses or is google all I really need? I am BRAND NEW to anything about computers and the networking aspect is getting a tad confusing. Just trying to further my knowledge before job hunting. TIA. I’m a 31yo male in good health besides the found my gfr and creatine levels off. Creatine is 1.5 and gfr is 59. Ultrasound found nothing and it’s months to see a specialist which I already have an apt. No doctor has yet to come out and say I have chronic kidney disease. How concerned should I be? Urologist told me it’s very unusual for a person my age to have this problem and told me he has zero idea as to why my levels are off.Got prescribed clomid from urologist. Insurance doesn’t want to cover it. Doing some research found ReliableRxPharmacy and alldaychemist. From what I read peopleWho buy off their website don’t have a script for the meds they purchase but when I go to check out it asks for my medications and to upload my script. I have never purchased off of these websites so I’m a little nervous putting that information on there being it’s from overseas. Maybe I’m just being ridiculous but do you have to provide the script to get the meds sent from these websites? Thanks. I have an 18 Subaru Legacy. Shop told me I need one in the front and one in the back replaced with the “hub assembly” as well. I have never heard of a hub assembly needing to be replaced with a wheel bearing? Anybody know what they are talking about?. I’m 31 and drive tractor trailer for a living. Looking for a change in career possibly. Don’t want to attend college because I’m not smart at all. My heart just isn’t into trucking anymore. I have a family now and would like to be home more. I have read page after page on Reddit of what careers in computers to pursue but there’s so much out there im getting confused where to start. I have zero experience with IT and don’t know anything about computers besides your usual user things. Any advise? I’m absolutely horrible at math too I dont know how heavy math based IT is.I had a hemorrhoid banding that went terribly wrong. From the extreme pain from the banding I broke out with a severe case of shingles. A few days after the shingles I was bleeding during BM a lot and a specialist found a large anal fissure. I have been out on short term disability because I drive tractor trailer and can’t sit for 14 hours in that much pain. I’m worried I’ll have to give up my job because sitting for an extended period doesn’t look likely in my near future. Any advise out there? I have a family to support and don’t know what to do in the case I can’t get back to work. 31 male. Have had shingles about two weeks now my doc says I have a severe case. Gabapentin was upped from 3-600mg and doesn’t seem to be doing any better. all day/night shooting pain and muscle aches. Can’t sleep really cause it doesn’t stop. Im on the antivirus and narcotics do not seem to do anything. I’m starting to think I’ll be out of work way longer than I expected I drive tractor trailer. Any ways to get rid of this pain? What the hell do I do if I can’t return to work?. I’m a truck driver. Almost every trucking company uses these third party credit agencies and can put negative things on your employee record. Legally how can you combat this if they put something negative and WRONG on your record?.

    I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 beginning of this year. To give a back story I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder for the last 12 years. After trying every SSRI in the book, nothing helped but only made it worse. I felt hopeless and had no clue it might be another disorder. I tried one last time to seek professional help and am so glad I did because my psychiatrist and psychologist are amazing. I was finally diagnosed bipolar type 2. My psychiatrist prescribed me Lamictal which IMMEDIATELY helped with everything symptom. I was on it for about 6 months and then I started to develop the Lamictal rash (mild case) so had to cut it cold turkey. Now I’m back to moods unstable, hypomanic behavior, depression, etc. My psychiatrist says we will restart Lamictal at a lower dose in a couple of weeks as some people can get reintroduced with no side effects. After that the course of action close to Lamictal would be Lithium but that treatment sounds more invasive. Does anyone have some experience or thoughts they can share? Starting to feel like I’m going crazy and hopeless. Thanks.
    BP2, grandiosity or awakening?I know this is asked a lot but I have rapid cycling bipolar 2 and have rapid cycling but never really have full blown manis psychosis. I constantly have this sort of enlightenment or awakening. I know it sounds like your typical mania ( I am god and can save the world) type of story, but it’s not. It’s more of me believing that there’s higher levels of consciousness and understanding how everyone views reality differently because of their individual brain chemistry and how they were raised . And that the bipolar brain can access untapped experiences due to are unique chemistryThe problem I’m having is where do I draw the line of there being truth behind this or this all being mania? Or could it be both perhaps?? A lot of times when I had these revelations I was high or weed or shrooms though. But none of them seem to be straight up mania or psychotic thoughts of grandiose All of these awakenings I have are just about how everyone’s reality is completely subjective and everyone’s emotions are completely different. I even gain a new sense of empathy and understanding how that persons reality might feel during these moments .I’m just so lost and don’t even know where to start from. I’m cycling all the time hour from hour and I just don’t understand anythingTo begin I was in a relationship with a girl I loved for almost a year (I was diagnosed prior). And of course like almost every relationship while being bipolar it failed. Not saying it was solely my fault. She had her flaws too. But In the end she realized how negative I always was and how it impacted her mood and made her experience depressionFast forward to may this year. She broke up with me. I went completely out of control and said the most outrageous shit ever. I said the worst shit you can possibly say to someone x10. And it led to a severe depression where I had to move back in with my mom. Everyday I was laying down in my bed all day everyday doing nothing for almost a month. Until I started smoking weed…Weed helped me. I know In know how bad it is for mania and y’all probably think where this is going. But it genuinely helped me. Almost gave me some sort of spiritual awakening ( I know your typical manic story) but I never got out of control with it or ended up with full blown mania ( I think) or psychosis no matter how much I smoked. It literally opened my mind to new perspectives on life and I have never felt so open minded in my life. However sometimes I would get so high I would have almost like a ego death where I look back at myself and realize that I’m manic, and literally journal telling myself that I am manic and I need to stop smoking weed and go to the hospital. Then I sobered up and just looked back at those notes and didn’t think anything of it. I’ve done that probably 10 times for the past 5 monthsFast forward to this week. I started microdosing shrooms. And it made me feel amazing. For the first time in what feels like forever I actually feel something. I feel real. I don’t feel like I’m dissociating or depersonalizing. And everything feels happy. However my mood is cycling even more that it is. And I just had a ego dissolving moment where I realized I have been manic this whole time for the past 5 months. I blew over 30k (spent half on weed) had unprotected sex with multiple people. Wanted to start multiple things at once. Randomly spent 2k on a drum set etcThe thing that confuses me is how well I mask it. Since I’m able to mask it so well and come off as normal does it mean my bipolar is not as serious? I have friends who are also bipolar and they cannot function at all and recognize their moods, so I convince myself that my bipolar isn’t that bad and is controllable. Despite everything I’ve managed to sustain relationships, make more friends, get a new job as a senior software engineer making 6 figures at 22. I don’t know if I should check myself in. But if I do I feel like I can’t afford it. I would have to take a week off work. And on top of it, it would completely change me, I wouldn’t be able to have fun with my friends like I used to, smoke weed etc. I’m stuck at this crossroad of giving all that up to live a stable life, or keep being manic which is who I typically am, since my baseline is hypomania. I feel like this whole experience really did awaken me in the sense of understanding the mind and truly understanding bipolar. However I feel like it may be a Icarus flying too close to the sun moment…So since I have this ego dissolution moment of clarity right now, which will go away in a bit when I’m sober and back to this endless manic loop. What should I do? I keep convincing myself one moment that I’m in full blown mania and the next moment I just tell myself “yeah I’m manic, but I can control it since I’m not psychotic, and appear normal”. Hello, I am a 20 year old student attending community college and just landed my first job as a software engineer in Tampa Florida. Base salary is 50k with medical, dental, and vision insurance, along with ancillary options, 401k with matching, and a stock plan after 2 years. Did I low ball myself? I feel like I could get around 60-70k. I’ve been programming for around 3-4 years and I’m self taught and I’ve ran my own software business, which I used as my experience, one of the main reasons I looked for a job was so I can learn a more structured and professional way of programming, since I’m self taught it’s a lot harder to learn industry paradigms and things of that. Besides that it’s a really friendly and cool company and feels at home. Just wondering if I should of looked for more pay somewhere else.
    I’ve had severe, over month-long depression every winter for 13 years, since the age of 15. We’re coming up on the first one since I’ve started any meds or therapy (BP 2, 150mg Lamictal). I’m pretty freaked out. I don’t know if the meds are going to prevent this shitty, cursed part of life as I’d only known it. Every year the “foreplay” with depression takes up around November. Ill health triggers isolation, bad habits worsen, moodiness and frustration come up 10x as often, and so does drinking and getting stoned (outside of depression I stay sober). Until eventually the crying begins, peaks right after the holidays and stays till end of January. Does anyone remember how their first year on Lamictal went and whether depression lasted less or wasn’t as painful?Did you have to increase dosage in the winter?Any sharing and advice would help me big time. I am already at step 2, losing interest in socialising after a long period of physical illness, having negative thoughts, anger and unfortunately smoking weed for 4th day straight. (Weed is my ‘devil’, took all my willpower to stop it and I feel always at risk of starting up again). Not depressed yet, but gloomy af this week.Euphoric moods this month had me worried about possible hypomania, and I know this is common. As far as I see it, in the case of simply a great mood there are:• No racing thoughts • No irregular sleeping • No unexplicable energy surges• No irritability• No hypersexuality• No inflated self-esteem• No desire to drink and smoke• No desire to spend time with more or new people I believe these differences are enough for me to feel safe that it’s not hypomania. The similarities are:• laughter and positivity• increased creativity • motivation for goals and projects. It seems to be a very common question in the community, so I thought it’d be useful to make a list.The feeling of detachment and disconnection has been following me my whole life, including in hypomanic states, and even now, in euthymia. Ironically, I have many close friends and a busy social life. But I’m not talking about depression. I meditate daily and practice mindfulness, and feel extremely present when I’m alone. But when I’m with people - no matter who - I feel in a bubble, reality is muffled, conversation is distorted and my feelings are detached. Is this part of the disorder? BP2, got diagnosed in March, 150mg Lamictal. I fell in love with someone while hypomanic, then into a relationship during (or causing..) a terrible mixed state. I ended it because I feared my life is at stake. They promised they understand my reason, but have cut me out since. Won’t even talk to me, and it’s been nearly 2 months. I attempt contact once every two weeks. I feel rejected and abandoned, for being too much. Like my behaviour was just too hurtful… as if my personal hurt is invisible. We were very close friends before my hypomanic episode, and I’ve worked a lot spiritually to let go of the romantic feelings, to let pure selfless love grow in their place. It feels like they won’t do the same. For the first time in my life, I fully feel the terrible pain of the disorder pushing people away beyond return.I love mornings and I hate nighttime. It’s not so much as I have trouble sleeping, but that I have developed a kind of tiny trauma. This year I’ve had so much difficulty falling asleep, so many unprompted anxiety attacks right before bed, bad “trips”, unexpected insomnia. I fear that as soon as my head hits the pillow, my mind could attack. So I noticed that I like to induce a food coma before bed. I know it’s unhealthy, and it’s only up to me to change it. Some nights are worse than others. I’m just sharing, I fucking hate nighttime.I’ve got elastic cordtied around my torso,I dive off bridgesAnd spring back from bottom depths. I make friends there,Who’ve got stones instead of ropes tied to them. Halfway up, I take some with meAnd we meet again on my way back down. They struggle with the heavy weightAnd seem surprised,Confused, and even enviousThat I move between heaven and hellLike tourist destinations. And I am shivering,I don’t knowWhy I keep diving.People try and they say they really love me, but not one of them knows what to do when faced with it. I’m tired of getting my hopes up, any time I’m in the hole, it takes all my strength to share and ask for help, and it never EVER hits the mark. I end up feeling more alone, much much more.I think it started lurking 2 weeks ago, and last night I came really close to dying. I was on the ground for 8 hours, hitting my head with a wooden spoon so hard that it broke. I put a chair on the door, because I’m at my grandma’s for the holidays. My mother in law kept bringing me food, and water, and showed me love. My best friend called me, and showed me love. But nothing, nothing worked. I fell asleep, and woke up, still with the feeling that I am close to dying. I’m on only 100mg Lamotrigine and perhaps now is the time to up the dosage. I would also like advice on - do I need space or do I need love? Should I separate myself from my loved ones in order to not hurt them? I already started writing hurtful letters online to people 2 days ago. This is a very bad episode.I’m newly diagnosed, on day 8 of lamotrigine, freshly off(?) a hypomanic state. Is the obsessive desire to wear the skin of your loved ones, to feel exactly what they feel, to clean every corner of their subconscious until it shines with your name on it.. is that part of BPD? And for this need to roll into an ugly insecurity that no one feels that way for you, even if you’re surrounded by people who love you (but not how you want to be loved)..is that also? And the loneliness and the nights awake thinking about others, often in a state of lust and desire.Like never, everything worked out fine. I love the therapist I found, the psychiatrist was very open to me asking for lamotrigine instead of anything else, I’ve made my peace with the diagnosis. I am optimistic (coming off hypomania), and surrounded by supportive and loving people. What now? What should I expect from lamotrigine? Am I still going to feel the hypomania & depression but to a lesser extent, or could they both go away completely?. My first therapy, ever, is on Tuesday. I’ve spent my life wondering what is wrong with me. Last month, I finally found, for the first time, something that describes 90% of my symptoms and it’s cyclothymia. (Only thing I don’t have is promiscuity - I find others attractive but never give into it). I want to be better. I want to get treatment. I am ready to try medication. But I live in a country where psychiatry isn’t well developed, and I’m terrified this therapist won’t take me seriously…. I slipped this month. I found out if I smoke just once, it alters my brain chemistry for the next couple of days too. I become more moody, less present. I care less about stuff. My entire self becomes replaces by some different, THC-infused self. It’s scary. I don’t want to smoke.What is an average pre-employment assessment task in your industry and country? I need an insight, since I believe in mine things are getting out of control. Here, after 2 rounds of interviews and a submitted portfolio, companies give out example tasks for job applicants to complete at a certain deadline. Lately, in the Web/Digital/IT industry, companies have been giving out tasks that take 2-3 full workdays (16-20 hours of work). Interestingly, the job market is better than ever - there are tons of offers and few applicants. So why are companies confident in requiring 2-3 days of unpaid work from potential employees?Is this normal in your experience? A friend of mine applied to 3 jobs and had to complete a full week of unpaid work combined, while balancing her existing job at nights and weekend. She’s still waiting to hear back but honestly even if she does, I’m angry and don’t want to accept 16 hours of unpaid work is the new norm.It’s been the best 8 months of my life and I have no intention of going back. But this past month, I’ve been taking “just one toke” moments once every few days. And I know why - some days everything is too much. It feels like all my close ones are struggling with some sort of mental illness I can’t seem to help with (anxiety disorder, depression, repressed grief, trauma, borderline, narcissism). It seems on a wider scale, my “national” community is losing all values and ways to work together and is either barely surviving or completely overtaken by greed and consumerism. On an even wider scale, the world .. man it’s just too much.. Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Ukraine… it just doesn’t end. And I barely even watch the news anymore - this just cannot be avoided. This is why I used to smoke. Some days, the black and white thinking prevails, and the black wins. And then I don’t even want to try to focus on the good. I just want to check out and listen to Bowie. Ironically, my life is going just great. Quitting weed and replacing it with spirituality has eliminated nearly all my worries and negative feelings, and most areas of my life are better than ever. But maybe I’m not capable of enjoying it until the ones around me start doing better. Honestly, 2022 is creeping me out. The national and global communities aside, is anyone else noticing a state of emergency for the mental health of those close to them?. My partner (28M) had a strange sudden reaction after drinking lots of caffeine tonight, with dizziness and a rapid heart rate. We were at a wedding, he had 2 Club Mates (yerba mate drink) and about 0.4l of whisky throughout the night. He was absolutely fine, not even too drunk, he finished his last Mate drink and we left the wedding. 1 minute later he said he can’t breathe - although he was actually breathing quite deeply and slowly. I checked his heart rate and it was very fast. He said he thinks he’s going to die, his face turned completely dark red. I put him to bed and he calmed down and fell asleep, his heart rate returned to normal.He has generalised anxiety disorder but has never had a panic attack. I wonder if the huge amount of caffeine could have messed with his heart rate, which scared him and led to a panic attack?. I was 3 months sober. I had reinvented my life. I was happier than I could ever remember, I was free - I discovered meditation, I changed jobs, I quit alcohol and spent 60 days of pure joy and gratitude (after the initial 30 days of suffering an overwhelming depressive episode). I didn’t miss any of my addictions since. But in the past 4 weeks, I’ve developed serious back pain for no apparent reason. Unaffected by any painkillers or therapy. Last night, I finally gave up. The depression and addiction I thought were gone, now have taken this opportunity of physical exhaustion to jump. I’ve been smoking, drinking and doing pills since. I am having a hard time believing how quickly this has happened. I’ve spent the past 6 years battling depression, addiction, and health problems, including a lot of muscle pain due to injury. These past few months of peace and happiness were everything to me, as I considered myself on the brink of.. death. I know hope is not gone and all it takes is for me to go back to sobriety and mindfulness. But all I can think about is drugs, booze and sleep. I am exhausted and it seems I have not forgotten them at all. PS I know physical therapy is what I need and not being wasted. I’ve been doing rigorous therapy regularly, somehow now weed has revealed itself as an easy escape. Quitting weed and alcohol was the best decision I’ve ever made. I’m better both for myself and everyone else in my life. I’ve quit my job. I have energy, motivation, hope and ease. I am not only happier than I ever have been, but happier than I ever could’ve even imagined. The first 20 days were actual hell, until I found what works (meditation). I think quitting alcohol along with weed was vital. Please consider it if you haven’t done it. Just here to say I see clearly now there can never be happiness in chasing a dopamine rush.Reporting back from one of the “scariest” scenarios for someone quitting weed - hanging out with your buds. What I’ve found is: No, they’re not having more fun than us! We got together to play Cards against humanity, everyone was doing shots, bong rips, etc. I was drinking tea all night (I’ve cut off everything along with weed, even coffee). At the start of the evening I admit they were laughing and making silly jokes, but as an hour or so passed, none of them was having nearly as much fun as me. They got tired, ordered food and overate, then they got sleepy and started drinking energy drinks, leading them to eventually crash as early as half past midnight. I was looking at their faces all night - they were all in their heads, no one was truly “loose” which is the effect we all expect from drugs and alcohol. I haven’t been sober for this long since I was 14. I’ve also never been happier. I’ve spent the past month doing some intense shadow work and meditation and facing all of the suffering I’ve spent 13 years avoiding. Now I have nothing to escape, no need to sedate or stimulate my mind. Nothing is more satisfying than my own self. Sobriety is the fkin best :) Good luck to everyone at the start of this path, the first 3 weeks were actual hell for me and I’d never expect to feel this good.Hi everyone, I need advice from anyone who’s done a therapeutic shroom trip alone during a depressive episode. I have a lot of experience with shrooms, and depression, and meditation, but have never done more than 1.5g, and never alone. The last time I tripped was 6months ago, and wasn’t in a depressive episode like I am now. However, I spent the whole trip crying about how painful physical existence is and how the human mind is the root of all suffering, and the only escape is death or enlightenment. I eventually discovered a desire to live and experience beauty, but I feel like a lot of my questions were unanswered because I was afraid to go deeper (I was with a friend and she seemed very disturbed by my trip). I don’t want to go on antidepressants because I don’t want to spend my life dependent on them. I’ve only just started recovering from a devastating 13-year-old weed addiction. I want to go back to that place and search for answers on why I’ve been suicidal since 12 years old. I’m looking for advice and information on therapeutic tripping. PS Please don’t comment on whether tripping alone while suicidal is problematic. I trust the shrooms with my life completely. I don’t live in a place where I can get a therapist to accompany me.I have a high-paying job, with maximum flexibility and zero oversight. I’m miserable at it. I’ve been flirting with leaving for years. At day 8, it seems clear as day I’m unhappy not only at this job, but this industry (digital marketing). I see how my weed addiction has numbed the deep internal dissatisfaction, and has also turned my depression into a crippling disorder that made sure I didn’t graduate from my Environmental Engineering bachelor’s degree. I literally studied like a dog for 4 years, aced every exam and gave up at the last one, I now see due to crippling anxiety and depression. All while building a career at this bullshit company. I don’t think I would have let this happen if I hadn’t spent the last 13 years high. I feel like I have to start over, and the thought my “best friend” won’t be beside me is terrifying. I feel overwhelmingly depressed at the thought I’ve spent the last 10 years building a life I do not want. I’m dying to smoke.Just three days ago I was crying in a bathroom that I’d never be able to enjoy things as I did with weed. What a bunch of bullcrap! Today was the best day I’ve had in months. No moodswings, no cravings, and soooo muuuch energy. Just in the 6 days of not smoking, I’ve already:- started training again ( I used to workout 4 days a week, but had a 5 month break due to increased daily weed use in the summer)- stopped eating sweets ( I normally have an insane sweettooth, that seems to have disappeared)- cut down caffeine ( it’s just 1 cup in the morning now, as opposed to 2-3/d in an attempt to deal with weed comedown)- cut down alcohol almost completely ( turned out to be a lot less fun without weed) Weed 0, Me 6 - Suck it, weed!Seriously, guys. I know you hear this a lot, but if it wasn’t for this subreddit, I wouldn’t have made it 24 hours. The only difference between me trying to quit two years ago and now is YOU. I love you!!Can you sense how euphoric I am? No substances, just me. Who knew??. I need an advice on whether to finally end a rocky 1+ year relationship.Over the past year, we keep having the same major fight and tonight was the 5th time (I've contemplated breakup all the other times as well). The situation is: We're apart (i.e. different cities) and he goes to party with his friends. I call him to hear how he's doing. He acts cold, I tell him that his behavior is upsetting me, he gives me teenage-boy-style responses like "oh well", "sry", "talk to u later". Hangs up. I freak out and text him angry messages. He ignores them all night and ends up getting really drunk with his friends, while I'm left feeling dissed and upset all night.The very next morning he always tells me he loves me, he was just drunk, he literally cries and tells me he cant live witho... Etc. Any other time, ANY other situation in life - he's the nicest, most emotionally supportive, most caring boyfriend. My theory? He feels insecure and takes the opportunity of beinf surrounded by friends to act careless, "cool" and "strong". I've explained how much it hurts me each time. I'm exhausted of having all my nights away from home ruined (tonight was a vacation away with my girlfriends). Do I finally end it? Am I crazy to think this is a deal breaker in a relationship? Tl;DR: boyfriend is a great caring person, but turns into a *@#& for no reason for a night when he's away from me and with his friends.edit: 25M*. Hello, 23F, have been treated for hyperthyroidism for 8months and a month ago my doctor told me that it's time to lower my dosage. I went from 3x50mg of Propycil to 2x50mg for 2 weeks and now since this week, 1x. My main symptom before the treatment was extreme anxiety and crying episodes (5+ hours of hysterical crying). This week, I got my first crying episode since before the treatment. Is it the act of lowering my dose that might have caused it?. I'm a 23F who used to have a big sex drive. I'm in a 1-yr serious relationship with someone I really have feelings for and used to have sex 5 times a day with. I find him attractive, sexy, etc, yet for a few months now I have had the strangest anxious feeling in my chest when we start to kiss. I might get horny and feel turned on, yet when he tries to kiss me and get something going, I get a really nervous feeling in my whole body and even feel like I want to push him away or punch him if he doesn't stop. It's so strange! Eventually if we do start having sex, I physically enjoy it, I might even cum but the anxious feeling is just there all the time! Like my whole body can't wait for it to stop. My theory is that I might be pressuring myself for not having sex as much as we did in the beginning of the relationship and perhaps for not matching his sex drive. Another theory I have is there might be some problem in the kissing itself, because it's kissing that always brings on the heavy chest feeling. Like I can't relax and enjoy it and would rather turn around and let him kiss my neck instead of my mouth. Has anyone had this anxious feeling from kissing and dealt with it? I'm worried if it means something about my feelings towards my SO.. I literally just came back from hell and want to know if Im the only one.4 weeks ago, my whole personality changed. From a positive laid back person I became a nervous wreck, stressed out of my mind. I went into episodes of unprovoked crying for hours, every day, all month.Cannot stress on how bad and scary it was, I had to go on sick leave from work and university, because the crying was so umcontrollable.Considered making an appointment with a shrink when.. Suddenly (6 days late), I got my period. It literally felt like my whole way of thinking and behaving changed. It felt like a cloud of worry was lifted from my head.Has this sort of long, extreme psychological change happened to any of you during your cycle? TL;DR: month long PMS with the effect of a real-life mental breakdown.. Hi, I am having a pretty serious streak of depressive mood attacks all October, not sure if it's seasonal affective disorder or academical stress but one thing is certain - weed is a very effective short-term "sedater".The attacks are basically a sudden burst of tears which usually last an hour or two.. However, if I decide to smoke, the crying stops immediately and I become very relaxed.Say my symptoms continue, would it be such a bad thing to smoke my way through this period of time? Based on previous experiences, I may be out of it in 2 months, so that means smoking weed 2-3 times a day for 2 months.I always smoke a lot of weed, but I make myself take breaks - not get too many days and weeks in a row. Do you think being high non-stop for 2 months could have a negative effect - on my dependance, my mental health and so on?. Yeah yeah, congrats on us for Ahref's new rank tracker. It's still limited to the number of websites you're allowed to run campaigns on. Does anyone know of a rank tracker (free to cheap) that would let me input as much as 70 websites? Thanks.I started rewatching the show, and as early as season 3 I already can't get away from the feeling that the finale ruined the plot for me. I'm actually 0/10 okay with the way Ted's love life ends up in present time. I hate Ted and Robin together and I feel like the Mom's concept was just used as a tool to develop their storyline. Is the lesson that we're supposed to learn that there are many types of love, some is true unconditional Disney love and other is love and dependance you've had to work on during the years? That's not a rhetorical question. I'm new to any HIMYM subreddit so I have no idea how other fans feel - is there anything for you that justifies the ending, makes it acceptable for you (or even - likable)?. Intertype relations are more closely related to socionics, so I don't know how much support it might meet here. Here (http://wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Intertype_relations ) you can figure out your relations to other types.To the point - is there anyone here who married their Kindred partner and made it work? Kindred partners are those of the same leading function and an opposing creative function. Mine, for example, is ENTP. After 2 years, my ENTP SO and I are still very much in love. But while there are a huge number of issues that we've overcome, we still fight over the same things. It's obvious that it's always a collision of Fi vs Ti that ends up hurting both of us daily. It's a passionate but very dramatic relationship where we've broken up and gotten back together 7 times. I'd really like to hear a positive story of Kindred partners who made it work. My parents are the only example I have, they were an ENFP-ENTP couple that got divorced and remarried, and divorced again - ending up with never speaking to each other again. Literally. It's a really messed up relationship and I'm scared to death of it. It's in my head all the time and I wish I'd never found out about MBTI in the first place. Any stories would be greatly appreciated (as you can tell by my dramatic tone). I'm struggling with my relationships to my closest ones lately and I suspect it's because I've become moodier and get easily hurt/offended by something they did. Is it one of my 8 functions causing me to hold grudges or feel hurt even after my external relationship with the person is "back to normal"? It's like a dull sensation that my feelings for them have changed and I don't feel as comfortable in the relationship anymore. How do I get better at letting things go?I know that especially for ENFPs talking honestly and directly to the other person does wonders but conversation about my feelings often makes me defensive and becomes an argument.. I was doing a domain comparison with my competitors and noticing some differences. One thing was that all my outranking competitors had a 4-5 times bigger number of "crawled pages". Since this metric is in the backlinks section, I'm assuming it has nothing to do with the number of pages indexed by Google. So - whose pages and who crawled them? I'm guessing it's Ahrefs but I wanted to make sure. If you've got the time you could also tell me if you think that a bigger number of these crawled pages correlates to higher rankings.Competitors of mine jumped to 1st place on the organic search results, all the way from 39th. There is absolutely no change on their website or backlink profile to explain the jump.They have a successful PPC campaign for over 160+ related keywords, could it be connected? Has anything like this ever happened to any of you?. For the past month, a competitor of mine is jumping back and forth between 39th and 1st place (for a highly competitive query with 4400 average monthly search). The niche is very competitive and it's absolutely impossible for a small website like that to surpass the entire SERP and jump straight to number 1. The odd part is they don't stay there permanently. They stay at 1st place for a few days, than fall back to page 4. Has this happened to any of you? I have a theory that it's some sort of glitch with their PPC campaign. They have a very successful PPC campaign with over 160 related keywords. Is it possible that it has something to do with it or do you think it's just some sort of Google update?.
    So I went to the doctor this week and confessed that I’m an alcoholic. So he took away my tried and true sleeping pills citing death if I took them while drinking. I’ve now been awake over 24 hours. I feel a wavering tiredness. I used to be hungry but I’m not anymore. I don’t know what to do.I’m getting an ad every roughly 3-4 mins of content watched. The app is almost unuseable.Just wanted to post an update for anyone that's been feeling symptoms and is curious what to expect. I've had numbness/tingling in my left hand ring and pinky fingers for about 3 months. Minor pain in my left elbow but barely any pain worth mentioning.Went to see the neurologist today. She hooked me up to an EMG and shocked my hand a bunch. They weren't really "painful" shocks but they did take my breath away a couple of times. Then she took a needle and poked me in a couple spots starting at my shoulder and going down to my hand. I hate needles, and this part was worse than the shocks imo. I'm not really sure what the needle was for but it seemed to measure soundwaves in my arm or something.After the tests were done, she concluded that I have a pretty bad pinched nerve in my elbow. I basically need to try and stay off of it for the next 4-6 months she said, and in a "rare" occurrence it could end in surgery.What should I expect?I've had numbness in my left hand ring and pinky finger and that side of my left hand for 3 months straight, no lessening, no strengthening. I've had pain at times but it's minimal times. I reported the numbness to my work about 3-4 weeks after I started experiencing it as I do alot of grinding at work.Wondering what I should expect at my neurologist appt and what I can do to better manage this issue. I don't think it has anything to do with how I sleep.Anyone else just constantly finding new songs to obsess over? For me first it was Granite, then Alkaline. And currently have Sugar on repeat.I think they're a good thing and would benefit alot of Canadian towns and cities. I really want to see something like this implemented where I live in Cambridge.Twice on FB in the past couple days I've seen people bashing 15 minute cities. Idk if this is a trending topic for the right atm but it's something I've never heard of before. People were saying things like the government wouldn't allow you to leave your zone or you'd have to pay to leave, that barricades would get installed etc. I just don't understand this type of thinking, it seems totally irrational.I've been sleeping 3-4 hours a night for the last 2 weeks, I feel so burnt out. I take a sleeping pill (Zopiclone) and I go to sleep decently early, like phone down and sleeping by 930-1030 but I wake up around 1 or 2 every morning and can't fall back asleep and then just go to work at 5. Normally my alarm is set for 5 and I get to work for 530.Is anyone else experiencing this? What do you do? Or what should I do? I feel so depleted.Hi, I'm 30 and have a track record of being bad at saving. Or I save for a bit and then cash it out. I'm wondering if going 25% into my work pensions Target Date Fund (I can afford this) instead of trying to manage my own investments would be a recommended option? The money is vested immediately but I can't withdraw unless I leave or retire, which would be a plus for me personally. What are your thoughts? Is doing this putting all my eggs into one basket even if it's a Target Date Fund with a diversified portfolio?. I have a plate full of baked pasta and garlic bread in front of me but I'm so unappetizing for some reason and I can't bring myself to eat anything. I love cooking especially when I'm manic but sometimes I can't even eat what I make. What do you do when you're in this situation?. Would love to join one, just can't really find anything on Google.I'm feeling hypomanic and just too much. 811 does nothing for me. I feel like I can't even be myself while talking to them.I'm so balled up right now and mentally writhing I feel like I can't make my plans for Christmas. I have to. But I feel like I can't do it. Is anyone else feeling a similar way:??. Just discovered this band like a week ago and can't stop listening to them. They fucking rip!!! You guys have any recommendations on bands I should listen to like them?. I can't sleep. I need to talk to someone but my parents told me not to call them at this time of night anymore about a year ago last time this happened. I feel like I'm vibrating and I can't contain it.Like I do, but idk if it's a meme or not.Hey, what tips would you give to a beginner looking to start collecting? I see some things on recent posts regarding grades revolving around off white pages, or things like that Jewelers Ad being rare. What are some basic things a beginner should look for?Thanks in advance!.
    I’m trying to prove a point to my bf who’s mother is controlling and manipulative.****What was the final straw for you???****. After my first and last major depressive episode after being hypo manic for nearly a decade it really broke me down and stripped me of any discipline I had. I’ve been medicated for 4 years now and am better but that digging deep to push through things enough to build discipline has been hard ever since. How did you manage to re-build your discipline?. He thinks getting an apartment a 20 minute car ride away from his mother is enough but I think he under estimates her. He thinks that because she can’t drive and would have to get driven she wouldn’t be at his apartment as often as I think and thinks that bc she’s older (60ish) she won’t have the energy to find a way to constantly be at his apartment either to clean or take care of his children if he had any. He says the only reason she found a way to be at his older brothers apartment constantly was because his apartment was a couple blocks away and in walking distance. But his mother is the classic boy mom who raised him to be mama’s boy and is very manipulative/controlling. Although he’s aware now I personally think he’s still underestimating her but what do y’all think?Essentially Im making this post to see if he’s right…. Like, how doesn’t she get tired or bored of gymnastics?. I’m 25F and all my life up until the age of 21 I was hypomanic so that was the state I was used to being in which also guided me when making life choices, especially career choices.Now that I’m medicated I find it hard to really know/feel what’s the right career for me to choose and pursue.How have you gone about knowing what career is right for you?. I’m asking because that was me (more so hypomanic) and now that I’m medicated life seems dull, I feel like this “normal” state is depressing sometimes. Because I was constantly hypomanic I had so much drive to do anything and everything I thought of, but now that I’m medicated i don’t have the same drive. Maybe the medicine is working too hard to make me stable to the point it kills my drive.How have you managed finding your drive again?. I’m asking bc I’d like to know how I’d hold up in the field lol. Especially a career where you could commit to throughout the mood swings if you had any?(Currently I’m 25) Growing up, I pursued art and dance, but I was experiencing a hypo manic episode for a long a lot of time, and wasn’t treated for nearly a decade till I was 21. In college, I had an existential crisis, grew severely depressed. My interest in art and dance went out the window.So what got me through college was a mixed up episode where I convinced myself I wanted to study geology, and become a research scientist. And as soon as I recovered from the episode, I was graduating and realized I didn’t want to be a research scientist. Since after graduating, I was more levelheaded i had decided I wanted to go into nursing, but then I fell in love with my first boyfriend, (And I exhibited some hypomanic symptoms) and I decided to go into photography with the goal of opening up my own business. Then I fell out of love and my relationship ended after a year and I went back to wanting to do medicine because I didn’t want to be a broke artist and I realized I had formed this whole life around my boyfriend presence. But this time instead of doing nursing, I’ll try to study abroad and become a doctor. Since studying abroad was some thing I wanted to do all throughout college and I knew I’d want to eventually become a nurse practitioner I thought well, the schooling is the same length might as well go balls to the wall and study at a European medical school. But now I’m second-guessing myself because I am thinking it has to be all happening again.WHAT THE HELL SHOULD I DO WITH MY LIFE LOL I NEED HELP. I want to study abroad at a medical school in Italy, and it would be a six year program, but I worry how I’d hold up mentally because I know when I experience drastic changes in environment I get depressed or have a mood swings, especially since I won’t be around my family. Luckily, I’ve never been hospitalized and have a mild form of it but it’s enough for me to possibly stop studying and I worry that I might get so depressed. I’ll drop out and not want to finish and be stuck in debt.I know that’s a very specific question,, but I thought I’d ask it because as much as I’d love to apply to medical school abroad I want to know how I’ll hold up mentally during the program, and I hope to hear of any other people that have the same condition. I would really like to know how they manage their mental health.I don’t identify with my parents ideas and their values, bc it’s honestly not helped them in a lot of ways and me either. They act from a place of fear and with a scarcity mind set.I’ve never wanted to be like them. I’ve never looked up to them and honestly all my life looked for support elsewhere bc I don’t want to end up like them. But idk part of me has a hard time breaking away from then maybe because I still live with them? Or it’s to ingrained in me? Hopefully not though. I’m a 25F. And mildly bipolar, but I’m on medication. Growing up, I was very good at visual arts, but had more of a passion for dance, so I stuck to that for years until I got depressed then due to the existential crisis that led to my depression. I stopped dancing and majored in earth science with the goal of becoming a research scientist lol but as I recovered and graduated I realized that wasn’t some thing I wanted to do so after graduating I thought of enrolling in an accelerated nursing degree program, but I decided to take some time off before starting school again. During that time off I met my first boyfriend and all of a sudden my plan to do nursing went out the window and I decided I do something in the art field since I did visual arts and dance. I feel like I made that change because I was in love, and the feeling had an influence on my decisions at the time. I ended up getting jobs in nonprofit in arts education. I even picked up photography so I can have a side business. It’s almost as if I made this career change assuming he’d be in my life for a longer amount of time than I anticipated.We just recently broke up up after a year and I am no longer in love and I don’t plan to get back together with him. And I am back to wanting to do something in medicine but instead of nursing, I was thinking of going to medical school abroad. Since I know I’d probably be in school for a while anyways I thought why not go all the way.I am at a point where I feel like I can’t depend on anybody and lowkey I shouldn’t.But as you can see, I have a very shifty unstable personality. I don’t want to stay in the field of nonprofit work because I don’t want to be poor lol. I know I like working with children and pushing myself to the max. I was thinking of doing child psychiatry.Help what should I do?!. How was the process for you? And did you need a cosigner? Is there any type of loan you recommend?.
    hi, i’m 24 and i’ve had multiple jobs in the last 8 years. this year especially has been the absolute worst. Right now, i’m at a job which i started in the beginning of september after a year and a half of holding a job for 1-3 weeks and then abruptly quitting because I struggle to get out of bed and find motivation. I’ve been working there for about 2 months which is the longest i’ve had a job. i wish i had more for myself though and i wish i was capable of doing things. I’ve tried to go to college when i graduated high school, but i only completed a year before i dropped out because of my bipolar. then i started and dropped out 2 more times after the first. idk what to do. i’m on medicine and regularly see my psychiatrist and therapist….but idk.
    Hello all, This might be my first time posting here, not sure, but I figured what better place to ask this question. I will be attending a support group within the next few hours for the first time and I'm super nervous and I'm afraid im going to choke or just leave... I've always felt like I had to keep to myself in regards to my bipolar and my actions due to embarrassing and taboo acts, so overall, I just have mixed feelings about this. Any tips, advice, or personal experiences from anyone? Deep down I'm not even really sure if I should do this, I just feel like I'm out of options.Thanks.. Okay I’ll just make this short and sweet. I did need a new car but I went to this place and they sold me a pretty solid pre certified/pre owned car with literally nothing wrong with it.no damage. Nothing. It’s just too expensive for me and I honestly got blind sided by that sales guy. Completely forgot about APR rates and all those hidden numbers. He did a great job and was super nice but when I got home I thought to myself “FUCK”. Any tips? I owe a little over 26K on this so I know for a fact if I were to trade it in, I’d get screwed with my negative equity and that loan rolling over, etc. KBB says I can get it through a private party AT most, 20k. But as a trade in, AT most 17k. I really fucked my self with this one and I could use any help/tips/advice. Thank you. Oh and yes, I know, I’m a dumbass lol.Oh and I’ve had the car for not even a year. I’ve added maybe at most 4k miles to it.
    Hi, I am currently having a lapse in my insurance where I am unable to take two of my three medications, Vraylar and Adderall I am unable to refill. I still have a few days left of my Lamotrigine. I have my doctors appointment today but I’m waiting on my HR to figure out my insurance, not sure if I will be able to meet with my doctor today. I can deal with being off Adderall but being off Vraylar I feel awful like a shell of a person. I called out of work and cried in the bathtub all morning. I dug up some old Abilify and took one of those but it made me very physically unhealthy so I don’t really want to take it more than a day or two. My house is an absolute mess and I feel awful and sad and keep having very dark thoughts. Is there any thing I can do right now before I am able to get back on my meds?. I’m averaging less than four hours of sleep the past few days, and abusing my Adderall prescription by taking double doses, taking it to stay up all night and work on creative projects, combining it with weed and caffeine to intensify the high. I feel like I am quickly becoming addicted to it. I’ve been taking it for about nine months, 15mg XR. And I know I should tell my doctor, but i know they will take me off of it and I just don’t want to, it’s one of my favorite things in life right now. It makes me feel amazing and has also given a lot of benefits with ADHD symptoms. I can’t tell if I am inducing hypomania with Adderall or if I am hypo anyways and it’s causing me to abuse whatever drugs I can get my hands on (a common pattern for me). I also take Lamictal and Vraylar so I don’t get fully manic anymore, but still this lack of sleep/barely eating is crazy. I slept for one hour last night, it is now midnight and I feel wired. I think part of the problem is that I’ve been unbelievably productive the past few days. I’ve been wanting to start my own business making art, and I’ve been so creative and focused that I don’t care that my health is suffering. I really don’t want this to escalate into more severe mania, I haven’t had a manic episode in over three years and I feel closer to the edge than i have in a while. But it also feels so good, I miss this feeling and I don’t want to give it up.I have light skin and dark, prickly hairs on my chin. I’m looking at the Nood but I was just wondering if anyone has any recommendations and advice?. I have 40 different AIC files that I want to export all at once as jpeg. I know you can batch export art boards but is there a way to export all of these without individually clicking into each one? When I select all, the “export as” option is greyed out.When I change the color in the color picker and click OK, the color doesn’t change in my fill/stroke panel. Is this a glitch or am I missing something? It only started happening recentlyEdit: it works when I click a new color, but when I use the eye dropper and then try to adjust the saturation, the problem happens.Use Monistat as lube, and prevent yeast infections before they start. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, but I had a dream that disturbed me. I was having sex with what looked like the stereotype of the Devil, he was red and large and just very scary looking. For a moment I was enjoying it, but soon felt very uneasy. He then started to pee on me and it looked like blood. I made myself wake up at this point. I don’t know what this means, was it my imagination or was there a negative energy trying to do who knows what to me?. I’ve been a bit hypomanic the past few weeks, and I sort of feel like I’ve been acting weird and erratic towards them. I will feel like I’m falling in love with them one day, and the next day I feel very distant and cold. It is hard not to act on how I feel, however I have had bipolar impact my relationships before and I really don’t want it to happen again. I feel like I trust this person enough to tell them what is going on, but I’m not sure how to go about it. When I’ve told people in the past, some of them have reacted negatively and so now I rarely tell anyone.I am looking for a store that does fine art printing, developing film, and possibly conversion of old VHS tapes. Is there any place like this here?. I am trying to decide between which place to move, I am looking for somewhere that would help me thrive as an artist and make friends as someone in my mid-20s, along with having job opportunities in a creative field. I like the atmosphere of both cities and was wondering if anyone who has lived in one or both could give input. My current salary is on the lower end, so this might be a barrier especially in SF. Also, are there specific neighborhoods you could recommend?. I am a beginner designer without much experience, and got a commission to make 2 worksheets for a therapy office. How much would you charge for this? I am thinking around $80 per sheet but am not sure. I have been on Adderall for about six months now and I’m starting to feel very dependent on it. On days when I don’t have much going on I don’t take it and then I just feel horrible and so exhausted. But it also feels that I develop a tolerance when I don’t have a day off at least once a week. I also have a history of drug abuse so I’m worried that I will get so dependent on it that I will start abusing it/taking more than prescribed just to get through the day. How do you cope with this/is this normal?. I am trying to edit my homepage and the products keep randomly disappearing off the page when I delete something. There is a text editor box specifically that when I delete it makes the products go away. I am editing in Elementor and the products do not show up while I am editing.My website is not functioning how I want it to on mobile, is there a plug-in I can get to optimize the mobile version?. I have image carousels that I set up using Elementor, and on desktop the images are in the correct order. However, when I view the site on mobile the images are not in the same order. Is there a way to fix this?. Most days when I take Adderall I feel focused, calm and productive. But sometimes I feel stimulated by the medication but still just so bored by everything that I can’t focus on anything. Nothing really sounds interesting. Music doesn’t excite me as much, I feel just kind of flat. I have also struggled with bipolar and I think it could be depression, being tired, or just not doing enough things that excite me. How do people deal with their boredom?. I take Vraylar, Lamotrigine, and Buspar. I want to take acid tomorrow but I am worried about it interacting with my meds. I know I should probably ask a doctor but they are closed today. I have taken it before but not for 7 years, before I was diagnosed, but I found it was actually excellent for my mental health. I am not too worried about it triggering an episode but I am more concerned about potential interactions. Has anyone else had this experience or have any advice?. I take Adderall, Lamotrigine, Buspar and Vraylar and have read they deplete nutrients. To what extent is this true?. My iCloud storage is full and I need to delete some of them but am wondering procreate saves them in its own application.I am used to working with alpha lock in Procreate, and am looking for a similar feature in the iPad app where I can draw only on top of the pixels already in the layer. I use hide transparent pixels on desktop but can’t find an iPad equivalent.I like to smoke a few hours after taking Adderall and I’m wondering what would be nice, I usually make art or clean. What do I do now? I am 50 pounds heavier than when I first recovered six years ago, and feel disgusting in my body. I am at the point where I don’t care anymore. My binging is worse than ever, I feel that I can’t control it, except for throwing up is the last way I know to fight back.When I lay in the sun naked, it feels better because the sun is reaching parts of my body that are normally clothed.I graduated college last year with an art degree and want to build my portfolio, and also want to take a course that helps me create originals designs while also learning essential programs, especially Adobe. I have a decent amount of knowledge with Photoshop and Illustrator, but am willing to learn new programs as well. Affordability is also a major plus. Thanks!. I am fairly experienced with mushrooms and want to set the intention of my next use to help myself quit nicotine, and reduce the amount of weed I consume, and curb my problem with binge eating. After some introspection, I realize these problems stem from the same root issue, but I think mushrooms could potentially help me get out of these unhealthy behavioral patterns. What are some things I could do while tripping to accomplish this ? Has anyone done this before and do you have advice?. Around 90% of my dreams are in houses and neighborhoods that I don’t recognize as somewhere I have been in my waking life. Is this unusual and what could it say about me?. How do both of the disorders interact with each other? I am diagnosed with bipolar and I suspect I have ADHD but I am also unsure if it is just symptoms of mood episodes.I just bought a cricut joy but I don’t have a printer, I am wondering where I would be able to get my designs printed onto vinyl sticker paper and card stock? I am in the U.S.I have been experiencing indigestion and fatigue, and I’m not completely sure if it is due to the medication, but I’m pretty sure the indigestion is caused by it. Does this go away with time? I have been on it for a month now, does anyone have tips on how to deal with it?. I’ve been using basic spackling paste (to patch walls) from the hardware store under oil painting for texture, but I am wondering if there are any major downsides to doing this?. I filled a rectangle with the live paint bucket tool, now I want to edit the rounded corners but the normal dots that show up to drag in the corners are not there.I have my stroke at 3pt, and after using the shape builder tool to clean up some lines the stroke weight looks like it has increased to be slightly thicker. Is there a way to fix this?. I am not asking for the best, I’m looking for the most affordable places you’ve found. It feels different this year, like there is more pollen or something. Is this just me or is there a scientific reason why?. I have had these visions before where there feels like something is stuck all over my shoulders and back, and correlates with pain in the area. It felt almost like conscious entity or parasite, and causing a lot of distress and anxiety. I even discussed it with a therapist and she instructed me to pick off the strings, to look at them closely and then release them. They seem to writhe and cling to me. It helps but it never feels like it is fully gone. What could this mean and what should I do to rid myself of it?.
    The 350cal demand is killing me. I know I could take it at dinner but I don't get my meds that early(My meds are given to me each night at around 7pm so I don't overdose, doctors orders). I'm thinking of geting just the Latuda early.. it just messes everything up. So I've been eating little debbies at night which are about 300cal. I don't want to gain weight from this. Any ideas?. How do you feel about your life? Do you feel satisfied? What gives you satisfaction? Do you feel like an adult? I'm on SSDI, and have been for like 6 years. I feel bad about my like, unsatisfied and pathetic. I do art and art commissions and that's the only thing I do that gives me satisfaction, but not real adult satisfaction. I feel like I'm perpetually a kid, living at my parents house. Everyone I went to college with is successful in their career. I forget how to even be an adult.. Is kinda scary... I'm supposed to start it tonight and it has some deadly side effects. Have other people has success with it? Oh, and if so, what do you eat for the 350cal that you have to eat with it? I bought some poptarts...recently I've been seeing stuff in my pereferal vision, like people and animals, and not like black shadows, like I could tell you how the person was dressed. When I turn my head to look there's nothing there. Also, I've had things flying across my vision, like tiny sparks. Is this normal human stuff, or something I should disclose to my doctor?. I'm about a month and a half in. So far no changes have happened other than back acne and smelly sweat... I told my mom I was considering HRT like 5 months ago and her reaction was no favorable. She basicalliy said she wished she would be dead before I did that... So, I haven't told her or my Dad I'm on it... How long do you think I can keep it up? I know everyone's different, but.. like 3 months? Should I just get it over now? Her first reaction really fucked me up. It's still fucking me up... I don't know what to do. Oh, I live with them.Has anyone taken benztropine for movement disorder(like tardive dyskinesia, mouth moving, teeth clenching, grimaching, blinking a lot) caused by an antipsychotic(in this case Seroquel which I just switched from abilify to, for my bipolar 1). It's causing my vision to go blurry. I can't read the text on TikTok... That's listed as one of the side effects, but on different sites it's listed as differnt severities. I do not like this blurred vision. It is rather alarming. Has anyone experienced this before?. I woke up in the middle of the night covered in sweat and I could smell myself.. I've never had an oder. When I woke this morning I was smelly and had to shower! I used to be able to get away with every other day showers but I guess that's over... 1.5 months on T and so far its back acne, my pee smells weird and now I'm sweaty and stinky XDD Give me some bottom growth or horneyness or dear sweet T gods!. Has anyone had this before? What was it like. I just got perscribed it and took my first dose for involentary movements caused by Seroquel.(teeth clenching, eyes blinking, tongue moving, mouth moving) Everything online seems to say sleepyness is a big side effect. I've never tried a med of this class. I'm kinda nervous.. Like.. weird. Like when I was in the bathroom the floor looked like it was slanted, and I keep seeing this light out of the corner of my eye and something move past me. And I feel super off. My head is tingling and the world isn't real. I don't recognize myself in the mirror. It's hard to write this..Any suggestions on how to handle it? I know how to handle facial acne, but what do I do with acne I can/can't barely reach? I was hoping my first effect would be bottom growth -\_- at least I know it's working. (Im a month and a week in, ignore the stated start date I stopped for a week or two). For over a month(I think?) I was in a depressive episode, ended up in the hospital and now an IOP. But we switched me off Abilify and onto a higher XR dose of Seroquel. It felt like the depression was lifting. It's only been a week(?), I've started to have some concerning possibly(waiting to hear from the doctor) tardive dyskinesia symptoms involving my jaw and mouth. But the law two days I've been depressed again and having suicidal ideation. -\_- I don't want to do another med change. I have bad insomnia and seroquel helps. But i'm in the "I don't want to exist, what is the point of being alive" stage. and it's only down from here..and I SH'ed yesterday and want to today. Uhg why is this illness so... stupid. I have an appointment tuesday with the doc.. well nurse practitioner.. last appointment was really lame. He had a student and the student did the questions and it was all rather pointless. What do I do...I'm out to my parents. They don't respect anything, name, pronouns, they basically said they loved me but that was as far as they go. I told my mom I was thinking of starting T like 6 months ago and she said "Id wish'd Id have been dead before this" and a bunch of other hate. It really cut me up and confused me for a while. I'm a month into T, and I haven't told my parents. I don't want to feel the pain of the cruel things they will say. I know I can't not tell them forever. There going to notice when my voice changes. I know I'm an adult and should be able to handle this, but it's special circumstances. I'm not treated as an adult. I'm disabled due to severe mental illness. I have to live here. I can't aford otherwise. There are things that are taken care of that further make feel less adult, like my medication is kept from me and given to me every night(per doctors orders). There are times I'm not aloud to close my door when I'm not doing well. They wanted to take over my finances, but I wouldn't let it go that far... Anyway so my relationship with my parents is weird for a 35 year old. It's more like a teenager. They have a lot of influence over me. I don't want them to convince me to stop taking T. Im REALLY afraid for in a year when I am able to get top surgery, and how they will react. -\_-. "Uh, no. I like dudes, it's pretty simple, you mean my gender is confusing. Those two things are different" "Oh, yea" Conversation with my mom today... It's been like 10 months since I came out to my parents. It might not be confusing if they did any research at all, acknowledged it at all.. called my by my name and pronouns even once, stopped pretending this isn't happening. -\_- I'm on T now and I haven't told them... and I live with them. I don't know how to navigate this fucked up situation. When I told my mom I was THINKING about T she said "Id wished Id have been dead before you started that"(not exact quote) and a whole lot of other cruel things. So, I'm a month in, and they don't know. Why can't they just be like those accepting parents. That drive you to top surgery..When she shows up in season 12.. I don't know, she just is so annoying. I can't even entirely put my finger on why, but I hate her. I don't know if this is a common feeling or if others really like her. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. My ex*(it's complicated)*in-laws started using my correct name and pronouns without me even coming out to them. I didn't even do a big coming out on Facebook. I told one person in a thread of comments "actually I go by Elliot now", and they picked that up and made the switch. They are the nicest most kind people I have ever known. They treat me like one of their own. My ex*(it really is complicated)* husband passed away. We were/are all crushed, and formed a really strong bond because of it. Anyway, they are really strong christians so I didn't know how they would react. I still plan to formally come out to them, but it makes me whell up seeing my MIL call me the right name on FB. My own mother and father refuse to use my name and pronouns. There are good people out there..So I was on T for almost a month when I suddenly got really freaked out and stopped like a week ago.. I got really scared I would regret the permanent changes, facial hair, hair loss, voice drop.. and what if I'm not really a trans man, because I kept looking at other men and not wanting to be them. Yesterday I had to go out to walmart and dinner and the pharmacy with my mom and it was torture. I wanted to curl in on myself. Everyone calling me miss or mam. I could feel them seeing me and thinking I was a girl and I felt disgusting. Everytime I opened my mouth to talk I gave myself away. I almost had the pharmacist think I was picking up some other person's scripts with a girls name, but he figured it out. I hated it so much. The only way I'm going to pass is with T. Not passing is so hard on my psyche. I don't know what to do. Should I go back on T? Would you go back on T?. Nothing feels right. It's like I took acid and things are sorta not real. I keep getting stuck standing places just staring. My whole body feels weird, my brain feels tingly. I don't know what this it. I'm in the middle of switching from one antipsychotic to another (abilify --> seroquel). I assume it has to do with that. I have diagnosed bipolar 1, CPTSD, GAD w/ panic attacks and a few other dxs... I feel crazy... Should I tell my doctor? Maybe it will mellow out.Im at almost a month on T and I'm suddenly panicing that I'm wrong and I'm not really a trans man. I'm not a woman though. I'm afraid I'm making a mistake with T and I'll regret like my voice and facial hair. When I started the T I didn't feel this way. Since then I've slipped into a depressive episode(I'm bipolar) and I don't know if that's why I'm feeling like this... I don't know what to do. I just wish I was cis. I'm so afraid of being trans and other peoples reactions to me. Should I take a break from the T, and lose any progress I'm made..? I wish I could hear how my voice is going to sound... or not get facial hair(though I probably won't get a lot if I'm looking at my genetics). So I have two appointments tomorrow, one with my therapist and one with an IOP instake. It's also my brother's birthday(he cares very little but of course I want him to have a good day) I've been really in a really bad place. I can't stop the dangerous thoughts, varying from just passing to planning. I'm spending all my time in bed crying and I hurt so bad. If I tell this to them, there is a chance they will want me to go to the hospital. I dunno, maybe not. Either way I just wanted to give my mom a heads up, and she was like "oh that will ruin your brother birthday and make him sad, can't you go later?" I said I didn't really have a choice when. Should I not be honest with them? and she was just yea but he will be sad. I don't know what to do.. lie to the therapist and intake therapist? I don't want to be the one to make my brother sad... He's my best friend.. So, I have 5 older brother. 4 out of the 5 of them(one of them we joke is the mailmans son) all went through puberty very late and it wasn't "strong". They are lanky and have very little to no body hair. They did all go from being the smallest kid to being tall. They can't grow full beards. One of them hasn't shaved in a year he said and he just has a small mustache. Anyway, So Im like on week 3, I KNOW it's still super duper early, but I've seen 0 effects. I'm not even horney, like at all. I was wondering if it's possible that my T experience will echo my brothers puberties. At least in some ways.. I was filling out paperwork and had to put if I was on steroids... and google wasn't helpful. I just put yes, because its for a therapy program and they know I'm trans, but I'm wondering.I can't remember if this it typical, but I'm like sore and heavy all over. I'm quite depressed. In an episode brought on by circumstances. I was in the hospital 2 weeks ago. I'm supposed to be in an IOP but they didn't contact me. It hurts.. So I'm just over 2 weeks on T. I also have pretty severe bipolar 1, CPTSD, and GAD w/ panic attacks. I was just in the hospital the other week(start of T). My doctor warned me being on T could flare up my bipolar or possibly make it better. It seems to be flaring. I feel very depressed. I'm supposed to start an IOP(instensive outpatient program, therapy program) to get me through what's going on... Anyway. Did anyone else with mental illness deal with this? I know people say it improved their mental health, but what about the opposite?. Like, it just "hurts" there in a certain way. Does anyone else get this. It makes me want to punch it. I'm still overall depressed but it's really concentrated there. (I'm bipolar 1, GAD w/panic attacks, and CPTSD). Mine is 50mg/5g 1% testosterone. I've seen other people's starter dose be lower than this. I was just wondering what the average is. My doctors never worked with gel and thus had no real idea what he was doing. So I wondered if my dose was high or just normal...I know everyone is different, just curious.So I’m in a bad place. I was in the hospital last week. My pdoc wants me in an IOP I’ve done before multiple times. Has anyone else done the same IOP over and over before? I feel like a weirdo…. Bottom growth? I'm on day 7 of T. Waiting to feel some bottom growth, but I don't even know what I'm waiting to feel. Everyone seems to know instinctually. Also I'm starting from a very small place :< like the size of a pea... will that effect it or is it all genetics?. So I’m 5 days on T and since the second day I’ve been having heart palpitations. I talked to my doctor on the third day and he said that it’s not a symptom of T and probably my afib but it’s persisting. Anyone else get palpitations from T?. 1 day long. My psychiatrist was going to pink slip me if I didn't go in and in the end they kept me 24 hours. I'm still having bad thoughts. I wasn't in the hospital, if they knew how I would feel when I left they would probably kept me longer. I think they wanted my bed. A day was fine by me because there was so much yelling and screaming on this ward... Anyway, anyone ever had a stay shorter, or equal?. Curiosity. **Do you wear it all day**? Do you wear it only when you have to, like when you are going out in public? Do you wear it just part of the day? **Do you have different strengths for different situations**? (I have a mild binder(ForThem) an older GC2B that binds less an new GC2B that binds more and a Spectrum that is very tight) **Do people know you bind**?(my family has never asked) **Do you like binding**? Or does it feel sophocating? I don't wear mine all day, dispite having bad top disphoria. I get too much pain in my sternum and feel too locked in. Though, sometimes I like it, it feels like a hug.. My doctor said the T can cause episodes to happen and I should be on the look out. Has anyone had that happen? Are you medicated. Im on 5 meds(more for side effects too). So, I wonder if they will keep me stable. But today all the sudden I got in a piss poor mood and felt really depressed. It's only day 2 so Its probably unrelated... On a side note I've also been having heart palpatations...My doctor was unfamiliar with them so had no advice whatsoever. The pharmacy said there would instruction in the box and there wern't. I know the basic, rub it on your shoulder or stomach, wash hands(difficult because I apply in my room), let it dry before putting your shirt on... is there anything else I need to know? Is it going to take longer to see results? Will some results come even slower like facial hair? I've seen stuff but I don't know what's true or not. Also, I dont want to transfer it to my pets and I'm worried about that...For T today after a 2 hour long doctors appointment(wheew)!! I just need to go get my bloodwork done and then they will send over the script. Does anyone know if T gel is covered by Medicare. The doctor had never worked with it and wasn't sure.YAY!!! Going tomorrow for the blood work :D. I'm embarking on really really trying to lose weight dispite being on two antipsychotics. I'm overweight because of them. Yesterday I was able to keep my calories in check. It's so hard because they make me sooo hungry. I'm on Metformin and Topiramate to help me.Has anyone been sucessful at losing weight? Any tips?I can't stand my body anymore \*TW\*I had >!anorexia !<for a decade off and on so this is just really hard. I feel like a fat gross pig that everyone hates and thinks is disgusting.I’ve had a rough week or so, my mood’s fluctuating all the time. Going from depressed and crying to feeling flat to ok to agitated.. really bad anxiety. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts but I think it’s more just thoughts. I did SI My mom has a stroke around when my moods started to deteriorate so I think that’s the triggerI don’t see my psychiatrist til week after next and therapist the week after that. Do I wait? I feel like a bother if I contact them. And who do I contact if I did?. I'm having mood swings and I don't know if it's bipolar related and I don't know why. I am going from crying in the middle of the day or angry to agitated to "normal" to excited ect. all throughout the day. I don't recall this ever happening before. Over the weekend I>! took too many of my meds!<(I already told my psychiatrist) and today I >!self harmed!<. I just don't know what this is? Ultradian cycling? I'm dealing with a really heavy phobia too that's just adding extreme anxiety to it all. I just keep breaking down. I don't know what to do. Tell my therapist(I dont see til the end of the month)? Ask for a sooner session with my psychiatrist(current is the 25th).
    Hi all. I’ve noticed something that is starting to concern me. Diagnosed Bipolar 1 + OCD as a teen.For context: For the past 3 years, I have had very irregular menstruation. I do not take birth control. I menstruate/get a period about 3 times a year if I’m lucky.I typically do not get ‘euphoric’ mania & am more prone to mixed episodes.I had a severe manic episode earlier this year that led me to not eat for nearly a week, lack of sleep, pacing back & forth, alongside a plethora of other manic symptoms. I was almost completely euphoric. During this time, I got the first period that I’ve had for a long while. Didn’t think much of it, just went to my doctor and had meds adjusted. Now, about 6 months later, I experienced heavy depression for a few days before jumping straight into a mixed mania. To my surprise, I started my period today, about 4 days after symptoms began. Still feeling mania building.Is the stress causing me to get my period? Is the period the reason I’m having mania? I had mania as a teen but also had a regular period growing up (until age 18/19).Am I misdiagnosed with bipolar? Could I have PMDD instead?. I feel like shit. I missed my psychiatry appointment today and need a refill on meds. Got charged for the appointment (it sucks but it’s my fault). Got too drunk last night, left my car at my friends an hour away because, ya know, I can’t drink and drive so I had to get a ride. Argued with my boyfriend. Made up. My mind’s all over the place. I’m going fast with no destination. I feel the need to do something but I don’t know what. I’m crawling out of my skin. I don’t want to bother those I love anymore. *I don’t want to be a burden.* I can’t sleep, goddammit. I’m prone to mixed episodes— so I guess that’s just the way my life goes. No euphoria, relatively little pure depression. Just chaos. Feels like I’m on this crazy ride that should be fun, but is instead scary and makes me want to throw up. Rant over. Thanks for reading!. Reposted to fix title **Background: Officially diagnosed at age 18. Psychotherapist suspected BP at age 16. Most symptoms began early teen/pre-teen (11-14) years, although some symptoms began even earlier. Currently 21.**Hi all! I wanted to hear some experiences, stories, etc. about whether or not your symptoms are worsening with age. Me, personally, I’ve noticed that my episodes are lasting much longer. I have been on & off (mostly off) medication since being diagnosed at 18. While my acute symptoms [drug use, wild actions, irritability, etc.] have gotten milder with age— my overall symptoms are worsening.Mania/Hypomania is not lasting weeks… it’s lasting months. My racing thoughts have taken over my life. I have blown through several credit cards. I have lose all of my hobbies, many of my friends, and my motivation in life. My thoughts are more discombobulated… my emotions are heavier. Depression(ish) was last felt several months ago. Mostly elevated, mixed symptoms this past calendar year.**Side note: I typically have mixed episodes.**I don’t know if it’s maturity and life experience that is wearing me down with having to deal with this illness, or if it may be getting worse. I think I experienced the most intense bout mania of my life just last month. I wasn’t eating, not sleeping, obsessively reading, maladaptive daydreaming and pacing around my room so much for several days until I got blisters on my feet… This caused me to seek help and get back on medicine. Currently on 900mg of Lithium + 20mg Latuda + 25 mg Hydroxyzine as needed. It has dampened the feelings a bit but they’re still… here? Very worried that things will just get worse from here.Would love to hear other experiences!. Hi all. I am on the Lo Loestrin combo pill. Just started this past month. I hadn’t had a period in over a year due to high testosterone. I started bleeding lightly into week 2.Unfortunately, I went on a spring break trip and forgot to back the BC. So I just came back and haven’t taken it for 3 days. I’m now bleeding **very heavily.** Do I just take 3 days of double pills? Should I call the doctor? Pregnancy is not a concern for me at this point, I’m just worried about taking it and not ruining the cycle.Hi everyone! So this is my first real snowboard season. I’m a diehard surfer, so wearing all this bulky gear to ride has been a really big change for me. I don’t know if this is why I’m getting a lot of pain? I’m wearing size 8 women’s Burton Mint Boas.I’ve tried wearing the boots super loose, super tight, in the middle, I’ve taken out the liners, etc. No matter what I do, my 3 outer toes on each foot (my middle toe to my pinky toe) go insanely numb and it feels like the balls of my feet are being squeezed super badly. BUT my heels won’t stop lifting. So I’m just not sure what to do. There’s a month left of the season here in SoCal so I want to get some new boots now that they’re on sale. Does anyone know any boot fitters in the Los Angeles area? Or Orange County? Or have any boot suggestions for “duck feet?” (Narrow heel and wide ball/toes). 21F, 5’2, 183lbs, size 8 (Women’s) shoes. Have snowboarded pretty much every other year since age 14. Definitely still a beginner but really wanna start getting into it more. Typically go to Mammoth, Tahoe, or Big Bear. I used to rent whatever the shop suggested (usually 144cm) since I was about 130lbs before. Had a bad snow experience when a rental shop put me in a 136cm years ago so I’m afraid of going too small. Put on a lot of weight since the pandemic so now that I’m looking to buy, I’m not sure what size I should go for? Most charts are saying 155-160. Working on losing weight but I know it’ll be a while. I’m a diehard surfer so I know how much size matters (lol). Is it supposed to be completely colorless like water? Or clear with color? (Similar to pee- yellow but translucent). My (21F) first colonoscopy is tomorrow morning. I’m on my first little jug of prep solution with 1 packet of the mix. Mixed it with water. It’s so horrid that I threw up a little bit. It says to finish within 30 minutes but I don’t think I can. Will this be detrimental? Also, is it normal to be nauseous?. My sound alerts originally never had a problem but now they either come through the actual monitor (instead of headphones) or they cannot be heard by me at all.Meanwhile, chat and viewers can hear them perfectly. How do I fix this?. Hi everyone, so: I had a fully verified order that I was scheduled to pick up from a Carvana Hub in a week. Plans changed so I edited my order and switched it to delivery (on a different date). On my app it’s showing that I everything is being reviewed and verified (again). I made a call to Customer Support who told me that everything is ‘good to go’ and fully verified - that I will be receiving my delivery on the date. But the app and website hasn’t updated. I also haven’t received the confirmation email. Anyone know how long it takes for it to change? Or for me to receive the email? I just like to have everything in place in case issues arrive. I’ve never bought a car online and am feeling kind of anxious, to be honest. I know the representative told me that everything is completely verified (documents, contract, etc.) and that my delivery is coming. But I like having the email and app as further confirmation. I received the first confirmation (before editing my order) via app and email within 20 minutes of submission of my documents & now the reconfirmation isn’t showing up anywhere.So we had 2 games today. Both games were against state championship level teams. We lost, no surprise there but I feel like it was an experience we/I needed.**There are only 7 of us total** (6 field + 1 goalie) so no subs. Apparently that’s how it’s going to be the entire season... the fatigue was REAL. We originally had 9 but 2 dropped due to injury.I was so exhausted that I had to sit out the last quarter and leave my team without a 6th. But I honestly thought I was going to vomit in the pool. Felt *so* bad and am hoping to not get so gassed next time.Lots of suit pulling, dirty kicks, scratching, etc. (initiated by the other teams defenders) but had fun overall. I just wish we had a bigger team because you can visually see how exhausted the entire team gets not having any subs :( especially with multiple games in a single day. Community college (California) women’s water polo to be exact. I swam competitively growing up and will be swimming for my school — but they needed extra players for the water polo team so I just joined late last week. Have only been to a couple of practices so far. We have a tournament coming up this weekend (Friday + Saturday) with 2 games each day. I’m not sure what to expect.I’m still so lost and confused on the rules. I’m not sure how aggressive to be, how much violence I should expect, etc. I’ve heard that the women play dirtier lol. So I’m just looking for some advice on what to expect during my first tournament!. I’ve been surfing since the summer after 5th grade, so about 10 years old. Learned on little 5’8 & 5’6 performance boards. I mean I surfed almost every single day between ages 13-17. I’m about to turn 20 and I kind of realized I still suck lmao. I can maybe do a crappy floater, weak snap, wobbly cutback, etc. Backside? Terrible haha! Only things I’m decent at are: pumping for speed down the line, foam climb, and occasionally - carving.I saw some videos/photos of me surfing as a little girl (like 12-16) and cringed because I swore I surfed better than that but I guess it just looks different from your own POV.I feel like it’s because I never really had like a mentor/coach/anyone to show me how to actually surf and don’t have a family that surfs. Just grabbed a cheap board and started paddling out. So I pretty much learned by watching other people and not developing proper technique. My surf friends dads all surf and they ended up way better than me.Think it’s worth it to get like a one time lesson from a coach just to see what I can improve on? Or is it too late for me to get much better? 😂**Edit: Thanks everyone for really great advice. Started thinking back and doing some reflection on the past 10 years of surfing - realized that one of the major components of me sucking now was my hesitation to actually TRY to put in effort and improve because I was insecure as a dumbass kid. Now, I’m gonna try other boards, surf a ton, and just fucking send it like I should have before. Gonna try out a lot of the advice I heard on here!!**. Hey guys. So I recently started Adult 1/2 and private coaching (hopefully will move up a level soon though, since I learned almost all of the 1+2 skills as a kid.) **EDIT: Being moved up a couple of levels and no longer taking group lessons - switched completely to privates**I know I put a majority of my weight on my right foot, so that might be the issue - but I had my skates (Jackson Artistes) fitted at a pro shop, baked, and even had a little foam arch insert put on the standard insole. No matter what I do, I get a lot of pain on my **right foot at the top of my arch, closest to the ball and inner edge of my foot.**My left foot doesn’t experience any pain whatsoever. I try rolling my foot on a ball, but I still get painful skating sessions. Is there a way to fix this? Perhaps gel insoles instead of the tiny foam pads? Exercises?. Hey all. So I learned how to surf on a shortboard when I was like 10 years old and really short/light… since then I’ve always pretty much used a small performance board or a funboard occasionally. I recently decided to start longboarding and bought a 9’0 x 23 x 3 single fin from a local shaper. It’s sort of a cross between a traditional log and a HPLB. I had a couple of fun rides but 99% were crap lol. Every time I would go for a bottom turn, I’d like stall and/or fall, I’d pop up way too late and go over the falls. When I surf backside I ended up at the bottom of the wave and had a hard time trimming to the top. Tried to do a little frontside cutback and it felt like I moved 3 inches before I ate shit.Overall, got a few decent cross steps in when surfing frontside. Backside I’m totally hopeless though. Any tips?. Hey guys. So I’m a beginner having an issue with Thai shorts. My Thai shorts look like tight little booty shorts on me, even at 2 sizes too big for my waist. I’m a 5’2 woman with an average/slightly chubby waist (size 6-8 pants in waist size) but huge thighs and butt. I often have trouble finding regular jeans that fit my legs and waist at the same time.While my legs harbor a chunk of my body fat, I also have a ton of muscle in my butt and thighs - if I flex they’re pretty defined and that’s not something I want to lose at all. So even with further weight loss I fear this will still be an issue, since I plan on keeping that leg muscle/definition and size.(The muscle is because I was a competitive swimmer until a year and a half ago and still work out). It seems that every pair of Thai shorts I buy, I have to purchase XL which is too large on the waist and too long on my short legs but **still** pretty tight around my butt and thighs...Are there any brands that have a bigger leg width?. Hey all! Got my first lash extension yesterday. The eye pads were a little irritating on my left eye but nothing too serious. It seemed like a pretty good experience.Now, I woke up this morning and attempted to put my contacts in. My right eye is totally fine, but my left on the other hand... hurts VERY badly when I try.It won’t keep the contact in, it burns like all hell, and now that I took it out - aches with 10000% pain. It’s also been red since yesterday.Anyone experience something similar?Edit: the top of my eye hurts as well, under my eyelid.I’m afraid of SJS since I haven’t taken it in a while... This is a new doctor and I stopped taking my lamictal (used to take 150 mg daily) a couple of weeks ago (mental breakdown lol) and she’s decided to continue me on lamictal and is starting me out on 100mg.This would be fine if I didn’t have a break in between. Should I get a second opinion?. Long story short: I’m third generation Bipolar 1. I also have Pure OCD, which means heavy intrusive thoughts that cause the WORST guilt - I skipped meds for a couple of days, went out with my boyfriend, drank too much, had a manic panic attack and got an ambulance called on me. Boyfriend thought I was having an asthma attack, turns out to be nothing but insane panic. Embarrassed myself in front on everybody, including patrons and medics. Finally told my boyfriend about my pOCD thoughts. Hate myself for it.Also! I got cosmetic surgery at 18 three weeks ago because fuck it, I’d rather be anyone else but me. I know I looked good before it, but that’s not the point. I just want to be someone else. Blew $6000 of credit to do it. Always having mixed episodes, having one right now. Wanting drugs even though I’ve been sober 6 months and just overall over it.Slept 4 hours in 2 days... surfed for 3 hours anyways despite the exhaustion. Barely ate.I’m tired of living with horrible thoughts and mania/depression mixed in. My 19th birthday is in 3 days. Maybe 19 years is enough for me.Thanks for listening.For context: I’m a 5’2 Filipina teen. I’m slightly darker than most of my cousins and I’ve never been more than 5~ pounds overweight until starting college last year. I’ve always been really lucky in the fat distribution department... as in it always goes to my butt, thighs, and breasts before getting to my stomach. This leaves me with a more hourglass/pear type shape. Throughout the years, I’ve grown more and more hateful of how I look. “You’re getting so fat” - Grandma says to me at 13... when I’m a US size 1 in pants. “When you go surfing - make sure you don’t get too dark. It looks dirty” - Dad says to me all the timeThis time last year, I loved my body. I had a normal BMI, I felt slim thick, and was starting life as an adult. During freshman year of college, I surfed as often as possible, got tanner and gained 10 lbs my first semester. Queue quarantine, and here comes another 10. No big deal right? I was a varsity athlete in high school, just gotta work and lose it!Wrong. All these years of body hate piled up to the point of depression. I couldn’t get up to work out because the jiggle of my newly earned fat bothered me to tears. All I could think about is “well... I was fat to my family even when I was at my skinniest... so why try?”Visits grandma and grandpa last month....”You are getting so fat. Your legs and butt are so huge. You need to work out. Stop eating.” “Why are you so dark?Stop going outside” Over and over and over.Visits uncle today “you’ve gained a lot of weight since you were 16 huh? I can tell.” Dad says at some point “Your stomach is fine, just need to tone up. But you need to lose the legs and a bit of your big butt. We’re Asian, we don’t look like that. We’re slim and beautiful.”???? Honestly guys. I’m not even burnt or heavily overweight! I actually feel like I have ideal measurements, especially with the trend being little waist + bigger bottoms nowadays (36 - 28 - 40) and I wear a US Size 6. But because I’m not fair skinned, because I’m not stick skinny, I just can’t feel pretty. Yesterday, a waitress at an outdoor dining restaurant told me randomly that she thought I was gorgeous, a passing person told me that I had a pretty face, and a group of ladies said that I had a rockin body. I went home and sobbed. Because it must all be lies right? Having a butt is crappy, being tan is crappy? It just makes my head fucking spin.Hey guys! So I got my braces on about a month ago (crossbite & crowding) I’ve never had crooked or problematic front teeth except for the overbite. But now one of my bottom teeth in the front is very crooked and super painful. Is this normal? It used to be completely straight.Recently turned 18, previous psychotherapists have always suggested Bipolar as a possibility to my self destructiveness and hyper activity - but never officially diagnosed until today. Type 1. Prescribed Lemictal today.For the past few days leading up to my appointment, it’s all I could think about. Now, it’s absolutely consumed my mind. Worrying, thinking about all the factors, it’s chipping away at my mind. I feel like I have no identity other than this disorder right now...Just a few weeks ago it was: “I am a **surfer,** an **artist,** a **partier,** somebody’s **girlfriend.** I am **someone**”But now it’s “I’m Bipolar.”I don’t know how to relax and remember that I am *more* than my illness.So I’ve been surfing since I was 11 years old (posting here since 13 lol) now currently 18. Mainly a shortboarder but enjoy logging from time to time. When I was younger it was: surfing everyday, practicing new skills and new maneuvers. I’ve noticed in the past year or so I’ve had kind of a standstill in progress. I don’t know if it was starting college, having less time to surf and growing up, but now it feels like I’m even WORSE of a surfer. (Let’s not forget the Freshman 15 I gained as a chick starting college) Also, the difference I’ve noticed between now and being a kid is the fear. I had no qualms about paddling into waves that were definitely out of my comfort zone and no fear of getting hurt. *Now* I get this hesitation to commit on certain waves because I’ve already gotten injured in the past (large gashes, badly sprained ankles, etc) Any tips to get back to the way it was before? Or anyone else feel the struggle? Lol. For 208 days, I sacrificed everything for someone who would not sacrifice for me. For 355 days, I felt more alone surrounded by people than I ever did when I was truly by myself. Yes, I kept count. I kept count of all the sleepless nights I spent, with flames all around me and no God in sight. I kept count of all the nightmares that hurt less than waking up. As I come to the end of my high school years, I have heard it all - as I'm sure many of you have. I have heard that things won't last forever, that people will come and go. Being young, dumb, and absolutely naive, I didn't believe a word. At 15 I knew everything, right? I didn't need anybody to tell me what to do.At 16, I felt untouchable. I was invincible from the sad songs and the unhappy endings. My life was perfect. A beautiful car, an amazing guy, the best friends I could've ever asked for. I had a college offer early on, straight A's and the days seemed to never end. I was a genius, right? I had it all figured out.At 17, I realized, I know nothing. My "best friend" and my "perfect boy" are in love. They went behind my back, they wish bad on me, they have forgotten about everything we've been through together. My other friends are nowhere to be found. I closed my eyes and looked behind and saw all of the moments that blinded me. I saw just how cruel the world could be. In the past few weeks, I grew up. I called on the people who called me, when they had nothing. The people who I had spent many hours comforting once. The ones who needed me and I came for. I needed them, I was lost. Surely, they would support me after an entire childhood of care. After all, I had been there for them. All those late pep talks, all of the hugs when they needed one. The universe reared its ugly head. I was ready to end it all. I didn't want to wake up anymore. So I called. And not a single person picked up the phone. Well, except for one. But guess what? They hung up. "I can't help you. I don't want to deal with you. Just move on. Just get over it"They had turned their back on me. Cue, 32 more nights of teary eyes and my audibly breaking heart. Half of those nights, being mocked, bullied, told I wasn't good enough. By the people who I love unconditionally.32 days of wishing them the best. 32 days of hoping that they are happy, even if they no longer care for me. And I forgave them. Even if they aren't sorry, I forgive them. They taught me things early on, after all.I learned, God, did I learn - to be so grateful for them walking away. I am thankful, for getting the chance to learn just how hurtful life could be. I am eternally happy, that I was taught to not be naive. Even more happy, that I learned how to love somebody. For the first time in all of those collective days, I am okay. I know how to live without movie expectations, how to see the signs of things crumbling apart. I know how to see when I'm being used, when people stop loving you. I am growing up.And growth is a lonely process. But, that's alright too.-n.s. Hi guys! Well this week has been crazy, crazy. Multiple big auditions to be a lead for well known projects, great paying jobs, etc.Well recently, my agent informed me I had an audition to be a series regular on an upcoming primetime show!!! It was a self tape through Eco Cast on AA. I feel like I NAILED IT! :) I can't give any details at all but I feel like I fit the character well.I know the deal - pretend that the audition never happened... If I hear back then cool, if I don't then don't sweat it. But if the news were to be good, how long do you think it would take to hear back? It's a SAG-AFTRA 1 hour episodic if that makes any difference.Thanks guys!. Hey guys! So here's the story. I'm a senior in high school, still a minor, and have been fortunate enough to have an amazing school and schedule that catered to my entertainment career. I have been accepted into my a couple of my top colleges and have set plans for my future, especially if acting ends up not a sustainable career for me. Well, tomorrow I have a BIG Final that is detrimental to my grade, passing high school, and keeping my admission to the colleges.And I had to give up a great acting opportunity that just so happens to be tomorrow...during my final.I know that it was right for me, but have any of you had to deal with this or something similar? Kind of wrenches my heart a bit to choose between two very important aspects in my life.Title pretty much says it all. I've posted on here throughout the years about bottom turns, speed, and learning snaps. Well - I've finally gotten the hang of it all (mostly).Except, ya know, frontside cutbacks. Backside I do pretty well, not always the most consistent, but I'm getting there.But I, for the life of me, cannot get a solid & clean cutback when I'm going left! (Goofy)I constantly lose speed and kind of flop out of the wave or I'm positioned wrong & I fall. Also tried turning my head to look over my shoulder like some said to do, and I lost major momentum. Help, any advice? D:. I had always believed that happiness was something I had yet to find. A needle in a stack of hay, a road I had not followed, or a diamond in the rough. It was not until recently that I had realized, happiness was not some secret treasure we were programmed to discover. Happiness is not found at all.**Happiness is built.**It is built in places, put together by various people in our lives, strung together by smells and things that we see everyday. It is the little moments and the big events that both destroy us and make us. And like that- my life had changed. I'll admit, I am very young. I have a whole lot of life to live, experience to gain, and lessons to learn. But after struggling with what seemed like a depression that would haunt me from my early teenage years till the end, I had finally opened my eyes. Build your happiness. Build it with songs that you can dance to and movies that you can cry to. Build it with people who make you laugh, who make you smile. Build it with the people who put you down, who never believed in you. In the long run, the ones who hurt you are the foundation of this house of happiness. In this world there are tilting towers that manage to stand even with a cracked foundation. Don't let the broken pieces of your foundation make you fall. Become a sight to see, a wonder, and an amazement. Leave people wondering, "How are they still standing?"The most broken things are the most beautiful. They've managed to survive despite the cracks. Yes, often enough a piece of that happiness does manage to chip away or fall off, it happens. But just because that piece is gone doesn't mean your happiness is any less, it's just different. Maybe it is no longer square, maybe it is a diamond, or a triangle. Maybe another piece will come along that just won't fit that old spot. Then you'll glue it onto another part and make your shape even more different. Maybe not as it used to be, but certainly not any less.Happiness isn't the ability to be happy when that shape is only big and shiny. True happiness is the ability to feel joy even when that shape is miniscule and minimal. It is what you make of it.-Natalie S.I've only had 2 snapchat streaks everrrr, I want more! Comment your Snap Username or Add me :)Snap: NatalieDaTurtle. Los Angeles... Celebrities down one block, hobos on another.Hey guys! Well to start off, I feel that my surfing has greatly improved since I started a few years ago. Carves, snaps, and all of the sort are finally becoming a routine part of my surfing. I'm a goofy footer so whenever I surf North LA points, I'm almost always surfing rights. My cuttys are decent but I can't seem to get enough speed to nail a good bs snap. Any advice?. Okay guys! Long time, no see. I'm preparing for a competition (not super big but new for me) this Saturday and I'm wondering "how should I go about getting ready for this?"I'm 14 and surfing in an Open Women's Division. Though most of the competitors are around 16-18. So I'm stoked.... And very scared. Although, I'm lucky to have very supportive (local/small time) sponsors who push me to not just excel, but have fun!I have a few days and I'm wondering: should I surf everyday? Or will I tire myself out? Scope out competition? Or just chill and do nothing and surf like normal? Maybe eat certain foods for energy and stuff?Thanks guys!!. **Background:** I'm a 14 year old girl who swims club and for my school. I also surf, so it might be another reason. My prime is Fly and I also try to mix in some distance swimming and sprints. My coaches have really been drilling us with some hard sets lately (tons of long distance swims, countless amounts of IMs, and some killer drills) and I've noticed that my shoulders (especially my right shoulder, I am right handed so maybe why) have been getting worsening pain. The pain is sharp and aching, and makes practice a struggle sometimes. Yesterday, during a 100 IM which is usually pretty easy, was unbearable on my shoulders. What should I do to fix this? I'm concerned about it affecting my swimming and general lifestyle.Do you guys know any "unknown" wetsuit brands? I have a bunch of Body Glove, Roxy, O'Neill suits but I wanna start trying out lesser known brands. For example, Janga Revolt, Glide Soul, etc. I like trying out different brands and seeing which one is really good.. In one session I got a snapped board, got caught inside, and the one that scared me the most? My leash wrapping around my ankles after a wipeout. The first 2 are no big deal, but my leash wrapping around my ankles really scared me, especially since it was slightly overhead.So guys, what do you do in that situation? Honestly... I panicked. I was alone, my friends went to go get food and neither of my parents weren't there. I couldn't swim at all, what should I have done instead of panicking and thrashing?.
    First I just want to say that I have not been diagnosed by a doctor or psychiatrist or anything & that is because I just cannot afford to get one. Looking at the symptom list of bipolar, every single one matches me exactly so that is why I believe I am bipolar. Recently my mood swings have been getting out of control every single day, I am constantly going from high to low but mostly I have been feeling really low. Everyday for the past week I’ve been having an outburst of crying, it happens during the day & at night. It’s getting to the point where I don’t really want to do any of this anymore and I just don’t know what to do about it. Is there anyway I can get my hands on some medication that treats bipolar without a prescription from a doctor? I would like to try and see if it at least helps because I don’t think I can get any worse then how I am right now. I was looking to go too day 1 of give thanks next month and I see it’s at the cow palace arena. I’ve never been to that event center before so I’m wondering if anyone knows if it’s a good spot? And when I say good spot I mean, does the dance floor get jam packed to the point you can’t move around much or is there usually plenty of space. Or if the sound quality there is usually poor or good?. need a little guidance if anybody can help me. I’m still trying to file my taxes from last year on turbotax. The only problem is that I can’t figure out how to put in my write offs. For example where do I go to type in my mileage & all the maintenance I did on my car during my time as a courier?. I need a little guidance if anybody can help me. I’m still trying to file my taxes from last year on turbotax. The only problem is that I can’t figure out how to put in my write offs. For example where do I go to type in my mileage & all the maintenance I did on my car during my time as a courier?. so I’m near the end of my 2nd month, first month I was on 40mg, this month im on 80mg a day. I ended up getting really sick and pretty depressed for a whole week and I didn’t take the pills that whole week. Did I mess the process up or can I just continue it?. Just started playing again and no groups will invite me because I don’t have any “logs” to link. Im a 5200 gs ret & I played back in OG wrath so I know every fight and I know how to press my 4 button rotation. The entire log thing is just so frustrating like this wasn’t even a thing back in the day, like back then you just linked gs & achievements and go. If people played shitty then you just never invite them again. Logging ruins the whole experience and you can’t convince me otherwise. What’s the realistic price people will charge for prim saronite on that first week of icc on bene alliance? I believe you need 25 of them for one of the early smourne quest. New to the game with 3 badges, looking for an eevee if anybody has extras laying around. Just like the title says, im looking to do a quick trade to evolve my haunter into gengar. I’m a noob with 3 badges somebody help plss. so I bought an oz of albino penis envy the other day and is it as strong as people say it is? I’ve done 5 grams on another albino strain and had a blast but ive never done penis envy strain before. would like 2 grams of this strain really knock me off my ass?. I have 1 torch ticket in la that I am selling, getting rid of it for face value and it’s transferable on Ticketmaster. Dm if interested please. I wondering if anyone else has experienced this, I have $58 in my earnings total for this week but my balance is only at $32? I haven’t delivered in 2 days so all the tips should be settled in and I didn’t do any cash outs. I called support and sat on the phone for 45minuted bc they all kept transferring me to different departments, talked to 6 people and they were all clueless asf. like wtf happend to my other $25?. so i recently bought 7gs of shroomies, it’s been about 5-6 months since my last big trip and my last trip i ate 5gs. i handled the trip well and enjoyed it and so now I’m now thinking of just eating this entire 7g. is there much of a difference between 5g and 7g? or should maybe I start with eating 6g and making my way up?. So I’m wondering if anyone who actually knows, are caps way more potent then stems? I’ve had people tell me that caps are the only part you’d wanna eat cause it has all the psycoblin or however you say it. and then I’ve had people tell me stems and caps are all the same. I’m just wanting to know what is right. i was wondering if anybody could send me a picture of what a microdose shroom actually looks like. anywhere between 100-200mg would be good i just can’t find any pictures online. I have a scale that I use to weigh it out but I’m just not sure if I’m doing it right and just want to compare the sizes. Selling a 2 day GA voyd in the caverns ticket for $150, dm of interested. so i just did about a 5.5 🍄 trip and i would say that i just experienced what people call “ego death”. this was the most I’ve ever taken and it was completely different then any other trip i had done. it’s hard to put into words but during the trip i saw and felt all of life and then i saw and felt all of death, it was pretty terrifying at first, it had felt like i was actually dying, in a way it felt like i did die. and then it felt like i was reborn after i experienced death, it was all honestly hella wild lol. it also felt like i was in a presence of a higher being, im not really a religious person at all but i do believe now that there is a higher power out there. i also remember seeing good and evil, i can’t really put into words what i saw with the good and evil but i remember i just felt both of them. the evil part was a bit terrifying and it was like i was in the presence of some very dark beings.. but coming out of the trip i feel like im looking at life now from a whole different perspective, i feel like i understand just life in general now. if anyone else has experienced anything similar to this id love to hear about itedit: i also remember seeing a woman, i can’t describe what she really looked like but she brought peace to me in a way, it felt like she was the mother of everything, maybe even god? but it felt like she was with me for a good amount of the trip. in a way she told me that our woman on this earth are very precious beings and we must always protect them. i remember she showed me what it was like to love and then what it was like to lose love. she showed me what it was like to have a child and then what it was like to lose a child, and she showed me that a mother would do anything for that child no matter the cost. last week i macrodosed 3g of shroomies and the experience was amazing and the visuals were insane but not too intense. however i didn’t get the “afterglow” that ive seen people talk about and i ended up feeling back to normal at the end of it, so yesterday i went and did a 4g dose and it was completely different from the 3g dose that i did. it was definitely a lot more intense, I couldn’t really keep my eyes close and enjoy my music like i did during the 3 g trip and was wide awake the whole time and it was like i stepped into a whole different reality and for a bit i thought i got trapped in that reality and couldn’t get out lol and i saw many things that i wouldn’t even know how to explain. but i do feel that “afterglow” people are talking about and i just feel so amazing after that trip. it also opened up my mind into believing that there are different realities and realms connected to ours that we can’t see, does anybody else feel like this also?. i started microdosing about a month ago and i was taking the ones with golden caps and i just picked some more up and the guy said these were white rhinos, does anybody know the difference between the gold caps and white caps? for microdosing and macrodosing, i did 3 grams of the gold ones the other day and loved the trip so hoping these can be similar. i took 3 grams of shrooms today and it was all amazing, i started microdosing 5 days a week 1 month ago and i decided I wanted to try out macrodosing so i started with 3 grams to try and get the full experience. stayed in my room for most of the time because it felt like my safe place and i listened to a lot of griz and some other mixes that played the same genre as him and just closing your eyes with the music going is a whole other adventure and when i had my eyes open the visuals were insane and i loved it, i just let it all play out, whatever thoughts and feelings came up i just let it run it’s course. i think im going to add macrodosing into my microdosing schedule, im thinking every other week ill do it and I think next time I’m going to up it to 4 grams and then possibly 5 grams after that to get a deeper experience. if anyone experience had any type of advice to give id appreciate it. wassup y’all i got a quick question on my microdose. im about to start week 4, my first week i started at .10 second week i upped it to .15 and week 3 i was doing .18 and looking to go .20 for this week 4 and im thinking of maxing it out at .25 for a while maybe? but anyway my question is from what ive been reading on here is that you’re not supposed to feel any effects from microdosing at all, but when i take it i get this rush of energy that’s good and gets me going, im not high but i feel focused and i know the good energy rush feeling is from the shroom but im not supposed to be feeling it right? or is it fine to feel that rush or should i lower the dose because im not suppose to feel it? i started taking it to help with anxiety / depression and it’s honestly helped a lot i haven’t really had any type of bad thoughts since the end of week 1. it feels like my social anxiety has got a lot better i can say what i need to say, and even on my days off i actually feel really good, (5:2) is my schedule. im looking to keep doing it for a long time and just want the best long term positive effects it can give, just not sure if i should lower back down on dosage to get rid of the energy rush but i do like the energy rush it’s been giving. hey y’all im selling a 3 day vip ticket for $380 and a 3 day vip parking for $100 both are under face value so don’t really want to go lower then those prices. however if you want to take both off my hands im willing to knock down the price from $480 to good ole $420 for both . im doing ever after festival in august and lost lands end of September and decided doing a b2b2b2b festival isn’t smart for me rn lol, hmu if interested PayPal goods n service only thanks.
    I went off my medication 4 days ago. I was very stable on my meds for 2 years and I felt like something snapped last week. I just stopped taking the pill that I know has given me the chance to build everything I have. I’m 19 and am planning on graduating university almost two years early. I have a loving family and partner that want to see me succeed. I have everything I could ever want. Why do I want to sabotage myself so bad? Why am I pursuing a fake euphoria that gives me an illusion of complete joy? It’s wrong, destructive, and a complete hell, but I feel addicted to it. I’ve tried so hard to achieve everything I have, and my brain is telling me to destroy it. I know people would kill to have the stability I’ve established. I’m filled with hate for myself for wanting to ruin what I’ve built. But I don’t want to stop and I feel like I will never change. I’m becoming a worse version of myself every second, but I can’t stop. Has anyone fought this? What do I do?. I’m entering the second year of my bachelors in HR and would like to hear any general advice about this career path. I’m working my first HR internship at a small biotech company. I’ve been pretty discouraged every time I read the posts in the HR sub because it’s a lot of negative comments from people wanting to leave, which makes sense from its reputation as I’ve seen so far.I chose this major because I was more interested in a career geared towards soft skills/people management and didn’t feel that I would enjoy or excel at other business functions like MIS or finance. HR professionals, which parts of HR provided the best work life balance for you? How about salary? Which industries can HR skillsets transfer into? Project/general management?If anyone has any advice for a very young student interested in HR having doubts about the profession, I’d really appreciate it. I know I have a long way to go and don’t have to figure everything out now, but some guidance aside from my regular mentors would be extremely helpful.Hello, I’m currently a freshman in college studying healthcare management and have been considering changing my major to Human Resource Management. Does anyone have any insight on this degree and advice for switching? I learned that I didn’t want to enter the healthcare field and that I want a career with more stable internship/job opportunities following graduation, which seemed more scarce in healthcare administration. I’m also more interested in HR processes like recruiting and employee relations than being involved in healthcare.How would I figure out if this major is right for me? Does major not matter as much as experience? What other positions besides HR could I enter with this degree? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Are there any Human Resource Management majors who can give me some advice over switching? Any insight about the program would be greatly appreciated. I’m planning on speaking to advisors as well and wanted to hear about other students’ experiences. Please feel free to DM if you have any guidance!. Hi, is anyone majoring in undergrad Healthcare Management or Supply Chain Management? I’m an incoming freshman entering HCM and was wanting some input from other students on what the program was like. I’ve heard that it’s more difficult to land a job after graduation compared to other JSOM majors, and that most healthcare administration jobs are taken by people with clinical backgrounds. Since I’ve been doubting this major, I’ve been looking into SCM and would also like to hear about other students’ experiences in this program. Please me know what you like about HCM or SCM, internships, job security, or anything you think I should be aware of! Also, who to talk to about these sort of questions/how to get ahold of people in my program?. Hello, I have a few questions for people who have experience within the healthcare administration industry. I’m entering a healthcare management undergrad program as a freshman in the fall and wanted to know about the possible pathways I could take. I know I can enter positions like Clinic Management, Hospital Director, and Healthcare Policy, but what exactly would I be doing?? I feel like I chose a major instead of researching a career field first, and I don’t want to panic, but am constantly wondering what I’m going into. 1. What area of healthcare management do you work in? How did you get there, and what do you do all day?2. What is the job security in healthcare administration like? I’m in the DFW area.3. Which areas have the best work-life balance?4. Do you have any clinical training? What education do you have?. Hi all, I’m a high school senior seeking guidance on pursuing clinical psychology. Apologies if this is a simple question or if I sound a little ignorant and lost (I am), but any advice would be greatly appreciated! I’m planning on majoring in Healthcare Management in college (US) this fall and was wondering what I need to focus on during my undergrad years. I would love to have a pathway towards owning a private practice focusing on psychological assessments, treatment plans, and therapy rather than research (is this a possible career choice?) and am planning to apply to doctoral programs when the time comes. I know PhDs are more research based, so would a PsyD be a better fit for this? Another problem is, I’m not sure if my major will complement my interests or career requirements in psychology. Would finding research/volunteer opportunities within my psych school, in addition to taking psych courses as electives for my business major, be enough to lead me into a graduate program (and eventually to my dream of owning a private practice)? Or does it depend on each graduate school?What do I need to focus on, discuss with advisors, and do during these four years before grad school as a business major?. Hi all, hope everyone is ok. I’m in my senior year of hs and I’ve missed more than a month of school. I realized that I haven’t ever had a normal year of high school, since I’d gotten hospitalized freshman and sophomore year, then corona hit and I was *magically* stable being on meds and without the stressors of in-person school. My meds have just gone up today and I just wanted to send hugs and moral support to anyone (especially young people and teenagers) who are just beginning to figure out they’ve got this illness. My heart bleeds for anyone afflicted by bipolar and I genuinely wish for all its victims to see hope. There’s always going to be better days, months, years, people, and things. This too shall pass.With that being said, I really am struggling right now and just wanted to write this to maybe feel a little heard. My friends and family have their own share of mental issues, but I never feel too comfortable discussing this stuff at depth. So I hope someone out there relates to me, the pain, and the suffering that I’ve been going through. Keep hope and look up. ❤️‍🩹. Does anyone know what the max AES amount is for incoming freshmen (class of 2026) or the tiers? I believe tuition for next year is about 16k and haven't yet heard about anyone getting a stipend, only 16k max.Has anyone previously sent in requests for AES reconsideration?. Hi all, I just got new ACT scores and got a superscore that is 1 point higher than the composite score I sent in with my application back in September. Does anyone know if I should send this superscore (34) right now and if it'll increase my chances at a higher AES scholarship even though I was accepted a couple months ago? Or should I just wait for an AES reconsideration form after hearing about scholarship results? (sorry if this has been asked, just wondering if anyone has had any similar experience with the scholarship lords). high school senior here working on my UTD application. can anyone tell me about their magical encounters with the AES scholarship? wondering if it's better to apply early right now and just appeal later in case i get a higher test score.i've heard that they've gotten really stingy with the awards during the past two years, even with kids who have crazy high stats. any advice/experience from AES awards?. I'm looking for songs or artists that use quick and aggressive drum breaks with vocals. I've listened to some 90s DNB like Prodigy and some more experimental stuff like Flying Lotus and Aphex Twin, but are there any more songs that use these types of instrumentals with vocals instead of just ad libs and filler lines? Any other newish dance beats similar to these would also be great. I also like Miss Camaraderie by Azealia Banks and Machine Girl, same with Crystal Castles and (unfortunately) Brooklyn Blood Pop by Syko. Experimental tracks with quick drums would also be appreciated, but I'm mainly looking for ones with interesting vocals. Thank you!. Hello, I'm looking for a birthday gift idea for my brother, who is a big Forge of Empires player. Does anyone know of any good (preferably affordable) physical gifts related to the game? I believe he has been staying in the iron age for a few months. I have been trying to find something like a plushy or model that would represent the game. Thank you to anyone who has any ideas.I'm trying to get some inspiration to make my own synthpop music, and I really love songs like Hey Moon by John Maus, Space Song by Beach House, Interloper by Holy Wave, and Never Tell by Black Marble. I am a big fan of lofi bedroom pop/ indie artists like Teen Suicide, and am looking for some tracks that are also similar to Mac Demarco's synthy songs like On The Level and Chamber of Reflection. Please list any artists or albums that you think I'd enjoy!.
    I feel so worthless, empty that I just want to isolate from the world. I feel like a monster that doesn't deserve love or appreciation. I want to live in isolation. I am so depressed and scared. I don't know how to cope beyond taking meds and coming here looking for help. I feel ugly, loser, bad person, disgusting or at least that's what I have been told during all my life by my family and my ex boyfriend. The days pass fast and nobody is on here, everybody is busy, everybody never answers or cares unless I offer them money. I have no self worth and I am tired of trying. I just can't hold so much more this.Thise was a relationship with a narcissistic that destroyed me.I'm a 30 yo loser, with no friends and that falls in love with anybody that gives any bit of attention just to end up being rejected! The person I like usually finds someone better. Is like I am never enough. I just want to isolate and be happy without being hurted. It might be something bad on me. I know. I am so stupid.Somebody wants to talk? I am so sad tonight. I am bipolar and was chatting with a guy for months just to end up being in love and rejected like usually.Recently I experienced the death of a beloved one, and since then I find myself ruminating about what is the meaning of life? I don't really find happiness on getting a bunch of money, fame or power. Philosophy says the true meaning of life is being happy bur how? I remember when I was an small girl and had so many dreams about beauty, money and love thinking I would be happy. Then I got sick, got the money and the beauty but lose it all as well, I was never truly happy and now I wonder what else? What is the purpose of my existence? I am pretty aware that I will never be able to be loved and I am here just existing. Just depending on a pill...I am scared to death of being in a relationship and being in love. However when I got manic is like if a completely different person took my body and started to install dating apps and talk to humans there. When my depression hits I have heavy panic attacks because of that dating app. I have figured out to better focus on other stuff rather than being on Tinder. I don't know how long will this last (probably until I get manic again) but to me is so refreshing being by my own and focus on other hobbies. It's mentally draining to constantly deal with ghosting, rejection, insults, drug addicts, crazy people, people who want sex, etc etc At this moment I just want to ease my brain and I hope I can continue with this even if I am manic or not. And as the title says I was banned during my uninstalled/installed of that app. I am happy now :) I just want to isolate from everything.My mental health has been so bad lately. Having constant anxiety and depression. Makes me miss being hypomanic! I am not being productive at all. I just spend the whole day in my house/bed because I am scared. I have been taking my meds and more but I still feel very sick.My only online friend usually tends to make bad comments about me like criticize my every day progress and my life in general which constantly causes my anxiety to go to the roof and panic attacks today I explode and told him the truth that I am mentally ill and that I am doing my best to overcome this and not letting this to define me but after that rant I feel so embarrassed because I wrote him like 100 texts saying and explaining him how his constant criticism affects me. And he only say "relax". I know we shouldn't be friends because he is pretty much toxic but I don't want to be alone :(((. Between the super extroverted easy going talkative human or the depressed human there is me hidden from everybody a shy introverted calmed human being. I wish I were more stable from time to time.I met this person online and it has become my best friend but they have a bitter personality and often make bad comments about me about what I am. But most of the causes of them are my illness. And everytime he criticize me I have a bad panic attack for sure so we were arguing today and I told him to stop because I was going to have a panic attack because I am mentally ill. I don't know how he will react to this, because who would like someone that gets mood swings, panic attacks and heavy anxiety? Thank you to this amazing community for all the support it has given me! Thank you.
    Ive been doing bad recently, missing classes, sleeping through rehearsals and appointments, i can barely wake up in the morning and im lucky if i actually do. It feels like all i want to do is sleep and rot in my bed. Im asking for some tips or advice on how others kind of help themselves with this problem. I just need to get my life together, it feels like its falling apart.i havent really felt this way in a hot second. its gotten back to the constant thought of just ending things. Ive lost alot of drive and love thinking about my future. i know this comes and goes so i guess i really do plan on sticking it out. But its scary when its like this. not so situational. its just a feeling i have in me thats changed. self harm is sounding more appealing and i haven’t actively participated in that in a couple years. I really hate myself.Im hanging on tooth and nail and it seems like everything is falling apart. I can tell that i want to just rot and cry and lay in bed all day. everything sounds exhausting and every little thing irritates me. But ive been forcing myself to go to classes hang out with people and not let this depressive episode get its grubby little hands on me. its starting to not work and i feel like an absolute failure. i have totally embarrassed myself several times the past few days. it just feels like im never allowed to not be okay. its a trauma olympics with my friends. im not giving up i just cant i know it will make everything i think is so bad right now so much worse but i wish i could have a break. I wish i had someone to talk to. and unfortunately right now i dont. ive been keeping up with my bipolar all on my own with no medication and a sorry excuse for a support system for so long. im exhausted.I hate my hometown. This place is awful. its small. and everyone is nosy as all hell. everyone knows your shit even if you don’t know them. And don’t get me started on how judgmental every single person is, EVERYTHING I DO IS SCRUTINIZED. And honestly the worst part isn’t even because of how terrible this place is but rather my immediate family. My father is a miserable, angry, retired correctional officer and god i cant stand him. I love him so dearly but god it feels like he hates me. i am never good enough for him and he loves to take out all his anger on me. Im usually away at college but obviously i’m home for the summer and i don’t know how I’m gonna survive and the best i can do is just suffer in constant emotional turmoil until i go back. Its a fight every single day, he is MISERABLE. He loves to use me as a scapegoat for literally anything and everything, its always MY fault even if the situation has nothing to do with me. He makes my life hell here. There’s really no solution other than put up with it and god is it exhausting, I’m almost completely decided that i’m staying on campus over next summer because i dont know if i can take this again. It feels like i should be enjoying life and having fun but I’m not I’m just living in a constant state of panic wondering what is it now that i did wrong. I feel like such an absolute failure like i really am a no good piece of shit like he says. Im so fed up living here I’m so fed up with him I’m so fucking tired of this fucking place and i just cant wait to leave.It kind of feels like my life is starting to fall apart. Im in college and i have papers on papers due in just a couple weeks. i have other assignments on top of that and play rehearsal for the upcoming play thats also in only a couple of weeks. It feels like so much is going on and happening and I dont know how to handle it. i cant keep up its so incredibly hard. Im struggling terribly with insomnia and i always have but its effecting so much of my everyday life. I have no fucking money and no clue how to start making any when i dont have a car and no jobs are open on campus. Im awake right now at 4 in the morning on the verge of a mental fucking breakdown and quietly trying to maintain a panic attack so i wont bother my roommate. I know i will get through this for sure and its just feels like everything is piling up at once so it feel extra stressful but still i feel fucking insane and sick because im so exhausted from all the work and wild sleep schedule. I hope some good things start coming my way. Ugh i cant shake this feeling if oncoming doom or something.Whats your favorite thing to eat OR drink when you get hella munchies? Personally im just a chip person like if you have a bag of chips by me and im stoned that bag is GONE. But my other favorite snack while high is probably Ferraro Rocher. Something about them just hits different.
    Does anyone just feel like completely empty when they’re alone, like just don’t understand the point of life in general? I’m really struggling with it lately. I’ve been diagnosed w/bipolar 1 and adhd for about 2 yrs and I have an amazing partner, family support system and a great job that I love. When I’m around my support system or if I’m at work or with a client, I generally feel okay, because I’m masking and I’m distracted. However when I’m alone I feel like everything falls apart in my mind and I just can’t grasp anything and my mind gets so scrambled I just end up feeling empty. I don’t know how to explain this feeling to my partner and I just feel like I’m not a real person and he doesn’t understand what that means. Can anyone relate to that or have any advice?.
    Does anybody else get vivid dreams where they are really intense and you end up sleeping 12 hours? Like I'll wake up after 9 hours but there's this real complexity to them where I'm still dreaming while awake and have to go back to sleep in order to solve an issue? I really can't explain it properly but it's like the dream forces me back to sleep and I wake up extremely groggy with low energy? Sorta like Jeb Bush. This year has been hard for me, witnessed a suicide of a friend in the psyce ward where I spent 3 months. It was absolute pit of anxiety and depression it consumed me and escalated over months. I started making plans to end my life, it was a dark time. Then I heard about ketamine. Now I started using drugs at 12 and had major bouts of addictions to many drugs. I didn't get the ketamine initially to use recreationaly. So set up a system with my friend they would take care of it so I don't go overboard. I took my first few lines and cried tears of joy, seeing myself from the outside (if you get me) realized how hard I was on myself and how cynical I was. It was amazing. I was even more amazed when I woke up the next morning not thinking of suicide, it was like waking up from a bad dream. So I did a couple session and things were going great, until I got a package and my friend who minds it for me was in work. I did 5gs in one day, kholing multiple times. That's when the tolerance grew. Since then I've had 2 3.5 g sessions and a couple of 1 g sessions. I've done 28gs in 2 months total. Last time I did 1500mg and had a nice effect and my depression was gone that night but didn't khole and it's lost that afterglow Is there any going back? Like I know I'll probably never khole off 150mg ever no matter how long I break for but have any of you came back from abuse? Some would say quit altogether but I'm not throwing in the towel yet, I have treatment resistance depression, lifestyle changes and classical depression meds just don't work. Thank you for reading. Does it do anything for you or and if not when did it stop? It pretty much saved my live at the beginning taking small doses but I can't really khole off 1500mg, nearly but not quite. In my defense it's not TOO available to get for me and my friend has my batch with strict rules not to give it to me. I'm afraid I've ruined it as a therapeutic outlet as I'm depressed after doing as opposed to the first couple times it was non existent. Also don't like the obsession so I suppose I can understand why you would continue using, I suppose my main question is does 2gs+ even do anything for you at this stage?. How much did you have to use before it stopped working for you and did a break help?. Abusing LSD and shrroms for about 2 months lead to a severe manic episode, after which i was finally diagnosed with bipolar1. Been on lithium since. And find it quite upsetting I'll probably never be able to do LSD again. I had the best times of my life on it, it just breaks my heart I can't even trip once a year. I have been using ketamine quite heavily the last 6 weeks. Built up a hella tolerance. Turning into a dangerous habit so taking a long breakMy holes are usually quite psychedelic but this was different, it's wasn't introspective like usually are but I was completely outside of myselfSo I railed .05 and just felt nothing did some more and hole and can't quite remember much. I kinda had a nice after buzz and it was nice I kept obsessing about 18th century sanitationLater that day did some more maybe a bit I than before but my friend did a tiny bit we just layed down listening to tool and I closed my eyes. I just remember feeling at bliss. Usually when I hole I just get really introspective but this time was different. I closed my eyes and got crazy visuals it felt like I was on this elevator floating through some other dimension, multiple ones even with a deep sense of peace and it seemed to last forever. I wish I could explain It It reminded me of past LSD trips. I just felt at one with everything ever. It was very personal as these things always are. The main takeaway I got from it was I'm not really afraid to die as I think my spirit and essence essentially ever will we just go to that timesless place of consciousness. I felt so peaceful the rest of the day but unfortunately the severe mental illness comes back I know we all have big revelations but they are very hard to apply. Overall my best experience on Ket. I'm taking a break now and hoping to never lose the magic. I suffered from addiction issues and severe depression and anxiety all of my life, not so much in the past 3 years with addiction just occasion cannabis and cocaine. I had severe suicidal ideation 6bweeks ago to the point I was making plans to end my life then I thought of ketamine. I made plans to get a gram and did like 300mg spaced out and it completely Irradicateed my SI. I cried tears of joy and had so much compassion for myself. This lasted a couple days and when it faded it still wasn't too bad Then I got 2 grams and it became more frequent. And needed more and more to get the desired effect. Then I got 14gs and delivered. Before this arrangement I gave my best friend it to mind because I am an addict and can't trust myself. But when I got the 14g delivered I ended up binging 5 gs in one day. Just recently got more Thursday and did 7gs in 2 days. I had an amazing experience but reading this sub if I keep it up on top of developing a permanent tolerance I will get bladder issues. Be super careful. If you are an addict find somebody you trust that will be strict with you to take care of itSince my 5g binge it's gotten bad and my mental health isn't great so taking a long break and learning from my mistakes. Also, I would advise you don't get larger amounts at a time despite being cheaper it's too easy to binge, sure I would have lost out on a lot of money but I wouldn't binge.I believe this drug can perform miracles and is a bunch of fun just BE CAREFUL and do tonnes of research.

Title. I've taken the bull of popular drugs. LSD, shrooms, weed, dmt, Ketamin, MDMA, benzos. Abusing them all at some stage in my life. The way I can best describe it is like the drug in Limitless, without the actual benefits of applying it in the real world, like profiting off it through actual skills learned. But to me it just feels like I'm absorbing information at a high level, superior to everyone else. I've posted on social media calling out Tyson Fury to fight despite having no previous fighting experiences, (quite embarrassingly) called out Eminem to a rap battle on social media despite being terrible. I've walked 15 miles from 1 town to the next refusing hospital, believing it was a pilgrimage as I'd no food or water or sleep for roughly 2 days I nearly died. I've 100 stroies like that. So mix the limitless drug with and extreme sense of grandiosity with heavy flavourings of spiritually and the sense that you are the most important person who has ever existed and God is literally sending downloads through every thought and you are his chosen one. I could best compare it to being on LSD, the spirtual side of it, without the visuals(visuals there in my most extreme episodes) mixed with the Fuck Yeah I am the man of cocaine. Except it lasts weeks or months on end. And just like hard drugs it ruins relationships, fucks up your finances and it's extremely embarrassing putting every bit of it online. And just like drugs the comedown is horrid. I mean for the month or 2 high can take a year to come back if ever before the cycle repeats. Luckily enough I've managed to stay away from drugs while manic the last few times or I would have caused certain permanent damage. There is a strong argument I wouldn't even be bipolar if I didn't take so much MDMA in my teens, along with weed from age 12, bouts of cocaine and alcohol addiction. I didn't get my diagnosis until after I started abusing LSD and shrooms and it's been pretty shit thenI only take ketamin now as I get that psychedelic feeling, but it doesn't induce mania and is apparently beneficial for depression (was initially but abuse has hindered thatBipolar Mania overall rating 4/10Pros:That feeling of grandiosity is unparalleledthe Syconicity I experience the extra creativitySevere pression being gone Feeling of purpose, direction, hopeCons:I never stay offline so that last 3 years 1-2 a year I get manic and make a fool of myself, stand 0 chance with any girl I'm friends with on FacebookI know I make it sound amazing but irritability goes through the roof sometimes, everyone trying to talk sense into me label a hater ect. Never sleeping, but I did do intense workouts in the gym 50 days straightRelationships, it's very hard to be around, and very frightening to my friends and stranger alike Finances, I'm pretty broke but giving my last 200 Euro to homeless people then not being able to afford toilet paper, I've a friend with bipolar who racked up 100k in credit card debtThe fantasy fading, it's do demoralising going from thinking I'm the man, gunna be best rapper ever, meet my idols, change the entire world as we no it, to waking up and realizing shit I'm brokeAnd finally and most importantly the depression that follows. I was in the psyce ward for 3 months following my last episode. Something horrible happened in there and it was just absolute hell beyond belief. Summary:I heard it on a different sub Bipolar Mania is like getting superpowers from the 99c store. Overall I don't want to happen again because of the severe cons listed but you won't hear me. Saying that when it happens. Turns your life upside down. I would like to hear experiences from my fellow Bipolar peeps what your experience has been like compared to other drugs. I'm Irish and I just automatically assume everyone is from America on here. Due to using the imperial system and many other factors. What ℅ of Redditors are actually American?. I'm (27m) never made the slightest effort to adult. Got involved in drugs and selling at 12 and was left homeless and got in with a bad crowd, all of whom are either dead, in prison or heavy drug addicts. Selling drugs made me lazy I didn't make much but enough to get by. I was quoted many times saying "jobs are for suckers" so I just stayed living with my mother and haven't been in education since 12. I won 25k in a poker tournament which I squandered and probably up another 10k lifetime. That's what I wanted to do is play poker but very few actually make it as a full time profession and it takes a lot of hard work and even if you are the best you can lose for a full year or more. 3 years ago after doing a lot of acid and had a very severe manic episode and diagnosed with bipolar which shook me and since been to rehab and only use drugs very rarely. I've had like 3 episodes since. I went to college last year doing an access course and had to drop out after going manic and spending 4 moths in hospital but I did tryAnyway that's my excuse. I live in Ireland where it is not hard to get a job and I can pretty much get a full college course paid for. I also only pay 50 Euro rent a week and get social welfare and free healthcare so it's kind of a situation where I don't have to budge yeah I'll be broke but I don't have to worry about bills or getting up in the morning. But I want to do something I'm just extremely lazy, I'm a victim of comfort. I keep brushing it off like I have food, shelter ect. But I want to move out and be an adult. I can get social housing the extent of my laziness is I have to go into town and fill out forms but I just exist. I feel deep feelings of shame whenever I hear the term moms basement. I'm actually rather intelligent but a combination of mental illness and laziness, accompanied by a huge lack of self belief I don't think I can cut itI would like people to be brutally honest and maybe give me some advice if you were in a similar situationTLDR: 27yo living at home, bad mental health, never had a job, wants to adult. Between the 3 Dunk and Egg stories I was torn between 1 and 3 but after maybe my 5th listen to The Mystery Knight it just takes the cake. I usually listen to ASOIAF before I go to bed more or less every night for the past 5 years. So I know what is going to happen so it's just enough to distract me from unpleasant thoughts but just enough to keep my engaged. But tonight the last hour of The Mystery Knight has me wide awake. The dynamic characters and dialogue is just top tier. Kyle the Cat, Quentyn Ball, Slimey Auld Uther Underleaf, Daemon/John the Fiddler, witty old See Maynard PlumRaven. There's a couple more I'm leaving out just goes to show why it's head and shoulders above The Sworn Sword(although that did serve it's purpose by showing the dynamics of the BF Rebellion) Just wanted to praise this awesome short story. P.S Harry Llyord should be the only contender for Winds if it ever comes out 🥱 I'll leave you with a question, is there any information as to what became of Fireballs Son? (He had heroes blood he proved it 😎😝) What an absolute bastard a whores son who rose to knighthood and unhorsed many formidable foes. Will no doubt be hearing from him in Fire and Blood 2 (please don't die on us Georgie 😰). I've read the books multiple time and just finished fire and blood but heard next to nothing about the reighn of Baelor the Blessed le the tragedy at Summerhall, where is this based on?. I'm 27 years old and have been playing poker 11 years now. Always flirted with the idea of going pro but never actually studied consistent enough to make the plunge although for the first 8 years or so I found it quite enjoyable. Had a 24k score and up about 12k at local live tournaments. I always thought I was better than I am sort of after getting some coaching early on and for sure have a big edge over the local regs where I play. I have bipolar and needless to say it effects my game big time, I can't remember the last time I played A game, even B. It's become a depressing escape for me staying up until 7 am playing with my emotions, like I'll just insta call when I'm behind I know 95% I'm beat but I'll just do it out of impulse. I think I have the brain and talent to be a full time pro but doubt I'll ever have the mental health to endure dowswings, stay diciplned to study and play A game at least 50% of the time. I just want it to go back to a fun hobby and shooting the shit at the table, owning fish. Whereas tonight when I played a lot of the time I just focused on how shit of a person I am and how much I want to dieClassic theme on this sub is people think they are better than they are I can assure you I'm just a shitreg. Would appreciate some input. I demand to know what happened to this sub and will search the 7 hells for who's responsible. Hey I dislocated my left shoulder 5 times and recently dislocated my right playing soccer. I'm wondering if anyone had similar issues and was able to get to a stage to perform athletics or similar activities. I know I'll probably be abused for asking this but what's with the Howland shotgun memes?. I'm in the pysce ward for the second time in two months and at my very lowest. I browse yt and Reddit for distraction but am just fighting an Internal battle I still think I'm going to lose. (Most) Every night for the past 4 years I've listened to the audiobook or hardback starting form AGOT to ADWD and I just escape to Westeros/Essos and nothing else seems to matter. I had a particularly hard day yesterday and before bed I read the Davos chapter in Sisterton in Dance and just felt amazing. God bless GRRM for creating this beautiful world and these amazing characters, maybe some of you can relate with this but the real world can get pretty crappy. I know a lot of shady stuff happens in the books but I dunno we got to embrace our shadow somehow I guessAnyway I feel very lonely and isolated and would love if someone could DM me to talk thrones. Thanks guys. I'm bipolar and my depression and suicidal ideation is pretty bad. I'm considering ect but this sub is filled with horror stories compared to other sources online I'm curious as to all your opinion. I am bipolar amd take meds for is but would really love to use psycedelics bevause its the best medicatiom ive ever had. Thoughts?.
    I got a new position right out of school with my major. The job is great and the pay is nice but being in the office 5 days a week is pulling me at the strings anymore. My job is pretty mandatory to be in office but a lot of it is computer software that can be completed from my laptop. Ideally I would like to have 1 work from home day a week just to kinda recover but my work won’t allow that. Is there a way I can get that from a doctors written approval that my work would have to cooperate… or is this a fever dream? 😕Being bipolar is hard sometimes and I’m not sure how normal people survive the 9-5 grind. ☹️. 1 graduated college back in august and have been working in my new professional job for 5 weeks now. (I am so proud of myself as I kicked butt in the interview and got an above average salary for an entry level position, a sign on bonus, and more PTO.)I'm just conflicted because the job I have is 4 hours from home and have been traveling home on weekends and it's starting to take a toll on me.I tried talking to my office about an accommodation for 4 - 10 hour shifts instead to make my weekends longer but they won't budge.I'm worried that the 5 day work week is gonna send me over the edge and really test my bipolar as it is already testing my patience. (I haven't had a therapist appointment either because it's in another state and my old therapist could not do across state lines. I'm pretty stable on my medicine and able to work through some situations due to my old therapist's help but it's getting rocky as it's been 5 weeks since I've seen her.)———I'm at a loss here...What should I do...? I want to be back home but cannot just up and leave this job as it's really good pay and would need the same back home. But how do I stay sane while trying to look for a new job?How do you guys work a normal 8-5 and stay sane? Do any of your work places have accommodations for you to help get through the week?I feel like I need accommodations for my job but I'm not sure how to go about it and not sure what I even need. I don't want to get fired either...I'm scared and just want to be able to stay sane though this stressful transition period.I graduated college back in august and have been working in my new professional job for 5 weeks now. (I am so proud of myself as I kicked butt in the interview and got an above average salary for an entry level position, a sign on bonus, and more PTO.)I’m just conflicted because the job I have is 4 hours from home and have been traveling home on weekends and it’s starting to take a toll on me.I tried talking to my office about an accommodation for 4 - 10 hour shifts instead to make my weekends longer but they won’t budge.I’m worried that the 5 day work week is gonna send me over the edge and really test my bipolar as it is already testing my patience. (I haven’t had a therapist appointment either because it’s in another state and my old therapist could not do across state lines. I’m pretty stable on my medicine and able to work through some situations due to my old therapist’s help but it’s getting rocky as it’s been 5 weeks since I’ve seen her.)———I’m at a loss here… What should I do…? I want to be back home but cannot just up and leave this job as it’s really good pay and would need the same back home. But how do I stay sane while trying to look for a new job?How do you guys work a normal 8-5 and stay sane? Do any of your work places have accommodations for you to help get through the week?I feel like I need accommodations for my job but I’m not sure how to go about it and not sure what I even need. I don’t want to get fired either…I’m scared and just want to be able to stay sane though this stressful transition period. 😕. I’m a Landscape Architect and one of our projects requires us to have a privacy screening fence at the top of a 13’ retaining wall.As you read that you questioned… “Wait you need a stable railing to prevent anyone from falling over!”Well that’s my question: Is there any fences out there that can serve the dual purpose of having the regulations of a safety railing but in the form of a screening fence? Links and feedback would be amazing!———Maryland safety railing requirements:- Linear load of 50 pounds per linear foot.- Concentrated load of 200 pounds.My boyfriend is one of the most sincere and caring significant others I have ever met. I believe I crossed paths with him after being able to sit down and practice self awareness after a past relationship that left me in shambles. I have been stable and continue to take medicine and see a therapist to help with the challenges I face.With that being said, he is putting a lot of time and energy into understanding bipolar and what it is and how to work with me and not against me.I keep telling him there’s a lot of misinformation on the internet and to not think too into things but then he said, “I don’t want to put you into a box anyway as you’re a different person that other bipolar individuals because all that doesn’t resonate with you” which literally sent me into tears. I want to recommend some good sources for him to watch or read which can help him better understand some of the challenges I face and how hard some things can be.I'm a recent college graduate that accepted a job position a state over and not enjoying the location after the first week and a half.My life is going to revolve around this future cycle:Work Monday through Friday- Drive home 4 hours Friday evenings- Drive back 4 hours Sunday evenings- Now repeat...I don't like the area the job is located at like I thought I would and not to mention my mental health is at play here too. (I cannot see my therapist and psychiatrist anymore because I'm across state lines.)I miss the security of knowing home along with my significant other being back home too.———I got a really good position! Like I can't believe I nailed what I got but I cannot be spending 10 hours of my life each weekend going back and forth between work and home.I don't want to leave just yet, I want to find another job first before I officially call it quits.I know this causes reputation issues but l'm not sure what to do.I don't feel comfortable here and don't see myself here long term anyway. I took this as a stepping stone to build my career on.———What should I be doing? What should I be thinking? What should be deciding factors to look for with moving forward?Has anvone else experienced this? What did vou do?. I’m new to the area and by driving around it looks like I could literally park anywhere on the side of the road and just get out and walk on the sidewalks.Are there any neighborhoods that are better to walk at during the night? Preferably ones seller out of the center with less traffic. I just want somewhere safe that’s all.I’m scared… This is my first full time position after graduating college and will have no therapist or insurance for a month until the company’s insurance kicks in.With being a college student, I have been lucky enough to take control of my bipolar and get help for free through the state. With that being said, my insurance is though the state and not where I’m moving to so I am losing my current therapist and psych for over a month. This scares me tremendously as I have finally been able to get my mental health to a place where I am so incredibly happy at after 9 long months of consistency with my current providers. I am stable and taking many life lessons with me into my new job and environment but worried that I might spiral knowing this is a HUGE change in my life. I feel like I’m stuck and don’t know what to do because I rely on my therapist for a lot of guidance through different challenges in my life and this in itself is a challenge I’m not capable of doing by myself and need my therapist. What does everyone suggest I attempt to do? I don’t want to snowball if something happens and I need to get advice.I know this question is asked a lot in this subreddit but I had some questions and concerns that haven’t been asked by others here.I want a renovated apartment:Nice floors, minimal carpetGranite countertopsUndermount sinksModern cabinetsNice bathroomsBig windowsWhat I also want is somewhere safe. I have a dog and will need to walk him at night. I cannot be walking at 11pm and have to worry about me and my dog’s safety. Are there apartments near home plans with sidewalks?I would ideally like an apartment that is well soundproofed. I like to play music and watch movies and I have good speakers and don’t want to bother others and don’t want others to bother me.

    my hair is shining, i almost mistake it for oil but nope, it's shine which my hair has never had before. my skin also feels fresh and soft and smooth like a childs and that's without moisturiser. i'm wondering, is cold showers anti ageing?. hi all, i'm in england at the moment, but would love to go to university at some point. mainly to get away from where i'm now living. i'd like to go somewhere england or even some outside of england if it were possible. i'm just terrified. i'd need guidance and a support network. i don't have much of a family and although i love them, they're not that supportive or knowledgeable. is this kind of thing available? if i went alone without a team or plan in place i'd crumble and my life would fall apart. anyone know anything?. somebody i have unresolved feelings for got in contact with me. i feel depressed and sad deep down but i'm still functioning. i feel anxious about it. i'm on quetiapine 25mg for bipolar 2 and was feeling great until this. now i'm scared it has set me back and causing a relapse. i'm not sure why this person has given me such a furious reaction. i liked him, he seemed to like me, it was complicated and went to shit. i was just beginning to forgive and get over and the message he sent wasn't even related to anything. it was to offer me something. i was so mad i forgot to take my meds (i thought i had) and that's the first dose i missed. i kept waking up during the night with such anger. today i've functioned as normal but i'm just very sad. i went on meds a month ago yesterday and am afraid i'm now relapsing after responding so well to it. i'm possibly overreacting but any intense emotion now scares me and makes me feel like i'm back where i was before meds.sorry for the rant, i just feel alone and can't talk to anyone :(. i don't know why i'm so pissed? this happened before i went to bed and i kept waking up in the middle of the night because of how pissed i am. i have bipolar 2, but i don't think that invalidates things or anything, maybe it factors in somehow. here's the short version of what happenedI (19M) knew this guy (18M) who had a girlfriend but we didn't know her. he made it his mission almost to persue me. i went from not knowing this dude to him being the centre of my universe for some time. it's the first time i've been infatuated with someone and it not be my fault. we got so close in fact, we flirted constantly, it got deeper than that. he'd kiss me and was so gentle to me which wasn't his usual self. i was feeling love sick so i told him to stop as it's not fair to his gf (in hopes he'd correct me and tell me he liked me) instead he got very sad and his vibe got very cold and distant to me. i finally confessed i liked him and the son of a bitch pretended to die. we stopped talking and i felt unresolved pain. then over the summer he hurt some of my friends with a situation and although didn't do anything physically, showed some predatory behaviour to my friends. just as i'm forgiving him and coming to terms with it all, he messages offering drugs. NO SORRY? NO ACKNLOLEDGEMENT. Yeah i'm fuming, seething, all of it right now. I'm in recovery now, taking my meds and sure i'd never be so stupid as to fall for such a stupid person or situation again. I let my guard down. we were so close and caring for eachother at one point, i've not had that since i was a child. i might be overreacting but i'm overwhelemed and just want to cry or collapse into anger.i'm not sure why? but yeah, that's my issue.advice anyone?. 1) enunciation 2) tongue placement and 3) mouth wide for singingi have noticed that while implementing these three techniques my singing is more controlled, cleaner and more stable. a lot less warbling and shakiness. i don't have the greatest of singing voices but now i am applying these i find they are helping create a more consistent sound. i plan on getting a vocal coach soon so this is a good start. my pitch is more centered i have noticed. is this because of applying these techniques?when sharing my recordings with others, instead of doubting and overthinking EVERYTHING i plan on doing a tip i heard on here. to dehumanise the voice, focus the technicalities such as pitch, tone, enunciation etc etc more than how it sounds. this is meant to be good for people like me who dislike their own voices no matter how many people say it's got a ''pretty, sweet tone''. thanks in advance, this will be great help to me. hi all, i'm going to a get together tonight at a friends house. i'm planning on having 2 glasses of a little bit of wine mixed with more lemonade. i am on 150mg of quetiapine and just want to know if this is fine? i know it says not to drink and i'm aware of the sedative effect but a glass or two is hardly drinking. i take my meds anywhere from 11PM-1AM and around 8-9 in the morning. am tolerating the med extremely well with little to no side effects.without medication i'm a mess. mostly in between moods i was affected and that's when most of the damage would happen. i would interrupt myself, was impulsive, desperate for something to fill that void, erratic and generally unstable. with medication, i still have my personality but it's reigned in and much easier to be around. i feel competent, self assured, secure and a sense of well being i haven't known before. i speak clearly and a lot less, my train of thought is simple and i feel no anxiety anymore. none at all. i can still feel upset but it takes a lot to get me upset, i can still feel happiness. sure, my emotions and moods have been numbed and altered but i feel like a great version of me on this medication. it's been almost a month and already, feel like i'm recovered.(20m) i was never really a smoker, just a ''social'' one. i always preferred vapes. starting them in school when we were bored and had nothing else to do which was a lot. everyone around me did it too, and does, so i guess i just became normalised to it without fearing it. i feel like it enhances socialising? i know that sounds dumb. i've never properly commited to quitting but i guess i should. i feel like i'm depending on it a lot now when in social occasions which is dumb. i don't ever vape when home. sorry for rant, maybe i'm being dramatic or silly. i want to quit when this one dies, any tips? like something i can do instead of reaching for the vape?. So, today i've been feeling depressed. I'm on seroquel 75mg and have been for 17 days now. today i've been sluggish, quiet, feeling dull, flat and mildly depressed. But, that's just it. it's a gentle depression. i suspect this is normal people depression. i haven't snapped or gotten irritated or feel a terrible anger in myself. i'm just thinking ''well, tomorrow's another day''. a good sign i think? just wanted to share :)). hi all! i've just joined my local gym and am really looking forward to going. i love the treadmills more than anything but also want to do some of those leg machine things and weights. i want to be toned, not buff. i am currently on an antipsychotic medicaiton which causes some weight gain to stomach. what are some good machines to use? thanks in advance to basic basic question. so, i'll keep it short and sweet. i'm taking quetiapine and am now on 75mg. i remember when i went to 50 i felt mildly hypomanic for a day or two before settling. then after 7 days i'm now on 75mg. it's been two or three days on that dose. i feel like each time i up my dose i feel a little more unstable and like it sends me hypomanic. is this common? i've come to fear any episode but if i know that it's common w/ med dose changes then i won't be so worried. it's a mild hypo feeling but still scary. i read it could happen because med changes temporarily alter the brains chemicals (i know meds do this in general) but especially at first, and the brain has to adjust. can anyone explain? :). i've just come across the noah st john method of afformations and think it's genuis. affirmations never worked for me, i never believed them no matter how hard i tried. i get a gentle peace when asking myself empowering questions (afformations) and there is little to no resistance. has anybody had any success stories, for encouragement?. i've been put on quetiapine for bipolar symptoms and as my psych put it ''mood swings''. they told me that if i respond to the medication then i shall be diagnosed. i've heard people say that it's taken them years & years to find their ''right'' medication or the ''magic'' one. i've found stability and peace within a week of my first ever medication. how common is this? sometimes it feels too good to be true. there are also little to no side effects for me either and it's been 10 days!let me know your experiences :)). i've been on quetiapine for about a week now. it's working fantastic and i feel so much better, better than i have in 7 years. i barely get any side effects but i do get some days like today where i feel drunk. i sound groggy and am slurring a little. is this common? like i said, most days i'm great others i feel the side effects.**I'm on quetiapine.** **since starting,** **my singing voice sounds better, more controlled, flowy, and others think it sounds better.** **is** **Is** **there an explanation for this? I can even hit some notes that I couldn't hit before. My voice is far from perfect but sounds far better and more relaxed**. Hi all, I'm desperate to hear a song from the casette called Gentle Foe by Cher straight from the casette. there's a youtube version available but i'd appreciate hearing the cassette version. this song is so extremely rare. can anyone help? thank u :)). so, i have used fresh in nature before and hated it. now, i found eco warrior shampoo bar (first time using a bar). it's 93% natural (or so it claims) and it did wonders for my hair. i haven't washed my hair in 5 days and as soon as i lathered it well and used it my hair still felt soft and not all hard and stripped. it felt so gentle and as soon as i washed it out, it looks so clean and fresh and yet soft and voluminous. i have fine hair and usually like my hair on day 2 or 3 because drugstore shampoos just make it flat and too clean. this did wonders, it looks like day 2 or 3 hair but fresh and clean. i fully recommend :). i'm 19 but feel like i'm stuck to an older way of life. not too much, but a few decades behind. i have trouble accepting that my city and the world are changing so fast and dramatically. maybe it's because i have such memories tied to my city or whatever. i want to embrace the future. anyone have any tips or psych tricks to flip my mindset?. hi all, so yesterday i took 25mg seroquel for the first time last night. almost immediately within the hour i felt the sedative effects. i felt intensely relaxed and like my body had unstiffened for the first time ever (it's always clenched and tense). i felt a wonderful heaviness like i was sinking into the bed and then after an hour or slightly more, was asleep. i woke up once though at 1.30am. (i thought it was meant to totally knock you out?) and might have woken up once more. i've now woken up and feel just slightly groggy and out of it. my face feels slightly numb but i was told that this is normal and i feel a little weird lol. my question as dumb as it is is, is this common? i thought it was meant to knock me out and make me sleep for hours or (i read) a day. i go up to 50mg in 2 days. here is the song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWpXRk5f254](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWpXRk5f254)i love how haunting it is. this might be a dumb question but what instrument is being used?. i was seeing an insta post of a woman who was a model in a host of sexually charged yet cool pictures and most of the comments were full of rage and hate. the same goes for a lot of gay people expressing their sexuality - it is met with such venom and they are labelled 'paedophile' or 'satantic'. sure, i think a lot of the time it can be seen as desperate but it doesn't cause me to kick the fucking bucket. what's with these kinds of people?.

    Just curious how long your longest hypomanic episode lasted and what was it like? Did it last for several days or several months? I’m not sure if I’m stable or in a very long hypomanic episode. I’m up early every day (5am) with lots of energy. Go to the gym 7 days a week, spending a bit more than I should but nothing crazy, and actually TIRED at the end of the day, sleeping by 10pm every day. What is this? Stability, a long term hypomanic? Curious what others have experienced!.

I have heard and read of fridge dormancy, but my climate is either hot, super hot, or typhoon. In which comes frequent electricity shortages. If there's a black out and the fridge temperature rises, would that force the plant out of dormancy? If so, should I put it back in the fridge when electricity comes back or just hope the shortened dormancy will be enough? Thanks.Been on this game for 90 hours now and four DLCs in. Over the square box habitat phase and have built quite elaborate habitats and facilities. But, I've noticed recently that they're all relatively flat.

I would love to gather some as I open a new franchise on a sculpter map.Just order a pod of N.[Viking x Globosa] x Trichocarpa seeds and a bag of sphagnum moss and perlite from a local grower. I was told to place the media in a plastic container then spray it with distilled water then go be placed under a grow light. However, when I looked up online, the methods seems to differ. One source says the container must be covered for the humidity to spike. One says the container must be in darkness. One even basically dodged the how to germinate question altogether and focused on how difficult it was. I would love to get some information here as I have never had a tropical pitcher before, much less growing them.

So, I google for an alternative. Popped up on a Google search after looking for perlite alternatives was a "kanuma soil". I quote from Google, "Kanuma has a pH value of between 4.5 - 5.5. The acidic nature of the Kanuma makes it ideal for all acid loving species such as camellias, rhododendrons, gardenia and more. It is also a popular component in carnivorous plant mixes for plants such as Nepenthes and can be mixed with long fibre moss or crushed lava stone." Does anyone here have experience with said soil? If so, what do you recommend for a mix ratio with spagnum moss peat? Thanks in advance.1.

    One year anniversary after my diagnosis! Really tough in early days, but now my life changing in a good way!Atm my psychiatrist gave me Fluoxetine and Aripiprazole (after countless change) and this combination is the doing well!Back to topic, like the title said: does anyone have severe inattentiveness but not diagnosed with ADHD?I haven't diagnosed with ADHD yet (and I know any psychiatrist in my region won't gave me one, because, well, mental health aren't that much issues in my country), but somehow my attention span is much like a guppy.I don't know really know if these traits fitted into it:1. My brain is soo foggy I can't think clearly even when I speak (resulting into gibberish, fast, jumbled up sentence); 2. Everything around me is way too loud (I can hear everything, all at once, people chatting, fridge humming, etc);3. My attention span is in shambles, it takes soo much effort to follow conversation (and I usually blanking in the middle of it), it takes 3-5 attempts (and I must point it with finger, per words) to read a paragraph; and severe forgetfulness;4. My brain running too fast, I can't sleep (unless aripiprazole kicking in), whenever I tried to close my eyes, I hear everything and start to thinking. Soo is this really ADHD or just hypomanic? Anyone has a way to cope this?. I got my diagnosis two weeks ago, visited because my depression, and the psychiatrist told me that I have BP1. Been using seroquel but for now the doc changed it into apripazole (can't withstand its side effect)Up until now I can't 'feel' the meds. My mind still racing, my talking still very fast, easily distracted, and I can hear everything (even while I write this). I am afraid the doc got the wring diagnosis, because I am sure i haven't experienced any manic episodes at least this years (I don't remember past years) and the antipsychotic somehow make me worse, also I think the doc misheard or mistaken my explanation (thanks to my racing thought+speaking).Is it fine to 'reject' my doc diagnosis?*Sorry for my broken English, not native speaker and here in my country there aren't any community about mental heath I can find so I went to Reddit.
    Hey mates, I've been single for probably 7 years now. There are various reasons for this, most partners usually cannot cope with my different moods and mood changes. Now, after a long time, I have found someone who I am interested in and who I feel attracted to. He is 5 years older than me and not on the spectrum. At the moment I'm in a depressive phase and to stabilize it I'm taking sertraline. I often have trouble knowing whether someone is genuinely interested or not. We have already met once and I thought it was nice. But I'm already worried that he'll break off contact if I tell him that I'm bipolar and I already have the feeling that he's losing interest. I don't know why, I have a bad feeling when he doesn't send me a heart emote, for example. Am I expecting too much? How should I explain to him that I am bipolar and, for example, sexually hyperactive in manic phases? I'm desperate.There's a guy at my work that I actually really like. We worked together on a night shift, as always we had a lot of fun. (I haven't come out at work yet, but I think everyone knows, so far nobody has said anything negative.)He asked me for advice I should look at something on his screen. I walked over to him and put my hand on his shoulder to lean forward and look at his screen.At that moment he freaked out. What I would think to myself, he doesn't want to get sick.He read me an article from the "Bild newspaper (A dubious German newspaper, rag)"> In this newspaper it is reported that the monkeypox virus infection is a gay disease, just like HIV / AIDS. (His words !) > >" In Spain, the authorities are investigating the suspicion that the "Maspalomas Pride" on Gran Canaria in the first half of May could have been an infection hotspot. Around 80,000 participants from the gay community attended the event " > >The same article says that, the German Aidshilfe warns against stigmatization and that this is not a "gay disease" he doesn't want to hear. Since then he keeps making bad jokes about gays. I feel so ashamed...I don't know what to say to convince him otherwise.I could only cry, i feel terrible.Hey lovely pancakes, the World need your Help !&#x200B;A little something to me:I am born 1978 in a small village in Germany and im pansexual as heck \^\^A little History out of my sight.2016 IrlandI danced in Dublin on the CSD for my first time, because Ireland passed a new law allowing gay marriage.WOW what a feeling i was so happy.I sleept in a bunk Room with 50 other people, what a Party what a Night.At this Time you cannot marry the person you love in Germany, unless you are straight.2017 GermanyWe fight and demonstrated and we won !The German "Bundestag" passed the new law allowing gay marriage.>The right wing parties like the AFD demonstrated against marriage for everyone.&#x200B;But not everyone has so much Luck.I don't know how much the free world is aware, that at the moment something bad is going on in Europe.At that moment this is happening with our neighbors.&#x200B;2021 Hungary Status: 15.06.2021 3 p.m.Hungary passed a new law.>The classic image of the family is enshrined in Hungary's constitution: mother, father, child.

    Greetings, I bet you’re awesome. I’m down to chat about anything; problems, philosophy, games, music, I’ll even put up with politics.Any and all messages will be responded to because you (all of you) are special!. I’m aware that I’m somewhat elevated, I’m sitting in a lecture for a subject I don’t even do (history) (pretty sure these are the best notes I’ve taken ever, though since starting this post I have no idea what the fuck is going on, though which is kinda funny). I desperately want to hang out with people and it physically hurts to be sitting still and I just want to talk and talk to people - to my friends. I don’t want to scare people or be too much for people, I spoke to my doctor this morning and he wasn’t so helpful (no disrespect to him but he was a useless bastard) and I’m just tryna figure out how to get through this while maintaining my relationships and keeping myself safe.I’m aware that I’m somewhat elevated, I’m sitting in a lecture for a subject I don’t even do (pretty sure these are the best notes I’ve taken ever though which is kinda funny).

I don’t want to scare people or be too much for people, I spoke to my doctor this morning and he wasn’t so helpful and I’m just tryna figure out how to get through this while maintaining my relationships and keeping myself safe.Because I can’t fucking do it. The idea of suicide is so big in my head that I can’t think of anything else, running out of drugs - not that they were doing shit for me anymore. I don’t want to be this person anymore. My life is just crippling lows and erratic highs and I can never fucking function, I always feel 5 steps behind everyone else.It’s like something was just built wrong in me and I don’t think anything’s gonna fix it. I don’t know if I can do it anymore. “Keep fighting”, for what? So I can get a shitty job I won’t be able to keep? So I can be that mentally ill friend that people just put up with, the kid that’s a constant disappointment. I can’t fucking breathe how bad I feel.Please. I don’t want to die, I just need someone to tell me how I’m meant to live, I don’t even need to be happy, I just want to be able to function like a normal fucking person.I’m beginning to feel the approach of depression, and I’m hoping it’s not going to be so bad, but I still feel it. My erratic behaviour has already put some strain on my relationships, but at least with the benefit that I was at the time(generally) funny, upbeat and reaching out to hang out with people.Now I am worried about how I’m going to manage the friendships I’ve made, since I’m not feeling so great. I don’t feel like the person they made friends with; I’m tired, the thought of having to follow through on today’s plans makes me want to cry, I just want to put the outside world on pause until I feel more positive. Has anyone one experienced this? Or have any advice?I still want to see people, or rather I don’t want to be alone or lonely, but if I’m miserable I don’t think that’s the best time for people. I kind of want to tell people how I’m feeling as a sort of apology but maybe that’s making me more of a burden, not to mention I’m still always apologising for them having to help me so much when I was acting dumb.I’m posting this a couple places just looking for all the advice I can get to help support my friend.I’ve been going through a lot in regards to my mental health and through it a somewhat new friend of mine has been an absolute lifesaver; helping me get emergency doctor appointments, getting in touch with security services when I was acting erratically, generally being there etc.I feel awful about everything she’s had to help me with, I’ve been very burdensome. However, all of this means we’ve been quite open in terms of mental health discussions and she shared with me a little while back that she’d struggled with Anorexia when she was younger though at the time she said she was greatly better. Today she offhandedly mentioned that she feels like she’s in the midst of a “bit of a slip”.I want to be there for her, and support her but I don’t really have any idea what that looks like - the little research I’ve done has told me that it’s a delicate sort of situation and I’m not the best at those, I recognise that I can’t cure her, and it’s not even my place. So I’m looking for any advice on what friendly support would look like, or if it’s to have a conversation with her, how I approach that?Thanks.I’m uncertain if this is allowed here or if this is the place to ask, if not I’d greatly appreciate directions as to where to post.I’ve been going through a lot in regards to my mental health and through it a somewhat new friend of mine has been an absolute lifesaver; helping me get emergency doctor appointments, getting in touch with security services when I was acting erratically, generally being there etc.I feel awful about everything she’s had to help me with, I’ve been very burdensome.

What about, if you cut leg holes in the tent and sort of “wore it”? Would anything change if you having put your legs through the leg holes of this tent then unzip it and wear it sort of like pants with your body out the door?Unrelated but similarly: If you’re in a car are you inside? Would that change in a convertible? Would that change in a non convertible, if you were sitting with your legs out of the door?. I'm very much overwhelmed by the sensation of *needing* to do something, but there is nothing to do; I want to go out but everyone I know is busy, there is nothing in this fucking town and I spent a fuck ton of money recently, I can't even go running because it seems boring. The sensation of restlessness feels like its burning me up inside. I'm meant to see my doctor in like 3 weeks but if this feeling gets anyworse I'm thinking of going and begging someone to see me which is a whack idea because I reckon it will pass soon.Any pitches or ideas for things to do or things that could help?.

Hello, I’m a university student who has begun to come down with something - headache, real bad muscle ache, sore throat, and a horrendous fever. I’ve lived on my own for a little while but this is the first time getting “barely get of bed” ill. I’ve begun panicking a little, very overcome by the idea that ill worsen in the future, no one will know and I’ll die. I don’t want to mention being sick to my dorm mates because I don’t really know them so well and I don’t want them coming near my potential contagious radius.If anyone’s got any advice on what to do, on managing the flu, and ideally contacting someone for help before I slip into a fever induced delirium and perish ( or a kind word saying that won’t happen?I’m probably doing all the wrong things healthwise.Hello, I’m a university student who has begun to come down with something - headache, real bad muscle ache, sore throat, and a horrendous fever.

I’ve gone home, still somewhat out of sorts but by far better than I was four days ago, certainly not the worst I’ve ever been. think I may miss my first couple of classes just because of the train times of me getting in tomorrow. I sent a message to apologise if I weirded out this new friend of mine, she didn’t really know what I was talking about so I elaborated that I couldn’t really recall the specifics of a couple conversations we’d had since I’d left. She said it “sounded like a bit of a manic episode”. I would admit that I was a degree hypomanic but it’s got me wondering about when/or if I should disclose my diagnosis to the friends I’m making. I’m still in the process of trying to get back on medication so it’s unfortunately likely that I’m going to through another episode of some variety before getting myself sorted with the way the NHS works (slowly) so should I mention it? I certainly don’t want to “scare them off” before they get to know me but I worry that any potential behaviour pre-medication, without context, would do that anyway? Has anyone got any thoughts on when or if to disclose a bipolar diagnosis to friends?. I feel like so bad, I feel like I’m dying, maybe I got food poisoning or something but I wanna crawl out of my skin, someone on a different subreddit said maybe it was a mixed episode. I don’t have medication, I’m trying to get medication - I’m speaking with my doctor tomorrow. Can someone tell me what to do in the mean time, I can’t remember what I used to do when I got like this - I can’t fucking think.Any advice, any encouragement, absolutely anything would be so completely helpful. I’m really going through it, not even certain where I’m at right now; don’t know if I want to start breaking shit or jump off a building.I’ve made a couple dumb decisions recently - nothing serious but I just feel kind of strange and really need any kind of reminder that I’m not alone or something dumb like that. I don’t know.I don’t even know how I feel, kinda like there’s really cold fire running through my veins - think I unsettled some people I just met at university by thoroughly cleaning their dorm.I skipped a lecture for the first time - I’m literally less than a week in. Just packed a bag, left my dorm, got on a train and went home. I’ve gotten home and now I’m remembering all the reasons it sucks. My hands kinda hurt because I punched a while and I’m just trying not to start screaming or crying or laughing like a lunatic. Maybe this is hypomania, I don’t know, it’s not the same feel good feeling I had when I decided that I “wasn’t vibing” with my lectures. I had to block one of my new sorta friends so I’d stop texting her.Sorry for rambling, I don’t know why I’m writing this, guess I’m just looking for someone to tell me that I’m going to be alright, and I just can’t deal with the hold times or the impatient condescension of a help line.I’ve basically just started university, and I’m pretty sure I’m already doing everything wrong. I’m in the process of trying to sort out my medication which isn’t going well so I’m essentially rawdogging academia at present. I’ve been drinking a little bit too much and I haven’t gotten around to talking to the disabilities office about getting accommodations because I reckoned that I wouldn’t really need them.I’m pretty sure I ruined a potential friendship by getting drunk and rambling about my mental health issuesI’m just looking for any sort of advice about making it through university, while managing pretty recently diagnosed Bipolar 2, potential disclosure to new friends; anything’s appreciated.I’ve basically just started university, and I’m pretty sure I’m already doing everything wrong.

Over the past couple of days she’s suffered an injury that looks to be affecting her mobility the next couple of weeks - she’s on crutches. And her youngest kid eloped and had to be brought home by police. I went to see her today and I could see how down she was, I tried to help out with some dishes and she started crying telling me that she felt really alone and was having a hard time.I don’t know if it matters but for context, my aunt has really been there for me when I’ve been going through stuff, was the only member of my family who was supportive of me sorting out my mental health. I really want to be there for her but I am leaving for university today.Is there anything I can do to help her long distance? I’m trying to see if I can get a job so I can come down to visit her a lot more but that may take a little bit. Any ideas on what I could do would be great.My laptop screen periodically starts flickering, lines appear across the screen. Even when it is working well, if I tilt the screen too much it goes black with a couple white lines across it. Does anyone know if this is fixable at home, or if I do need to go to a service what exactly the problem is for me to tell them?. A serious series of mistakes that most everyone will think “why would you do that?”Been on a reluctant month long T break owing to fuckery with the mail system. That ended yesterday, all good if slightly more hyped than I would have liked. This morning I took my usual dose, or at least presumably because I’ve gotten into the bad habit of eyeballing it because I’ve lost my scale; empty stomach, energy drink, potentiated with OJ just like mama used to make. Then I got on a bus.I suffer quite badly from car sickness so at first I thought that to be the cause of my building nausea, shakiness and general dizziness. I stepped off the bus 20 minutes later and suffered my way to my destination. I stepped in to my friends house, got up the stairs and I knew then that it was the wobbles. Burglarized a glass of water and tapped out of all interaction, laying on the sofa trying to breathe my way through my bad decisions - still unbreakfasted, the thought of food making me nauseous. Close to 3 hours have passed and I feel somewhat better, though it’s a bit touch and go. And the decision was made to toss and wash a little more in preparation for our outing, my friend and I’s. I shall call it post swallow clarity as I thought to myself “the fuck am I doing, why would I think that after the wreck I was two hours ago this would be a good idea?!” So I’m sitting here trying to manage my anxiety hoping that I will still be able to go out in 30 minutes, looking for any advice on how to manage the resurgence of wobbles that I am anticipating shortly. It is my understanding that anxiety can worsen it so that’s not so great. Do I drink more water? force down some food? Suffer??. I’m a barely functional dumpster fire of a person, been on and off medication since getting diagnosed (currently off as of 4 days ago though I’m speaking to my doctor about that) and I’ve had the realization that I’m a shit friend.I’ve never been good at making friends so the group wasn’t really large. My longest friend told me a while back that she couldn’t do it anymore, being constantly concerned for my wellbeing because at the time I was incredibly depressed, talking about suicide and doing more drugs than was healthy for me. I respect her decision completely and have been working on myself since but I’m really struggling to figure out what improvement means. I’m either depressed and uncontactable for weeks at a time or hypomanic and a reckless, annoying jerk - Non stop messaging, irritability, concerning behavior and at the time I know I’m the back of my mind that I should shut up or that I’m being mean for no reason and I try to express that to my friends but I can’t stop myself from being like that at the time. I’m terrified that people are gonna get sick of my inconsistency and shitty behavior. I don’t know if I should share my diagnosis, or if it would just come off as an excuse or scare my few friends away. Any advice is helpful.I’m trying to find a meme that’s has the format in the title, I think it may have originated from tumblr or maybe it just got popular on there, I’m probably not quoting it exactly because it’s been paraphrased amongst my friends so often we can no longer remember what it was originally like which is what I’m trying to find if anyone can help.I feel so shit, it’s like I’m struggling to breathe. Can’t shake the thought of suicide. It’s my mother’s birthday today and I’m trying so hard not to ruin but I feel like lying down and crying. I don’t even know what to do, I just don’t want to be here anymore. Been taking new medication that’s meant to sort out my mental health, still depressed as fuck. My whole family’s telling me how I’m wrecking my body with pharmaceuticals and I’m biting my tongue to stop me saying how when I tried “the natural way” I had 3 suicide attempts and a psychotic break.My dad’s just been admitted to the hospital, and is getting angry with everyone I’m so goddamn tired that I want to walk into traffic. I’ve tried reaching out, got no friends and my family doesn’t seem to understand when I tell them how shit I feel. I know that I have a lot going for me, I know that I should be grateful but hearing that from my family when I tell them I was crying so hard I couldn’t breathe, isn’t helpful to me right now. I wish I was dead, honestly and truly, I’m so tired of all this.My dad’s been in and out of hospital, he’s recently been diagnosed with colitis, in lots of pain all the time. He’s coming to stay with me and I’m trying to find out what sort of things he’s meant to be eating or what might help with his pain management and condition.He’s afraid of doctors and not very good at admitting when he’s sick so even getting him to seek treatment had been an uphill battle so I’m trying to help him as much as possible right now, any advice would be great help.I signed up to a mosaic class, last week with my mom - showed up glued tiles, got yelled at by the instructor and decided I didn’t much like it, but also would feel like POS if I quit and left my mom to go alone, I think I’ve got two hours til I’m meant to start seriously thinking about heading out. I’m depressed AF, feel like I’ve simultaneously just woken up, while also being 3 days sleep deprived, the vibe of the class is a social one and I’m really not up to it, contemplating if it would serve me well to get a bit of a buzz on for the class. Only my mom, naturally, disapproves of me drinking and I’ve made a point in life of rarely being drunk around her; smashed alone at home, for sure, now I’ve moved back home, would rather sleep at a mate’s house or in the garden than have her feel somehow about what I’m getting up to, but nonetheless I’m seeing little other way to bring the appropriate energy to the evening. Idk, advice?. Full disclosure, I wasn’t home schooled. However my mom was a teacher who supplemented my education over holidays, weekends and days I was “off sick”. She took me to a lot of places and took the time to discuss with me different things.I recall being 7 and going to a fish market and my mom and the sales guy talking to me about the different kinds of fish and oysters. When I was a little older my mom took me out of school for a day to go to a Lego exhibition. I say this because I recall these and other incidents to this day and think a great benefit of homeschooling is the ability to be a bit non traditional in teaching. These kind of hands on experiences have stayed with me a lot more than what I was taught at school and I really think that’s something that can/should be brought to homeschooling, though someone more experienced has or could probably make a better post on the subject.It was this game like a google doodle thing where you could drag and drop different people and they'd make different but individually repetitive sound, and all these characters were in different sets of color coded clothes and hairstyles.I’m sitting on a train, looking at all the people around me and just wondering how they do it. I feel like I’m about to explode - like a storm trapped in a bottle. I want to start breaking shit, screaming until I’m hoarse so they know that I don’t have it all together - I am a mess of a human being. I have so much energy and nowhere to put it, I want to start clambering across the seats, barking at people. Fuck, I don’t even know who I am. My skin itches, I am too big for it, and yet I’ve just got to sit here, silent and still no matter because that’s what the world expects of me.I have recently made a commitment to managing my condition in a healthier way, I woke up today feeling the beginnings of depression on the horizon and I’m wondering what people do to slow the arrival or limit the severity of depressive episodes. My typical approach has been rather unhealthy benders with an abundance of drinking and drugging but I’m moving forward from that and looking for healthier suggestions. Any advice is appreciated.I was diagnosed Bipolar 2 late last year, my doctor at the time said she didn’t want to put me on antidepressants because of the fluctuations in my mood and because I was about to be traveling and therefore couldn’t be monitored as well as was required. Before I was diagnosed I was taking Kratom to deal with the depression and which was kinda helpful but not so much which is what lead me to getting help.I’ve moved house recently and changed doctors, been through a bit of a rough patch right now and it’s looking like I’ll be put on medication in the next couple of days. I’m not really siked for that, not a big fan of doctors and their machinations. I’ve been dealing decently so far, except for restlessness and a couple situations, does anyone have any advice or experience of managing bipolar 2 with minimal or, ideally no medication?.

I was talking with someone today about actively being a hood person, and pursuing others happiness in a wider scale plan. I am not affiliated with a religion or church but I do want to do what street preachers do only with things like “Everyone is trying their best!”, or “Life is a work in progress!” just be connecting and talking with new and different people and spreading positivity. Can this be done? Can I make it a job or something? Should I tweak my approach in anyway, I very much aim not to be a nuisance rather a nice moment in someone’s day is there a specific tone I should take when I talk that could achieve this? Has anyone done this before?. I was in talks with someone today about spreading positivity and connecting with people and I’m beginning to wonder if street preacher style positivity spreading is what I should be doing. I want to be able to just hype up someone doing there shopping, let them know they’re valued. How do people afford to do this, are they paid by a church? Is it a side job?. I’ve been hearing a crackling sound from my phone recently, that in conjunction with some odd events have my suspecting my privacy/security is compromised. What are some ways to protect myself against broad surveillance?It is very much urgent, I think my communications and my family’s communications are being restricted/controlled; neither me nor more my brother can get in contact with anyone. I haven’t been sleeping these past nights and looking back on it right now I was acting pretty weird; I broke into a park near me to watch the sunset (really should have realized something was wrong then), been drinking a lot more, having a moment of insight and realizing I’ve pretty delusional recently, talking about my brother trying to poison me, about being chosen by a conceptual universe. I still don’t feel right but I’ve calmed down a lot. Need any advice to calm down before I have to get on a train tonight - last time I went out I started talking to random strangers, I don’t know why I did that.Update: thanks for all the advice, I am two hours away from arriving at my destination, worst train ride of my life to be honest, did manage to grab a really shit nap, but I think those couple hours have helped a bunch. Feel a little bit more put together, scenery’s beautiful, paranoias manageable, incidentally also in two hours my doctor’s office opens so I’ll put in a call to them.UPDATE #2: all sorted. Dialed up my doc says she’ll see me when I get back from my trip, cause I didn’t seem like I was a danger to myself or others right now(I’m not). Not gonna committed, Yay! Thanks again.Literally lol, I’m real sick all of the sudden in the head. I just wanted to see the ocean and now I think I’m to messed up to understand what’s real or not. Maybe I’m at the beach and I just don’t know it. I’m sorry for not making so much sense, the world doesn’t to me rn. I’m so scared and so tired, I haven’t slept in a while, I want to start crying I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to be afraid of imaginary things anymore.I’m sorry if this is allowed here or if it’s a bit of a mess(this paragraph) and it’s probably a bit scrambled because my mind’s scrambled and that’s a symptom. I feel real bad - scared. I don’t really know where I am even though I’m at home, I’m paranoid I think, I think people are putting thoughts inside my head to try and trick me for what I’m keeping inside me. I know this doesn’t make sense and is a bit weird to be thinking but it’s really hard for me to get around what makes sense and doesn’t make sense. Please someone help me; if you could tell me what is happening to me and what I should do.I am going to be vague because I think they are watching me - someone is and they’ve been making me think things,and I know it all doesn’t make so much sense but I’m confused and very scared and I would be grateful if someone could help me; calm down enough to think easier, that would be very helpful.(Sorry for the brick if text). I have just been invited here and that’s pretty cool. Thought I’d share a thought I had about consciously practicing whatever faith one has.I was raised into Christianity and I used to pray every night before bed as a child, but I never did it out of a genuine belief more as just a thing that I was meant to be doing. I don’t think I practiced any Christian values in my life then.Since then I have shifted into agnosticism with some spiritual undertones and I have started consciously making the effort to do a marked degree of good in the world - starting with one act of kindness a day.I say this because I think that there is something of value in introspecting on one’s beliefs and ensuring that it is not just a belief but a practice that one carries into life. Even without a distinct religious belief that says as such, it is always good to be kind.“If your only depressed half of the time I don’t think you should be medicated”Yeah, but If that half of the time I’m so depressed I kill myself then the days I’m able to function don’t really mean anything to me.I’ve spent the past year trying to do anything and everything to get my mental health sorted; counseling, quit smoking, quit drinking, tried exercising, quit drugging. I am actively looking for help from literally anyone who will give it to me, my counselor was all like “hey, I really think you should be on antidepressants for this to be effective”.I guess the joke is on me then, really quit caring about all of that and have fully embraced a bout of self destruction and am just seeing where this will go.I don’t know if I’m looking for commiseration or recommendations about a new course of action but anything’s welcome. I’m so goddamn lonely all the time, spent the past 6 hours working up the motivation for the simplest errand that I have to run.Lmao (obligatory because it was sounding a bit dark there). I’m looking for a subreddit that discusses divine missions and messages. I am aware of r/Spirituality (?) but it is not completely what I’m looking for. Any suggestions are appreciated.
    I can feel myself stepping into the early stages of Mania. All the usual signs are popping up: the energy, excitement, impulse spending, messed up sleep, wanting to be super social, etc. Most of the time, my episodes are mild, and occasionally I get important things done! But I've had a few that were pretty damaging and downright scary. Hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, that kind of thing. I've never been completely disconnected from reality, but that doesn't really make it any easier. My problem right now is that I have a lot I need to take care of, and I want to lean into the energy so to speak and get as much done as I can while I finally feel up to the task. But I know that it could turn sour, and it might not be worth the risk. The thing is, everyone in my support system is either out of town or just not close to home in the first place, as I've just moved cities, and I don't have a doctor to go yet because of insurance issues. So I feel a bit alone in this. My roommate and I seem to be on opposite schedules entirely at this point. My family is all an hour or more sway, including my partner. I don't have close friends near by and I feel like there's nobody to keep me in check if I do fly off the handle. I can feel myself resisting sleep right now. It's almost 5am and I have two job interviews tomorrow that I NEED to show up for. I am tired but for some reason I don't want to go to sleep for the night. I feel like I'm chomping at the bit. Will it be easier if I let this run its course or can I actually try to keep myself in check? How do I even do that when I'm so dysregulated?.
    BP1 diagnosed (25F) here. I’ve had one official manic episode with psychosis that led to me being hospitalised and being diagnosed. I’ve reflected on the last few years and realised I had a manic episode a few years back. What I’m not certain of is when I might have been hypomanic. It seems like my psychiatrist thinks I’ve been hypomanic for extended periods of time because I told her I don’t feel as excited about things as I used to and she said it might have been hypomania and she’s still trying to figure out what baseline looks like for me. Looking back on my teen to young adulthood I think I may have been hypomanic for months at a time but I’m not 100% sure on how to identify hypomania. What does hypomania look like to you?. I lost my group of friends when I went manic, tried to reach out to a few but it didn’t work.I’m 25 and have finished uni, and my workmates are all 40+ so I feel like I can’t relate to them much. I honestly don’t know where I am supposed to find new friends? After uni it feels like there’s no opportunity to meet new people. I’ve seen people suggest support groups but they don’t have any bipolar groups in my area. I’m also scared that new people won’t understand bipolar and I’d either have to hide it or they’ll think of me differently.After years of unemployment post manic episode I finally got a job and just finished my first week! I think the routine will be good for me. It’s a big step for me because the last time I had a job is when I went manic, still fingers crossed this time around everything will be all good since I’m now medicated. Feeling accomplished !. i’ve been having this problem for a few months, i yawn like 10-20 times throughout the day even when i’m not feeling tired. does anyone else have this problem? could it be related to medication?. I’m on abilify, wellbutrin and seroquel and i’ve been feeling for months that I have barely any thoughts and find it difficult to think of what to say in conversation which makes me feel like I have no personality. Is it the medication?. i’ve always shaken my leg and rocked back and forth in my chair ever since i was a little kid. i’ve been hyper aware of it recently ever since my psychiatrist asked me about it to see if it was the medication. now i’m questioning if it’s gotten worse since changing medication or if this is just normal for me? i know autistic people stim to self soothe and maybe im doing the same thing? has anyone else experienced this?. Mine would be when movies/tv shows say that psychosis happens because a person can’t handle reality. They had this in Shutter Island and an episode of Community. My psychosis definitely wasn’t a better alternative to reality, it just happened you know?. i know many of us have gained a lot of weight because of our medication. ive been trying to lose the weight i gained due to olanzapine but it’s slow going.last night and this morning i balled like a baby because of how fat and ugly i feel. i don’t think my self esteem will pick up until i lose the weight. i can barely even look in the mirror.edit: ozempic is only approved for type 2 diabetes in australia. hi my mum just cut my hair last night and it is horrible. it’s such an ugly length. i’m going on holidays in three weeks and i don’t want to look like this in the photos. what can i do with hair extensions to get the length back? there seem to be so many different types of extensions. i am 100% new to this world so if you could give me advice about what to do that would be great.i had my first manic episode about two years ago and haven’t worked since. i’ve spent the last year studying at uni full time and am stable now. i got a job with a graduate program starting in a few months and i’m a bit nervous about it. i’m scared i might get stressed and go manic. how do you stay stable working full time?are there any stumbling blocks i should look out for?. i haven’t worked in about 2 years & lost my last job due to my manic episode. i’m worried that working full time will somehow cause another manic episode but maybe that’s just my trauma from last time. at the moment i sleep 10-12 hours and wake up around 11 am and i know that will have to change when i start working. what were some stumbling blocks for you when you first started to work again? what should i be vigilant about?edit: i have spent the last year doing full time study so i’m not just jumping into the workforce without having done anything for two years. i’m honestly confused about how long i was manic for because i was only in the hospital for a few days but when i look back on it it feels like i was acting out of character a few weeks before and after the psych ward? i also feel like maybe i’m trying to justify shameful behaviours by thinking that i was manic before and after. but then i don’t know if that thought is me being too hard on myself and that i really was manic for a lot longer than my stay in the hospital. do hospitals release you when the episode is over or just when they think you’re not a danger anymore?. I had a manic episode about a year and a half ago. The episode is still a bit of a blur but the stuff I do remember I’m very ashamed of. I don’t think any of my friends at the time will forgive me, (I deleted social media after the manic episode & recently got it back and tried to follow old friends but they either didn’t accept or didn’t follow back so i’m assuming they don’t want to reconnect). I’ve been trying to deal with my shame in therapy and googling stuff but most stuff online says that making amends is one of the best things to help shame. I don’t think I can make amends with these people. Has anyone else had the experience of people not being able to forgive what you have done in mania?. Does anyone else not remember a bunch of stuff they said and did while they were in a manic episode? I’ve been dealing with shame for how I acted while I was manic but I don’t actually remember many specifics. I’ve lost basically all my friends because of it and I don’t think I can make amends partly because I can’t hold myself accountable for the things I don’t remember.
    I feel so worthless, empty that I just want to isolate from the world. I feel like a monster that doesn't deserve love or appreciation. I want to live in isolation. I am so depressed and scared. I don't know how to cope beyond taking meds and coming here looking for help. I feel ugly, loser, bad person, disgusting or at least that's what I have been told during all my life by my family and my ex boyfriend. The days pass fast and nobody is on here, everybody is busy, everybody never answers or cares unless I offer them money. I have no self worth and I am tired of trying. I just can't hold so much more this.Thise was a relationship with a narcissistic that destroyed me.I'm a 30 yo loser, with no friends and that falls in love with anybody that gives any bit of attention just to end up being rejected! The person I like usually finds someone better. Is like I am never enough. I just want to isolate and be happy without being hurted. It might be something bad on me. I know. I am so stupid.Somebody wants to talk? I am so sad tonight. I am bipolar and was chatting with a guy for months just to end up being in love and rejected like usually.Recently I experienced the death of a beloved one, and since then I find myself ruminating about what is the meaning of life? I don't really find happiness on getting a bunch of money, fame or power. Philosophy says the true meaning of life is being happy bur how? I remember when I was an small girl and had so many dreams about beauty, money and love thinking I would be happy. Then I got sick, got the money and the beauty but lose it all as well, I was never truly happy and now I wonder what else? What is the purpose of my existence? I am pretty aware that I will never be able to be loved and I am here just existing. Just depending on a pill...I am scared to death of being in a relationship and being in love. However when I got manic is like if a completely different person took my body and started to install dating apps and talk to humans there. When my depression hits I have heavy panic attacks because of that dating app. I have figured out to better focus on other stuff rather than being on Tinder. I don't know how long will this last (probably until I get manic again) but to me is so refreshing being by my own and focus on other hobbies. It's mentally draining to constantly deal with ghosting, rejection, insults, drug addicts, crazy people, people who want sex, etc etc At this moment I just want to ease my brain and I hope I can continue with this even if I am manic or not. And as the title says I was banned during my uninstalled/installed of that app. I am happy now :) I just want to isolate from everything.My mental health has been so bad lately. Having constant anxiety and depression. Makes me miss being hypomanic! I am not being productive at all. I just spend the whole day in my house/bed because I am scared. I have been taking my meds and more but I still feel very sick.My only online friend usually tends to make bad comments about me like criticize my every day progress and my life in general which constantly causes my anxiety to go to the roof and panic attacks today I explode and told him the truth that I am mentally ill and that I am doing my best to overcome this and not letting this to define me but after that rant I feel so embarrassed because I wrote him like 100 texts saying and explaining him how his constant criticism affects me. And he only say "relax". I know we shouldn't be friends because he is pretty much toxic but I don't want to be alone :(((. Between the super extroverted easy going talkative human or the depressed human there is me hidden from everybody a shy introverted calmed human being. I wish I were more stable from time to time.I met this person online and it has become my best friend but they have a bitter personality and often make bad comments about me about what I am. But most of the causes of them are my illness. And everytime he criticize me I have a bad panic attack for sure so we were arguing today and I told him to stop because I was going to have a panic attack because I am mentally ill. I don't know how he will react to this, because who would like someone that gets mood swings, panic attacks and heavy anxiety? Thank you to this amazing community for all the support it has given me! Thank you.
    Today one of my closest friends got engaged and another is set to get married in May. My brother is finishing up his degree in December and my youngest brother is pursuing a career in basketball. And then there’s me. 28 years old, working the same part-time job that I’ve had for two years, literally struggling to regulate my thoughts on a day to day basis. I understand that we each have our own paths to follow and that seeking validation, and comparing ourselves to others isn’t productive but how the fuck am I not supposed to when everyone that I care about is moving forward with their lives while I continue to rot in the same place.I want to feel loved, to find a career that brings me some level of joy/stability, to not have my emotions constantly overwhelm me, to control my spending and sexual impulses, to sustain my relationships and friendships, and to have a reason to get up every morning but it feels like I can’t. And even when I can, it feels like it’s taking so much self awareness that it leaves me living in a state of burnout. I want to be wanted and I want to have the ability to pursue things in my life but idk how. It feels like I’m hitting a dead end and I heavily contemplate suicide or signing myself up into a psych ward.How do you all deal with this?.
    backstory- i had a very bad manic episode late last year which lead into a MAJOR depression episode to the point where i tried to hospitalize myself ( they wouldn’t admit me due to insurance…bullshit but whatever) and after i finally recovered from that i’ve been doing pretty good. so that brings me to today, i finally decided to make my own butter (i’ve been wanting to), and then me and my partner made an organic compost so we went out and got all the stuff. later on i was looking how to make my own pet safe candles and i was talking to him about it and he asked me if i’m going through an episode. i said no, why and he said because i’m wanting to do a lot of things and only happens when i am going through an episode. after he said that it sent me in a spiral and now i don’t know if i am or i’m not.can other people tell when a person is bipolar? like do we give off a certain vibe or something? my perception of myself is obviously biased but i’m curious if it’s noticeable.hello all, i don’t know if i need to go back to the hospital. i don’t wanna be a disappointment or a burden but i don’t know what else to do. i don’t trust myself, thoughts or actions. it’s been years since my last hospitalization and i keep up the appearance to everyone that i’m okay and stable, but i’m not, in fact far from it. i’ve been off my meds for awhile now and i hate them so much, but everyone thinks i’m on them. during my last eat manic episode i’ve opened up 4 credit cards and have maxed out all of them, rarely show up to work ( surprisingly i still have my job ), lying about why i can’t be at work ( also not normal for me ), and i literally have no money to my name. i am almost done with my semester but i’ve had to drop 3 classes and am already barely passing. i don’t wanna go back but i don’t know what else to do.UPDATE: i spent all day at the hospital trying to check in only for them to turn me away AFTER referring me to inpatient services… i went through the whole process and assessment when they knew right from the beginning i didn’t have insurance then said go to your university’s counseling center… words cannot even describe how upset and angry i am. this just confirms my previous beliefs that i will never get help from any doctor.i’ve been in a depression crash since my last manic episode and today was the first day i actually woke up and saw sunlight!! i now have to dig myself out of the deepest trench i have ever gotten myself into but i think i can do it. to anyone out there laying down but still thinking laying down is too much work- i feel you and you can get through this!.
    I'm currently having my meds prescribed by my pcp. I used to have a psychiatrist through this provider in their office, but something happened with the mental health department, and I lost my psychiatrist for the millionth time. I had been following this psychiatrist from clinic to clinic because having to explain myself in an intake appointment to a new doctor is just draining and sometimes I get the feeling, at least in the past, that they didn't really believe me since I am very high functioning. I have been thinking that I need a change to my meds. I want to continue to take the brexpiprazole, but I wanted to add an antipsychotic to my regimen. I stopped taking it years ago, and I have been able to function and get through life with relative ease. I still have some struggles, and sometimes my thoughts are not the best, but I have an excellent support structure and some good coping skills. In the past year or so I have noticed that I have been struggling quite a bit more and to be honest I just need a little extra help, so I was thinking maybe incorporating some type of medication to help. Do I need to ask my pcp for a referral to go to a psychiatrist for a new medication regimen, or will my pcp be able to write the script?. I'm currently having my meds prescribed by my pcp.

    I have Bipolar 2 Disorder, along with other mental illnesses, and I'll be honest I stopped taking my meds back in March. I ended up getting COVID and when I had it I had no desire to do anything but sleep so I stopped taking my meds and my mom didn't want to fight with me to take them. Well now I'm in college and moved out and I tried to take my meds again in August about a week before I moved in to my dorm so that way I could be functioning at school. Didn't work. Because I'm a little self conscious about all of the meds I take I didn't want to take them infront of my roomate. She doesn't struggle with mental health like I do and when we've had conversations on it she just doesn't understand how this effects me entire life. So I stopped taking them again and I thought I was fine because I wasn't really in episodes. I had a hypomanic episode that lasted about a week in September but other than that I've been fine. But it hit me tonight that I haven't been fine. I've just been forcing myself to overwork myself and always keep myself busy so I wouldn't have to deal with anything. It's getting colder where I'm at and we recently got hit with a foot of snow. I'm away from my support system and I know two people where I live now, my roomate and my boyfriend. Making matters even worse I do not have insurance so when I do run out of the meds that I have, which is not a big supply, I will be screwed. I'm trying to take my meds again and get insurance figured out. I'm just alone and not doing well and I was wondering if anyone had some advice on how to get me in a routine of taking my meds again, and when I do run out if I do not have my insurance sorted out what I am supposed to do until I do get insurance because on a college budget there is very little money left over for a psychiatrist appointment and medicine. Yeah I know the title is a common thing with us but God I'm just, I need to vent for a minute. I hate, and I mean hate, that people automatically assume that since I have OCD I'm clean and neat. I am extremely disorganized and dirty with how I live, mostly due to depression. I've tried explaining to people that it is not being clean or constantly washing my hands or shit like that. It's not. I think the only "clean" thing my OCD makes me do is that I constantly shower because it constantly feels like I have dirt on me or I can feel stuff on me. That's it. During the height of the pandemic my contamination OCD was worse but now it's not as bad. I just wish people would realize that OCD is so so much more than being neat. I wish I could fully explain my OCD to people but I can't because they do not understand it because media portays it as something that it isn't. Vent over, just needed to vent and yeah I know everything I've said has been said a million times in this subreddit before but I needed to vent.Accidently deleted the game when I was going through my phone and I originally had all of the expansion packs unlocked and everything, was a bitzen before they changed it to where you had to pay for everything, but now I don't have any of it. Lowkey mad about it because I've been a supporter of the game since it came out and I've been a bitzen since it was $5. So it seems that everytime after I have sex I end up with a UTI or a yeast infection. I clean myself up pretty well and I always shower afterwards but it's just becoming a problem. I'm just wonding if there is anything I can do to help out with this problem? Any advice will be appreciated!. So my period is about 6 days late now and I had unprotected sex about three weeks ago. I did take plan b shortly afterwards, less than 24 hours later, so my period could be late because of that. Or my period could be late because a couple of days later in August I ended up getting a second period for that month, not uncommon for me of this does happen it will normally go into the next month (so September) for the first day or two and then my next period won't come until the very end of the month. My periods have always been a little irregular and I didn't start tracking them until I moved out because I could always count on them to come either before or after my mom and my sister's. I've also been extremely stressed out because of school, work, money, ect and typically when I'm more stressed out my period is a bit later than usuall. Idk I'm just really worried now more than ever so I'm just wondering if I should go and buy a pregnancy test or if I should just wait until the beginning of October to get one.So I'd say since Monday (it's Thursday) I've been really, wet down there and it's not from like being turned on or anything it's just something that's happening. We'll with this there is more discharge also, not a super big problem just there's more than usual. I'm only looking for help/advice on what to do because it's getting to be a problem with how damp I'm getting. Is this normal or should I like do something?. So I moved 17 hours away from my home to go to college. I wasn't super upset by it at first since my dad lives only an hour away from my college. But now that it's been a week of classes and I've been moved in for a week, I'm extremely homesick for my mom. I've never done the best at social interactions due to severe anxiety and living in a dorm with someone else is starting to get to me. I'm the type of person that needs their personal space and needs alone time often. My roomate is great, she really is. I don't have any issues with her. But I'm just having issues making friends in general and trying to not feel homesick. I don't want to drop out, but I'm starting to feel like that maybe going so far away from home wasn't the best decision.So couple days ago, Wednesday, I had sex for the first time. I was expecting to be a little sore the next day, but what I wasn't expecting is to now on Saturday still be a little sore? Sore isn't really the right word but I have this slight pain still but it's not a pain that is making me uncomfortable. I don’t think it's a UTI because I cleaned up afterwards and I also took a shower the next day. Only reason why I think it could be a UTI is because really I only get this feeling when I use the restroom, but I also felt this feeling when I masturbated last night. Idk I'm just a little concerned and I don't know if I need to be or not. Any advice is appreciated. I'm moving into my dorm soon, but the day I'm moving into my dorm my friends and I want to go and do some stuff that night and I was just planning on crashing at their place, but since it's the first night/move in day I didn’t know if i had to spend the night there or not.I've always been interested in the "almost names" like what you were almost named or what you almost named your kid. For me I was almost named Jennifer but my mom shut that down quick so I also almost become Verda May. My younger sister was also almost named Jennifer because my dad just didn't learn the first time around. I just think it's always interesting to know what you could've almost been named.I'm currently looking for a good tattoo shop in the Minot, ND area. I recently moved here and I'm wanting to find a good shop to get a tattoo done at. Just looking for people's advice on where to go or who to go to. Thanks!.
    I’m starting my first real job as an adult. An office job, pretty nervous about it but proud for landing the job. They sent the form asking about health concerns etc, one of the questions literally being: have u ever been treated for any mental issues such as manic depressive etc… I was a hesitant to be honest. I don’t want people in my work life to know about me having bipolar. I want my professional career to be separated with my social and mental struggles. I answered no. But I then signed the document, now feel like it is wrong from me to keep it to myself while also signing that I’m being honest. But I just don’t want anyone in the office to know, I feel like I’m pretty good at dealing with my bipolar, I’m not medicated yet I’m doing incredibly well, havnt had a depressive episode in months and my mania is hypomania (It only gets really bad if I don’t take care of myself or I’m in high amounts of stress which has led before to psychosis) am I wrong? Did I do something wrong?. IMPORTANT: I’ve been a member for 10 months, always been supportive and super kind in chat. Recently I saw a post that said that they were a paying member and they checked if they had been secretly banned from chat and they had been. I was confused, apparently mods can ban you and your chats seem like they’re being posted but nobody else sees them except for you. I checked, I went on incognito mode and looked at the chat while I wrote something from my actual account, nothing. I was banned from chat. All this time thinking I was putting input in the chat, all this time of me sending love and thinking I was part of the chat. Why have I been paying? When did I get banned? Why did I get banned? All questions I can’t answer. I’m hurt, and feel like I have been throwing money to an echo chamber. I wonder how many people pay to be a member and don’t even know they are banned. I genuinely can’t fathom why I could have been banned, I’ve seen so much negativity in chat and I’ve never been like that, I’m always in chat hyping up the crews or giving opinions about the topics being spoken about.So I’ve been feeling off, but I’m not feeling my usual symptoms of mania; no fast talking no energy. But I am not hungry, not sleeping/ no need for sleep, irritable, and I have this buzz feeling, like a constant feeling like I’m high. Could it still be mania if I don’t have energy? I Guess in not in the point where I’m super impulsive, talking a ton or full of energy so I’m confused. It’s like a combination of anger and mania it’s so odd… I just feel high without the euphoria, it’s more like that anxiety you feel when you have too much caffeine.I’m on my first campaign, I decided to romance a few characters and Astarion. Yesterday Astarion came forth to confess his feelings. I was in the middle of the shadowlands not even thinking about the romance aspect of the game so it caught me off guard, he dropped a bomb on my character, turns out he was intimate with our character for stuff in return huh. I know he’s a character but that broke me. I immediately saved because I wanted to try a few options of dialogue. I realized that those options in which you ask to get intimate with him after he tells you he doesn’t want to be seen as “s3x” anymore lead to him saying, “I’ve never known how to say no but now I do” and he breaks up with you. I didn’t realize that Astarion’s relationship would be so interwoven with consent and s3xual trauma. It’s heartbreaking and I got teary eyed when i thought about it. Then immediately touched grass for crying over a game npc but hells I can relate to him.I’m a woman, don’t know if that matters. But I’ve been struggling so much lately and I just feel like everyone around me looks alive and I don’t… I don’t even know how to put it into words but everyone is so full of color and their hair is full… then there’s me. I feel like I look so dull compared to everyone else. I used to be a pretty girl who got a lot of attention for my looks, now people don’t view me as pretty anymore. Men don’t give me a second look. I just feel like I’m rotting from the inside, and my looks have caught up with how I’ve always felt inside. Is this a bipolar thing? Does anyone else feel like they’re already dead… is this just a symptom of depression?.
    Anyone have any good info for support meetings?I searched support meetings for bipolar and found Recovery International. The goal was for my partner to understand what I’m going through, and for myself to be able to talk about my struggles. I thought this would be kind of like AA/NA format. It was in a church basement (which is meh, but I’ll take what I can get).I am not at all trivializing anyone’s experience, but this program (non-religious btw) seemed to gear towards minor anxieties. The speakers talked about fear of mice in the garage, or anxiety caused by when a gps paused while receiving a call when driving. I’m glad it helps them, but it was not helpful for me.Are there any good support groups for bipolar, even if it’s remote? We are in upstate NY.I work in WFM (workforce management/optimization) for a pharmaceuticals contact center. I have 3 employees and I love them dearly. My junior analyst is here locally with me (we are 90% remote). I have always given her 5/5 on her quarterly bonuses and annual raises because she is a rockstar. This is a niche field, and she had adjacent relevant experience. I have 2 other employees, who are coordinators, in Colorado. My more senior hire, of two years, makes so many errors. I know he knows the work, but he butchers schedules, misses steps, and updates things in wrong time zones. He was an external hire and had very relevant experience in this field. He is so nice, but I coach the same things over and over. My most recent hire has no experience in this field, but was a team lead at the Colorado call center. Internal hire. He has surpassed my other hire. I gave him a bigger bonus and raise this quarter. He’s just that good. I have career pathing (coordinator, analyst I-salaried, and analyst II). I want to get my first hire up to analyst, but at this rate the new hire is on the faster track for that. I feel like it will leave a bad taste if newer hire is moved up before my older hire. How do you motivate a really great employee (he always steps up for overtime and to help) who is super dedicated but misses a lot of details? How can I help and be more supportive? We do have regular one on ones and team meetings and I provide coaching. I am available via text whenever they have questions, and so is my junior analyst. I just want my staff to all flourish.This pains me to type out. I have bipolar disorder. Every day is a struggle, but I manage to get by. I own my home, have a good career, have my dogs I adore, and what was a generally happy relationship.I recently had a manic episode after months of stability that was intense and lasted quite some time. I wound up hospitalized. I was put on a new medication upon being discharged. This medication has been helping me to function. Maintaining my job, being functional during the day, etc.My partner is apparently against psych meds (he himself takes adderall for ADD). He has yelled at me “take more dope, they’re doping you up” and is resentful that I take medication that is keeping me stable. He says my manic episode was just PMS. (People with pms generally don’t wind up in the psych ward). I don’t understand this mentality. I have never shamed him about his ADD or how it is treated. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope? My therapist agrees it is hypocritical and weird.I thoroughly love dogs, and earlier this year decided to start fostering for a local rescue. I figured it would be fun to have puppies here and there, then send them on their way. It’s also a great way to give back to the community and meet new friends. Win win. My partner and I fostered seven dogs and puppies over the summer, and most went off without a hitch. I even got to do a segment on the local news with a big ole coonhound, and he got adopted within days. We took all dogs in our care hiking, swimming, to breweries etc. to help them socialize. Our latest one was a sweet little pup named Rosie. Rosie was a true mutt labeled “boxer mix”, and she was the most lovely ginger color with floppy ears and a long tipped tail. Just a sweet little thing. I talked her up in our group chats at work, and a coworker in the IT department wanted to adopt her. Great.We arrange to do the adoption at a local park halfway between our homes. This park also has a lovely hiking trail, so we loaded up our other dogs along with Rosie into our beloved Honda Odyssey van to go on a hike after the adoption. We put two cans of IPA in the cup holders in the back of the center console to enjoy on the hike, and rolled out on a drizzly, overcast day. A few miles down the road, I’m riding passenger when all of a sudden liquid starts raining down on my head from the ceiling. I start yelling “pull over, the van is leaking!” I thought this was odd, since it’s a newer vehicle without issues, but figured somehow the rain was leaking in. It was IPA. Rosie chewed open a can of beer, which sprayed up at the ceiling and rained down onto my head. She was making a pretty good effort at chugging it down too. After some clean up with paper towels and snatching the drink away from ms. boozehound, we made it to the destination. Coworker fell in love with the pup, and paperwork got filled out. He asked if there was anything he should know about her, to which we quickly replied “don’t leave any drinks on tables.” All of my personal dogs have a strong aversion to adult beverages, but another one we fostered had to have a glass of Chardonnay snatched away from her. Some dogs just seem to have a taste for it I guess.As we all know, this disorder can seriously impact our energy levels. I’m having a hard time getting my significant other (who is generally supportive) to understand that. Waking up is an effort. Getting to work on time (for my work from home job as a data analyst) is an effort. Performing my job is an effort. At the end of even a reasonably “good” day I am sapped of energy. I’ve used my spoons, if you will. I have tried so hard to express that I need an hour or two after work to decompress, that immediately jumping into other activities is overwhelming for me, and will impact my energy and ability to do things on subsequent days of the week.My partner equates this with laziness. I am expected to go to his kids soccer games 15 minutes after my shift ends. Or do yardwork or household chores immediately. If I gently say I am going to sit this out, or I need some downtime to normalize, I get lambasted or guilted. How do you get your loved ones to understand? I want to participate as much as possible, but there are literally times when I cannot. I don’t have the physical or mental fortitude. I guess maybe that is hard for some folks to understand. It’s frustrating.I recently spent 3 days in the psych ward for arguably my worst manic episode yet. It was very intense and ended in some pretty brutal SH. My partner had to break down the bathroom door and I was taken away by ambulance.I feel so guilty and ashamed. Like rock bottom low. My boyfriend called my boss and explained the situation. Thankfully, everyone at work has been so supportive (which in turn makes me feel even more guilt). He says he’s terrified to come home and find me not alive now, so he drives around the block several times mentally preparing himself. I hate this.Fast forward one week. I have to leave for a work trip to Denver on Monday (I live in NY). Turns out my boyfriend and my boss have been coordinating for another colleague to “babysit” me on this trip to ensure my safety. I know this is an incredibly caring gesture, but I hate that my illness is that bad that it comes down to this. It’s humiliating. I just want to curl up in a ball and die. I just wish I could be normal.
    Hey, its me again!I just wanted to ask has anyone ever felt what their 'normal' was, if ever? I don't remember what or when my baseline was without anguish. Perhaps it is my trauma or that I am now medicated, but I don't even know what normal feels like. It is as if I'm always at the edge, waiting for the next depressive or hypomanic episode to happen. I'm also worried that I could have been faking this mess the entire time.I don't know why this feels so scary, but it is.*(I have already shared this in another bipolar community, but I thought I'd share it here too since I cannot crosspost.)*&#x200B;Hi all,So, I've been thinking a lot about this, and I am finding myself struggling to accept it for some reason. After years of being unable to find a psychiatrist who takes my insurance (I'm on Medicaid), I managed to find one as I was experiencing the worst depressive episode of my life. I wouldn't wish that experience on my worst enemy. It was as if there was a constant weight on my chest, on my shoulders, everywhere. I, normally, would be able to push through my depressive episodes, but this time, I couldn't and was seriously considering offing myself.I've been with my therapist for about six years at this point and my psychiatrist for a little over two months. She and my therapist collaborate on my care. I've been diagnosed with MDD with Mixed Episodes, GAD, Bulimia Nervosa, and C-PTSD. And I also screened positive for BPD, so we will see how that goes.I was put on lurasidone (Latuda) as my first med and it has been going alright with me. I have conflicting feelings about an antipsychotic, especially with potential weight gain (thanks ED), but I've been doing my best to be consistent. After two weeks, I was on escitalopram (Lexapro).In less than four days, 5mg of Lexapro once a day sent me into a hypomanic episode.I felt like a superwoman. I was jittery, full of energy, running all over my city (hopping from one bus to another, going god knows where), spending so much money on my brothers and myself, sleeping a lot less, talking fast, trying to meet guys over the internet for sex—the whole nine yards. It was like my mind and my mouth were running at different speeds, and my body had so much more energy than it could handle. I'm a nursing student, and I have to interview nurses for my final capstone project. They quite suspiciously eyed me as I took over interviews and were literally pacing up and down the hallways.Oddly enough, I was still deep in my hypomanic episode when I saw both my therapist and psychiatrist, and she told me that she was going to potentially change my diagnosis from MDD with Mixed Episodes to Bipolar II in our next appointment, seeing how I respond to lamotrigine. I'm off Lexapro completely.I'm just not sure what to feel about it. I do have a family history of psychotic disorders (my mom and paternal aunt), but I'm a bit scared of the bipolar II diagnosis. At this point, it seems accurate when I think back to my turbulent childhood, but it is still a weird gray area for me.How did you cope with your bipolar diagnosis? Had anyone experienced a hypomanic or manic episode after taking an SSRI and was it as quick or quicker than me? I'd like to know your experiences.Thank you!.

Hi all!I never thought I'd be on this Reddit, but here I am. I am the big sister of a victim, who happens to be my nineteen-year-old brother. I just found out today that some man on Twitter (or X) has been extorting him for nudes and personal information and making him open many PayPal accounts for weird money transactions. I found this information when my little brother asked me for money to send to this weirdo.I also want everyone to note that my little brother is autistic and isn't super savvy when it comes to social media and stuff. He never had proper teaching on how to be safe online due to our abusive upbringing. He is a gamer and animal lover and it scares me to think how long he has been with this predator. I also believe the death of our other brother (I have three) made him more vulnerable, but I'm not sure. I'm not a therapist.Anyways, I told my brother (who is scared to death rn) to block this man and not respond to him. Unfortunately, I've seen the nudes and many of the things he was made to send to him and it made me sick to my stomach. The man threatened to release the images if my brother does not comply to his demands with money and more pictures.I was thinking about heading to the police station tomorrow morning to make a report, but I am not sure what else I can do from here. I'm angry and scared for him. Telling our parents is not an option because our father is abusive and it will send my brother on a sewercidal (censoring for reasons) spiral and I am doing my best to protect him as best I can.Any advice? What can I do from here? Is there anything else I can do? I'm sorry if this is super vague.Btw, I'm 26 if that counts for anything.
    I have recently been having manic panic episodes coming off a 3ish month manic episode that was horrible but not to what I’ve had before. I’m a mixed bipolar so I struggle with rapid cycling. I’m apparently in a depressive episode now according to my doctor but it is simply horrendous. I can’t sleep because I start having panic attacks and my brain literally can’t shut off even though it’s all I and it wants to do. It’s causing physical problems with me and I’m having troubles regulating everything. I’ve been taking a lot of different meds bc it’s getting hard to function, but I’m hating all of them. Not a single thing is making me feel even close to back to myself and I’m struggling with really bad DPDR. I haven’t had it this bad since I was diagnosed and I don’t know what to do. It feels very dark. I know I’ll get out but I’m exhausted, being patient while battling this is exhausting. I took Seroquel a few times, and this past week I broke down with my doc and he put me on 400 mg for a week. I’ve only ever taken 200. It kicked my ass, I actually haven’t had a worse experience with a med and I’ve had an allergic reaction to Depakote. My brain still wouldn’t shut off with the seroquel and I got sleep paralysis and then even worse anxiety and dissociation the next day. Does anyone else struggle badly with sleeping like this where you get so overtired it’s hard to function and makes the bipolar worse? Or had an experience like this with seroquel? I’ve never liked it much but it usually does make me sleep. I feel like I’m going to have a psychotic break and I hate being alone with my thoughts. Just trying to feel like I’m not so alone in this.I have been finding Salt Lake such major entertainment for me. I know everyone is pretty bored with the drama but I’m absolutely loving this season. The women are so unintentionally funny, episode 3 in Arizona I could not stop laughing; wasted on the party bike and throwing some cheap ass rose all over each other and then the intense dinner where there’s a pause in the conversation and whitney goes should we burn something and Jen’s like “Lisa.” I was cacklingggg. Sidenote: Heather stop ripping on AZ, some of the most interesting things they’ve done on the show, were deadass one of the best states goodbye. But the house was hideous and a major misrep of Scottsdale.Love Dorit with all of my little heart but please tell me I wasn’t the only one screaming crying when she was getting offended by them fucking up the charity’s name?? It couldn’t be worse, no doubt it is for a WONDERFUL cause, but my god, please rename it.The poor me campaign! The immaturity! I literally want to scream at her through my TV, if they bring her back I will die I legitimately can’t handle how absolutely rude, condescending and immature she is. Bitch needs to take a look in the mirror, please, I’m done with her. It’s making it hard to watch bc I despise her so much…. For me Meredith was hands down the best, so unique and stunning…2) Jen3) Heather4) Whitney5) Lisa (color was cool but nothing else was standout at all) 6) Jennie. So I love Larsa and I don’t like Adriana at all but Larsa calling her bipolar was absolutely NOT okay- don’t use that as a slur, it’s such a real and painful illness for people like that’s so low of her I’m so disappointed. I just was started on Buspar and Trileptal and have some big drinking milestones coming up in college life (boyfriends 21st, senior vegas trip, etc)...I drank with no change on Lexapro and hydroxyzine and they never did a thing to me and when I go out and drink like I go out and drink, I don’t want to really worry about this but I’ve recently for some reason developed major anxiety about meds? I literally had probably 8 drinks or so on both meds and they never did a thing to me but these are new meds. I’m not as worried about the trileptal, more the buspar, but I’m on a super low dose and am ofc going to consult with my doc about this, she knows I’m in college and I’m not ready to give up partying quite yet...any advice? I was told I could maybe skip the buspar for those days since I’ve gotten the anxiety pretty regulated now? Just looking for some advice, not really a rant- I know you’re not supposed to drink on any of these, but I still like to enjoy a good night out. Also for anyone out there concerned about drinking and hydroxyzine I swear I didn’t change a thing, had shots on it and everything, and it didn’t do a thing.
    What do you all eat with your dose of Latuda? I was told I had to eat a minimum of 350 calories with it before bed. I’m currently force feeding myself a peanut butter sandwich because I’m not hungry but obviously need to eat something with my medicine. Looking for snack ideas from those who are also taking it.I’ve never experienced audible hallucinations. I keep hearing noises. Or things keep playing in my head. I have been cooped up in my room for days, I can go places but when im home I am literally hiding in my bed. I’ve been like this for days but I just started hearing things that im aware are not real but it’s still scary. I can’t call my psychiatrist because it’s Sunday night but I’ll probably call in the morning but what does this mean? This is new and I hate it. I also keep seeing things out of the corner of my eyes which I also can differentiate from fake vs reality. My husband will be home soon and he’s always supportive but this is new. What do you do? I don’t want to sound silly because I am able to figure out that what I’m seeing/hearing is not real so I don’t know if maybe it’s not a huge deal. Is this mania? To add a little insult to injury I spent nearly my entire paycheck yesterday alone. I’m so new to this, I’m scared, I don’t know what any of this means. I’m also afraid they’re going to send me inpatient and the thought of that absolutely terrifies me because germs and what if someone tries to kill me there or something.I’ve never been inpatient. My husband thinks it may be time. He’s a police officer and has special training on top of that on dealing with mental illness. I’ve been really paranoid and have been hiding in my room. Im still able to go to work, I work in an office setting with just two other people then come straight home and hide. Im afraid something’s going to happen. Im afraid the house will explode or collapse or someone will break in and kill me. I know it’s silly at the same time but I’m frozen in fear. He can’t keep coming home to take care of my fears and has to work so we have money. Im new to this bipolar thing. They’re still working out my medications and I don’t know what’s “okay” or normal. Im mostly just venting. Has anyone else dealt with this? Like have you been aware you’re being ridiculous but being terrified at the same time? Any experience is welcome.I’ve been going through process and was just officially diagnosed yesterday. I wasn’t surprised, we have been treating it for almost a year and we kind of knew but to have the doctor diagnose it felt like a relief at first. We finally knew what was wrong. Today it really hit me like a brick wall. I will be this way for forever. There is no cure. I will be on medication for the rest of my life. If I’m not on medication I will be unstable and everyone around me suffers including myself. I’m just really down and really sad that I have to be on medication that changes who I am and makes me feel like a zombie or be unstable and continue to hurt everyone around me and wreck everything. Both options really suck.I’m mostly venting. I’m just sad.I’m working with my primary care provider towards a diagnosis. He isn’t comfortable diagnosing me officially but gave me a referral and started me on some medications. My appointment was the next available and it’s three months away. The hospital recommended trying something like Cerebral to be seen sooner. Just curious what others have experienced with it. I am aware of the lawsuits. So no need for those to be brought up, I’m just looking for others experiences.
    At this point, I really am trying. I’m trying so hard in school and I’m doing horribly. Cognitively I’m no where where I was pre-manic/mixed/depressive back-to-back episodes for about three months and none of the information sticks. Psychiatrist even said that it makes sense for my brain to be fried but I don’t know how to explain that to my university that unfortunately BP 1 IS debilitating, and on top of it all I don’t do anything if I don’t see it there in my face to do things. I’m struggling and I feel under pressure. I want to do well but I’m not doing well. And at point I start hallucinating again and those situations are very disorienting for me. I simply don’t know how to explain that I need to drop these classes and try again next semester. Mainly two things, has anyone ever experienced or felt like they have lower cognitive abilities after a handful of episodes? I genuinely believe that I’m no longer how I used to be, now I feel like I cannot *think* the way I used to. I wouldn’t say I didn’t struggle with stem classes but dang, I am struggling so much right now in multiple aspects of my life. It’s like I can’t apply myself like I used, I feel so much slower and I don’t know if that’s just a me thing or something that has some kind of backing to it. Secondly, I genuinely don’t know if my anxiety about germs is something I should bring up to my doctor. I’m on Seroquel and it has also helped with general anxiety but I can’t get over my need to sanitize anything I barley touched with the “outside” germs. It’s a whole issue if I feel like my hand touched something dirty and I have to wash my hands over and over again. I’ve worked really hard to not wash my hands to the point that they’re bleeding, but I feel like it gets worse with stress. I know there are comorbidities with BP, but I don’t know when something is an actual issue or me just needing to being clean.Any advice is welcome, just hoping I’m not being irrational or something. Thanks :). I have felt like maybe it’s time I actually see disability aid at school, even though initially I was like “ahh, I don’t need nothing. I’m good” I’m in fact, not good. I feel apart of engineering just simply being hard, I’m not cognitively where I used to be, I feel like I have to relearn how to work with brain instead of against and I see everyone literally getting better grades than me. I’m frustrated because I thought well “with these meds my brain won’t be fuzzy” and they help to a degree, hypomania didn’t last long enough to get me through school and my brain is really just mush after being extremely manic or depressed the entire summer. I don’t know how to communicate to people that I’m struggling and I need help, I don’t know what kind of accommodations I’m allowed to get, if there’s even any in the college sense. Any advice would be heavily appreciated, I’m not even sure if I should go try too, I feel like they’re just gonna tell me to power through it.I’m kinda jealous of the people who don’t have to go through the constant ups and downs and I wish I didn’t have psychotic symptoms. I feel like I keep having the up my dosages of my meds and I still can’t feel “stable,” I don’t know if it’s just the stress of college that triggered the hallucinations again, which upsets me because I’m literally like on a antipsychotic. I asked a close friend for reassurance and if they experience the same symptoms because I truly don’t know what is “normal” and they told me that maybe I’m just paranoid. Told people I thought I could trust that I’m on lithium and they said “you don’t look crazy.” And that really hurts. On top of it all, my hidradenitis suppurativa is acting up and I’m in pain and I feel like I’m just rotting at the rope of age of 20 and not even lithium or Seroquel are helping with the depressive symptoms. I feel like a burden to people, I feel stupid and I feel like all I’m seen as is a “crazy/psychotic person nobody wants to be around.” MDD is no joke, but I feel that people are so much more nicer when talking about MDD and GAD. I can’t ask people if they see the people I see, because they don’t confirm or deny it and I just want to know if the people I saw were real. I do have a upcoming psych appointment but I feel stupid for talking about things if it’s something everyone experiences but nobody in my life says yes or no. I feel so alone and I’m in physical pain and I can’t simply just “move” normally. I feel fucked over and like I just have to Struggle needlessly.I just recently came down from a hypo/manic episode and I feel so shitty. I was previously diagnosed as having MDD but after two-ish months of not seeing my psychiatrist he changed my diagnosis to (maybe) bipolar because he admitted he isn’t so sure yet given I barley just saw him again and my other issues manic me finally decided to blurt out. I feel so stupid for all of the things I’ve done and said while I was manic. I spent so much money, said way too many bold things, the only thing stopping me from doing something genuinely more reckless than blacking out in a 5ft pool (im short) was that my family restricted my outings unless I was around them. I feel so embarrassed for how intense I was at work and I don’t know how to cope with my mania post-come down. How do I explain to my manager that the reason I was so 🔥💥👹💥🔥👺👾 at work was because I was manic and the stupid shit I told people was just me being psychotic. I’m scared of losing the only people I have left. I even posted a very embarrassing post here about not needing my Seroquel. I just feel so shitty, I don’t know what’s my true thoughts or feelings anymore. TW: Rape and PTSD For context, this started about a bit over a week ago when my PTSD got triggered. I was out enjoying my time having fun eating out with my friends after not seeing them in over a year. Since we were heading back to the hotel and my friends Uber didn’t have enough space for all of us my (male) friend offered to drive me to the hotel (more like his parents and himself we are still high school seniors barley turned 18) nonetheless, I agreed and it hasn’t set in onto me yet by that point until my friends dad came and spoke and his voice was deep. And this is where it all started setting in. My trauma from being raped as a child (and multiple sexual assault occurrences) and my Trauma with being tracked down by parents 24/7 and that if I fuck Up or get hurt(raped/kidnapped/killed etc) I would lose all my privileges and being instilled that my parents would be furious with me for taking an offer of my friend driving me back to the hotel about how “there are two men. You’re asking for it. You get hurt” has really fucked me up. And I live in a metropolis area so I have history with sexual assault within the transit system from my ex-boyfriend, and now that I’ve been invited out with my friends and my specific guy friend from earlier... and I’m so scared. I can’t even describe how scared I am. I’m so tired of being afab, I want the flashbacks to stop and i want to move on from my life. It’s been nine years since I as raped and I can’t get fucking over it already.
    So I’m (18F) a psych major in university, and it was basically confirmed by 2 of my professors that I have bipolar. The first one said it sounded like a possibility, and the second one confirmed it and agreed i also have some psychotic features mixed in (thanks great grandma!). The second professor said she’s impressed and that it seems like im managing well, but I went to visit the first professor earlier this week and he said I need to get on meds before I end up seriously fucking up my life. He’s right. I know he’s right. There’s been a couple roadblocks with the last couple providers I tried to go to, so I got discouraged and quit. Finally have a real psychiatrist appointment for tomorrow afternoon. What should I expect?. My (f18) friend group is in shambles. One of the boys in our friend group thinks it’s so hilarious to call me Kanye. I made a joke the other night saying he got a case of the Kanye’s bc he was being egotistical, and he took it way too far. He threw it back at me and blatantly outed me in this group where not everyone knew I deal with bipolar. I tried explaining what he did and how he took it too far, and he didn’t even acknowledge that he did anything. The others that knew agreed that he shouldn’t have done what he did, and we’re trying to kick him out of our group. I cleared the air with the person that he outed me to, and this boy took it amazingly and we got closer than we’ve ever been. On top of this, the boy that’s causing the problems started with one of the girls in the group today saying she’s sped and has Down syndrome for no good reason.I’ve been fine for a bit, but the past couple weeks have really pushed me. I’m watching my friends have fun away at college while I’m at a local school with almost no friends. I also didn’t really sleep for like 3 days and had to take meds to finally be able to get sleep. Everything seems so pointless. I’m pretty sure one of my friends is developing alcoholism, and I can’t do anything to stop it, and it brought back some things with past addiction/trauma. My sister is mad at me because we haven’t been spending much time together since our schedules changed, I started crying driving to work a couple days ago, and then I started self harming in the car before work as a release. I’ve never self harmed like that before, and today food doesn’t taste the same, my skin feels so heavy that it’s such an effort to do anything, I have no motivation and keep crying on and off, and I’ve started planning my suicide and figuring out how to word the note. My family is so weird with mental health because we all have some kind of issue, but it’s seen as taboo in my family because my parents are traditional/Latin-European immigrant background. I don’t want to upset my family by getting emergency services, but I don’t know how much longer I can make it.I feel like I’m getting worse at being able to tell how I’m feeling. I just got back a couple days ago from seeing my friends, and I just totally crashed. I’m so irritable and sad, and I’ve been taking it out on my family, which I know isn’t fair. Now that I’m thinking about it, I barely slept the whole week I was away and I felt fine, I was super fast with being able to come up with jokes, I was so desperate to do all my friend’s homework and help them around the apartment, I downloaded tinder with my friend just for fun and got more flirty than I normally would, I kept tripping over my words because I couldn’t get my thoughts out fast enough or I’d get distracted and forget what I was saying. I also tried things that I normally wouldn’t try, had a spout of impulse buying, and my appetite was very increased. I also like one of the boys so it probably elevated things too. My friends also said this is the happiest they’ve ever seen me and they keep begging me to come back which is making me sadder. And now I just feel like shit and all I want to do is go back.Anyway, thanks for listening.I went to visit my friends at college for a week and now I’m back home and so sad that I’m not there anymore. It was my first choice of school and I didn’t apply and now I’m regretting it so much. I also like one of them and my friends think he likes me too, which is making me feel even worse about what could be.Sorry for doing 2 posts in one week. After 9 months of keeping a steady job, I put in my 2 weeks. I found out a couple days ago that one of my managers said I can be a bitch to one of the other managers, so I decided I couldn’t handle the negativity as I’m already teetering on having an episode. I told my regional manager what happened and about being bipolar and all that and how I don’t want to compromise the (so far) month long stability I’ve had. She was very understanding and made the manager apologize. I know when I get low my job performance is affected, and it makes me teary eyed, irritable, and “bitchy,” but I didn’t want to tell anyone before this point because of stigma. Gonna miss this job too, I made a lot of friends that I didn’t want to leave 🥲.(18F) I’m visiting my friends out of town next week, and it’s my first time on a plane, and I’m really excited to go see them. Im just so frustrated because I feel like anytime I’m excited or stressed about anything it speeds up the cycle and I get thrown in an episode. I’m not currently in one but my sleep quality/duration is going to shit and I’m starting to get more impulsive. This isn’t the first time this has happened and it probably won’t be the last. And now I just got in a fight with my mom because I “answered with a tone” and now we’re both mad over literally nothing.So usually I can tell but rn I really can’t. I’m feeling pretty confident today which is not really a norm for me, I feel like I need smth to do, I blew over $100 dollars at the mall, my friends had to tell me to slow down while I was talking on video chat, I was being a little more boisterous w my friends while we were talking, I’m like really happy rn and a little buzzy but it’s not the same head high I’ve felt the other times, I keep thinking abt sex and how I wanna start birth control and take scandalous pics, i concocted a prank on my coworker bc she’s been joking and spreading lies abt me, and now I’m texting w someone else and I made too many plans to fit into 3 days. I’m starting to get a lil sleepy tho which is good ig but let’s see how much sleep I actually get lol. So yesterday I started feeling jittery and everything started getting brighter, so I took melatonin because I was awake later than I usually am. Even with the melatonin, I only got 6 hours of sleep and I’m still jittery and kind of anxious today. Should I be expecting a hypo/manic phase coming?. I don’t think I could handle a giant fluctuation in weight because I’m still trying to mentally recover from anorexia. Thanks in advance!. So I’m fairly new to this but I wanna know if anyone else’s first and last hypo days wash on and off. Like I’ll be flipping back and forth between hypo and stable on those days, but the middle is full hypo.I have 2c medium density fine hair. Currently, I’m using not your mothers mousse and tresemme gel and then diffusing it. It looks pretty decent after scrunching out the cast, but I have to wear my hair in a bun and a hat for work and all the work I’m putting in doesn’t last.I’ve been on a wavy journey for about a year and there’s been some good progress. Would olaplex help curl the pieces that refuse to curl?.
    I have started to realize that I consistently make mistakes and ruin relationships with people. Even small things have started to send me into a deep depression for a few days. Recently I drank a little too much at a party and my friend had to walk me home. I told him I wouldn’t drink that much, but I did have too much. He texted that he was annoyed he had to leave some people to take me home and that I need to stick to my word, but I feel like crying over it. The smallest mistakes I make with people just feel massive to me right now and I don’t want to talk to anyone about anything because I’m too scared I will say the wrong things. I am isolating so much and constantly on the verge of tears. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.my neighbor is loud as hell and keeps screaming in the middle of the night when it’s “quiet hours”. i have complained multiple times and sent audio recordings of it. i feel like an asshole for complaining but he keeps waking me up in the middle of the night. my landlord sent an email asking to talk about moving my apartment to a new unit. i just moved in 2 months ago. am i just being overly sensitive about the situation? he stomps and screams a lot and i have sent audio files of him swearing at 4 am. i don’t know if i should take the offer and i have yet to have a sit down discussion about it with my landlord. i’m going to meet today no matter what. any advice before i do?. i don’t know if i’m the problemi have had an off and on thing with guy where we constantly block and unblock each other. things get really sexual when we text and it has been like this for two and a half years. i finally decided i wanted to have sex with him because i am genuinely comfortable talking to him about that type of stuff. we had sex and i thought we would be friends after. it was my first time and i don’t regret it luckily but oh wow. my roommate and i decided to not live together anymore partially because she won’t let me have him over and i got defensive about her not letting me be an adult and making my own decisions even if i know they are bad for me. i essentially chose him over her and i really thought it would be different. after this i was sobbing and wanted a hug. he said no and told me we can’t be having sex everyday but i didn’t want sex i just wanted a hug. he finally came over and i asked to spend the night at his place since i have thin walls and i could hear my roommate crying. he said i could if i gave him a blowjob and let him finish in my mouth so i said yes cuz i was desperate. he isn’t allowed in my apartment so i did it in the public restroom in my apartment buildings basement. after all of this happened he just ghosted me. completely dropped me after everything. this happened about a month ago and i saw him last night. he awkwardly waved at me so i flipped him off and he just kind of nodded. i had a breakdown last night and i’m trying so hard not to relapse right now. i think it sent me into a manic episode and i’m really struggling at the moment. i have a therapy appointment on thursday so it’s not too long but wow i am not doing good right now. i don’t know if i’m the problemi have had an off and on thing with guy where we constantly block and unblock each other. things get really sexual when we text and it has been like this for two and a half years. i finally decided i wanted to have sex with him because i am genuinely comfortable talking to him about that type of stuff. we had sex and i thought we would be friends after. it was my first time and i don’t regret it luckily but oh wow. my roommate and i decided to not live together anymore partially because she won’t let me have him over and i got defensive about her not letting me be an adult and making my own decisions even if i know they are bad for me. i essentially chose him over her and i really thought it would be different. after this i was sobbing and wanted a hug. he said no and told me we can’t be having sex everyday but i didn’t want sex i just wanted a hug. he finally came over and i asked to spend the night at his place since i have thin walls and i could hear my roommate crying. he said i could if i gave him a blowjob and let him finish in my mouth so i said yes cuz i was desperate. he isn’t allowed in my apartment so i did it in the public restroom in my apartment buildings basement. after all of this happened he just ghosted me. completely dropped me after everything. this happened about a month ago and i saw him last night. he awkwardly waved at me so i flipped him off and he just kind of nodded. i had a breakdown last night and i’m trying so hard not to yeet. i have a therapy appointment on thursday but i am really struggling right now. i’m going on a date on thursday and it got me thinking about when is it an okay time to talk about having bipolar. my date is only a first date so i wont be sharing all my deepest secrets here, but about when do you all tell people you have bipolar? i don’t want to freak people out because of the stigma behind it.i want to try and help my friend learn to sew but i am not sure what beginner pattern she should do. i think my view is a bit skewed since i have been sewing for years now. any recommendations for a cute and easy pattern to help her learn? she is a complete beginner. i knew i was starting to get manic when i had the overwhelming urge to start running 5ks, but i kind of pushed it to the side. over the past two days i can’t push it back anymore. i can’t sleep and i feel sick/constantly on edge. my biggest issue is i ended up acting out sexually in a way i have NEVER done before. i have no idea what came over me i just did it and i regret it so much. im not worried i will hurt myself, but i am worried i will make some irredeemable decisions if i can’t manage to hold myself back a bit. usually i would take my emergencies mania antipsychotic to help, but i am in the midst of finals week and i can’t afford to be sleeping all day. if anyone has any advice on what to do please let me know. I have no idea if this was a fever dream or something but it was a post and someone disagreed with a comment and then the op responded with[Something like this](https://imgur.com/a/TiC4pV8).
    Some context! So I worked at a pizza place from last September to this September leading up to my manic episode and hospitalization. Now, at my job there was only a hand full of girls (like 5 not including myself) and so when we got a new manager who was also a girl I was stoked! But I had/have severe social anxiety, so I didn’t really get well acquainted w her. In fact, I had this thing where I didn’t want to get involved with work drama so I was even MORE closed off compared to my coworkers which… in hindsight I could’ve went about that better. But yeah I didn’t want to get involved w any type of drama and I remember her going through it with her personal relationship and her crying about it to me, but all I said was “I’m really sorry you’re going through this” but like- I felt super uncomfortable about it 😭😭😭. But we did have times where we’d socialize and genuinely connect like when we’d talk about getting fucked up on alcohol and stuff. But yeah I actually did talk to her once about getting hospitalized for a mental breakdown, and that’s when she told me she had bipolar disorder. This was several months ago, and she didn’t work at my store at the time but I imagine her bipolar and home circumstances made her have issues w upper management… Cause I also had issues with upper management when my symptoms started showing 😭. I just found out I’m bipolar a little more than a month ago, and I really want to reach out to her and see if she wants to be friends but I’m also terrified she doesn’t. The last time I ever saw her we were super nice and cordial but yeah. She said she would still work there for the college benefits. There have been times during a stressful shift that she’d get frustrated at me, as a manager and associate would, but now that I quit that stressful hellscape and found out I’m bipolar, is it a good idea to be friends w her? Also I’m leaving out that she had a crush/feelings for a coworker but that didn’t workout from what I heard from the grapevine- but during my manic episode I “ confessed my love” to that same coworker and he ended up blocking me (I was spamming) which I totally respect and understand but I hope that doesn’t make me wanting to befriend my past manager coworker weird 😭 so yeah tell me what you think! I think befriending someone who’s going through the same thing as me would be helpful and insightful.TL;DR- I want to know if it’s a good idea to be friends with my old coworker because I just found out I’m bipolar and she told me she’s bipolar months ago but we haven’t spoken/worked together in months. Should I reach out?. I really need help feeling at peace with the abuse I went through as a kid in church and because of church…. And I still have adverse reactions today since my Christian friends act like pastors can do no wrong even though my dad abused me and my whole family. How did y’all move from that and find peace?. I recently got diagnosed with bipolar disorder about a week and a half ago, but lately I’ve been feeling more and more paranoid when it files to friendships. Last year I had a mental breakdown/ psychosis because my friends and I planned a birthday celebration they didn’t go as planned, and it ended with me spending most of my money and me not sleeping or drinking enough water. Fast forward to this year and those same friends and I have drifted apart, but I think my bipolar diagnoses plays a part with it. Also during my psychosis last year I thought my friends where out to get me and wanted to sell me into the s*x trade… but also my friend was talking on the phone with another “friend group” who weren’t good friends at all, and I also managed to get her medicine when she said she wasn’t feeling good (at the hospital store) and she disregarded my effort entirely. But yeah, is paranoia a part of bipolar disorder? How do y’all manage your paranoia?. Today I felt very tired and I felt like I was on autopilot. But my thoughts were playing in the background in a low register like I was in a coffee shop… and I felt depressed per usual..I had a psychotic break almost 1 year and one month ago today but I’m still feeling so insecure and upset about what people think of me after it. Before the episode I was dealing with really bad depression and stress from flunking out of school, having a shitty job and feeling self conscious. The psychosis was triggered after my friends and I planned a birthday celebration that don’t go good at all, from me not having enough money during that entire weekend. Basically, I really got triggered when my friend talked about childhood sexual trauma she experienced. I also went through it as well, and during that weekend, I neglected eating it being hydrated and I really just drank alcohol and ate 1 1/2 meals during that weekend. But yeah, I ended up feeling suicidal after and posted about it on Twitter, then a “friend”, really a semi-complicated situationship saw my tweets and reached out to me to see if I was okay. I was fully psychotic at that point and ran away from my friend and called him trying to explain how unsafe I felt and I randomly told him about my trauma, and my delusions of my friend I was with at the time trying to hurt me and sell me into the sex trade…. But yeah luckily he was really helpful and understanding but uhhh I hate the fact that he knows about all this traumatic shit I went through. Also, one of my other “friends” (more so acquaintance) was there when I called him and I texted another friend (again mostly an acquaintance) while I was psychotic and I’m sure he knows about it to… how do I stop caring about what they might’ve thought of me or how they think of me today?? I hate it so much.Also some more context, the person that I called and the other person I texted I kind of have a weird relationship with. We used to be in a group chat and the former I kinda had a crush on but he was a little weird/rude to me in the past… and the other person, we had a full on talking stage then situationship in the past but in retrospect… even that was toxic.So how do I move on and grow from here?? I literally feel paralyzed in shame that this happened and then knowing about my life just makes it worse.TL;DR: I’m haven’t issues accepting the fact that some old friends/ acquaintances know about my trauma, when I told them about it during my psychosis. And I’m also feeling insecure about how I’ll be perceived after this psychotic break.One year ago today I had a psychotic break and I’m still struggling. I don’t speak to more than half of those I used to speak to this time last year, and the friendships I do have is currently rocky. I still feel paranoid with most of the friends I have and I feel like everyone is weirded out by what happened.. I still haven’t looked back at what I texted folks since it happened. The last 24 hours have been particularly rough, but hey it’s just one day. I was gonna take care of some stuff tonight but I think I’ll talk to an old friend on the phone and catch up. Tomorrow is another go at my goals but I think I’m ready. The past 365 days have really taught me that I need to listen to myself, acknowledge my trauma and be my own advocate.TL;DR-It’s been a year since I had psychosis and I’m reflecting on my current mental state.Hi all! I want to become vegan and I wanted to know if y’all had cookbook suggestions? My main reasons for being vegan is mental and physical health reasons. I want to buy a cookbook for the first 30 days, and I’d like it to have a large range of recipes and protein. I have awful depression, anxiety, and just overall really bad stress levels. Also I work at a pizza place and have been eating processed foods A LOOOT these past few months so I need to clear my body of that as well 😅. But yeah, any suggestions?. I’m starting to come to terms with this especially now, since I’m working through some trauma. But yeah I’m now a person who has a hard time trusting people, who’s easily triggered, and who’s just genuinely exhausted of life. And the gag is a lot of my friends are Christian, I recently vented to one friend and she told me I should ask god what I should do and try and listen for gods voice.. I know she meant well but I’m at a point where I feel like that shit is dismissive as hell and I feel that it isn’t helping. I feel stuck in life and life is just painful to live, though I think this is just due to me having depression and repressed emotions. It’s just worse cause how I was raised.Hi! I’m a 22 yr old female and I’m looking for a female friendship so that I can talk about my insecurities but also ideas about life/the future/religion/boys/relationships etc. I would like to befriend someone who’s around my age and/or 5-10 years older than me. I really want another perspective on the aforementioned topics because I was raised in a strict Christian household and I would like a new perspective. Other things about me:- I’m apolitical, I can either get behind any political view or respectfully disagree- Kinda agnostic/kinda questioning my faith- I have a lot of mental health and self esteem issues that I’m actively working through - I’m spiritual and trying to get in touch with my spirituality and womanhood - I’m a big sister myself to 3 younger sisters - I don’t use social media and won’t use it indefinitely - I believe that mental health is a real thing. If you do not, go ahead and close this post for me thank you!And yeah that’s the gist of my post. Definitely reply if you’d like to get a friend! 🥰. I feel like without Christianity manipulating women into feeling guilty for even being a woman and having a body with sexual urges, and manipulating them to believe that marriage, kids, and subservience to your husband is the only way to be a good Christian woman- I think it would really collapse lmao. But it’s sad the amount of weird mind tricks and breaking down of personhood and womanhood Christianity had to impose just to get a footing of control. Life is more than being under a man, and it’s heartbreaking that this rhetoric is being pushed lmao. My friendships feel fake and superficial, when j start dating it’ll be the same way too I bet . Life just life’s you and society or god just watches …..So I actually recently left a group chat because it turns out half of my “friends” in there didn’t belive in mental illness and completely invalided me. One of my “friends” even told me I shouldn’t have been psychotic at all like I had control over what the fuck I was experiencing. I’ve since told them I need space after those incidents but honestly? I regret not cussing them out and I am so full of anger everytime I think about when I decided to be diplomatic with pieces of shit who didn’t give a DAMN about how the fuck I felt. Selfish motherfuckers who told me and gave me advice based on their stupid fuck ass expectations, or wanted me to do things based on their own selfish grimey desires. I feel so angry I’m literally clenching my jaw and I’m in a cold sweat right now as I type this…. People are cruel and selfish and evil, no one cares to listen to how you feel, they just want their way and they only care about themselves. I could punch right through glass rn…. And I keep getting these rolling waves of anger from time to time… anyone else relate?. Most of my life I’ve had a hard time making and maintaining friendships. I think this is a result of me constantly moving plus some personally maladaptive tendencies of mine. But recently I’ve considered letting go of most of my friendships for the main reason being: I haven’t been as present and I have very strong disagreements on certain subjects. Here are the two reasons I’m forgoing these friendships:- I feel like I haven’t been myself- some of my “friends” don’t believe in mental health - some of my “friends” believe in that redpill bullshit/ follow Andrew Tate- some of my “friends” have internalized misogyny Now, I’m trying to heal from a psychosis episode I had last summer and really just discover myself so at this point I see it necessary to cut them off due to these conditions. I don’t wanna argue about whether the red pillers or Andrew Tate are good people or not but I myself used to be in the toxic pink pill community and since I don’t believe it anymore I definitely don’t want to be friends w others that subscribe to it. But my friends not believing in mental health and even some of the suggesting that I need to “get closer to God” and “I’m depressed because I believe in depression” really sealed the deal. I’m at a point where I need a baseline of beliefs with my friends but I am still open to respectfully disagree- but when it comes to mental health (of which I am struggling) and “gender wars”, yeah I’m very picky 😅. What say you? What do your friendship dynamics look like?Tl;drI’m cutting of 90% of my friendships because of shifting beliefs; is that good or bad? How are your dynamic relationships it’s your friend like and how are your beliefs similar to your friends?. I’m wanting to get in touch with my femininity and overall sexuality as a woman, while trying to unlearn the male centered purity culture bullshit I’ve been indoctrinated with. Which steps did y’all take to unlearn this?. Hi! Ok right now, I’m working at Walmart and am taking one online class. I used to go to a major four year university but had to leave due to poor grades which stemmed from bad mental health. Regardless, I am in about 5,000$ In credit card debt because I initially wanted to leave school a semester before my last and was about to do so, but because it made my parents angry I just went to school and used credit cards to pay for the semester since I hadn’t completed my financial aid for that semester 🤡🤡🤡 but fast forward to today, I’m working at my new job where I’ve been for almost two months and I wanted to know what would be the best way to move forward with purchasing a vehicle. I’ll need one to commute back to school as well as find a higher paying job that I can commute to, my parents bring me to work now but even with that, I sometimes have to use Uber since they are busy sometimes. I really would like to just save up my money and purchase a car without having to worry about monthly payments but I know that’ll take time. Which would you recommend? I was thinking about saving around 4,500$ to purchase a used car that’s around 120-160k miles.Tl:dr - I am looking to buy a car but I am not sure if I should finance it or buy it but I am leaning toward buying. I also have 5k in credit card debt.Hi whoever’s reading this! Firstly thank you for taking time to read this but here is my debt situation this far:I am 5,000$ in debt right now because of two main reasons. The first is last summer, I did not want to continue going to school due to mental health reasons which led me to not completing my fafsa soon enough for the incoming school year, and when I told my parents I did not want to continue they got pissed at me and told me to continue and despite everything that I was going through I just decided to turn to a credit card to pay for that semesters tuition. Also, the second reason I have a high bill is, I had to use the cards to pay for most of my spring semesters rent due to my dad not being able to pay for it anymore and due to my failure of not getting a loan for my rent. That and lack of budgeting and mental health issues is why I have such high credit card debt. I have a fairly new credit card history that will be be about 2 years in the summer, but my credit score has tanked because of these decisions. I haven’t been to school since fall and now I’m working towards purchasing a car to commute to school instead of living there, until I can truly afford it. I was just able to get a job and start regularly paying them back, but interest keeps rising and I don’t know if I’ll be able to fix my score in time to buy the car before the fall semester in 2022. Here is my question:Should I get a loan to and instantly pay off my credit and hopefully get a good score to finance a car?I have between now and August to turn my credit score around and be able to afford to finance the car. Honestly and more personally speaking, even though I’ve had sleepless nights about my future and the regret of incurring this debt in the first place, now that I’m out of school I am taking personal finance more seriously and working on my day to day spending habits. Commuting to school for instance would save me a ton of money instead of worry about rent at the moment.TL;DRShould I get loan to pay my debt off instantly so I can afford a better interest rate on a car?. I really would like to make meditation part of my daily ritual, how do y’all meditate if you have a restless mind?. I’ve fallen out with every best friend that I’ve had, with the last best friend pretty much ignoring me and cutting me off which could definitely be my fault… But I’ve also been back stabbed by “friends”, had trouble making some since my super strict ass parents never let me have a social life. School and college where difficult too since they didn’t really help me navigate that either, and don’t even get me started with emotions or relationships. I hate that the afterlife and god where their top priority when they decided that everything else would be #2. It’s really negatively affected me :/.
    Hi all, after a 3-week manic period, I’ve fallen into depression once again, but it feels different this time. I can be ok in the mornings, but as the day progresses at some point in the afternoon I get knocked sideways by the empty feelings and dark suicidal temptations. In the evenings, I just feel like crying and even sleeping 12+ hours doesn’t feel like enough. I can haven’t showered in days and can barely do anything. I turn 23 this week but I’m in bed before 9pm every night completely shattered from a day of doing nothing.I don’t know how to cope. I feel so pathetic.Hi. Hi there. I had a psychiatric assessment this morning and was diagnosed with bipolar after having a depression diagnosis for about 8 years. I feel weird now and I don’t know what to do with my day.How do I not feel weird when I woke up with a depression diagnosis and now I have a whole new one?!EDIT: thank you for all the kind and wise comments! My mum also helped by reeling off a list of famous people with bipolar. It would seem I’m in good company💆‍♀️. I’ve had a diagnosis of depression since I was about 14, but after trying literally every front line antidepressant with no success, and having family members and professionals express concern about unstable mood, my psychiatrist finally called the diagnosis into question at the start of this year. Then I got sent inpatient for an ED again, and the mood side of things got brushed under the carpet and forgotten about - I was put back on venlafaxine (for the 3rd fucking time) and that was that. Obviously the venlafaxine did nothing, and I’m currently withdrawing from it (11/10 DO NOT recommend) but holy shit my mood is disturbing me - one minute I’m on top of the world and the next I’m in tears in the middle of the shopping centre or sth. That’s not out of the ordinary for me, but fluctuations this rapid I’m not used to. Anyway, I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow where I’m going to ask to have lamotrigine to see if that helps at all. TLDR; how did you know that your diagnosis of depression was incorrect and it was actually bipolar?. I left IP two weeks ago, started volunteering one four-hour shift a week in a charity shop near me but 2.5 hours in today had to call my mum to pick me up because I almost passed out. I have been eating (probably a little less than I should be, but nowhere near nothing!), and resting, and I made sure to have breakfast before I started, and yet this happened. Have I taken on too much too soon?. I have nothing to do today and the depression is already STRONG. How do you cope with these days?. What are some small things or things that may seem pointless/a waste of time/money to others but that provide you some temporary comfort or relief from the depression?. I’m coming up to discharge from IP and I hate to say it but I just know I’m headed for a relapse, but I’m scared that my OP will step in way faster than before and force me to go IP again. Does anyone have experience with how long OP tolerates weight loss for before sending you IP? Or do they just wait until you fall below the BMI threshold again?EDIT: I really hope this doesn’t get taken down - I’m not pro-Ana or pro-relapse in any way, I wish I could get out of this cycle more than anything. Currently really struggling to stay focused on myself and my own treatment and not get sucked into the illness’ tendency to constantly compare MPs and behaviours to other patients’ or mentally compete with them. Any tips would be helpful!. It sucks to admit, but hospital is the one place I feel safe. I dread going home on leave - it makes me feel so suffocated and depressed - and even more so, I dread being discharged. Don’t get me wrong, I hate it here. There’s nothing to do, everyone is ill and competitive and I’m being forced to gain weight. But it’s also the one place that gives me permission to eat, where I can rest unconditionally, where I am free of obligation and the pressures of adult life, where I have an excuse for missing out, where (a few) people give me the time of day, where I can hold up a routine, where I can be social if I feel up to it etc etc. I hate being here but I think I hate home more and that feels rotten. The closer I get to discharge (harm reduction, nowhere near weight restoration), the more I will my body to plateau in the weight gain to postpone discharge and the more I want to relapse when I get out, and I dread that painful feeling of hunger again. I don’t see a future where I’m not in and out of hospital…. I’m IP and I’ve suddenly gone from gaining ~0.2kg per week to gaining over 1kg in a week. I haven’t increased my calories or changed my movement, the only thing I can think of is I’ve just about doubled the amount of water I drink. Why is this sudden weight gain happening?. I’m IP and I’ve suddenly gone from gaining ~0.2kg per week to gaining over 1kg in a week. I haven’t increased my calories or changed my movement, the only thing I can think of is I’ve just about doubled the amount of water I drink. Why is this sudden weight gain happening?. Can hotter weather cause a false weight gain (water weight)?I’m completely freaked out. I haven’t changed my eating or movement at all (I might’ve actually eaten a bit less than usual in the last couple of days), but since Thursday I’ve apparently gained a shit tonne of weight. The only thing that I can think of that’s changed is we’re currently having a heatwave and I’m almost constantly sweaty (sorry tmi).Is it likely that I might be retaining more water and as a result the change on the scale is water weight? Help I’m so freaked out.UPDATE: got weighed on Thursday and the number was back to what it had been the week before. I reckon I must’ve been majorly dehydrated bc the only change I made was drinking double the amount of water.It could be me being institutionalised and don’t get me wrong being inpatient is fucking traumatic, draining, boring, difficult, isolating… I could go onBut I also feel a level of almost comfort from being in hospital…? I don’t know if it’s the lack of responsibility, not needing to make excuses for why I can’t attend social events, not needing to lie to my family, strict (ish) routine (although still heavily revolves around meals ofc) and just lack of having to face adult life etc. not to mention it’s like my one ‘excuse’ to eat. Often in treatment I’ve gone through periods of feeling ‘comfortable’ in hospital and dreading when the word ‘discharge’ is mentioned, even if it’s a long way away. There’s really nothing comfortable about it: certain foods are scary, gaining weight is distressing, you’re surrounded by sick people and controlled in everything you do. Not to mention there’s no freedom and you can be threatened with a section any time they like…Still, I can’t deny that I sometimes feel this way. Has anyone else ever felt the same?. DAE overheat and sweat a bunch after eating a meal?. Does anyone else overheat after eating a meal?. I’m currently inpatient, so obviously on a weight gain meal plan. My weight has been increasing but incredibly slowly, which has concerned my team. My meal plan is already pretty large, and I was given a scary increase last week that I was certain would cause my weight to increase. However, I’ve lost weight since the increase. I’ve not been sleeping very well and I get horrendous night sweats. I’m wondering if I might be hypermetabolic, but this has never happened before. I have no leave - if I go outside, I have to be in a wheelchair, I don’t exercise or purge etc. I have no idea what’s going on. It’s so frustrating because I feel like everyone talks about how I’m recovery your body changes faster than your brain, but I feel like the opposite is happening; I don’t necessarily want recovery but I know I definitely need to gain weight to not be in danger and have some sort of life. It’s like my body isn’t playing ball🙄. I’m currently inpatient, so obviously on a weight gain meal plan. My weight has been increasing but incredibly slowly, which has concerned my team.

I’m ip again and even though I swore this time I’d be different, and my mindset genuinely is different, my behaviours just fall back to be the same as they always have been. It feels like no matter how much I want things to be better, my default reaction to being in hospital is to fight back against it. And for what? They won’t let me leave without gaining weight, so I might as well just eat the food without engaging in restrictive behaviours (I’m not talking extreme - no exercise or b/p this time🥳). I constantly look to other patients who just get on with their meals and make it look easy (NB - make it LOOK easy, I’m sure it’s far from easy for them) and wish I could do the same but I just cannot seem to. This past weekend, I lapsed slightly and my behaviours were worse than usual. Despite that, I still gained this morning so what does that tell me? ITS NOT WORTH IT AND ITS NOT DOING ANYTHING.

I was admitted to general hospital 2 weeks ago and desperately wanted it to be the final straw kick-up-the-arse admission I needed to kickstart proper recovery. unfortunately, I was totally neglected and they allowed me to lose weight, which has unfortunately continued this week despite me being in more intensive outpatient care.I managed to be honest with my team today that I'm just not sure I'm receiving a high enough level of support, and they've offered me a bed from tomorrow for four weeks. it would allow me to go on holiday with my mum in 5 weeks time, which I'm desperate to do. obviously, I'm terrified of weight gain, especially because in hospital a gain of 0.5-1kg is normally expected, whereas at home I'd probably be able to gain slower, but the prospect of gaining anything at all at home just seems impossible and incredibly shameful.I know things can't be allowed to get any worse, or even stay where they are now, but I just don't know if I'm strong enough alone to dig myself out the other way.I've been sectioned countless times before, so being able to voluntarily accept a bed, and for such a short time seems like a huge luxury, but of course it's still a decision that I'm totally torn over.and honestly my saving grace mentally is that I have shown myself time and time again how easily and how quickly I can lose weight if I want to, so I guess if it goes on 'too quickly', I know how to cope with it when I get out, which isn't the right mindset I know, but it's comforting if nothing else I guess...advice and thoughts are v much appreciated <3. so I got out of my most recent IP admission in January and things were going ok in the community until the end of March, when I got covid.

I just got out of general hospital last week for refeeding monitoring and… I kinda miss it?Don’t get me wrong I was bored and lonely and neglected af but like a massive part of me wishes I could be back in general (not psych😖) again…. I just got out of general hospital last week for refeeding monitoring and… I kinda miss it?Don’t get me wrong I was bored and lonely and neglected af but like a massive part of me wishes I could be back in general (not psych😖) again…. I’ve just got out of general hospital and I am a mess. The night I went in I was so panicked and had a huge burst of motivation to recover. I’m supposed to be going on my first holiday in 5 years with my mum next month but I’m not in a physical state right now where that would be possible. My OP team has an IP bed waiting for me so I have days to save myself from yet another psych admission. Every time I go to hospital I tell myself “this is it. this is the last time and this is the validation you need. no more now” then I get out and my stupid brain goes “ok but just one more wouldn’t hurt”. It’s ridiculous. If I manage to stay in the community, I know I’ll have much more agency and control over my situation, I’ll be with family, I’ll be much more comfortable etc etcBut I feel so invalid gaining weight in the community. In fact, I’ve never done it before. I know that I’m not going to be allowed or able to stay at my current weight whether I’m in hospital or at home: it’s simply unsustainable and my team won’t allow it. Home is so much more comfortable, so the decision should be easy: gain a little at home vs. potentially having to gain a lot more in hospital. Why can’t I make that decision?!I need help desperately; any words of advice/motivation would be greatly appreciated <3. I discharged myself from hospitallast night after being there a week for refeeding blood monitoring. Every day I was told by at least one professional that I didn’t need to be there, and they even tried to discharge me on day one. At the start of the week I was pretty motivated to recover but all I feel now is complete demotivation, neglect, mistrust of my team and loss of hope. I lost weight in hospital, so it’s made me not only mentally but physically worse. While I detest psych wards and I’m grateful that in this instance I managed to avoid it, I do find a weird sense of comfort being in general hospital despite the overall invalidation and neglect I experienced. Now, back at home, I just feel totally hopeless, demotivated and lost…. My taste and smell are back! But my recovery motivation has dwindled again. What are you guys’ motivations to recover? Some I can think of:Finally finish uniSee friends againSee family againLive my life unrestrictedI can either gain the weight at my own pace, in the comfort of my own home, with my family, and eating foods I actually like, or I can be forced to gain that same weight in hospital through barbaric methods and surrounded by toxic people. I tested positive for covid on Saturday. I’ve felt fine all week except for a day in bed on Sunday. Today was my first day of properly committing to recovery and of course I’ve lost my smell and taste. I can’t lose any more weight or I’ll go back to hospital but I’ve already gone back to restricting today bc not being able to taste my food makes it not seem worth it. When will it come back?! And how do I cope?!. Has anyone discharged themselves from services in order to pursue recovery?I feel like this is my only option: engaging with ED services keeps me stuck in this toxic world and hyperfocussing on weight. I feel like it puts value in all the wrong places…. It’s really hard to want to recover when other MH issues make you not want to be alive…. This past weekend I decided for the first time that I actually want to recover from this fucking ED. I felt so good and so motivated and hopeful. I made lists of all the things I was gonna do and eat and everything seemed amazing. It’s completely vanished. I have barely stopped crying today because the motivation has just disappeared. My head is telling me I “just need one more” hospital admission and then I’m allowed to recover, even though I legit think hospital has given me PTSD. I don’t want to go to hospital, but my head says it’s the only way. I’ve started restricting again since deciding to recover, I guess like giving the ED one last hurrah. But I know it doesn’t work like that. I’m so upset…. My ED consultant told me today she thinks I might have bipolar…What do I do with this information?. ... but not until November/December.All the big family events happen towards the end of the year...birthdays, Christmas etc. All the big celebrations and 'exciting' food eras happen at this time of year. It feels like there's no point recovering until then.I actually can't be bothered to be anorexic any more.I've spent over 25 months in hospital over the past 2.5 years, in 4 medical admissions and 2 (extremely long and traumatic) inpatient admissions and, despite that, my brain is still screaming at me that it's not enough - "just one more admission, then you can recover" etc. but I KNOW after that it'll be "just once more" again.AND I CANNOT BE ARSEDI'm so aware that this illness does nothing to serve me. I'm so tired, it is so misaligned from my values and it's torn my family to pieces. yet I cling on. why?I've started associating myself less and less with people I've met in treatment and people who document their recovery online - I don't see myself as obsessed over my appearance: I hate the way I look no matter what; I literally feel like I'm too depressed to be anorexic. Does that make sense? I also feel so pathetic being 'scared' of food. like. it's food... life is too short for that.I've completely isolated myself because I don't want anyone to see me - my logic here is that when I choose to recover, no one will notice me gaining weight because they won't have seen me at my lowest weight anyway, so it won't feel as uncomfortable.I know I'm desperately clinging to it but for what? I have no idea.I'm so torn between "just once more" and "I can't be arsed", it's driving me crazy.does anyone else just find ED social media (recovery accounts etc. on YT, TikTok, insta, whatever) just massively pathetic?Idk, I feel like it sounds really harsh but I'm just so tired of seeing people crying over putting half a teaspoon of jam on a crumpet or eating a mouthful of fat-free yoghurt.like, I used to get so sucked in and intentionally triggered myself with this content, and now I just feel repulsed by it.I'm not hating on these people by any means, but they tend to be young teenage girls and I'm not sure how great a grasp they have of their influence - their actions, words, behaviours etc. have a huge influence on the way other sufferers view and manage their own recoveries and relapses.I'm tired of people documenting (don't even get me STARTED on monetising) their MH issues - it's dangerous and, on the whole, irresponsible, in my opinion.idk why I'm sharing this, I guess I'd just like to hear others' thoughts?. I had (undiagnosed) ARFID for about 6 years during my teens. It was caused by a fear that I'd have a physical reaction to eating pretty much any food (vomiting, poisoning, allergic reaction, diarrhoea etc.)I hated it at the time because p much all my 'safe' foods were carbs (plain toast, plain pasta, plain boiled rice)It seemed to disappear for a few months when I started uni, but then I developed anorexia, which I've been in hospital for for almost 2.5 years straight.I've been out of hospital for 6 weeks and, until this week, things have been going ok. I had hunger signals here and there, and I've been managing to just about maintain my weight.However, this week my hunger signals seem to have vanished and my interest in food seems to have diminished. I'm not sure how familiar people on this thread are with anorexics' obsession and preoccupation with food - it's (misguided) assumption that anorexics hate food, but they usually love it (there's a great Ted Talk that touches on this by Catherine Pawley). My obsession and enjoyment seems to have disappeared.In addition, while I am still preoccupied by my weight (numbers become everything in hospital), I am under no illusion that I will hate my body whatever my weight is, so I'm unsure what my body image is like at present - I don't like being sickly thin, but neither did I like being a healthy weight.My lack of interest, and sometimes aversion to, food coupled with a lack of interest in my own body is making me concerned that the anorexia is morphing back into ARFID again, albeit in a different form. Does anyone have any thoughts?\*I hope nothing I've said has been offensive - I have admittedly limited knowledge of ARFID, and really my own personal experiences are all I can go by.Thank you <3. I've just got an e-reader (Kobo Nia) and I'm finding it hard to bring myself to buy an ebook - I feel like it's a waste of money because it's not a tangible thing, despite many ebooks being cheaper than a physical copy.How do I get over this so the reader as a whole wasn't a complete waste?. So I discharged myself AMA last Friday after another year in hospital (2.5 years total now), and I'm determined to maintain my weight for now.However, I know that the compulsion to restrict will eventually come back, but my parents are very aware of my meal plan. So, I've been 'following' the meal plan around them (I track everything and I'd be majorly undereating if I ate only what I eat around my parents), and secretly fulfil the remaining calories. This involves secretly eating in my room, which often feels like bingeing, even though it's still below my MP. For example, today I secretly ate a whole tub of custard because it takes no preparation and I can just secretly throw away the tub. It's so that when I want to lose weight, I can cut out the secret eating first and it looks like I'm still following my plan to my parents.I know people with anorexia often hoard food but don't eat it, but I've never seen anyone talk about doing this, has anyone else ever done this? I feel so guilty and alone but I know it's what's going to keep me out of hospital for now...This Christmas was the worst. It’s probably the best I’ve been mindset wise for years now, but I think that’s what made it so hard. For the first time in years, I wished I could join in and felt physical and mental anguish that I couldn’t. I’ve been inpatient over two years now and Christmas was a slap in the face. Hospital does so much to normalise eating disorders and suddenly seeing family and friends eating without thinking about it hurt me because I feel like I’ll never be able to do that. Hospital creates so much competition. No matter how bad things get, it never feels like enough. Yes I’ve had x number of admissions but she’s had more, so I’m not that bad. I’ve been ill x number of years but she has longer so I’ve barely suffered. I wish I’d never fallen into this world and could’ve lived my life blissfully unaware of this toxic section of the internet and the toxicity of inpatient treatment. I will never be enough for my head but I feel like I’m in too deep and can’t stop striving for ‚enough‘. I just want to eat normally. Why does that feel impossible?!. I haven’t changed my diet or exercise but around 4 weeks ago I had my buspirone increased from 10mg to 15 and since then my weight has been steadily increasing. A week ago I stopped taking it cold turkey and all of a sudden my weight has stopped moving. Is this a coincidence? Because I’ve heard generally buspirone has no effect on weight….
    Hi there,I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder back in 2017 and it really helped make a huge difference in my life. I however like many other people with bipolar disorder really struggle with work. For most of my life, I've just hopped from one job to the next every six months or so. I was able to keep a job at Starbucks for almost 10 years which I'm really proud of but after that it's been the same on and off.&#x200B;I'm just wondering if anyone has suggestions for jobs that may be good for someone with bipolar disorder, I can tell you right now I really struggle with 8-hour shifts, it seems like 5-6-hour shifts are the sweet spot for me. I've been feeling really sad and disheartened over this and am really hoping for something to come up, so if anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it..

Anyways, I walked out and now I'm about to send her an email to ask her to reconsider my salary. Any additional words I should add? Any charts or images I should add? Anyone with that photo of what a salary needs to look like for paying back student loans?. Hello! I'm currently working on my portfolio (coding all by myself). Can the people with a Mac computer tell me how it looks? I've been testing it only on Microsoft laptop and Galaxy 9 mobile. Am I heading in the right direction? https://classyboss.design/.
    I need help understanding something about managing my BP with everything else. Divorced - recent enough. Small child. Volatile divorce; can barely speak to each other due to a myriad of communication issues; I’m working to own and correct my half of those. Mental health awareness says it’s okay to tell people when you’re not okay. It’s ok to ask for help. It’s ok to ask for what you need. Except… my ex has zero compassion for me. Yet he says “if you need more support and space, just let me know and I’ll be flexible,” but then throws those requests in my face later. Find your support group. Except… people have their own shit going on. They distance themselves organically at times but the abandonment wound in me gets triggered and then I withdraw. And sometimes people handle me with kid gloves or show up different for me, and it’s degrading. Like, I let you in for support - be with me in it - not as an enabler or caretaker. And further still… professionals in my circle think my ex knowing any of my health information is dangerous because of his lack of compassion and empathy for what living with a mental disorder is like. Dangerous in terms of custody and dangerous to my mental health for the mind games that can be deployed against me. And that’s all valid; that’s largely why we divorced; I was sick (didn’t know the extent of illness) and wanting to get better and he couldn’t handle any of it. And I knew that. All this to say - be careful who you trust with your health information. And I guess I’m here learning to walk the thin line of being authentic and veiled. Sometimes I have outbursts of emotions and mood related to a disorder but really, it’s on me to maintain a level head and show up better each time. But when the other person is committed to a grudge… it’s really fucking hard. It’s never the disorder’s fault; it’s our responsibility to move through and past its barriers. Yet I also feel like that’s the “management” stage and I’m still in the “learning and defining” stage. Unfair, isn’t it?. I have so many responsibilities and expectations I’m managing every day. I have to get out of bed. There isn’t an option not to. My employer just laid a bunch of people of, so calling in feels very uncomfortable. But I can’t function. My brain is like “bye”. My body physically aches from a myriad of things like not hydrating enough, not sleeping enough, not eating well, not exercising. It’s just this spiral of things swirling around making every day hard mode. Masking this illness is so hard. Off to work. I don’t know what else to do.I’m struggling through a lot of change. My employment feels precarious as we just endured a layoff. I don’t earn enough at my job, so I work two jobs. I see my therapist weekly, every week for four years now. I’m thinking of cutting back to twice a month to save money and it feels almost like a breakup. If I lose my job and insurance, idk how I’ll manage my medical expenses for blood draws to check meds. It’s like $400 every 6-8 weeks. Help… I’m living bare bones anyway. I’m over it. I’m applying for new employment but we all know how fun that is too. Idk what to do.36 F, single mom to one kid, MBA graduate, bachelors in graphic design (mistake)My employer of 6 mos began layoffs last week; I survived the first round due to “work ethic”. This company isn’t stellar in culture or training, it is quite literally just a job and was the highest paying offer when I was searching and showed promise because senior level executives have long tenures. The person training me is looking for the first opportunity out of the company, meaning their workload will likely roll downhill to me. I’ve been recovering from divorce and career burnout, so feel I’m just gaining my footing in life. Monthly net income - $4600Mortgage $1560/month with taxes and insurance escrowed (cheaper than fair market rent now for my areaDaycare $590/month (my half)Car payment - $0 - bought a used car outright to avoid loan and car payment stressCar insurance $530/six months Credit card balance $3,000 at 28% Medical expenses monthly not covered by insurance $600-$800Groceries $250/month - I eat with my sister and her family 2-3x a week as it isUtilities $350Pet expenses (2 dogs) - $50/monthI’m working a part time gig as a podcast producer l, publishing content that pays maybe $500/month My work schedule for the current fulltime job doesn’t allow for evenings waitressing (I wouldn’t be home and dressed for a second job until 7 pm) and my custody schedule is every other weekend. No family support here and my ex would rather see me starve than help. What the fuck am I supposed to do here?? The job market is super slow, taking 2-3mos before getting to the offer stage in my experience. I have a medical condition that limits my ability to overwork because sleep is a huge requirement for baseline functioning. I can’t work a second job past 10-11pm. I FEEL SO FUCKED!!!! I worked in financial investments before. Ran an ad agency doing business development and sales. Now in software. What are the job positions I should be seeking? Financial analyst: okay but I haven’t actually done financial analysis and built models or forecasting since college MBA five years ago. Business analyst: okay but I barely have experience here either. Am I going to look like a moron interviewing with no experience even though my education and job history shows I should have ? My past employers did me no favors in true job training. Help. Send a hug. Our economy is tanking, hard, if you didn’t know.36 F, divorced, single mom of oneI’m hesitant to get on dating apps because I’ve been told my views on dating are abnormal. So, internet strangers, is what I’ve laid out below impossible to attain? I want a friendship. I want someone to have dinner with, run errands, go to events and movies, and just chill with. Nothing serious, not defining the relationship after five dates or five months or whatever. I’m looking for the slow game, the long game. I feel like it takes a while to know if someone can be consistent in showing up for you. You have to build a friendship. I don’t need someone to fill a void in my life. I want someone to be additive, fun, an expansion pack if you will. So… is this impossible to achieve on dating apps? I also don’t want to limit myself to one friend to do things with. And for everyone to be okay with that without feeling I’m being noncommittal and giving anyone the runaround.I cleaned my kitchen yesterday, getting everything off the counters and into its respective home again. I am so proud of myself. I also vacuumed and swept floors and dusted furniture, getting ready for spooky season decorations. I’ve been trying to accomplish fully cleaning my kitchen for several weeks now, and I finally did it. Next, refrigerator, floors, windows. 😅 It is almost soup season.I read to my kiddo 2x a day, every day, for nap and bedtime. Today, one of my favorite books hit different and I couldn’t hold back tears. I’m tired of masking my emotions constantly. I’m tired of being a rollercoaster. I’m sad it makes my kid sad when I can’t keep it together. Breathe. It’s been a really rough 18+ months of life - divorce, job loss, car issues, diagnosis, expenses - and I’m trying to be nice to myself but I’m unbelievably burnt out. So I just cried anyway. And I can’t stop. And maybe there’s no immediate danger or emergency, but my brain and body can’t process that yet. And I keep wondering if there’s a stillness in life, if things do slow down, if I’ll be able to manage calm. To find stability. “Normal” and “routine”. ‘Cause we both deserve that.So… pretty sure I’m cycling on meds for the first time. Things have been really stressful. Read previous posts but also, car failure, excessive heat weather, car shopping, finances, high conflict coparent, regular life. I’ve just been dealing with a lot all at once again. I’m tired, but wired. I spent the day manic cleaning, engaging in social activities, car shopping, selling stuff on marketplace. I don’t think I’m in danger of anything serious, I just know the last few days have been up and down every which mood and I feel it, but it’s not as severe as before. And I’m thankful for that.It does get better. Let’s solve some problems. I can do this.I’m having a hard time staying “in it” - in life - present moment - today as everything keeps going horrifically wrong. Trying to sell a car. I drove it last a week ago. Shined it up. Listed for sale. Tons of interest. Go outside to turn it on, it won’t turn over. Panic. End up accepting an offer for less than 1/3 the asking price I wanted initially just to get rid of the car. I’m car shopping. Everything used I want to test drive is miles away. I’m afraid to go by myself. I’m afraid the car I’m borrowing will strand me. I’m afraid of so many other things, mostly single female things about being abducted or just some other universal shit storm I can’t handle. I’m exhausted. I’m tired of managing all the storms of everything. I want a reliable vehicle. To afford groceries and one ounce of fun sometimes and to get stable, whatever that means. “Go make friends” okay… nice advice but I have a panic anxiety attack every time I try to leave the house because of car issues. “Get a new car” Okay, I know nothing about cars and have a very limited time window for car shopping without also bringing my child. How would that even work, “Lets test ease of car seat installation,” every time I drive something?FOR FUCK’S SAKE I can’t get myself out of bed today to human and I have to be somewhere out of my house in an hour. It’s not even necessarily BP today, it’s just all the life AND managing the BP. Not raging on people who are trying to be well intentioned and helpful but offering zero solutions. I’ve cried five times today. Wtf?. Looking at buying my first Hyundai. Deciding between the trims on the Sport and Limited. What - if any - are major problems you’ve experienced with either? Does one handle better than the other? I’m a single mom, limited income, and haven’t had a reliable and functioning car for the last two years. I’m exhausted from car maintenance and being frequently stranded; pretty sure I have CPTSD from this alone. Appreciate any insights. Need something to last another 5-8 years, used, and looking at both trims with mileage around 115k and pricing between $9k-$14k Would you recommend this year of Santa Fe to meet these needs??. Trying to avoid outbursts and vague posting via social media. Problem: I work in social media for a part time gig, so I can’t delete the accounts altogether and I’ve curated a decent friends list. What do you do to prevent yourself from creating nuclear fallout on social when you’re experiencing a mood fluctuation?? I’ve basically just created a fear about all of it and am now hardly posting even for work as a result. 😬. Zero interest in anything. Basically trying to do anything to induce what’s probably a hypomanic cycle because I fucking hate being this numb. Laundry. Dishes. Piles. Hair in knots. My life before was me operating like a machine. And I was exhausted but I had drive. I got it ALL done. Now, nothing. Nothing. Numb. Fuck my brain. My cognitive ability is 60% at best of what it was and I’m just frustrated and pissed. “Oh you should make plans with people and get out.” HOW THE FUCK DO YOU DO THIS?! When it’s minute to minute at best as to whether or not you can even leave the house and show up somewhere?! Tell me this shit gets better. End rant.Well, I shared the synopsis of my episode that lead to my diagnosis and discovery of my illness with my recent ex husband tonight. I owned that I initiated divorce during an episode. Now, we wait and see if they use my illness as a cause and shield for their victimhood, or if they grow and own their half. Sure, I was sick, but our marriage was mutually sick and contributed to my sickness. Everyone says the cognitive ability will return, but idk… doesn’t feel like it. I keep trying to make space and hold space for myself. It’s hard. Sigh. Keep going. Some things have to end so new things can begin.Been processing a divorce, now finalized. Diagnosed post divorce. Stable on meds. I’ve always been hyper focused on goal driven tasks, my entire life. I was raised with a very gritty work ethic and to perform at a high level, in all things. I took up gardening to fix some landscaping issues that have been lingering around my home for years. I recently got 20 cubic yards of mulch delivered and I’ve been working at it every night, but the interior housework has suffered immensely. How do you manage your “hyper drive” - even if it isn’t manic because you’re calm inside - to make room for other life duties and expectations? I’m basically like “screw everything else; must mulch and garden and move rocks and kill weeds when weather cooperates.” I guess I’m not hurting anyone else, so no harm in any of it? Embrace it?. How tf am I supposed to eat?! I forget meals all the time, crash, and then I’m so pissed at myself for FORGETTING TO EAT! I’ve previously loved food, was decently overweight and had to work hard at weight maintenance and loss. Now, fuck food. Nothing tastes good, I have zero desire to eat, and I’ve dropped a clothing size. I try protein shakes and drink them like a shot, but they don’t sustain me long enough anymore. How do I find something I can eat and eat at regular intervals? I’m blowing money on lunches out - fast casual with a ton of greens because I figure if I’m going to cave and eat out, it needs to be nutrient dense - because I can’t bring myself to meal prep and go to the store or even plan and sandwich for work. Please. What works for you? I also told my doctors that if they put me on something to induce weight gain, we are gonna fight because I can’t physically afford to gain due to a spinal issue. I don’t want to lose more weight, I need to maintain and fuel my body. I’ve never had this war before. It’s so frustrating.I’ve always tried to prioritize my health. I planned every major life milestone with meticulous forethought and finances to support: getting my MBA, job, house purchase, starting a family. I have had a series of medical emergencies: pregnancy was rough with a cesarean delivery, chronic pain condition that led to a spinal surgery, and others. I took it all in stride, doing the next right thing. I agreed my spouse could leave work and be a SAHP. Their depression and dissatisfaction at work was killing us and I thought maybe this experiment would help. Worst decision ever, in hindsight. The years passed and we grew apart. I was in therapy, had left a toxic work environment for another, and burnt myself out completely trying to be everything to everyone. We divorced. It was ugly. I lost all trust and respect for them because nothing added up. They weaponized my health in session with a therapist and I refused to tolerate another minute in the relationship. Survival mode continued. Between steady jobs, single parent, finding work, financial ruin inevitable.My friends and family and therapist, all proud of my progress and how I was managing it all. Working three jobs, sick kid, life happening in the middle… In pregnancy, my symptoms were just depression. Stress. In divorce, my symptoms were expected, situational. Until I heard my friends saying, “I don’t know how you’re doing all of this. Your task list and accomplishments before noon make me feel anxious. Slow down.” Until I moved an entire room of furniture and boxes up three flights of stairs by myself in an hour. Until I moved a large heavy plant like it was a paperweight. Until I routinely forgot to eat for days on end and dropped a clothing size in months. Until I was missing hours of sleep. Until I heard my distant friends and family in my thoughts, telling me “it’s okay. You’re okay. You can do this. I’m proud of you.” Until I described that day - one day - of accomplishments as a “manic cleaning day,” I thought I was just in a trance of productivity. Just boss mode as usual. When I described it that way - manic - and reflected and reconnected with my body and how I was feeling, I intentionally slowed down, holed up in my home and started reading and journaling and reflecting. I called my closest friends and my doctors. I almost caved to going to the hospital; instead, I brought the hospital resources to me: easy prepare meals, grocery delivery, a housekeeper, friends and neighbors checking in (phone, texts, in person) and focused on just showing up as the bare minimum, which was painful. I finally had an understanding of all the struggles and the ups and downs, and I was - I am - committed to getting better. The abuse isn’t happening anymore; the marriage is over. My kid is happy. I can freely live my life and be happy and healthy and give myself the good things I’ve always wanted and needed. You can, too.I’m in the depression cycle now, but I keep telling myself it’s temporary; just a season of rest as I exit survival mode. I spent a decade being abused and unsupported for being unknowingly sick. I deserve a rest. I’m growing. And when my inner boss bitch wakes up again, I’m going to better understand her power and purpose while maintaining control.Mods - throwaway account. TLDR: Tell me it’s gonna be okay? What am I going to feel like adjusting to meds? What support system do I need to create for myself and my son? Beginning RX treatment this week after experiencing what I believe - and dr agreed - is a series of hypomanic cycles occurring with more frequency and intensity over the last year. I quit my corporate breadwinning job after workplace conflict and my paranoia and overachieving nature made me feel I had to look for greener pastures. Ended up in a high energy and demanding startup environment that fueled the overworking nature to the point of absolute burnout. My marriage was failing anyway but I exited with excess volatility. I believed my spouse was going to kill me and the paranoia fueled a manic “awakening”. The divorce finalized. I have exited the abuse fog from a high conflict relationship, where I was often taunted and tortured for my depression and body image insecurities, the sole income provider for an extended period while my spouse raised our son, and my doctors believe all the stress cocktail of all the conflicted environments with constant agitation from my spouse … fueled the manic response. I worked at being a single parent and surviving during the divorce like it was my life’s mission. I was working 3 jobs, stressing over my finances, looking for fulltime benefited work (over 200 applications submitted) and dealing with the divorce harassment as best I could. Little sleep, not eating, going from one job to the next, barely present at my fast paced grocery picking job, working overtime, and my speech was sped up and hard to follow. I was manic during interviews. Manic at work. Manic at home. Irritable. Suffering. Sad. Angry. No sleep. Not eating. Not drinking. House projects. Painting rooms in a day. Gardening. Organizing. Purging my home. I caught myself going too fast three weeks ago. I reflected and realized I’d been going too fast for days again. I wrote down everything I could remember. I felt the power drain coming, saw my phone text conversations, my embarrassing social media posts featuring my inflated boss bitch ego, and the fear set in. I called my therapist, I started researching, remembering the antagonistic things my spouse said about my behaviors over the last ten years, the cycles of unending depression and manic cleaning behaviors… and I felt both relieved and terrified. I grew up with parents that have struggled with mental health issues, and they manifested similarly. Of course, a generation of stubborn people, they received baseline care and diagnoses that were “good enough” to provide bandaids to their problems at the time. I’m getting help. I’m safe. I’m mostly alone in this with just friends for a support system. I keep reminding myself that my ex couldn’t show up for me in the marriage; he won’t show up for me now. My doctors believe the relationship trauma largely contributed to the intensity of the manic phase. 😣The diagnosis doesn’t change who I am at my baseline core: a good mom, a good person. It’s just new information to help explain decades of struggle in a new context. Lithium, a routine for eating and sleep, and hopefully a stable existence as the parent and person I want to be. Tell me it’s gonna be okay? What am I going to feel like adjusting to meds? What support system do I need to create for myself? Thanks.
    headed to residential treatment soon, what can I expect? Also the info they gave me refers to the stage system, in regards to when you’re allowed to wear makeup and access phones. Can anyone explain that better?. I feel like I need to be admitted for a week or two to get my medications figured out as I have been bouncing between mania and depression with suicidal ideations. I’m not sure I want the intense length of 1-3months at a facility far from home for residential treatment, but I’m not sure that PHP or IOP is enough monitor for me. but I want to be able to see my friends and family and use my phone and finish my classes in college. cross posted. not currently feeling in crisis. when to check your self into inpatient vs outpatientthis past month and a half I have been bouncing between mania and depression faster than I have ever experienced. I am on rexulti, seroquel, and strattera for adhd, and I just added low dose lithium into the mix. I see my psychiatrist every week. I have been having intense suicidal ideations on and off and I told my psychiatrist but she said to go to the er if I feel in imminent danger. I have urges to take a lot of pills, the only thing that stops me is I don’t want to traumatize my roommates or family when they have to find my body, but i fear one of these times i will just act impulsively and actually take the pills. I have been having trouble feeding myself because I either don’t feel hungry, all food sounds disgusting to me, or I have no energy to make anything. I am way behind on homework and I’m suppose to be looking for a job but I feel so mentally i’ll these tasks seem impossible. I have never been hospitalized and I am wondering what inpatient is like and how I would check myself in. can I check myself in now if I’m not experiencing suicidal ideations in this very moment? or is outpatient a better option for me?

    Hi all! First post here. I have been diagnosed by multiple doctors with bipolar 1 disorder and am looking for some advice. When you’re in a low, are there any books or paintings/musicians that help you cope? Also, anything artistic that makes you feel better while manic? One of my biggest struggles is not feeling heard or understood and art is a solace and coping mechanism of mine. Any advice is appreciated! Positive vibes and thoughts to all.
    I'm having a hard time thinking of anything to share. I want to get the most out of my 3rd Iop groups. What are some topics I can use for sharing?. I'm about to lose the 3rd job this year. I can't get ready for work in the morning due to severe depression and anxiety. I miss 1 sometimes 2 days a week because of this. I'm diagnosed bipolar 1 and gad. I've been in 3 iop programs in 3 years and see a therapist weekly.I have been in a psychotic depression for 2 weeks. I applied for short term disability through my HR dept. so I can attend an iop. Im still waiting on my Dr. to fill out the paperwork. If any of you have been through the same, how much of your base pay did you recieve? I don't want to end up homeless and it is physically impossible to work rn. I just hate not knowing what to expect.Im having a lot of anxiety when getting ready for work, I end up calling out once or twice a week. I have this heavy feeling in my chest while all I can think of is how much of a fuck up I am. I have also been having some SI. I see a therapist once every 2 weeks and when I bring up the fact Im missing work she says I should go for a walk. I don't want to bring up the SI because I would need to prepare rather than getting swept away. Im taking lithium, lurasidone, lamotrigene and xanax as needed.I've been having anxiety and intrusive thoughts that result in me calling out of work once and sometimes twice a week. I get up an hour and a half before i have to be at work which is a 15 m commute. When i get up i take .5mg of xanax otherwise i will start dryheaving. I chill for about 20 minutes before i start making lunch. This works for me somedays but other days i can't get out of my head. What should i try different? Im on lithium, lamotrigene, lurasidone. I see a therapist every 2 weeks.I've been stressing myself out lately. Mostly because I'm unemployed and the benefits run out in a couple of weeks. It's that pit in the bottom of my stomach feeling that's bugging me. My therapist wants me to get out of the house and do stuff, but I'm broke. What have you used to cope with stress?. I couldn't hold it together. I started 3 weeks ago and called in sick twice. I go through extreme bouts of anxiety in the morning and by mid day I can't remember, concentrate and focus on anything. I hate this illness.I just got a job after being unemployed for 8 months due to my mental health. I called out for a day on my second week. I have bipolar disorder and my symptoms are hard to manage some days.Am I protected from getting fired for missing a day here and there by the ADA?. I just atarted a job 2 weeks ago after being unemployed for 8 months. Last Friday I called out after dry heaving, having racing thoughts, feeling hot and sweating. Stupid anxiety. I don't want to make calling out a habit and lose this job. Are we protected by the ADA for calling out due to mental health?What have you done to fight the morning anxiety?. I've been out of work since applying in July of 2022 and im about to starve and lose my home. Why does life suck with teeth?If I go back to work will I have lost all the time I've waited already?. It's a patient sitter job at a hospital. I would be watching SI, dementia and violent patients. It's 3 12 hour nights a week 7pm to 730am. My therapist don't want me working nights because I need a good sleep cycle.I was working nights when a manic episode in May got bad enough I started hearing things. I went on short term disability that covered 8 weeks which I used to relax and tweak meds. I was still ill after 2 months so I went inpatient for a week and then took 2 iop programs during my recovery. Im still not right I have problems concentrating and almost like Im in a fog. Probably from the depression Im living with.My bills are being paid by my wives family since August. I feel terrible for not being able to provide. Im 43 for f sakes. My wife doesn't understand me and why I get episodes. She wants me to get a job doing anything.Should I turn down the offer?. [New Jersey] I collected short term disability from May to July until it ran out. I was still in treatment until Monday November 7th. The company I worked for has since been sold, so I no longer have a job to go back to. Should I file for UI? Do I have a right to file and collect until I get another job that can accomodate my disability?. I was energy orbiting a large warm bright cellestial body before I was flashed across the universe to occupy this body. What can I do to go back there? Am I supposed to ride out the cycle trapped in this flesh prison before I go back?.
    For the past 10 years I have been a teacher. During depression episode I will miss work 1 to 2 days a week (private school you can miss days but without pay) and when I am hypomanic I am excellent, creative, different teaching technice and doing twice the work.I snapped a few weeks ago and had a hospital permission to leave work for a month.I feel guilty, maybe I am running away or avoiding treagers instead of facing it . I had a new medication the last month but I am afraid the depression episodes will still afact my job. I will probably lose my job because of this.Should I take leave until my medication start working, or should I push myself and stop avoiding and hiding. I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder 3, i am so scared that I will have to take medicine for the rest of my life. My country had stigma about mental illness. Médecine is not always available. From your experience is that probable.Edit bipolar type 3 is the same as cyclothymia. My Psychiatrist called it that maybe it is the different languages barrier. Thank you for all the moking and movies refrance. I was recently diagnosed with bipolar, but for the last 15 years I was diagnosed with depression anxiety. During that I thought there was time where I was fine, funny, productive, sometimes really angry and that was the real me my personality. After I knew I have bipolar I realized these traits was only hypomania.I don't know myself anymore, what's the real me and whats bipolarSoory for the bad English. Hi sorry for my bad English it is not my first language.I (F) called the salon (who have one main stylist and 2 assistants) if there is availability or if I can come another time ( there is no reservation who come first get served first) they told me I can come now there is no one waiting before me. I got there and there is 6 before me and four after I got there so I waited for more than an hour but one of the women who came after me started getting her hair dyed I asked why and the stylist told me dryly that her dye would be done in stages and that would be more convenient for her as she would help the others through the waiting between. I waited for another half hour and noticed one who also came after me getting her eyebrows done I took a deep breath and tried to let it go only after she was done with her I asked her to help me as I was just there for my eyebrows and it will take a very short time she very rudly told me that every one was waiting and if I would like one of the assistant help me ( I tried them before and they did a horrible job everyone told me my eyebrows looked crooked) so I said of course not I don't want a bad job. When my turn came she said who is next ( it was mine) I told her I don't know maybe you will ignore me and help someone who came after me. She said I will help you but if i can't stand waiting I am not welcome to the salon again I told her to GET LOST and stormed out. Am I the asshole. I know I am socially awkward and I get anxious in a room full of strangers I would probably sucked it up if she wasn't rude.
    I ruin everything. I have no friends. I ruined my relationship. I hate who i am i hate that no matter what, im just me. My partner told me i have so many problems that I should be in a psych ward. I dont mean to be this way. I hate myself. I hate how low the lows feel. I want to go into bed and rot but I have my responsibilities. Its all so hard. I genuinely just wish I could d**. Whats wrong with me? I havent been able to get ahold of a therapist and I think its just making it worse. I hate myselfIm so aloneI dont mean to ramble but i have nothing to express my feelings to. Anyone else feel the same?. My boyfriend told me he was going to a party on thursday, we were going to watch the fnaf movie and i was so excited but later that day hes going to a party with his coworkers and even though its a work event I still feel upset? I went to a halloween party with friends yesterday and it was only my highschool friends. I dont want him to go. He isnt happy with me right now because i took a shot at the party yesterday, he told me im not allowed to drink. I feel like a piece of shit why do i keep messing up. Why did I take that stupid shot why do I do stupid things. I kind of made things worse and said stupid stuff about how i want to die because of him going to the party. I dont mean to be manipulative i really dont, how do I stop this. I hate that I hate him so quickly, in a second. I fucking hate him Im so angry at him and me I CANT TAKE THIS. Im so tired of feeling this way. Hi, 19FI was prescribed medicine about a month ago? I have trouble feeling the motivation to take my medicine. I have it next to me with water but something about opening the medicine cap when its hard to do so just makes it worse. It might sound stupid but is there an easier way to get your medicine without fighting the medicine cap?.
    I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago but stupidly I never took it seriously.I had such an amazing connection with this girl. She was exactly what I’ve always wanted in someone but shortly after we met I impulsively booked a ticket to go on a year long trip hitchhiking around the world.We had like 6 months together before I left. I always tried to treat her well while I was with her but once I left the country I felt like I lost all empathy and I was so selfish. Every time I would meet a girl I would ask her if we could not be exclusive and say horrible things like “if she tries to sleep with me I won’t stop her.” She would cry to me on the phone and I literally felt nothing at all, it just wouldn’t connect. It really confuses me now because when we were together if I ever saw her cry it broke my heart but when I was gone I felt like I lost all of my empathy. Eventually I cheated on her.I came home early and it was like I came out of a haze. I have no idea why I was so selfish while I was gone and I’m disgusted with myself. I’m not entirely sure if I was experiencing some kind of manic episode or if I’m just a terrible person but it doesn’t even matter. She’s gone now and it’s all my fault.I’m thinking if this was due to my bipolar, If I had educated myself more on the Illness maybe I could have recognized that I was not thinking properly but I was so absorbed in my own thought process.I really fucking hate myself right now because I always thought I was a good person but my actions were so far from my morals and I can’t figure out why. It feels like I was a different person.Am I just a piece of shit or could this be partly because of my disorder.
    For the least like month, I've been depressed. For the first three, I was constantly irritable and getting mad at my girlfriend because of the reality that I couldn't maintain who I was (never yelling or raising my voice, just talking with her and telling her how frusrated I was), because it takes much more effort than I had to spend, and I wanted her to do more, but recently realized that she was doing more and that I just wasn't seeing it because I was trapped in my own inner world of negative intrusive thoughts. A week ago I realized this, after a period of a little under a week in which I slept for 75% of each day, and ever since, I've been trying to introspect and think about what in me is causing negative emotions to surface. I realized quickly that after working through my negative emotion, I was left with no emotion at all, and I now think the negative emotion was a maladaptive way to still feel emotion. I feel nothing; the only thing that can get me to feel pleasure in the moment is penile stimulation from my partner, if at all, but afterward I am left still feeling like an empty husk. I know I love them very much, but when we kiss: nothing; when we cuddle; nothing; when I think about doing anything with them: nothing. I'm very interested in math and sciences, so when I read those things and have conversations with my partner about those things, I feel "normal", but it's pretty much just the slight feeling that I'm okay and able to function even though I'm an emotionless husk, but it goes away the moment we're done talking.I don't know if I'm actually emotionless, or if I'm repressing my emotion in an attempt to not feel it; either one could be true. I felt hangry yesterday which was totally new, but it was more that I was just impulsively saying things that indicated I was annoyed bc I was hungry.I know I love my partner and would do so much for them, or anyone else I normally feel love for for that matter, but the feeling isn't there atm. I don't know what happened; there wasn't anything that triggered this, it just started and over time progressed to where it is now.As I'm writing this, I'm realizing that I feel nothing except dulled basic emotions in response to immediate stimuli, like I feel repulsed if I smell a wet dog, or I feel hungry if I smell food, or I feel pleasure with penile stimulation, but I also know how to fake happiness when people smile at me, I know how to convey that I'm hungry through acting annoyed, I know how to pretend that I'm a normal human... but I feel like an empty husk.Thank you for coming to my ted talk.Does anyone relate, or have solutions?. I've looked online and somehow google only ever interprets my question as "are bipolar people more intelligent than people without bipolar disorder" or "how does mania effect iq after a person is no longer manic?"My question is this: Since mania causes faster processing speeds and more drive, do any of those things lead to a drastic increase in IQ? Like if someone with bipolar disorder took the WAIS while they were not in a manic or hypomanic episode, then they took the same test while they were in one, what would the difference in IQ be?. For mod purposes: I am bipolar, but I have friends who are too.My friend has bipolar, and they are in a 24/7 nonpsychotic manic state, though apparently they still need sleep. They are doing insanely well with their business goals and in growing it, and their information processing speed is so fast. The only downside is the asocial grandiosity.I have schizoaffective, so I know my mania and depression automatically looks different, but it's so hard to not let in the thought that I could be like that if I only stopped taking my pills (Quetiapine ER).How do I fight this?. I hope posting here will solidify in my brain that I am done. It was the "your girlfriend doesn't care if you do it" that started the binge. I've been watching porn for basically 8 hours now, and I know now I have an addiction. We haven't had sex in a while (over a week), and it just was getting to me a little bit. I'm done now though. My streak was 2 weeks I think; here's to starting back up again I guess.Problem: There's a tank driving along the Y-axis toward the origin, whose speed is proportional to the distance from the origin. At t=0, Y=4, and at t=10, Y=2. There is also an enemy on the X-axis, and a high wall along the line XY=1. How fast do you need to turn the turret to maximize chances of survival?Solution so far: Obviously the coordinates for the tank can be found with T=(0,Y)=(0,Ce^(-kt)), but the way you maximize the chances of survival is by making sure the "line of sight" is parallel to the wall at XY=1 at all times. Also, I don't know how to prove it, but intuition tells me that the equation for the farthest point on the X-axis that you can see at any given point on the Y-axis follows the equation P=(X,0)=(1/Y,0). I thought about trying to find the equation of the line of sight using f(X,Y)=(rcos(theta),rsin(theta)), then trying to use that to find d(theta)/dt, but I didn't know how to get a function of theta. Where do I go from here?. I feel like I'm dead. But... idk.I'm annoyed at my girlfriend for no reason, and I don't want to see her face.My brain fog is so intense I can't think straight.When she tells me she loves me or misses me it makes me feel nothing but anger because I don't believe her... I feel like she's saying these things out of habit or to trick me even though she says that she's not.I know the only way for me to feel better about this is for me to see her, but she says she doesn't have time until 9am on Friday.I feel like vomiting.I feel so disconnected and emotionless except for the mildly annoyed feeling directed toward my girlfriend that I physically feel in the back of my head.How. I'm taking quetiapine er 200mg, and so far it's incredible at getting rid of mania and positive psychotic symptoms, but apparently not depression.I know my girlfriend is super tired and overstimulated from other stuff and just wanted to go to sleep instead of facetime because of that, but that nagging thought in the back of my mind wonders if she sees what I see, which I know logically is not accurate to reality but I can't look at myself and not feel disgust.I feel like crying all the time despite my facial expression never changing from the default, I can barely get out of my bed, I haven't brushed my teeth or cleaned myself in multiple days.I have things to do, school to work on... why can't I just do what I want to do?I thought about going onto the highway and laying down across the road today, just to see if anyone would care enough to stop before or after running me over, it wouldn't matter. I feel so disconnected... I can't think straight. In the back of my mind I know I want to be with my girlfriend and have a life with her... but something inside me is telling me that it would be better if I were to disappear from the lives of my loved ones and end myself where they wouldn't be able to find me.I feel like my skin is just more cloth on my body. I've been getting so overstimulated and getting headaches. I want to scream but I don't have the ability to do anything but sit and have my nauseous headaches alone.I have an addiction... I know this is true. I was introduced to porn at too young an age, and unconsentually to sexuality even younger than that. I need to stop for my own sanity and for my relationship with the love of my life to thrive. I saw no sexual media today, and I will continue on this streak until I die.My doctor suggested in an after visit summary that I have borderline with schizoaffective instead of schizoaffective bipolar type. What does borderline with schizoaffective mean and how is it different from schizoaffective bipolar type?.
    Hello,I have a friend who seems to have mixed episode bipolar. Her mother passed away in 2016.. and when the title to the house was put in my friends name in 2017. She never seemed to be the same.A couple years later she took off in a panic with delusions of people after her. To be found by the police safe... in a state over. Her boyfriend at the time tried to have her committed she talked herself out of the facility.Her boyfriend did seem concerned for her taking off like she did. But, he is really worthless and just stays there rent free. Doesn't seem to even bother with what is going on with her at all.She has not been diagnosed and will not admit any mental problems. She does not seem to be aware there is any problems.My question is.. do I just keep being her friend and just talk her through her delusions? Any suggestions? I like to at least keep her calm and somewhat sane.. connected to someone outside other than the guy living with her.. Liquor drinkers that drink 7 days a week.. 2 to 3 500ml.. at night.. that wake up shaking.. do they have to continue to drink throughout the day at work? If small amounts.. is that a shot.. weekends he drinks more.I am recovering alcoholic and I drank 2 bottles of wine a night during weekdays and more on the weekends.. as about to somehow make it through work on about. .50 to 1 Xanax a day.. and I did have a seizure at work... it's been years.. that seizure was caused by stress at a bank in 2014 at GM Financial in Raleigh NC and I made the best numbers in history in VA they hated me. Anyways.. that was 10 years ago since that last seizure. Not sure if we have some liquor drinkers that can answer this. Just trying to figure out our options on what he is truly doing and what he isn't. For health reasons.. I appreciate any feedback.. anyone posts personal.expereinces also.. thank you it's such a help. I shared mine. It was a terrible time. So grateful for my life.I am a recovering alcoholic. I haven't drank in years.. I have a question. I drank wine.. and I would take xanax not too much. To get me through the day. I did have a seizure once.My question is with liquor.. if you are drinking 1 or 2 or 3 pints of liquor at night 7 days a week. Can you not be sick during work all day? I mean can you drive around in a truck with your boss all 8 hours....without drinking for 8 or 9 hours.. with no benzos... A lot of you are going to not believe this.. But, you just ask what I need to show to prove this to you! Look AT THIS LINK - THIS IS THE GENERAL MANAGER THEY FLIP AROUND STORES -[https://www.ncinmatesearch.org/NC\_DPS.html](https://www.ncinmatesearch.org/NC_DPS.html) this is ONLY ONE EXAMPLE of 300.WHY IS THIS LADY USING JULIE WEBB AND IT'S POSTED ALL OVER THE STORE?? WHEN HER NAME IS JULIE SILVER? WHEN SHE HAS NEVER BEEN MARRIED.. I GOT HER RECORDS.. AND THEN THERE IS A PRETEND DEAD PERSON IN ON THE WEB WITH JULIE SILVER NAME RIGHT AFTER THIS CONVICTION? I have seen her drunk at work screaming and yelling at no one by herself.. I got a video of that too.1372 store in Raleigh, NC.. and all 3 stores in Wilmington, NC are drug trafficking between each other.. they use the OLD WALMART EMPLOYEES THEY HAD TO FIRE THAT ARE HOMELESS... Notice how the homeless people SEEM TO KNOW THE BAD MANAGERS AT WORK??????? and try to hide it? Money centers go down unexpectedly...They do not use background checks at this store and use Alias to cover their tracks. See the picture.. this is a GM they circle around stores.. once she is caught using drugs and alcohol at work by employees.. then they put her in another store in the state and change her name again.They do this with criminals as well.. 7 Child molesters were hired in the Wilmington store.. which I have proof of.You can tell immediately which stores are the corrupted ones and which ones haven't. The ones THAT ARE SCARY TO WALK INTO ARE THE ONES WHERE EVERYONE IS DRUNK AND HIGH.. WHERE THERE IS NO VENDOR SIGNS..THE BOARD MEMBERS KNOW ALL OF THIS.. THEY DO NOT CARE THAT CHILD MOLESTERS HAVE MANIPULATED THEMSELVES INTO NORMAL PEOPLES LIVES THAT HAVE WORKED AT WALMART. I HAVE PROOF OF THIS TOO!. Tired of lies and more lies. I’ve practically supported him for six months. I’mMoving... thanks to him. Well actually thanks to me for continuing this relationship that IS NOT working. It’s not going to work and it never will. I’ve been positive negative quiet every person except myself to try to help him get better. And worry about his feelings over mine. I’m just done with it. I have to be. I can’t do this anymore.I weaned myself to about 15 gpd fromWhat I could see from the extracts I had been taking. I haven’t been able to take powder anymore. Makes me instantly sick. Unless It’s in a capsule pill... And even that is kind of “iffy”. I thought from what I read anyone who did early withdraw way.. was at A LOT higher gpd than me. So couldn’t be that bad. Right????!!! WRONG. I took about 1/4 IF EVEN THAT of a 50 mg Naltrexone. 30 minutes later it was bad. I made the mistake of eating right after taking it. I was so hungry... I hadn’t ate that much throughout the day. So I was starving. Threw up all of my meal.. plus some. Stomach cramps so terrible. And cold cold cold. I kind of enjoyed the cold somewhat. Considering I’ve been so hot taking Kratom. That I haven’t even needed a jacket being outside at 40 degrees. I had three blankets. My bathrobe. And warm long PJ Pants and a tank top. I felt like I was just in another world. I threw up so bad I peed all over the bathroom floor... no control. The restless legs was all over my body. And cramps so bad. Lasted about four or five hours. After that.. I still had stomach cramps that came on about every 20 minutes and slowly got further and further apart as time went on. I am feeling very weak. I managed to take the dogs out around 9am. To come back up two flights of stairs and throw up water with more cramps in my stomach. (I started all this at 7:30pm and withdraws starting at 8pm) It’s noon now and I’m now able to walk around without feeling too weak. I managed to eat some plain pretzel chips (four of them) and some soda pop (coke wish I had sprite) restless legs are minimal and back little worn out sore feeling. I’m hoping now it’s pushed out the opiates. I don’t have a craving for it ever ever again.. well at least I feel this way now. It was terrible. Not sure if I would recommend this. Battle for 6-7 years.. one year sober from it sometime in between. So I’ve done this on and off for quite some time... so long that the people at the shop I get it from are rooting for me to get better. Was it worth it? I am really not sure yet. Tomorrow will tell. If I kicked out all the opiates out of my system in one fun day. (Lol) maybe. I’ll let you know tomorrow.I quit Kratom for a long time over a year. And somehow I’m the past year or maybe even 2 I have been on and off it. I have somewhat control at first and then it gets bad. Then I quit..... go through all the bullshit to a month later doing the whole thing over again. Then I started drinking on and off.. and I quit that years ago. I think I need to start posting more often or something. Because what I’m doing now isn’t working.Just started this three weeks ago. And it’s seemed to decrease my appetite to the point I can hardly swallow. Has anyone had this problem?. I am posting for my friend. She was on lithium for her manic episode she recently had. But started getting tremors really bad. So she stopped. Is there anything natural or herbal she can take instead of prescribed medications?. Do all narcissists lie? Lie to get their way?. I moved across the country far away from my family almost seven years ago. I didn’t do it to move away from them. I was suffering from alcoholism.. after economy took a dump I kind of lost my mind. My life had been so perfectly planned out and I was successful at it. The sad thing was.. I only worked so hard hoping they would alleviate me from the “scapegoat” position. Which never ever happened. So when I was struggling financially.. I had really no one to back me up like family was supposed to. My sister turned back into the nasty girl I grew up with. And I drank the pain away all the way to almost ruining my life. I moved across country for a bette job but biggest thing was because I blamed where I lived for my drinking problems. The last words three years ago over the phone from my mom was “we don’t even have a family anymore” blaming it on me. The thing is... I never ever was part of the family. My cries for help during trying to quit drinking by just asking to call me once in a while were ignored. They even said.. oh you were just “joking” about it. Those last words of my NMom were the last time I took a drink and the last time I spoke with anyone in my family. It’s been very healthy for me to not have contact with them. I’ve blocked e mails, phone numbers.. making sure they cannot get through. But, my mom only sent her flying monkey once (my Nsister) to write a letter trying to get me to call her. I’m sure she has made everyone miserable trying to get them what she should be doing herself... just to control them. This is the first holiday season I feel like making it nice. I put up a x mas tree.. even tho it’s just me. And I enjoy it every evening with my dogs. I have stop drinking.. and I’m still in a up and down battle with Kratom here and there. But I’m healing and I understand now.. that it’s them.. it’s not me. I try everyday to forgive them.. and it’s hard. I try to feel sorry for them because that life they decided to be trapped in.. is miserable.. people that are happy.. don’t treat people the way they treated me... my nsister married a terrible narcissistic.. worse than my family combined. I feel she is an alcoholic because my last times I hung out with her she either showed up a places drunk.. or she got extremely intoxicated in front of me who quit drinking. She even passed out at a very busy camping spot on her chair. Couldn’t wake her up. Pathetic. I can almost see the future of them together. My sister the golden child won’t be so “golden” anymore when she slips deeper and deeper into alcoholism and depression from her Nhusabnd.. my parents won’t get help they were hoping for from her.. and will be old and alone..But guess who’s fault it will be in there minds.. mine. Lmao! I am going to keep fighting to heal myself.. and I know I will get there. I need to find some forgiveness in my heart one of these days. When it comes down too it. It’s all they know and it’s really not their fault.. I actually have a “timer” on my phone that tells me exactly how long it has been. I will always remember those last words my mom said to me. Which made me go.. this is enough. (She said we don’t have a family anymore and it’s my fault)I moved out of state and my mom and sister just went nuts. Like fucking lunatics. People move on with life. Get over it. My mom has had my sister or “flying monkey” write a letter to me about a year ago. Obviously forced through my mom. Asking for me to call my mom and dad. I wrote a letter back. Made it very simple and asked how they were. I never got a letter back. I didn’t call I’m sure was the reason for nothing back. And to be honest I’m very grateful she didn’t. I’ve realized more and more on how bad my family was for me. I do not feel alone anymore. Isn’t that sad? I had to stop talking to my parents.. to NOT feel alone. No more disappointing phone calls.. or being cut down.. or acting like they don’t care. I’m sure they are saying “oh she’s just playing a game” which they’ve told me for years. Ok! That’s fine. Whatever you want to call it. Just leave me out of it. I still get mad and hurt at times. But they are getting less and less every day, month, year. I have replacements for them.. good friends and their family who have adopted me. No more tears when I go over there for thanksgiving or x mas. It’s just joy to have people who show and act like they love me and they do. If you have gone no contact. It gets better and better. You realize so much. My whole life changed. My addictions went slowly away.. myConfidence grew.. I spent my whole life doing what I think would impress THEM as far as career.. etc. now I do what I want. I felt lost at first without having this “I need to do that for them” but it goes away b. My neighbor wanted to straighten my hair. And I said I was worried about being burned and mentioned how my mom had done it by mistake several Times. She then tells me that is unusual she never burned her daughter. and my sister never burned me... I ask around.. maybe once by one other Mom. So!?! Who else had a NMom who burned you a little too often with a curling iron? Did she just not care enough to be careful? Or I wonder if she did it on purpose. I spent 38 years trying to get my parents to know that I’m a extremely smart and great person. And they will never believe it. They believe what they want to believe and none of it is reality. They want to believe my sister is a great super star. When I’m actually the smart one, the kind one, the one that brings the family together and gets them laugh. I will always be the scapegoat.. I will always be a liar, a trouble maker, and a loser. It doesn’t matter if I won the lottery, bought a island built a castle on it, and then invested the money and made more money. My dad would be “disgusted” it happened to me and that I still didn’t do something right. That, unfortunately, will be what they will focus on until I feel just as miserable as them. They are very jealous and mentally sick people. That hate when you do better than them or have any kind of fun unless it’s something they like. I haven’t spoken with my parents in 2 years. And my sister in over 3 years. By doing this I no longer attract bad people in my life. I see the warning signs of someone like my family and I never speak to them again. Instead of being happy that I “relate” with them. I’ve stopped the cycle of the terrible abuse by ghosting my sister and parents. I had a good 10 years with my sister. But she married someone just like my parents and now she’s just like them.. with a terrible drinking problem. She will always pretend that everything is wonderful while he insults her friends and her family. Because that’s what’s she is good at... pretending everything is great when it hasn’t been since we were children. As he (sisters husband) sets different rules for her than for himself... just like my parents.. and the cycle continues. My point is.. there is nothing I can do that I haven’t already done.. but walk away. Best luck to my family.. If you take control of yourself... then you get your life back and it only gets better. Isn’t that worth just quitting, accepting the withdraws are going to be uncomfortable, and get better sooner!?!You get your whole life back from just a couple months of withdraws! And become a stronger, better, and more appreciative person!!. I realized today looking into new phones that since I quit Kratom.. I hadn’t dropped my phone or throw ln it. Or leave it some where. I have no cracks or anything. And that’s a first for me in a long time.. I believe I have reached the initial acceptance of the relationship. We broke up around Easter last year. I felt as if I was over it months and months ago. Until today I realized I really wasn’t. That’s why I couldn’t go on any dates. That’s why I had a hard time moving on and allowing someone else in. I loved so many things about him. Him and I were just both free spirits. We could talk about anything and he accepted me for who I was. We could laugh forever. He was supportive of anything I was interested it. He got me out of the house and to enjoy life a little more. He forgave me of several mistakes I had made myself. He was never malicious or cruel to anyone. But, he has a compulsive lying problem. Which, unfortunately, destroyed us. He also hurt several people that depended on him being honest and truthful. That even... still to this day.. he doesn’t take accountably. Even questions why certain people got mad at him after months of no contact with them and then he reaches out. To be shot down in a mean cruel way. But, it wasn’t his fault?? Yes it was if he’d only been honest maybe he’d still have those people in his life. Including me. He was supposed to come and visit me from out of state this weekend. But, right before I caught him in another very small lie. That he defended with his life.. sending invalid proof trying to manipulate me into believing him. Over just something simple he had forgot and I was ok with him forgetting. I feel that he’s so used to people just walking away and just saying OK your right. Making him feel his lie worked when really they just didn’t have time for it.. and it wasn’t worth it. Another friendship lost was something normal to him... not his fault of course.. they must of gotten busy with life. I wonder if he could be me for a day and see how much it hurt about the small lies that turned into big lies. Maybe he would stop if he could be me for a day? See how much it hurts. See me sitting alone in my house that I am being evicted from in tears of how I was a fool again. All my savings gone with his all in or all out thinking of new business ideas. Or not paying employees.. as they are expecting to feed their families and pay rent. As he swears up and down they are getting paid tomorrow. When it’s months later only because I am on his ass to do the right thing. Which he is proud of that he did EVENTUALLY pay most of them. But, it was really me getting on him to do the right thing. I, of course, have not seen a penny of the $20k+ he used of mine. With broken promises and lies that it will come back with more. He’s too busy keeping a step ahead of his lies than to actually be a good business owner. Which the business is now gone... but of course.. it’s going to be up again!! And better than ever... yeah sure. He didn’t even fight for me this time. He knew he was caught with this last silly lie. Instead of ok I lied and forgot. He tells me to talk to someone else about it. Thanks for breaking my heart. Thanks for getting me to believe in you that you used my savings that took 10 years to have....to help you get your dream going.. that you ended up covering up the situation with lies until it was too late.. and I was left with nothing but a broken heart. And thanks for telling everyone lies that I am the bad one. Why is it, the one who is genuinely the good person always ends up as the person everyone blames. Things will come back together as time goes on. And he has to live with his delusional situation and himself. At least I know I am the sane one.. When I look back to when I quit now that it’s been a very long time. I realized - I don’t think the withdraws are worse than taking Kratom. After a while the Kratom destroys you. For me it was hair loss, no energy, only really worked in the morning for a short bit after over a year taking it. Maybe if I took a lot a lot during the day maybe feel something later. Depression... Rage over nothing that has gotten myself in trouble. Throwing up all the time. Happy to sad to rage to tired. No memory at all. Able to sleep.... 20 hours a day if allowed. Weird smell. Peeing 5,000,000 times a day. Red eyes. No appetite. Weight loss. Sweating feeling hot. Jittery. Hair loss. Unable to finish tasks even tho it feels like you are. You really aren’t. Quitting Kratom:Kratom withdraws - hard time sleeping, depression, lethargic, sweating.. some stomach problems. Appetite lower but not as low as taking Kratom Then after about a week or two the sleep gets in line, eating is normal, no more sweating, after that it’s depression and low energy for a month or longer. But there are days it’s better.. If you compare the two. Actually it seems that withdraw is better feeling than staying on it. And I DIDN’T FEEL LIKE IT WAS BETTER WHILE GOING THROUGH IT. Now that I look back.. the crippling depression sucked and being so exhausted for 82 days. But I could remember what I did a second ago. I could complete tasks. I didn’t have sudden urges to throw up and then get sick. I didn’t need stock in eye drops. I never screamed or did something inappropriate again. I enjoy food. I look better so much better my ex BF cried. My hair didn’t fall out anymore! Don’t hold off because the withdraws aren’t as bad as staying on it.. I asked a Vendor on Dream Market if he had the tracking number. And he sent an encrypted message and I don’t know how to read it. Can anyone tell me how to read it?. I keep getting this error trying to get into dream Market this morning. Any idea what this means?. Is this a good place to shop?. Emotional abuse was most of my life. When I was a child it was my Dad teasing me until I cried. Snapping at things kids just do when upset, or being physical.My mom ignoring me and never listening to me. She’d let me leave the house a total mess and when I’d come home and cry because I was picked on. She would just say tell the teacher. Never thinking maybe your time to make sure I didn’t leave a mess at 6 years old. I don’t think she wanted to be a mother. I think she only wanted the parts that said she was awesome because of her. My older sister was straight up cruel to me. My parents will, still to this day, defended her.. like putting my horse to sleep behind my back because I moved out of state. As a cruel punishment for not doing what she wanted.. she kind of sounds like my parents. Can’t wait to get that hurt back at ya.. well she wins. My last words I heard from my mom over a year ago is blaming me “we don’t even have a family anymore” and of course it’s all my fault. Because I should let my family treat me unfairly like they have been doing my whole life. I blocked my whole family after that. Ok that’s just unbelievable. And that over a year I haven’t spoke to anyone in my family... I also haven’t drank any alcohol. And it was a problem. It really bothered them that they spent so much time and money on my older sister. Set her up to succeed. And I was ignored. But I was the one succeeding and she was the one just getting by. They refused to see it or acknowledge it unless family was around so they looked good. I feel that I pick similar people that are like them in my lives. That lie all the time because they have some lame justification.. or very very selfish. But I’m making better decisions. But I’m working on that and getting better. I look forward to having a much better life. Leaving and stopping the cycle of negativity behind me. I no longer have to defend myself when I have good news.. try to chase my sister down with severalMissed calls and texts for days to weeks to just tell her about what wonderful thing happened to me. They just really didn’t care or ever believe in me. Now I know they all sit together at the uncomfortable dining table. Listen to the son in law being negative and disrespectful... sister getting drunk.. parents pretending they don’t hear anything. Miserable people. I choose to move on and bring joy to other people who appreciate it.. I was taking about 2 to 4 mil for about 8 months. I got slowly up to 4 mil and weaned back down to 2 and took the plunge.I know this is not recommended. And it was very tuff for the 1st week. I had a friend stay with me for three days. After the first week I had residual effects for about month and 1/2 but slow dissipated everyday. Before that I did .25 - .50 xanax every day for 20 years. And I quit that with no withdraw. My life is so much better sober. I am on Zoloft I as much as I wanted to fight taking xanax over Zoloft. It has been a blessing. I don't have anxiety like it did anymore. I been on it for about three years and never really gave it a chance between quitting Kratom and Xanax. I don't do any drugs or drinking now. And life is great. Now that I look back I really believe that Xanax created more anxiety. My drinking (quit 3 years ago) and Kratom created more. I finally gave myself a chance without it all. If you are having anxiety it may be time to allow yourself to be sober for a while and you may be pleasantly surprised.. I feel normal now. The only thing I seem to forget what I tell people. Or what they tell me a little more often I think than normal. Anyone experience this? Does it get better?. It's very true... so if no one says that.. you will too once you quit and give it the time to heal.. It took me about 82 days to start feeling 100% better. But even after that.. I really had to work hard at self motivating. At this point in my life it's not hard motivating myself. I feel like I'm a important person again and I've gotten through a lot. If I was still on Kratom... I wouldn't be where I am at today. 239 days ago.. I was a mess.. I couldn't function at all like a normal person. I would take the stuff and throw up sometimes. 40 grams a day for about 2.5 years.. I'm absolutely fine now. Now I look back and I wonder... did xanax actually give me more anxiety? Because I don't seem to have hardly any problems. I'm tempted in stressful situations to take something for anxiety. But when it actually happens without any medication I'm fine. It will take a little time for me to gain this confidence back that I'm not going to have anxiety from situations. I have a therapist now and she's great on getting me back in-line. It's been 33 days with no Xanax. I had been using xanax since 16 years old. Only .25 to .75 and then just recent quit for a year. It was all prescribed. Then I started taking Kratom for over two years. Quit that which took 80 days to feel normal. Then I got ahold of someone who sold xanax. Started taking that last Nov or Dec. He only sold them 2 mil at a time. So I quickly went to 2-4 mil a day. Mostly 3 mil. I caught myself before it went above that. I was weaning down and got to hanging at 1.75 to 2 mil. And finally I just quit CT. I was tired of relying on substances. I had quit drinking 3 years ago. Then went to Kratom then started on the Xanax. I realized with the help of my therapist it was time.My therapist was extremely upset that I decided to go Cold turkey off of 2 mil and explained how dangerous it was. So I had a friend stay with me for the first three days. He was aware there was a chance he would need to call 911. Week one was awful. I worked from home a couple days the first week. Didn't really do to much working at home. I just felt very weird, heart Palps. I took a lot of GABA which seemed to help the palps. I was very very slow moving. My thoughts just were not completing tasks at a normal rate. Week two was easier and after that I could function normal. I never really had problems sleeping. I did take Benadryl at night. Which I have finally stopped. I still have moments of anxiety and slowness. I sometimes will get a slight fever and just feel bad. But it's pretty much over and it's really nice.. I haven't had really any problems sleeping that much since I quit CT off of 2 Mil. But now I feel like the past couple days I can sleep forever. I go to bed at 9:30ish and I could hardly get up at 7:30. I'm super tired today and I had to go home to pick up some things. And I just want to lay back down in bed and sleep. But I'm pushing myself along till I get things done I need to at work. Then I think I'm just going to come home and sleep. Is this normal?. Every day I am getting better and better. My withdraw symptoms are very minimal now. I feel normal feelings right now which is hard since I just got through a breakup. Unfortunately my ex tried to be nice for once in months we were together.. and it really ripped me apart yesterday. But, I need to mourn for the lost and feel the hurt. So I never make the same mistake again. If I just covered it up with xanax I might think to myself.. well it wasn't so bad to date someone who lies about everything and isn't a real person. Probably because I wasn't much of a real person myself. Only difference is he is sober. Or at least I think he is. He lies about everything so who knows. I can put things in healthy perspective on who is a normal person and who is just a piece of crap. It's very disappointing because most people pretend they are something they are not. But, now I can find good friends instead of bad ones. My life is coming together now and moving forward.. So went CT off of 2 mil. It was really terrible for a whole week. I felt like I was never going to get better. I think I was lucky that I seemed be able to sleep. I would get sweats really bad. But I have had worse. I worked from home two of the days and took a nap in between. I felt like I was in a really bad dream for a long time. I think it started finally lifting at about 9-10 days. It started out I would feel better just for a little in the mornings and evenings. Then some clarity in the middle of the day. Now I have clarity for most of the day with a few weird feelings in-between. I had a lot of stomach issues. Having to go to the bathroom a lot. Today is the first day that finally lifted. But, I get tired easily from stress. Today when I got home. I took a nap and didn't wake up till three hours later. I had a lot of weird bad dreams.. those are started to slowly go away. I have a lot of drama going on in my life which in some ways I'm glad I am getting it over now while I am not 100%. Then when I am 100% it will all be in the past with my withdraws. I'm very thankful to feel better and be able to take on the world again. I didn't realize how much xanax messed me up. I am almost embarrassed over it. Now I am completely sober and it's great. I do have a few cravings here and there. But, what makes me stronger is the people they try to create problems to make me fail. It just makes me do that much better and finally be a true good person.. I am finally starting to feel better... I am a lot less foggy. I slept almost 11 hours. But sleep hasn't been much of a problem for me. Mornings and evenings seem to be the best. It feels good to have more moments of clarity. I am still a little slow. I've been trying to eat better he past few days. Food doesn't always sound very good to me and I am have stomach issues all the time. I didn't think 2 mil of xanax would effect that. I do feel lost. I don't think that is part of the withdraw. It's just being free of substances. I feel like I have a lot of time on my hands but don't have the motivation to do much with it. I know staying sober is a lot of work than just quitting. So I'm ready to start my road to working to keeping myself sober. I feel I caught myself before I got into another major addiction with xanax. So, I need to be aware of all substances in the future and what they can do to my overall health.. So I completely stopped doing xanax at about 1.5 to 2 mil. I was up to 3-4 some days. I've only started doing xanax since December and started at .25. I was weaning but then my xanax got stolen by my ex or friend (who knows) my therapist was trying to get me into a doctor but I just said forget it. I can't take it anymore. I know it's not safe and all that crap. But I'm not getting another prescription. So I'm looking for some help or advice. I'm told I'm out of the danger of a seizure by now anyways. I am still feeling very foggy. Everyday I wake up and I feel a little better but it comes and goes in waves. I thought when I was tapering by day four of the taper my body would adjust. But here I am and my body has not adjusted. Any idea how long this is going to last? I've accepted for what it is. I guess everyone is different. But maybe someone on here has a similar timeline to mine.. 5 months. I cannot believe it. It feels like forever ago I was so miserable. I took Kratom for probably close to three years. Started out when I quit drinking (I'm a alcoholic) and saw online how it helps with the PAWS. When I read it online I went straight to the headshop at 11pm. And found something that made me feel better. I realized now that it really made me crazy and take risks. I had no sense at all. I didn't even realize I was addicted until I was in the hospital and there was a doctor that knew what it was and that was about 2 years ago. First attempt I quit got about 59 days and came back to it for five months worse than ever. Ounce and 1/2 a day to just feel like shit and throw up all the time. Right after I would throw up I was almost disappointed I couldn't keep it all in. How sick is that?I had horrible mood swings. I would snap at anyone. When I usually was stand offish. I would cry for no reason. I got so depressed not taking it that I actually tried meth because I was so unhappy I'd try anything. That's how messed up my brain was from this crap. It took me about 82 days to finally feel normal. I have some few good days and some bad days. No motivation. I did make pot oil and smoke a lot of weed that helped. I took l tyrosine, gaba, vitamins, ate good. But motivation was really hard and everything was such an effort. After about 82 days it was like a switch turned on. And I was fine. Like nothing ever happened. I was back in full swing. I think this isn't the normal amount of time. I think I took longer than most. But I do not crave Kratom.. I don't crave anything anymore. I don't smoke weed either. It's just really nice to be myself again and smile.. Yeah life is much better. I don't even think about it at all but... it was hard to quit. I tried smoking a lot of MJ In the beginning which did help with sleep. Making MJ oil to really knock myself out. But it was the energy level and feeling so lethargic that was the worst. The day came where I really didn't want to smoke MJ or anything. And just be clean. I don't think about it. I don't have any need for it. My energy level is super hyper and normal. Though I caught myself creeping up on benzos a bit before I realized how dumb that was. Thats pretty much at a end. I don't sleep less or sleep too long anymore. I still have ups and downs. But that's because life is like that and I have shit going on. Can't just take something to feel better to numb the pain because it's just going to be worse when it goes away. Or worse case another addiction. Life is fun. It has it ups and downs. Why try to stop it. The downs is something you fix sober not messed up. Then you laugh about it later and forget. You'll never fix the downs if your taking something that prevents you from functioning.. The past couple days I've just been a mess. High anxiety and just feeling just up and down. I seem to have a lot going on and it's stressing me out. Before it was Kratom I would use. Now I got to find out other healthy ways to cope. Ugh.. I notice some people on here have a quit date next to their name. How do I do that?. At 82 days. I woke up and felt blah. Like usual.... then finally I just said to myself this is bull shit. I'm tired of feeling like this. Its not going to happen anymore. I got up 45 minutes later I was out the door to work early. Next day didn't even think about it. Didn't give myself time when I woke up to see how I felt. Again early to work. Each day after that it was like I never had a problem for the past 82 days. I guess this was maybe just PAWS. I hadn't even taken my usual supplements because what reminded me to take them was feeling miserable... day in and day out. Now I am like a completely different person. I care. I love. I've forgiven. I've moved forward. I think of happy things... things I want to do again and enjoy. Actually... maybe I'm not like a completely different person. I'm just finally back to me.... I don't have any cravings for Kratom anymore. Especially since I've gotten this far and I don't want to go back through all of this. I am still sleeping a lot. I slept the whole weekend through basically. I'm up and down a lot. I still seem to cry about something almost everyday. But I do have a lot of good days as well. But, I'm still waiting for that "normal" feeling to come back and it's just not there yet. I have t gotten this far yet in quitting. But it's starting to get tiring to push through the bad days. Sometimes my temper is just bad. I want to do more with myself and the business I'm trying to run. But I'm just so exhausted.. It seemed like I would go through some stages where I would sleep a lot.. but now the past two weeks. I sleep like 10-12 hours a night. Now when I was on Kratom that was pretty normal. It wore me out. Is anyone else having this problem? Should I just start forcing myself to get up in 8 hours?.
    I’m sorry if you already get a ton of these posts on here, I just really need to get it out of my head.My psychologist who is trained and have worked in a psychiatric center, and is qualified to diagnose the disorder, believes I’m bipolar. I’ve had the thought a few times when younger but I never knew about type 2 before she told me, so I didn’t think that’d be it because my “up’s” are not completely manic.I’m really worried about being diagnosed. I kinda see it would make sense, I do get depressive periods a few times per year, sometimes for no reason and they come and go, and I also believe when she says some of my experiences might have been hypomania.I am pending an official diagnosis, because if it’s this, then I would like to get treatment.It’s just so bittersweet because it’d be amazing to not have as many or deep depressive periods of time, but I always kinda hoped it would just stop coming at some point and if I’m bipolar, then I guess it won’t.She talked to me about treatment and I’ve since researched a bit and what worries me the most is how important it seems to have a good routine and live a pretty chill life.I have nothing even resembling a routine in my life, I am very passionate about event-planning and I thrive in high-stress enviroments even though I usually also end up feeling completely burned down. I guess it’s probably not good for me, and if I’m bipolar they’ll advice me not to pursue this in the future, but it’s such a big passion of mine.I’m worried they’ll want me to get a 9-5 job in an office, because I know I’ll hate it and I can’t stand the thought of living what for me would be a boring life.I’m not sure what I’m looking for here, I probably shouldn’t even worry this much before I know anything for certain.But it makes me worried to get diagnosed, even though I should have it checked out.If anyone og you have had similar feelings or want to share how your life has been since starting treatment, I’d really love to hear it.Hey all, I’ve just come here to lurk and learn about more. I have been seeing a therapist who used to be a psychiatrist for a while now, and today when I came in for my session she told me that we had to talk about something and that she really would like for me to be screened because she believes I have bipolar type 2.She said she wouldn’t be diagnosing me then and there, she’s private practice and she could take me in for diagnosing but I’d be very expensive so she referred me to someone she knows who has experience as well, where I’d be able to go for free. (I’m in scandinavia, thanks free healthcare)I’ve had thoughts of it before, but never really believed it because I didn’t know about type 2, and she seemed quite sure, and I can definitely see that it would make sense.However I was actually diagnosed with ADHD just about a year ago, and it had me wondering if maybe I was wrongly diagnosed? I do see myself in adhd too, and the medication is working wonders for me. She told me it’s not unlikely to have both, and I’m just curious to hear if any of you do, and if you’d be willing to share your experiences. Thank you. I’ve posted before and I’ve also googled, searched here and watched YouTube videos.Our sweet cat just turned 7 this month. We got her half a year ago, she’d been living the same place since she was born, but wasn’t happy with their dog and the owners felt like they couldn’t give her enough attention.We live in a relatively small apartment, and she spends a lot of her time sleeping. And she’s bored! And I can’t for the life of me figure out what to do, and I feel guilty constantly.So far I’ve:-Put up shelves on the wall for her to climb, but she doesn’t use them-Bought several different scratchposts with levels and dens.-Bought lots of different toys, electrical and not-Tried to teach her tricks/motivate her with treats-Built different “obstacle” trails for herAnd I can’t figure out what else to do. She will sometimes play a bit with the one of the cat wands I have for, but she’s not super interested and I lose patience because she doesn’t seem to care much.She likes being pet at times, and if I throw a treat she will run and get it.But I really need ideas on how to excersice her/keep her entertained. We catsat for a while and she did not like the other cat at all so I don’t think getting her a friend would be helpful. What works for your cats?. I can’t remember when it started, but for the longest time I’ve had a feeling that I’ll die before I’m 30. I’ve had the feeling before I was 15 for sure, but I’m not sure when it started. It’s not something I think about every day, it just pops up sometimes. I’ve also had a feeling that I might be the one to end it, but I don’t want to and I don’t imagine I will.Around my middle 20’s, I felt like I could picture being 30, and it felt realistic and the feeling of doom kinda died down, it was still there but not as convincing.I’m 28 now, I’ll be 29 in november. The feeling is stronger than ever. I feel like my body hasn’t been right for a few months now, and I’m fighting to feel better but it’s just not happening. I can’t point to what is wrong, apart from me being extremely tired, and feeling like none of what I used to do, is possible anymore. Like I’m not able to do things.I’m still going strong, keeping up with everything and trying to work through it, but my body is acting so different, and I can’t seem to do anything about it. It kinda feels like a sign, that it’s only gonna go downhill from here and that it’ll be fast.The rational part of me is telling me I’m an idiot, but the feeling has been there as long as I remember and it just feels so certain.I’m not too bothered because I’ve lived a life I’m happy with, and if I do die, I won’t be here to know what I’m missing, and I think it’ll be peaceful. I feel like I need to talk to somevody about it, but my friends get (understandably) quite upset when I do, and I need to share it and not worry about hurting anyones feelings. Here we are. I had my nostril pierced in the beginning of June, and all was good until last week when I started to get a piercing bump.I clean it twice a day with salt water spray. When the piercing bump came I continued to do the same, and it kinda went away but then it came back even worse a few days ago. This morning as I was cleaning it, it kinda burst and spilled pus and blood and now I’m not sure what to do about itI can’t add a picture because my post gets remove everytime for it not being focused enough :/. Hej allesammen! Det her et lidt et skud i tågen og jeg ved at der nok ikke er nogle der kan give et klart svar, men jeg er nysgerrig på hvad I tænker.Vi har fire billetter til Silent Spot og fire early entrance, så vi skal være ved indgang east mellem 10 og 10:30.Vi har én i bil der kører med baggage, resten af os tager toget og går til parkeringen hvor vi lige nu har aftalt at mødes kl 9. Så vi har altså supergod tid til at komme derfra til indgangen, og få styr på billetter og at komme ind.Nu er det så bare turen fra København til Roskilde: Vi tager afsted herfra allerede kl 7, og jeg har sagt til de andre at der jo nok ikke er så mange der tager så tidligt afsted når først de åbner kl 16, og det meste camping er pre-booked, men jeg har én i campen der er meget nervøs og tror at alle tager mega tidligt afsted for at ligge i kø til West.Selvfølgelig er det ikke noget nogen kan forudse, men hvad er jeres forventninger? Tror I på at det bliver kæmpe kaos fra tidligt om morgenen?. I know this is weird. Since I was 13/14 ish, I’ve had a feeling that I’d die before 30. It’s not that I want, I never wanted to - I just feel like it.For most of my 20’s, the feeling hasn’t been very strong and I was good. Now I’m 28. I still have 1,5 year until I’m 30, but the feeling is back. The feeling that I’ll die before 30, and maybe even sooner. I’m supertired lately, my body isn’t doing amazing. I have had a cough for two months. It’s nothing major, I’m talking to my doctor about it soon. I guess it’s just some sort of anxiety but the feeling is so strong.I’m waiting for an appointment so I can make my testament, and leave my apartment to my roomie, who I’ve lived with for 6 years, I want her to be safe in case I do die.I don’t want to die, it just feels out of my control. It’s a very tiring feeling to have. Hey! My roomie and I live in a two bedroom, one bathroom, one kitchen apartment, and have a sweet indoor 6-year old cat that we’ve had for almost three months now. Before we got her, we’d agreed to catsit for friends, and now the time has come.They have a sterilised, 10 month old male cat, who has been here for ~2 hours now. I’m in my room with him, while our cat is available to roam the rest of the apartment. However we have catdoors in our doors, so they saw each other through that and she started hissing at him a lot. Now I’ve put up a pillow so they can’t see each other through the door, but how do I go about this the best way? He is here for 10 days.I know this is not an optimal situation, but I’m trying to make it as little stressful as possible. I (F28) have this friend (M26) Simon, we’ve known each other for a year and used to work together on a project. After the project ended, we’ve hung out a bit and through drunk nights we’ve gotten pretty close emotionally.Flashback to ~a month ago, we were out with friends and then somehow ended up just the two of us, went back to his place and had sex after discussing some emotional topics for quite a while.When we woke up I kinda ran away before we could talk.We texted the day after and he told me he’d actually gone to a bar that he knew I was going to, to see if I was still there (I wasnt though). We talked about other things and talked on the phone a bit during the weekend, then I ran away for some days. Last friday we ended up working together, and he asked if we should talk about what happened:I told him that I have no expectations from him. To make it more messy, a few months back he drunkenly told me we should go on a date, and a few days later when sober I asked if he wanted to do that and he said we should probably just be friends. Back to now: I was worried he thought that I now expected us to start dating, so I told him I didn’t and we were good. Then we ended up having sex again that night…This time I stayed a bit longer but also left quite soon. We texted about other things after again.On wednesday I went to go see a free concert outside and texted a group chat to see if any of my friends wanted to come - turns out this guy was actually there already! So we ended up hanging out, later another friend joined and we all got quite drunk. Before the friend joined, we’d talked about it again and he said he’s cool if I am, but then also said it’d be weird for us to continue having sex if I’m seeing others (HE told me he was going on a date that day that got cancelled, and then I told him about a guy I’m talking to.)In the end, he went to go home and I was waiting for our friends train with him, and he told me that he’s sure that Simon is into me and that we should just go for it. I tell him that I’m a bit worried because I think I actually like Simon romantically, and he said “well good, cause he likes you too.”I went to go home, then Simon texts and asks if I wanna stop by and so I do, hoping maybe we’d talk. We sleep together and after he tells me he thinks we might need to stop it, because he’s afraid he’ll start bootycalling me - He’s had a friendship end that way already and he’s just now starting to reconcile with her. Apart from that, an ex of his that moved away is coming back, which obviously complicates it even more.Now it’s been two days. We texted a bit yesterday. I don’t know when I’ll see him again. I was okay with just being friends, and I still am, but I’m very confused because I think we might both like each other, However his situation right now makes it difficult. And maybe he just doesnt like me like that.I’m not sure what advice I’m looking fot. Currently I’m trying to distract myself with other things and let time tell, but if anyone has any ideas on what else could be good to do, then I’d be interested in hearing it.Also if you’ve read the whole post? Thank you!. I’m not sure this is the right place to post, but I really like this community and have had really good advice before from other adhd women.I’m just feeling down. There’s no specific reason for it, other than I’m starting my period today or tomorrow, that’s always intense on my emotions.I woke up and was still tired, missed my train and it rained. I did a lot of good things today, crossed a lot of my to do list! But I just feel down. Kinda like I’m gonna cry, but I don’t think I am. I can’t think of anything I want to do at all, I’m just laying here feeling sad.I get like this sometimes and it usually doesnt last for too long. Last time I posted about sitting on the floor and being unable to move, a kind woman told me “that’s just today. You won’t feel like this everyday” and I loved that. I’m trying to remind myself that now, but it sucks to feel like this. Hey guys! So, my schedule tomorrow is:6 am - get up, get ready, head to uni8 - 12- exam at uni12-13.30 - get home13:30-15 - rest at home15:15 - leave for work16:00-02:30 - work behind the barIts currently midnight, and I’m trying to sleep. I know a lot of people do schedules like this, and I used to too, but I really don’t appreciate having a long day on little sleep, and now I’m looking for tips on how best to manage/get through it.So: ANY tips you have for the days where you have a 10 hour shift behind the bar, having had little sleep and little rest before are very, very welcome.I’m not gonna be online until I get up again, but aaaaaany advice is more than welcome!. It’s almost 2 am and I can’t sleep because I’m so in love with my cat.We got her 1,5 week ago, she’s 6 and had access to outdoors but didnt want to go out, so we figured she would be great as an apartment cat.I actually didnt wanna get a cat until after summer, but then my roommate found that some people were needing to rehome her, and she seemed like a great fit for us. And she had been so amazing!Half an hour after getting here, she was laying in my roomies bed and we were both so surprised! She loves being pet, she loves snuggles, she wants to have her belly pet while she purrs loudly, snd she rests her head or paws against us. She follows us around and she has been amazing with any guests we’ve had over.For the past week she’s been sleeping in my bed every night, and while my roomie is jealous I’m so happy even if I can’t lay in as comfortable positions vecause I dont want to disturb her.I’m so happy we picked up this cat, she is the cutest, sweetest, most loving cat in the world and we are soooo lucky to have her!. I’m from Europe, tipping is not really a thing. I work in a bar, and I have a tattoo on my arm just saying “feel real” (it’s just a nice quite from my favourite song)This lady came in, friday night it was quite busy, and she spotted it snd started asking me if I was feeling real, and saying more people should and lots of other stuff. I didn’t really have time to explain to her that it was a song title, so just agreed with her and then she tipped me ~20 dollars, while just buying two beers.I don’t know if there’s a better subreddit for this, but I’m trying to hang some stuff on my wall and getting super frustrated because nothing is working as all the diy guides said it should.I need to install two rawplugs, and for that I need to drill the holes.First of all, how do I figure out the size of the plug? It does not say on the plug and it does not say on the bag it came in. I have googled various phrases but nothing comes up to answer this very simple question. I get I should measure it, but how?I assumed it was ~5mm, because the screw says it’s 50 mm, but that might also be the length - idk.I tried drilling a Hole with the 5mm, but the plug does not fit in there. When I got further into the wall, it was as if the it started to not work properly, the drill was slipping and now the outside of the hole is bigger while inside there is a part that I can’t seem to get rid of.I will add a photo in the commentsAny and all advice is helpful, before I fuck up my wall even more. Hi! I know there is a megathread for this, but I guess I’m just looking for a bit of advice/feedback/whatever.I was diagnosed today, at 28 with ADD. I know this term is outdated in many areas (I’m in Europe) but I check out on the criteria for ADHD, just not the hyperactivity. I need some physical tests, then I get to start medication, which I’m looking forward to.It just feels weird to know. I’m doubting everything. I mean I went to get it checked because my sister and roomie both have ADHD and said they thought I might too, and I do think it makes sense, I struggle with quite a few things and it does check out.But at the same time I just kinda feel like a fraud? Like, if I’ve gone 28 years and I’m doing pretty alright, then why do I need a diagnosis? Am I really doing it just to have an excuse? Am I maybe just faking it? I mean, I do know that those things aren’t true, but I can’t help the feelings/thoughts popping into my head.Did anyone else feel like this? How did you deal with it?. Hey guys! I’m just looking for ideas to pass time on quiet shifts, as lately all the shifts I get have been the quieter ones such as day shifts or like now, a sunday night shift.I work at a small beerbar, so no cocktails. What I usually do is clean everything I can think off, and maybe sort stuff that needs it, and if I do have guests I’ll talk to them if they want to.But I’m getting so bored with just cleaning, I can’t keep finding things that need cleaning, especially since it’s a small bar. I’m just wondering if you guys have any ideas on how to pass the time? What do you get up to on quiet nights? I work alone and we don’t do cocktails. I had a new tattoo done yesterday, in a very specific style. I definitely don’t hate it, but I’m a little disappointed in how it came out - it was supposed to be a “glitter” tattoo, but I don’t see that effect at all, which I know is hard to achieve, but I looked at pictures of a similar style tattoo the artist had done, which looked great!However now they have posted my tattoo as well, and it’s super obvious to me that the picture is edited. Like the colours have been made much clearer/defined and I even think they’ve changed the shape a bit - and it also made it clear to me that the other tattoo I saw has been edited simillarly.I feel like I should say something, I’m not sure how or what though. But I honestly don’t think I’d had gotten the tattoo, if I knew this was how it’d turn out, it definitely does not have the effect IRL that it does on the edited picture, and I’m honestly just a bit annoyed with the situation.I’d post pics but I’m still wearing second-skin, and the colours have bled so much the tattoo itself can barely be seen, and also I don’t wanna “shame” them publicly by sharing their postWhat would you do?. I live with two good friends, A who I’ve lived with for five years, and knew before, and B, who we’ve lived with for three years and become good friends with too.A and I have been on the lease, and subletting a room to B.A lot has happened and I’ve become able to buy my own apartment - Which I have! It’s only two rooms, and I’m taking A with me. We get the keys on the 1st of february, and need to be out of our current apartment on 10th of March. I need help in how to tell B.She is abroad atm, she is from another country than us, and was supposed to be back friday, so we thought we could have a face to face talk.Now she has extended her stay, so we will have to tell her through the phone, which sucks. She wouldn’t be able to take over the apartment as it’s way too expensive and also there’s a lot of damages so even if she got some people to move in with her, it’d leave her with a bill that’s not hers to pay when moving out.So. I just need advice on how to tell her - How do I go about it the best way?. I mean, I sort my trash and I try to be as eco-friendly as possible. I don’t want nature to die. But I just don’t care to experience it.I don’t want to hike, I don’t want to be in a forest, I don’t want to see waterfalls and mountains and glaciers. I DEFINITELY do not want to sleep in a tent, or go campingEveryone I know talks about travelling to see the beautiful nature of different countries, and I honestly would rather stay home than go on such a trip. I love to travel to see big cities, art exhibitions and experience night life.I don’t get the hype about nature, I think it’s overrated. I have two rabbits, they’re 3,5 and I’ve had them for three years. They are free roam and live in my bedroom which is ~15 square meters.I live with two roommates who help me feed them when I’m away, and they also spend some time with them sometimes, but I feel bad because it’s not enough.They sleep for most of the day, or just lay around, and the same during most nights - they are definitely not very active.I have put carpets down on my whole floor and taken the legs off my bed too. They have a box for chilling and another one as a toilet/for hay.They have a box of sand for digging (though they don’t use it) and a large trixie tunnel. I give them sticks and chewthings often, but they’re still sitting around a lot.I really need advice on what to do to make them have more fun.I’ve bought leads for them but I can’t really take them out as there are many dogs around here and I have no car so I can’t really bring them somewhere. I read that swimming in the Lake in werewolf town would make him become a werewolf but it hasn’t happened yet despite trying twice. Is it vecause he needs to be older?. Hi guys, I hope this is the right place to ask for advice! I have (at the ripe old age of 27) never dyed my hair.I have wanted to, many many times, but never felt it was the right time and also feared I was too old.Now that I’ve decided to view age as a social construct, I’ve also decided to dye my hair pink. I have booked an appointment at a hairdresser who works with many colours, so I get the best possible result, I wouldn’t trust myself to do it.I’m very excited, although a bit nervous - I have naturally thick hair, shoulder length and semi-wavy. Because I have brown hair and would like a pastel pink, I need to have it bleached first, and I am slightly worried if it will “ruin” the texture - I NEVER use any sort of heat and no other products than shampoo, conditioner and some mousse some times.Now it’s become a long post, that was not my intention - I really just wanted any and all advice you may have.I’m hoping to do a sort of ombre so that my hair can grow out naturally without me having to dye it again. I’m BRAND new into aerials, did my second ever session yesterday but I am hooked like I’ve never been before with anything.I’ve created an insta page to post and keep myself motivated while also tracking my progress and I’d love love LOVE to connect with others who are doing this for fun, so would anyone here want to share an insta handle? I hope posts like this are allowed :). I’m BRAND new into aerials, did my second ever session yesterday but I am hooked like I’ve never been before with anything.I’ve created an insta page to post and keep myself motivated while also tracking my progress and I’d love love LOVE to connect with others who are doing this for fun, so would anyone here want to share an insta handle? I hope posts like this are allowed :). I just went to my very first trial class with a friend, and we’re both SO excited! It was so much fun, and we’re gonna sign up to go weekly.I’ve been lurking here a while, as I’ve wanted to try Pole in a long time - One of the things holding me back is the fact that I’m overweight and have absolutely no strength in my arms. I CAN’T do a push-up, not even on the knees, never were able to. I work at a bar and carry kegs around all the time, so I’m not weak in that way, but I just can’t seem to lift my bodyweight by the arms.Do any of you have any tips/guides/ideas on how to help this aspect?Obviously I wanna get better at that, but where do I even start?Our teacher today was super cool and friendly, and showed me how some grips didn’t even use her arms but other parts of her body to grip, and that did encourage me a bit.I’m not quite sure what advice I’m looking for, maybe I just kinda wanna talk to someone who’s been in a similar position or something maybe?. Maybe my mindset is just a product of a heternormative upbringing, but it seems so hard to change it.I’ve dated guys forever, never been more worried or nervous than that little “first-date-flutter.”But when it comes to women, even liking them on tinder seems like a big deal! Like, I see a cute woman and I’ll freeze up and be like: “She’s way to good for me.”But it’ll be basically all of them. Women are so goddamn gorgeous, it intimidates the hell out of me.And talking to them, like with romantic intention, it just feels so awkward like, I can’t quite figure out my position. Logically I know that I should act the same as I do with guys, we’re all just human, but my brain just gets stuck on “intimidated”-mode all the time, lol.Not sure what I’m looking for with this post, which I btw hope is okay to post here.I’d love to hear if someone else has had similar “troubles” or maybe even just some encouraging words haha. I try really hard to advocate for getting rid of the heteronormative standards, but I feel like a bad example when I personally treat men and women differently in a dating perspective. Is this sub mainly younger teenage boys, or what’s going on with all the negativity aka “You’re shit if you didn’t get Ghost E+ in two days!!” Idc if there are super many extra difficult custom maps, idc if you “started on Camelia expert+ and everything else felt boring”Can we just tune down the amount of comments that are just bragging, putting down the original game levels, putting down the difficulties, putting down people for not being as good as oneself. What’s the need? It’s no fun.. imo, anyways. Hi! I’m currently learning Spanish through duolingo and would love to practice conversation with someone else.I’m interested in a written, simple conversation in Spanish, only present tense for now.I’m offering either my native, Danish (which is probably not very relevant haha) or English, which I speak fluently. I’ll be happy to either write or speak in English.I’m 26 years old, studying at uni, and my interests include different movies and series, music, beer, hanging out with friends, learning new things and so on.Let me know if you want to talk! :). So, I’ve had my Quest and beatsaber for a little more than a month now. I recently moved up to playing expert+, and have been able to beat most of the maps.I’ve had sore arms before after playing, as I used to play 1-2 hours everyday, but during Christmas and New Years I’ve been super busy and not playing a lot.Three days ago I got back into it, moving on with expert+, and I got soooo excited by it that I’ve played for like two hours per day.I also finally beat my first Carmellia expert level! But yesterday, my arms were feeling kinda mushy. I tried to play a little anyways, but it was difficult.. Now my arms are even worse!I bet others have experienced the same thing, it’s probably even quite normal, but is there anything I can do to help it?I realize I might have to take a day off from it, but it’s really hard because... I just wanna plaaayAny advice is welcome!. I watched the first season years ago, before any of the other seasons were out. Now my roomie got me back into it, and I’ve reached season 3. Multiple times, I’ve had to stop for a breather; not because of the blood or the gore or any of that.But because of the absolute mental horror of it all - and just the sheer amount of deaths!Currently I’m at the point where Bertholdt has just transformed, leaving just the few guys we know by names alive. And right after this, which to me was devastating enough, the beast titan throws the rock that kills another great amount, as Levi watches their blood splatter in every direction.To me, the mass deaths of the scouts have been even worse than the deaths of the characters we know and love. After watching, I just feel hopeless and completely sick inside.I mean, I am still gonna continue watching and I do think the whole anime is a masterpiece just... Yikes, it hurts.My friend got it when it first came out, before that we were watching beatsaber videos together, both looking forward to trying it.Then she got it, and it was SO MUCH FUN! Even more than I had imagined!So of course I wanted one too, but as a student that’s just not something you can just go out and buy. So while I was trying to save for it, I’ve been watching videos and playing in my head lol.My birthday was yesterday but I had a small get together on friday for my best friends.I told them not to get me gifts, especially not something so expensive! But all of them chipped in, and got it for me.I really have the best friends in the world, and I’ll be thanking them by playing every day! :pI woke up with a hangover today, so I’ve been trying all the tricks to clear it so I could play, and only just finished an hour of the best fun! I also cleared my first expert :DAnyways, just wanted to share my excitement!. My dad died when I was 14.He lived a rough life, he was just around 60, had done drugs for most of his life and also had cancer.My brother and I grew up in a fosterfamily, but they got along very well with my parents and we spent a lot of time with our parents - Our mother passed away when I was 10.The last few months of my dad’s life must have been rough. We used to come around every other weekend to stay with him, but we’d asked not to spend the night anymore - After a few incidents that had us waking up in the middle of the night because he couldn’t breathe and then we had to call an ambulance, and then go home in the middle of the night, while our dad was rushed to the hospital. He was hurt by that, but I don’t remember much about it.What I do remember is the day he died.He was in the hospital, but he was in and out quite often, so I wasn’t too worried.My sister (fostersister, I guess) gave birth to a baby on friday. We went to see her on saturday, and I thought that while we were there I might as well go see my dad too.He was in a wheelchair, but he looked like he might be getting better.He suggested that I bring him to the other part of the hospital, to see the rest of the family, but I declined - and I don’t even recall why. I pushed his wheelchair to the elevator where we said goodbye, so he could save his strength to push himself back again.The next day, I received a call from his friend. He kept asking me to put my fostermom on the phone, but I refused because.. I guess I already knew why he was calling.I know he was sick, and I know he probably wouldn’t have gotten better. But I can’t help but wonder if I played a part.When your own daughter doesn’t even wanna come and stay over, and when she doesn’t wanna spend time with you or bring you to see the rest of her family.I wonder if he felt lonely, if he felt abandoned, and if that may have contributed to him dying at the time he did. And I wonder if I played a part. It should be several. It’s just way too massive for one president to handle properly. I’m sad to see all that’s happening with the corona virus, but at the same time I can’t help but think “what can even be done when there’s such a huge population”I know that there’s different states, handling things differently, but I honestly think America would be better of as different, smaller countries, with different leaders.I’m really pissed off at her, but wondering if I’m in the wrong. Sorry it’s so long.I work as bar manager, and have done so for three years. It’s a smaller bar, with 9 employees - The owner pays the bills while I do pretty much everything else, including assigning shifts.Usually we all meet up once every two months and then I say “monday x date?” and people ask to work, and it works out pretty well. Sometimes we have to talk a little back and forth but we always get it settled. An important detail is that everyone has signed a contact that they’ll work a minimum of 6 shifts per month (no one is full time.)During the corona-time we’ve been closed, obviously. I’m not in the US though, and we’ve been opened back up with safety measures for three weeks now.At first we didn’t expect to be busy, so we made a schedule and I made sure to tell everyone several times that we had to be flexible (they’ve had their normal wages paid throughout the lockdown, so I think it’s reasonable to expect them to be a bit more flex while we get back in the game.)Turns out we’ve been a LOT more busy than expected. That’s obviously great, but means we’ve had to call in extra people a lot, everyone has been good about it but especially two girls have been really helpful.Anyways, enter my roomie Maria, who also works at the bar. We’ve been living together for two and a half year, and are very good friends, and usually work hasn’t been an issue.However, she is doing her exams right now (as is many of the others, including the two girls who help out a lot.) She has not taken her 6 shifts this month.Next week we need two extra, so I asked her to choose which shift she wanted, as she has zero shifts.She kinda threw a fit, saying she can’t work because of her exams, and she should be excused.I’ve already had complaints from the two girls mentioned, that they think its unfair that she isn’t doing more, and I completely understand and agree with them.She does have ADHD, so it makes it a bit tricky, but I’ve told her she needs to make special arrangements with our boss if she needs to have different arrangements at work than the others. She refuses to do this.Now she has said that she will work, but we got in a big fight and she said if she’d known she’d have to work, she would have chosen a different time, and that she “doesn’t want to spend all her free time working.”Now, I can understand the first part of that sentiment, and I feel kinda bad about that, also offered to switch around some things so that she could work another day during the week (but no matter what she will definitely have to work one day next week. Our shifts are 6 hours.)Am in the wrong for making her work through her exam? She did tell me she would prefer not to have any shifts this week, but it just doesn’t seem possible at this point, and I’m honestly a bit pissed off that she thinks working 6 times 6 hours a month is “working all of her free time.”.
    I apologize if this post seems confusing, but my ex-girlfriend left me in a terrible manner after 3.5 years, and it’s been 9 months since. Since my ex, I’ve started seeing a woman I genuinely like, but my bipolar disorder has become tumultuous again after just 2 weeks.Once more, I found myself contemplating suicide after just 1.5 weeks due to the chaos in my mind and the desperate need for peace. I immediately reached out to my care team to avoid any impulsive actions and managed to secure an emergency appointment for the following day. I’ve now started a new medication to help calm my racing thoughts and bring some stillness to my mind.Tonight, I was with this new woman, but it seemed like the medication wasn’t enough. I messaged my friends with a fake SOS to create an opportunity to escape, as my mind was spiraling negatively. Now, I’m overwhelmed with self-doubt, questioning if bipolar disorder is entirely controlling my life. I wonder if I’m just relying on defense mechanisms or if it’s time to take responsibility and act like an adult.Has anyone else experienced a similar situation, and if so, do you have any advice for dealing with it?. Hi, everybody.I often find myself thinking about my bipolar at random times and questioning myself all the time, every action, interaction with people when I’m in that state of mind. When I’m in that period, I usually think about whether I’ll lose this battle with my bipolar at some point and when that might happen. Usually, I can shrug it off, but with each episode, it becomes more intense. The ‘demon’ inside me whispers in the back of my head, ‘it’s only a matter of time.’ Does anyone else also struggle with this?.
    So I attend community college and had a sticky sock vocation in the summer which landed me a med change. I feel a lot better but I have been nervous on my new script because it’s new. So yesterday we took our mid terms. When I walked in class my classmate asked if I saw the pdf for study questions pertaining to the mid term. I said no and saw it was posted Friday morning. This is frustrating because we went over the exam last week. New info the day before the exam. This always gets me going because can’t adapt that fast sometimes. Then class starts, after the exam and everybody’s computer has the circle of death on it. The teacher proceeded to start lecture and it’s follow along with the commands for civil Cad. A few speak up so he pauses. Then restarts with commands the stops to see if everyone is one board. He walks to every desk so I wait. I’ve restarted my pc opened things back up take a restroom break to cool off and let the computer warm up and after he gets to the girl next to me I figured I’m next. He goes to his desk. I raise my hand because I’m stuck moving a file. I raise my hand and he says I’ll be there shortly. I said I don’t think so. He continues on. I pack my things and leave before making a big ass of myself. Now I’m playing multiple scenarios and ruminating. Do I play the Im disabled and need special attention. He already told a story of a frustrated coworker to me and wrote the persons actions off to bipolar. Sorry for the dump but I’ve been trying to repaint reminants of charred bridges and I don’t want this one to fall into another explosion. Sucks being me some days lol. So should I write him. The dean. Or the Ada. This is a Little tough because my body feels something from being me plus I have a cold. I new it would be a tough semester since I’m just getting going again.I have bp1 and ptsd and I have been changing my meds. I’m not stable at all. I have been feeling like I’m being watched and provoked by the devil. I hate this illness. I have been stable for 6 years but was not living a happy life. I changed meds and now have some psychosis going on. I need some prayers and help. 2 days till my birthday and I want so bad to spend it with my family. I’m hardheaded. I haven’t slept for 5 days and keep having flashbacks. Like I’m on high alert. For some reason the devil wants me dead and wants to possess me. I’m having a hard time. I changed med, quit weed and cigerettes about 2 weeks ago. I feel fine that I’m clean but my body won’t let me sleep. Like I’m living in a dream. Prayers and advise are highly appreciated. I love you all. Thanks 🙏. Today is the day that marks 14 years of marriage to my wife. I no longer have my old friends but I have acquired some new ones as my interests have changed. My wife has been with me for 20 years now. We met in the basement of church. It was AA. I was 2 years sober when we met. She helped me clean up my life and supports me as a friend would. She stuck with me through 2 psychosis episodes that landed me in the hospital. All while she was nurturing our little man. Just a shout out that I’m still in love with her. Taking in the good memories today.I’m doing well on the outside but the inner Turmoil and dialog makes me really irritable. I’m bp1 with adhd symptoms. The research I’ve done looks like a sensitivity issue. Like I’m a highly sensitive person. I don’t know much on adhd so I’m seeing if anyone else can relate. I have ptsd and can be startled easy or blow up. I have constant racing thoughts and any situation that is not to my liking will cause days of rumination. I’ve kind of been a hermit because I have a hard time being outgoing and my social skills are a little bad. Others things I’ve read on is the limbic system and I feel like I’m constantly in fight or flight mode. I’d like to be a little better spoken but I feel my voice hasn’t been herd in so many years. I have a hard time with what I consider challenging people. I guess I’m a sensitive person driven by feelings most of the time.I have a constant anxiety problem and tons of racing thoughts. Woke up this morning after seeing my dad on Sunday and I’m triggered. My brain was going haywire. It’s been constant for years. I cant smoke enough weed to combat it. I’ve been having constant chest pains and think I just live in misery. I get done what I need to but this inner dialog is driving me crazy. Any advise?. So I’m bp1 and some people at my work know. I am trying for a promotion and have some others applying for the position also. I was reading my resume and it had a spot for disabilities. My question is should I say I’m bipolar on the disability part so h.r. knows or keep it to my self. I’m not sure if it will give me special treatment to get the job but I would like to keep it to myself. Any advise is appreciated. I see we are even scared to tell loved ones or romantic partners about being bipolar so how do I handle work with it? Been there for 26yrs now and have had some episodes so it’s not a big local secret just not sure if corporate should know.I made the deans list this semester. I’m 46bp1 on meds. I thank lithium prolixin and a lot of doctors. Lol. It’s been going well for me I’m half way through college. I have a 9yo son that I try to inspire. He has some adhd but made the honor roll this quarter. My wife keeps him on a strict fengold diet and it seems to work. I have been eating better myself and trying to keep a sleep schedule. Last night I had 4 hrs but it’s usually once a week. I’ve applied for a new position in the engineering field at my company. Just want to give myself a shout out and thanks for everyone’s support.I’m into the new year and it’s starting like last year. I want to quit smoking cigs and thc but it’s my only escape from reality. I’m a lot better than a few years ago after being diagnosed bp1 it was like the first time my life and reality lined up buts it’s not sustainable. Today I’m reading about the Kaisen way of doing little baby steps to develope a new habit. I guess being on meds and a adrenaline junkie I have a hard time finding excitement. Lately it’s just been from my actions. Anyone with advise. My meds suck out my dopamine.So I have chest pain like a burning sensation or torn muscle in my sternum area about a inch off center when the pain is up I’m in a bad mood. I’ve been too the drs so heart and lungs are ruled out. When I eat sometimes it burns. I wake up in the middle of the night and cannot move like something is going to tear. Today I see a pain mgmt dr. And I’m not looking for painkillers. Little nervous. I take like 10 pills a day. Anyway 46yo bp1. I think it may have to do with the Vegas nerve. Sorry if misspelled. Or be a digestive issue. I had a endoscopy a few years go and had inflammation in the esophagus. Anyone else with similar problem. I was just looking at other options. Maybe dietitian or specialist. The pain causes anxiety 😟. I seem to have lost some confidence with making decisions. I lean on my wife and others just to make sure I’m not doing anything irrational. How have others built confidence and make sure it’s not another manic episode. I don’t realize till its too late and get nervous especially if it’s knee jerk one.Thanks for advise. I’m treating my bipolar 1 but haven’t gotten up to par since I was diagnosed 7 years ago 46m. I have been diagnosed with ptsd and think I have adhd and ocd. I just started ptsd therapy yesterday and I hope it covers the other ailments. I was diagnosed bp when I was 20 but never had psychosis till 38 and a lot of stress. New born new house and bp. I take lithium and fluphenizine ( maybe proxilin) Life is well but not great. I have tons of racing thoughts and been having flashbacks. Now it’s the holidays and allergies been bad to. Probley just venting but what kind of dr helps with all this I see a nurse practitioner and he don’t change anything I haven’ had psychosis in 5 years with these meds and there better than what I was taking. But I want to be a little less on edge. I guess has anyone tried this cocktail or some advise on keeping going. I’ve been on this and lithium for about 4 years. I don’t feel great or even good some days. I was wondering if anyone has tried this mix before. I keep reading that there may be some alternatives. I go through some mania when provoked it seems like once a year. I’m doing well and haven’t been to the physic ward since on this combo but I usually need a week off from work for recovery from episodes.I’m bp1 and have been having flashbacks for a while. I loose focus from these thoughts. I was looking into emdr and discover something called brain spotting that may help. Anyone have any info or other suggestion would be appreciated, thanks.I have been on this network for about a month now and I appreciate the chance to share and read post. I’ve learned more in that amount of time than the doctors have advised in 26 years. Im on lithium and flufetizine and haven’t felt good since mania 4 years ago. I haven’t felt excitement in a while. Does anyone else take this combo and how did it make you feel. I hear good things about lutuda but know nothing about it. My pill doc is a nurse practitioner and I may need to see a doc to change meds. I still have some angry outburst about 1 time a year that is ugly, Uncontrollable rage that I black out from. Thanks for feedback and taking the time to read this. This a tough illness that’s hard to accept it doesn’t go away.
    I'd like to connect with people here who've struggled through bipolar and made it through med school. I'm in my second year of med school and have been recently diagnosed. With the fast paced nature of med school and the need for consistent work, I've had an extremely difficult time. I'm still passing but often find myself hitting a wall and often just trying to survive not even being able to get out of bed at times despite being on meds. Alongside that, I'm in a relationship and while my partner is extremely supportive I find myself often not being able to give her time. I'd like to hear stories from anyone here who made it through such a challenging environment and graduated med school on time. Because often at times, I'm just dejected at the lack of stability in my life and feel like it's never going to get better.Hey guys, I'm an international student looking to apply in HKU, CUHK & CityU for a LLB degree. I want to go into corporate law later on in my career and wished to know how difficult would it be as an international with pretty much no knowledge of Cantonese or mandarin to practice & study law here?. Hey guys, I'm an international student looking to apply in HKU, CUHK & CityU for a LLB degree. I want to go into corporate law later on in my career and wished to know how difficult would it be as an international with pretty much no knowledge of Cantonese or mandarin to practice & study law here?. Can anyone here let me know how I'm supposed to apply for advanced standing? There doesn't seem to be an option in the initial application.Hey guys, are there any International A level student here who've recieved a fullride or full tution scholarship at NTU (nanyang, cn yang, college) scholarship? I understand that the main criteria for Singaporean applicants is their A level grades but how much does this differ for international applicants? It would mean a lot to me if someone here could help me out.Hey guys, I'm a prospective international A level student looking to study at Hong Kong. I'm trying to find fellow internationals currently studying at CUHK to know more about about scholarship offers, the environment there and so on. It would be really nice if any of you people could help out.Can an a level kid currently at cuhk let me know what conditional offers did they recieve for a scholarship at cuhk?. I'm sorry for the irrelevant question in this sub but I've been scouring the internet trying to find a level kids who got scholarship offers from cuhk. Unfortunately I've so far been unsuccessful and need to know what scholarship offers if any does CUHK make for its international a level applicants?. Hi guys I have 8 A stars in 8 subjects in O levels. 4 A stars in 4 subjects in A levels and a first place national 'best across 4 A levels' distinction. I will be applying for CUHK this year and am coming out of a gap year that I took because of Covid complications. I belong to Pakistan and am relatively poor so can not afford the living costs in Hong Kong or the university fees. There are plenty of scholarship opportunities listed on the website but they didn't mention the exact requirements. I'll be applying for biomedical engineering.Hey guys. I'm an international student who appeared for his final A level exams in October November 2020 and took a gap year and will be applying for fall 2022. I have straight a stars in my OA levels and a first place distinction in my a levels. I'm also applying to other lower ranked international universities as a safety in case NTU doesn't work out but I'm just concerned how much the gap year will effect my NTU application. Can anyone here who took a gap year and got in give me some insight into what I can expect?. Hey guys. This will sound like an odd question. I've talked to students offered scholarships from HKU and these are the conditional entrance scholarship requirements that HKU provided for non local A level students in 2021.4A stars= 100 percent, 5A stars= 100 percent + accommodation, 5 A stars + 1 distinction= 100 percent + accommodation & a stipend. I have already given my A level exams currently on a gap year and will be applying for fall 2022. Currently my A level grades are 4 A stars and a distinction. If I apply on the basis of my A level grades and choose to appear for an additional subject for the May/June 2022 series, will HKU be willing to upgrade the scholarship offer they might make me?. Hey guys. I recently graduated high school and gave my international A level high school exams for physics chemistry maths and biology and have performed exceptionally well in all these subjects and am applying to universities abroad. I'm currently in a conundrum. Everyone I have reached out to for carreer related advice has asked me to major in something I'm actually passionate about. However considering my financial background alongside the costs and time that an international education requires, financial stability is key for me. I've been applying for some fairly applied maths and maths heavy programs like engineering and comp sci purely for the job opportunities these may provide later in the future. I'm not very comfortable with maths or purely analytical fields although academically I've done fairly well in it. I'm a hard working kid and am willing to put in the time and effort to hone my skills and so on. Is it then a bad idea to choose majors that can allow for financial independence early on although I might not be as comfortable with them?. Hey guys, I made a post asking for Nanyang scholarship recipients earlier and it was poorly worded. I am trying to understand whether it will be worth applying to NTU as I do not have the finances to be able to fund my education as a international student currently on a gap year coming from a lower middle income household. I have 8 A stars in O levels, 4 A stars in A levels and a first place best across 4 national distinction in A levels. I however given my circumstances have not participated in any international or national Olympiads and so do not have any outstanding extra curriculars. Could any recipient here let me know what the criterias are or whether I have a shot at the scholarship.Hey guys, I'll an international student looking to apply to NTU for fall 2022. BioEng does interest me quite a lot but I'm very skeptical of the carreer options a niche field like BE may provide. Could anyone here currently majoring in the field give me a good heads up?. Hey guys. I'm a high school student from a third world country currently on a gap year applying to international universities. I would like to inquire if opting for a somewhat niche field like BME would be a wise idea as I come from a low middle income background and studying abroad would be a significant investment of time and money.Are there any recipients of the Nanyang scholarship here? I'm an international student currently on a gap year applying for fall 2022 and would like to know more about the scholarship scheme.Hey guys for context here, I'm an international student and I'm going to apply for Lehigh University in Early Decision. Unfortunately I could not apply last year because Covid ended up affecting the international A level exam series I was appearing in. I ended up taking a gap year because of that and was able to score extremely well in those exams (first place in the country). I do have decent ecas but nothing that particularly charts as high as my academic achievements and certainly not anything that could've won me any national prizes. How badly will the gap year coupled with the request for financial aid affect my application? There wasn't much I could've done about it on my end.I don't know who else to talk to about this so I decided to post here. I've hit rock bottom academically. I've been a good student. A great one actually. I've managed to score national distinctions in exams I've appeared in before. But I've destroyed everything I've worked for uptil now. I'm too tired, too exhausted, too mentally drained to work anymore or achieve or accomplish what those around me expect from me. These expectations eat me alive now. I'm already on a gap year because of covid and might have to take another one and it's so so hard to deal with the fact that everyone's lives are moving forward in universities and despite doing so well academically, I'm still not in a university. It's so hard to see myself like this.Are there any belt & road recipients here who could guide me on whether or not I have a shot at the scholarship?. I will be applying for HKU early in October or November this year and am coming out of a gap year that I took because of Covid complications. I belong to Pakistan and am relatively poor so can not afford the living costs in Hong Kong or the university fees. There are plenty of scholarship opportunities listed on the website but they didn't mention the exact requirements. I'll be applying for biomedical engineering.Exams are almost onto me and I've gotten myself stuck into this wierd fucking rut. I haven't studied crap for the past week or so. Literally do nothing all day.Any idea how I can combat this? Why does this happen so much and how to work around this? Do I just have weak lower back muscles? Does this happen to anyone else here.So I've been trying to wake up early at 5 or 6 am to study since I have exams coming up. I go to sleep at around 10 or 11 pm and when I do wake up it's just really cold outside of the sheets so I just go back to sleep waking up at 8 or 9. Any tips or suggestions?. I don't know what's up. I just woke up really down. My hearts sinking down and I'm really unmotivated. I really really need to work and all I feel like doing is lying down and bingewtach youtube. I don't know whats up. I just woke up like this today.MY LOWER BACK ALWAYS HURT WHEN I STUDY OR AN HOUR OR TWO. How do you guys even study for long hours? I walk around after every half hour but it's always fucking hurting god damn.Hi peeps. It's currently 4 19 am and I just completed season 1 of money heist. I'm currently in my final year of high school. (A levels) and my exams come up in May. I desperately need good grades. Straight A stars are a necessity . I have straight A stars at Gsce and AABC in AS. Im giving retakes for the B and C. I'm trying to sort myself out. Get my life into order but I can't discipline myself. I've tried everything. I watch a lot of these study you tubers and how productive they are and how unproductive I am depresses me. I can't stick consistently to routines and can barely get 3-4 hours of study in a day. I know how to study. I take breaks in between and everything. I just seriously lack discipline. I'll have one good day where I'll study and then the next day like right now I'll be up at 4 am watching some show and barely getting any sleep because I cant even control myself. I'm just feeling extremely shitty about myself right now. I don't even know why I'm posting this,i just need to vent. Thank you for listening.
    Does anyone have any experience or advice for extended travelling with bipolar? I really want to go travelling for 3-6 months, I attempted it this year booking a one way ticket to Nepal, but after a month I could feel a mania brewing and quickly booked a flight home. I'm basically terrified of entering mania in a country less enlightened about bipolar and being committed. Anyone got any good travelling tips?. I am thinking about going on lamotrigine because my depression is just insane ATM.Please give me any advice or experiences you have about lamotrigine, is it worth it, does it work? How much does it change your personality and energy levels? Do you need many blood tests etc, thank you so much in advance I have been unmedicated for a year and a half and it's been good but I've been having psychosis, suicidal impulses and deep depression again so I need to sort it. It's all deffo triggered by life events, had a family member die and now worried af about family in Israel. I am basically not functioning at all at the moment and I realise I need help, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 with psychotic features a few years ago and I have been on quetiapine (hated it) and lithium (really helped but fucked my organs) and I can't go on antidepressants because they make me manic. I am a creative so need to retain creativity, does lamotrigine affect that? Thank you so much in advance and big love to everyone out there with this illness it is a bloody nightmare.
    I’ll try to keep this brief, I’ll elaborate if there’s interestCurrently seeing psychThey recommended restarting talk therapyFinally got an appointment scheduledOnly to be told due to substance use there was “no point” in continuing talk therapyWhile my substance abuse I would personally classify as a pressing issue and definitely in need of addressing (I am also on meds to reduce cravings), but not to such an extent that I’m incapable of benefiting from therapyI feel like this isn’t right? Am I wrong?Also just find it funny my health care provider system is perfectly fine with giving me medication but I could possibly be not applicable for talk therapyAny help greatly appreciated thank you. Was ich Liebe - Rammstein. I will always be brokenLess than wholeBut eventually being tiresome runs outLittle energy will become no energyAs is the law of the universeI’m tired of waking up 4 times a night drenched in sweat sopping through every sheet, every article of clothing and every carefully layered towelI’m tired of gripping a steering wheel my head spinning the odometer reading 120kphI’m tired of sobbing over everything and nothingI’m tired of the cycles with no reliefI’m tired of the appointments and expensive bottlesI’m tired of my shitty ideas going no whereI’m tired of my good ideas going unheardI’m tired of the lack of friendsI’m tired of the misunderstandingsI’m tired of feeling lonelyI’m tired of feeling crowdedI’m tired of the ‘use and disuse’I’m tired of screaming into the voidI’m tired of not knowing what’s in the voidI’m not so tired of my toes wriggling just over the edge. Max doses of venlafaxine and bupropionNot sure exactly what timeline I’m aiming forVenlafaxine (Effexor) if you don’t know is a 101 pains to forget taking dose of so we’ll see how this goes You should always consult your physician/pharmacist but I feel my resources are rotted drywall that’s been slowly crumbling I’ll keep them updated but I’m done waiting for them. I just wanted to throw this out there as a debate and see everyone's thoughts, support, and of course dataFirst, let's try to initially ignore the costs of transforming whole manufacturing processes&#x200B;I have seen arguments that make sense: switching to glass would mean heavier bottles and therefore more fuel spent to ship the product -- However, I think this issue will resolve as our vehicle fleets convert to electric, as well as producing more goods locally and closer to retailers.&#x200B;One quora answer I saw seemed a bit alarmist in the potential damage to people/property as well as increased breakage costs for retailers While I can assume there'd be a negligible rise in glass cuts/injuries, and if there does appear to a drastic increase in these events I'm sure safer glass will be developed at scale such as tempered glass in automobiles The breakage issue does seem unavoidableAs of now there is not a huge market for glass recycling, it is my understanding that it is more economically feasible for companies to produce/purchase virgin glass rather than recycledThere is also first and foremost the eventual necessity of eliminating all single use items -- I figured at a grocery store you'd come with your jars/containers fill them up at I guess a slurpee machine/soda fountain type thing where you pour into a bottle and it is sold by weight/volume of course this is going to be seen as inconvenient by all and I'm sure by some as "woke"&#x200B;Should glass bottles remain single use and our waste management systems stay flawed what kind of changes in pollution would we see? I know glass breaks down incredibly slow, but how fast is sharpness of a broken glass worn down? Would this contribute to an increase in wildlife injuries? Instead of having floating plastic debris could we have a build-up of glass debris in the ocean depths or elsewhere?&#x200B;Any other pros / cons of switching to glass?. If I have to fill out one more safety plan I will lose it.Any time I meet with a different therapist, receptionist, intake specialist and they ask about symptoms and I report suicidal ideation (even though 90% of the time I’m at the most a medium risk level for an attempt) we have to drop everything that was going to be worked on/said/askedNow we have to do the same filling out of the same form with the same names and the same coping strategies and the same phone numbers to keep and all thatI understand they’re doing their jobs, even though-maybe it’s cynical-this part of the job is probably mostly to keep them from getting suedEither way I just feel like at this point the 15 or so minutes of my 30 minutes I get maybe once a month for mental healthcare is just wasted on this bull crap Not to mention I lose my health insurance in less than 5 months so I am on the fucking clock right nowAt one point I told a former therapist I was close to just lying about or reporting reduced severity of symptoms just to save timeThey always start talking about the safety plan the same way too: “I know you’ve probably already done this…”I’m not knocking Safety plans they are a good resource especially if you share them with your support team but filling them out over and over and over again and wasting time is only hurtful for everyone involved If I could summarize in three words: Fuck Kaiser Permanente. I don't know if I am on some spectrum I am unaware of, or if I am simply grappling with the prospect of reduced memory, concentration, etc. Either way I am getting very tired.&#x200B;I am so tired of people that simply say, you should know what's wrong, or you don't understand the issue, or otherwise continue to beat around the bush.&#x200B;Am I autistic? Do I have aspergers? I don't know. But I don't see why having that diagnosis or not prevents so much clarity on what I have done that's perceived to be wrong. It's not a new problem. I've always struggled to fully grasp details and requirements of more intricate social norms, mostly because I overthink everything...&#x200B;Either way, I'm tired of being written off as inadequate because I take a few more times, and maybe a very direct explanation once or twice to get it through my thick unassuming skull&#x200B;It's a problem I need to fix but I shouldn't be cast out for it either. \[with some weak googling this mostly gets results of more intricate bodily reactions e.g. inflammation\]&#x200B;My question is:&#x200B;After strenuous exercise to the point of drastically increasing your breathing rate...If you were to breathe supplemental oxygen (i.e. O2 gas canister) during this increased breathing rateWould your breathing slow quicker while breathing the O2 or would it recover normally regardless of the O2?&#x200B;Side question: If the O2 does not change the recovery of breathing rate would this mean that rapid breathing (obviously has to do with supplying cells with oxygen) but could continued rapid breathing be some sort of stress response? Despite adequate oxygen saturation?. It was supposed to refine my social skillsIt was supposed to get me to work as part of a cohesive goalIt was supposed to be my stability and purpose to shield school from mood wobblesIt was supposed to test my judgmentIt was supposed to be fun, at least sometimesIt was supposed to be somewhere others were actually like meI was going to meet new people - maybe make friendsI was going to develop new skillsI had hopes and worries and plans and questionsIt wasn't supposed to be easy&#x200B;And I fucking failed miserably&#x200B;Take it as a lesson I suppose -- be glad for whatever help I did give -- be sorry for whatever I damagedFuck meI didn't expect to lose out on this amazing opportunity -- but I guess I didI also didn't think how much losing this would affect meIs it embarrassing to tell my partner why I'm crying?. I have always felt I dream often, though I'm not much of an active dreamer (i.e. lucid dreamer) but when I drink a fair amount and am on my meds I find myself experiencing weird dreams. The dreams are weird because they can be grounded in total fantasy, mixed nonfiction and reality, and just plain old reality-like dreams. All of them feel so much real-er than other dreams.&#x200B;The total fantasy ones can be interesting, the total reality ones can be maddening because they seem so real that I wake up go on with life and can sometimes struggle to recall if one event was a dream or not. I've had reality dreams about just getting ready for school, then wake up, not ready for school&#x200B;One of the most terrifyingly mixed reality dreams I had very recently was just plain uncomfortable, even more than a day after waking up. It basically surrounded myself on a river trip in Mexico, though the river specifically ran through Mexico City (which is not true in reality) On it we all went back and forth between rafts and just swimming. However we were warned that there was a jellyfish (yeah uh Idk) that once it stung you could implant some sort of 'polyp'? (maybe my brain was sifting around in jellyfish biology) Once stung, which I was, a sort of flesh like branching growth formed around my wrist. These growths/lesions needed to literally be pulled from my own body, while not painful I could feel each little ridge in the polyp's "roots" was each was pulled out of me, a deeply unsettling feeling. Then I learned my ankle was also stung but was 'too late' I guess because right before I woke up the doc said "well as long as it hasn't calcified ....... uh oh it's too late" I looked down and saw my foot engrossed with deep almost seaweed like green swelling patches overtaking my foot..... then I woke up, probably writhing about but don't really remember&#x200B;so fun...I mean all humans can be stinky but for those of us who struggle with keeping our rooms clean and caring for ourselves we may have a more \*pungent\* odor and I am very much in that category myself&#x200B;I was looking for a natural deodorant, and I found one mixing vodka (or other clear liquors e.g. gin) and vinegar at 1:1 but you can tweak that ratio however you like to further increase the deodorizing capability. Don't worry the vinegar smell does not last long, also helps if you let your armpits dry a bit I’ve found it works pretty darn well, and probably would work better if I showered more and used the deodorant spray more often. **This is of course is not a replacement for self-care and hygiene**. The benefits of using this instead of deodorants with 'stuff' like sticks and gels is I feel the 'stuff' doesn't build up, although the vinegar and alcohol kills bacteria and in theory that could also build up? Not entirely sure.&#x200B;You can also make an air/fabric deodorizer with vinegar at a 2:1 ratio with water and just a bit of rubbing alcohol if you like. This one works well too and I have cats. You can spray this just about anywhere just be careful the floor is not too wet and beware of stains, but I haven't had any problems with that. You can swap the rubbing alcohol for ethanol (e.g. vodka) if you're concerned about that ingredient.&#x200B;Also obviously should be stated: **do not use ethanol alcohol if you struggle with alcohol addiction**. But, you may need a new underarm deodorant recipe because ethanol cannot be swapped for rubbing alcohol because it should not be sprayed directly on the skin. I cannot stand any longer the phrase “but your mental health is more important”I cannot care how true it might beI cannot fathom what the phrase means to someone who is mentally “well”But if someone says it to me one more time I might explodeI cannot accept itI say:I cannot afford tuition on my own.I cannot afford the pricey medications.I do not know how I’ll pay for therapy once I am no longer accepted under my parents’ health plansI do not know if I can just drop out of school or work or focus on one more than the other. I must work full time at bothAnd they will always say:Don’t worry! Your mental health is what is most importantWell what good would my superb mental health be (assuming I can even achieve it by neglecting the shirking of my other VERY important duties) what good is that mental health if I am either jobless, education-less, moneyless, timeless, or all of the above in this exceptionally cruel capitalistic world vying for my very destruction. She went missing just before HalloweenNow I’m going back and forth between anxiety, deep deep depression, guilt, anger at myselfI’ve been drinking a lot to try and cope (nothing new for me)I keep having dreams about her where I see her and I just hold her and cry, but then I wake up and she’s nowhere aroundI just want to jump off a high building (again nothing new for me)But I just didn’t need this Life was already shitty enough what more does it need to take from me?I’ve gotten so anxious and depressed I don’t even want to go door to door looking for herI’ve walked around the neighborhood whistling here and there (she’d come running up to me when I whistled)Just the thought of asking people if they’ve seen her at all makes me tear upAnd then the fact I can’t do it makes me feel like a bad ownerI’m fortunate enough some of my support network (family and gf) have helped post stuff online about her and that makes me feel grateful and guiltyMy academics are deteriorating, work is a piece of shit, home is messy and I just want my cat back. I'd like to post a short story I've been working on for awhile from my experience of being placed on a voluntary psychiatric holdI'd really just like some feedback on the story itself your own experiences with this sort of thing are gladly welcome and any sort of next steps to spread this message, if known, is greatly appreciatedWhich to this day I still believe I was relatively coerced into \--------------5150**Chapter 1: 72 Hours****I: First Arrival**“Hi. Um, my psychiatrist recommended that I get an evaluation.”With no idea the weight that phrase carried, I muttered it anyways to the front desk nurse of an emergency room while my mother was convinced I left to Walmart. I mean this could all be done and over with in under an hour right?Shit, I didn’t even know what an *evaluation* was.My psychiatrist told me to do this. She said it was necessary. She emailed me this direction. Because I emailed her what I thought my symptoms were. We emailed because Kaiser’s health care only let me see a psychiatrist once every three months at most.They took my vitals and escorted me to a patient’s room. Being the anxiety stricken, overly analytical person I was--still am--I assaulted the room with my senses. It had that general antiseptic, borderline clean, emergency room smell. I noticed the television was surrounded in a clear plastic case, which I thought. Odd. And unlike most of the rooms I passed by.Almost as soon as they got me in there they asked me to change into their ugly, scratchy gown and deposit my possessions in a locked, repurposed trash bin, which was possibly, also unusual. How would I know? This was the first time I was ever in an emergency room on my own. So maybe they just wanted to make sure my belongings were safe?After that they quickly dismantled just about every machine, wire, or piece of equipment, and moved it out of the room. Why? Crowded? Was it needed elsewhere?Slowly humming to myself I tried to cope with what was happening. This part had happened quickly, but they seemed to forget about me soon enough.I later realized a security guard standing outside my sliding glass door keeping an eye on my room. And quite possibly only my room. This too seemed strange. Maybe that was just where they stood all the time?Because I tried to forget about them soon enough, I thought nothing of it. Until they asked me to provide a urine sample and had the guard follow me to the bathroom and I was not permitted to lock the door. I complied. No matter how odd this seemed. Provided my sample, which can either be the easiest thing or the hardest thing for someone with a penis. Having the urine splash and spray thus having to thoroughly wash my hands. Was that not allowed either? I don’t know, nothing was said.After that I sat on my bed. Staring at the silent television since the volume cable had been removed. For whatever reason.Once some internal pressure had built up, I called my mother and came clean, as if I had something to be ashamed of. Mostly I was just scared. Scared of whatever might come next for me here in this white room; she told me she’d be right there. I waited a little longer and she proceeded to wait with me.As more time passed a nurse came in to explain my *rights*.“Rights?” I thought, “I’m in a hospital not the back of a squad car.”He simply stated that I was being voluntarily placed on a 72-hour hold and would lose all of my rights for that time being unless the doctors there believe I should be held longer. To me this just was explained as a sort of “summer camp” where you go to get better, however forcibly, which sounded like something I might need. Something I was apparently told I need. I thought I could keep in contact with my girlfriend and work on some homework so I could try and clutch my academic career just before finals.During the time of the actual 72 hours I was to be evaluated by a psychiatrist, given a diagnosis, and a better prescription or lifestyle change advice. Something. Anything to make me well.Later a doctor did come along and she said that I was explaining psychotic symptoms, thus, she too recommended I be placed for an evaluation. Psychotic symptoms? Sure I *thought* I was seeing things in the corners of my eyes and could be gripped with anxiety or skepticism. But I felt like I was mostly functionable. Sure I often contemplated that any passerby on the street beside me could be waiting to attack me. But, I didn’t march with a loaded, safety-off, handgun in my waistband. I just *thought* a *lot*.That rang in my ears though, two doctors, and supposedly *brilliant* people, deemed me a danger to society and/or myself. Well what if they’re right? What if I’m not thinking clearly? What if I’m not even seeing things clearly? What if I’m this detached? This removed?I think that you could say they performed some unintentional gaslighting.My mother and I sat there for a couple more hours, we ate McDonalds she left briefly to procure, and we waited. Eventually two EMTs arrived with a gurney, which they told me to hop onto.What the fuck was happening?What the fuck was I doing?I said my goodbyes to my mother; she said she’d visit tomorrow.I got to the hospital with a psychiatric ward. Incidentally not the one I had checked into even though. So, even though I was with Kaiser they had no hospitals with a psych ward and thus could not accept me. They could not guarantee any of the *evaluation* would be even remotely covered financially by whatever insurance I did have. Which was Kaiser.This so far seemed typical from my experiences with them.The system. Being swept, pushed, tricked, volunteered; I’d gone between what I wanted to call it. But, whatever you want to call it or I choose to call it. Doesn’t seem to change how I got there. And it definitely doesn’t change what happened once I got there. I used to just concern myself with why I went there. Which today I’m still not entirely sure I can agree with myself on that.But, there was so much that could have gone better. So much that needs to go betterSo much of it would leave me with all kinds of scars I personally consider a traumatic experience that still follows me to this day.The kind of scar, that stress, that creeps up on me day in and out. Pushing in and asking me, nagging me. Why did I go? Why did someone think *that* was what *I* needed?The kind of scar, that disgust, that fills up in me. That I escaped while others, possibly, no, definitely, even more ill-equipped than I, are stuck there. Quite possibly, indefinitely.The kind of scar, that disorder, that makes me push my nails into my palms at the doctor’s office and the kind that makes me ~~cry~~ sob on my current girlfriend’s shoulder begging her to not send me back to that kind of place.Ever again.I still have nightmares about being there. They creep up on me while asleep and awake.I will do whatever I can to escape those moments and hopefully never see them again.**II: Second Arrival**My clothes, phone, wallet, everything was seized and I was not allowed to access any of it.We arrived at St. Joseph's Hospital in Orange. The nearest hospital with a psych ward. Which basically just meant a high walled picnic area and a prison style door where you had to be buzzed in or out. With dingy, borderline motel-like rooms with two beds to a room, no doors, and no other furniture.To the best of my recollection it was after midnight I think. So, it took awhile for someone to get the door open.The two EMTs escorting me were plenty kind enough. One even briefly shared his own suicide attempt that allegedly landed him in a 72 hour hold as well.Once someone got the door open I found there was quite a few staff members present.A couple of them questioned me about symptoms for the fourth or so time that night. Still not realizing that I was nowhere near inclined to hurt myself or another human being.Some more questions.A small paper cup bottomed out with some unfamiliar pills.A guide from a male nurse to a sort of closet.Asked to strip my gown and bend over.Checked out as a negative for lice. Shocker. I think I’d notice.Ushered to a room with a sleeping man and a bed opposite him, empty for me.So, I crawled into what was basically reminiscent of a cheap hotel bed. Fluffed cardboard pillows paper thin cotton sheets and a fleece blanket/comforter.Awoken at around 05:00 I think. I wasn’t allowed a watch.It took me awhile to get my bearings straight in a windowless room without its fluorescent light on.From “my room” I was taken back to that lice closet. Inside an older man in a white coat I think.I remember something of an accent on him, can’t remember the face. Probably because of the hour and whatever was in that paper cup.He asked how I felt.Asked about my symptoms again. Still no noticing.In all it took a little under 20 minutes or so.Before I could guess what was in that paper cup from before I was handed another paper cup.Now I had the choice of sleep, rec room, or to pace the 20 or so meter hall.Pacing and rec room already had its participants. Plus, it was below 60 degrees fahrenheit. Probably because it was December. Also, we weren’t permitted many of our own clothes and definitely no shoes.This was supposedly remedied with extra scratchy gowns and doubling up on socks that have those rubber grips that you usually find on the floor of showers and bathtubs.I chose sleep.However warm it was.I think I missed breakfast and awoke for lunch.A paper cup.A cart filled with trays you could apparently order a choice of ironed flat bread and nauseating sides. Or maybe the nausea was just from the paper cups.I don’t remember eating much the first day. I remember sleeping. I remember forcibly sleeping. I was always tired. There was nothing to do. Except swallow meds, meet your shrink for under half an hour at his discretion, and get a half hour of outdoor time in a small, small paved area with 2 stone picnic benches and walls too high to even see over. Couldn’t even see the adjacent sky scrapers and hospital towers. You could also watch movies in the rec room. I think they had one set of toss across outside.I ended up falling asleep on a couch with no armrest in the rec room because it simply wasn’t my bed, which I couldn’t fall asleep in anymore. Eventually visiting hour came. My mom came. My sister came. Even my girlfriend at that time came. Unfortunately not long before they showed up I began to have some sort of scary allergic reaction to those paper cups and their contents. My Jaw became incredibly locked, my upper body felt overly tense, even breathing seemed like a chore. I notified a nurse. A quick sigh, another request to bend over, a needle in my buttocks, and another paper cup.Then came visitors. Before mine arrived. I remember seeing and hearing a patient crying with her, what I think were parents, if she could come home, at least before Christmas. Followed by some light sobbing or crying, sometimes, even on both sides of the table.When who I knew arrived, talking was very demanding on my jaw. So I just begged my mother to let me rest my head on her lap and have her stroke my back as I held my girlfriend’s hand. They all complied. Wasting maybe our measly hour. I still haven’t worked out what or how to say to my sister anything that this experience contained.Dinner came in another cart.Another paper cup.Another long sleep.Awoken early to be put in the closet again.Another maybe 15 minutes. This one markedly different because I tried so hard to push out words through my groggy, drugged mouth to convince him that I didn’t belong here. Undo his perceptions of me as a dangerously paranoid individual. Which was followed by a response that almost made me sob in turn. “Good, that’s good. Maybe we can get you out of here before Christmas.”Another paper cup.I remember pacing the hall to try and distract myself. That faltered soon enough and I began to cry.I held back some tears eventually to talk to a nurse asking what it would take to get out of this place.**III: An Upgrade**Later that day I received news of an *upgrade*. I was being released from this *more-maximum* security psych ward, to next door. Their *less-maximum security* psych ward. Here I would be allowed to wear my own shoes. Already a win if I may say so. No more numbing toes.This ward was roughly the same size, but it had a different rec room which was slightly like a small cafeteria.I was also permitted to have my school books brought in. Although studying was impossible in that place.My room now had four beds. Though I don’t remember seeing more than one other person in there.I was given the opportunity to attend some group counseling sessions. Which are not something I am fond of and I don’t think anyone being placed in this kind of situation for the first time would enjoy.In there I just kept to myself. I think I spoke once, hoping that would buy me a speedier ticket out. If I did say anything I don’t remember what it was.I remember constantly hounding the nurses to keep paging or emailing or faxing or whatever the hell it was they did inside their sealed vestibule. To try and get them to make contact with a psychiatrist allegedly *my* psychiatrist. Since he was only available to be talked to in those 15 minute periods at a time you can barely function. And he of course controlled my freedom or lack thereof.Trying to get someone to get me the fuck out of here.**IV: Reproach**Funny thing is. However funny. I was sent there to stop me from killing myself or someone else. Or that’s what they told me the reason was. I entered with very few of these feelings. I left with a promise and some internalized scars. The promise being, if I ever ended up back in a place like that I would kill myself in order to escape. I left with many more feelings wanting to die to end all this. I emerged with alcoholism and fairly heavy cannabis smoking. Only forming more scars. Now all the scars remind me of a dangerous lesson. A dangerous lesson only made worse when I got the medical bill in the mail. Last I remember it was near $20,000. $20,000 on a receipt that said I was *evaluated*, diagnosed of my ills, helped and remedied. Well I think I paid $20,000 to just hurt me. Deep inside, making me so very distrustful of doctors and the medical system in general. No one told me this is what I faced when signing a clipboard on my gowned lap. Not the experience. Not the price tag. I was told I would be helped.When I needed to be treated as someone who was sick, confused, and definitely scared, I was treated like a prisoner.I was given no new diagnosis. I was however given a few antipsychotics, er well sorry, let’s call them what they are, tranquilizers. Let’s just say haloperidol is a bitch. Making just walking down a hall sometimes hard to stay awake for.Did you also know that many medications used to treat mental health disorders usually require therapeutic levels to be maintained for around a week or two before any real results can be seen. Not within 72 hours.But, maybe that’s for the better since I’d rather spend zero hours back there.What am I trying to say?I’m not entirely sure.Maybe just fuck you.Or shame on you.You all should have known better. You were the people I was told to trust. Doctors and nurses. With your bragged years of experience and education. Yet you failed me. You fail so many more.Enlisted to help.Licensed to hurt.Today I live. Battling. Surviving. Keeping my head above water. Thinking too often of diving under.Trying to protect myself from people who see to only cause some more pain and take more money.No amount of antidepressants, late-nights, call-ins to work, bottles of liquor, or grams of marijuana will ever fill that hole they punched right out of me. Even if I found that *little* chunk no medicine from across the counter of a pharmacy or dispensary will make it hold.That’s not being hyperbolic.Or an alarmist.This is just how it is.I wasn’t necessarily suicidal, I wasn’t aggressive, I wasn’t unresponsive, I wasn’t on drugs, I wasn’t immature, I wasn’t filthy, I wasn’t debating if some voices were going to kill me, I wasn’t threatening to blow anything up, I wasn’t abusive, I wasn’t hurting myself, I wasn’t prepping for an alien invasion.What the fuck did I do wrong?I was confused, I was depressed, I was scared, I was too trusting.I doubt you even noticed.Now.I am an alcoholic now. I am suicidal now. I do drugs now.I think you did this to me.Even if you didn’t.You did not help.**V: Later**It’s the second half of 2018 now. Three years after all of this. I have obtained my medical records. It was quite illuminating and appaling. In their notes they said, “patient sees cockroaches on floor and tried to stomp them.” Which I do remember when I brought that up in the ER I had said that I was at work, can’t remember if I said it was at night and out in a parking lot, I thought I saw a cockroach, tried to stomp it, lifted my shoe and found nothing. But, the way they wrote it made it seem as though I was doing that in front of them inside the ER, which I wasn’t. They even marked me for involuntary commitment, multiple times, even though they told me it was voluntary, multiple times. They said I was gravely disabled, even though I drove myself to the ER, had a job, and was in school. They wrote that I was scared to go to school, but I wasn’t, I just didn’t want to go. They thought, that I thought, that people were trying to murder me. Really, I just incessantly thought that any passerby had the capacity and *could* murder me. What went so wrong?Was this my fault?Did I do this to myself?That thought plays over in my head a lot.Of course the tellings and retellings of this story change with my varying moods and sobriety, along with the ever increasing amount of time since then.Most of the people who I told about this generally have the consensus, if any, that I did bring this event on myself.\-----------------I have a few other short chapters planned but not sure what to do with them or where to go from hereAny ideas/feedback again are welcome!. It was a long time ago.But, I do remember when the Lithium Carbonate Extended Release kicked in. Kicked on? Turned on?Either way it was like a switch had been flipped.No, my whole life didn't flip around. No, I wasn't suddenly experiencing stabilized moods.What did happen was that I was able to see more and more of what was going on in my life that was wrong.Before my lithium I saw stacked dishes and clothes littering the floor, and I just kind of said, "yea, so?".Now things are better, not because lithium made me do it, but lithium let me see.Things mind you, aren't perfect. But, better.Drunk or High?Why can't I cry?Feeling down.Maybe up.Can't decide where I'll end up.As if it's a choice, not like I've had a voice.Hell maybe I'm better offDeep undergroundNot with worms by the moundsBut isolatedEver so eviscerated, right through my soul.. I will supply three of my own tips1. Do not stay in bed if you are not sleeping, if possible, lay on a couch or the floor (it's good for your back). If you spend too much time in bed your brain won't know if your chilling or trying to sleep2. Open the curtains if you have a window, let the sunlight in, maybe some fresh air too. 3. Get some houseplants nothing beats some nature. I mean I think it’s safe to say there is definitely a genetic component going on here Obviously not with just suicide or any one mental illnessBut I do believe it could be possible some people with BPD were already at risk of developing it from birth.Perhaps some more than others were able to come out with less risk, but their environment triggers those lurking gene switchesWho knows just about anything is possible in this world. At what point do you pass the point of no return.Right now my life is balancing quite a few points of no return.What is the point of building lasting social relationships...if someday I may kill myselfWhat is the point of going to college, getting my degree, building my career...if someday I might kill my selfWhat’s the point of starting a family...if someday I may kill myself, or worse pass on my suicidal tendenciesI mean I’m pretty sure I won’t kill myself today or tomorrow. But what about 1 year, 10 years from nowI guess you could say I should complete all these things so that I can enjoy life while I have it and it may create some anchors to keep me hereBut many times I feel completing these things can get incredibly stressful and push me closer to the edgeI can’t just burn every bridge and disappear into the woods...or Greenland or something. I mean I could but that prospect also seems daunting and stressful.
    I mean this is so important to me.I slept like 3 hour-ish that day. I did not get much sleep. However, I did not try to sleep more and i instead had 4 shots of caffeine to see a friend of mine. After our lunch, I was in an underground subway station. I was walking with my friend and we had a conversation. There were people in the station. Just as usual. Then all of sudden, I heard a sound like mhmmmm for like three seconds. I saw that there were people in the subway station. Today, I was very anxious and nervous so I checked that subway station. It turned out that people's sound kinda echo in that space (the station is big so yeah)&#x200B;Any hacks for differentiating psychotic hallucination and real sound?. I am 26 yrs old. I had nothing to blame in my life. I have rich, loving parents. I graduated a good school with a good gpa. I am in Although I started having depression since I was a little kid and started seeing a psychiatrist since 22 ish, my life had been good. The process was not easy, but I trusted my doc and listened to her advice. I started getting better and my doc told me we can taper meds and I will do fine in my life. She told me we could taper my meds in September of 2023. I was happy. She was happy and my family was super happy. Everything was fine. However, things got fucked up. I relapsed and psychosis came to me. Ik there are many criteria for psychosis, but recently, I started developing auditory hallucinations. I discussed my symptoms with ENT doctor and the ENT doctor said it is not an ENT problem but a psychiatric problem. I am starting to hear things that do not exist. It is mild and it has not reached its severity "yet," but it is a hallucination.&#x200B;I am so devastated. I am afraid that everything I had in my life will get fucked up. I do not have anyone who supports me. In the past, I told two of my friends I have bipolar and those two friends said mean shit about my diagnosis so I had to block them. Therefore, I can never ever ever reveal my symptoms to other people because shit will get worse. &#x200B;I am so alone. How should I admit this shit? I do not want to admit this shit but I have to admit this shit at some point in my life.. Soo.. I know that hallucination and tinnitus are different symptoms.However, these days I am very confused. I sometimes hear bizarre sounds. For example, I was at a subway station with my friend. Of course, there were people passing by in the same space. My friend and I were talking to each other. But, all of a sudden, I heard the humming sound of a woman for like three seconds. I do not know if this is a hallucination or a real sound.So, my question is, how did your auditory hallucination first manifest?. I have smoked for 7 years. I smoked half pack ~ 1 pack in one day. It has been so long and I dont even remember the times without cigarettes.However, I decided to be strong, so I completely cut off.It has been 4 days and my withdrawal symptoms started kicking in and this goddamn MIXED EPISODE became worse.What should I do? I wanna quit smoking but this mixed episode is just too overwhelming.I have my doc's appointment like 10-11ish days later. But I am going thru hypomania. Idk how to put it into words. My chest is burning and my head is like volcano.I think the best thing I can do is change meds. What should I do?? It is so torturous to wait 10 more days to see my doc.I really do not want to admit it.However it turned out that I am starting to develop auditory hallucination. Honestly this shit scares the fuck outta me and Idk what to do. Any advice?. I was depressed since 13. Back then, me and my family thought I had this quirky, eccentric personality. Back then, my country did not have mental health awareness shit, so we just left it untreated. Time passed by and I got into college and it was then my depression symptoms showed. I could not read books and I had great difficulties going outside of my home. I guessed it was a depression so I went to hospital all by myself and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. That was the spring of 2017.&#x200B;From 2017 to 2021 winter, I had psychotherapy and medical treatments. They were not quite effective for me. Up until the winter of 2021, we thought it was depression. However, in December, after I had a hypomanic episode, I was officially diagnosed with Bipolar II. My doctor started with lithium.&#x200B;For the entire 2022, I could not sustain a so-called normal life. I had been a top-notch student whom all the professors were very fond of. I had been a smart student and all the professors really thought I was an outstanding one. However, I could not study at all. I barely managed to get As. It was utterly hell. I could not study like the past me. (high school and college.. I was magna cum laude) My doctor tried hard to find the right mix of meds and we changed the meds three times. It was so painful finding the right meds. It was a pure nightmare.&#x200B;In 2023, I recovered quickly, and I have been stable. My doc congratulated my recovery and she said I have matured, and 90% of my personal growth is well-achieved. My doc even said we can get off meds and minimize the dosage of meds.&#x200B;However, starting at the end of this September, everything went spiral down. It all started with a hypomanic episode and then mixed episodes (depression and hypomania) followed. I thought I was a very successful person and I thought I was so fine. But everything got fucked up and all my past achievements are nullified. They mean nothing. They are worthless.&#x200B;I completely lost hope in my life. I am devastated that another (hypomanic or depressive and whatever) episode is awaiting me in my future life. I cannot change my fucking brain and this will happen to me again at some point in my life.How should I regain my hope?&#x200B;&#x200B;goddamn it I have a grammatical error in my title. ah. my brain is so damn foggy.&#x200B;. My doc said this is my mixed episode.Yeah my brain is foggy. Everything is hard. Walking, eating, breathing and everything.Even typing my post here is so difficult.............. I am barely writing this and Idk what is going on. My brain is literally like nothing..&#x200B;My appointment is 2 weeks later. What should I DO?. Hello, so I really do not know what I am going through rn is auditory hallucination and tinnitus.Note: My mom has Meniere's disease and she has hearing loss. Unfortunately, it also has a possibility of passing down to me. I do hear sounds, but they are very weird. 1. On the left ear, I hear beeeeep sound and my ear is so full. It is as if my head is under water.2. When I listen to calm jazz music with airpods (I have been using this airpod for more than 2 years) I heard a big explosion sound and heeeeeeeeeeeee sound.3. I was alone at my home and suddenly I heard some kind of radiowave (ish) sound. It had no meaning. Mechanical sound.4. Recently, at night I was walking at the street and I was talking with my friend with airpods in my ears. As I walked by, there was a trash car next to me and men were working with bin bags. Then, I suddenly heard very loud pppppppppppppppppppp sound. I got so surprised. I do not know if I should go to ENT doctor or Psychiatry doctor. Where should I go??&#x200B;. I am 26F. So far, I never had sleeping problems. But in August 2023, during my depressive episode, I had oversleep issues. My doc adjusted pills.Then, at the end of September 2023, hypomania kicked in. I then started having another sleeping issues. I struggled so hard to sleep, but I only get 4-5 hour sleep everyday.I lost my shit at this point and I cannot prepare for this huge upcoming exam in this December.What should I do??. So I have this horrible event that happened in 2016. I forgot about this event for a long time, and then my ptsd started in the winter of 2021. My symtpoms were so severe. Panic attacks, depressions, obsessive-compulsive disorder, fear, anxiety messed up my life. I was always this high-achieveing and smart student in the class, but after ptsd, my school work was totally ruined. I was unable to concentrate on my course material and I had difficulties writing papers. Of course, my gpa dropped. Because of my obsessive-compulsive disorder, I could not go outside of my house, so I could not attended my classes. (When my ocd symptoms explode, I have panic attacks so I could not go outside of my home.) Anyways, 2022 was the worst year of my life. I hit the rock bottom of my life.However, fortunately, I got better and my ptsd became mild. I made friends, performed good at school, and my doc said "Oh hey you are doing great. You made amazing progress."But recently, this October, these two horrifying, unspeakable, terrible events occurred. (These two events are very similar to the ones that happened in 2016.) Ever since then, my life is crumbling apart again. I have those ptsd symptoms again. I cannot do anything. I am stuck in my house. All I can do is eating and sleeping. Typing my story on reddit rn is so difficult. It is so difficult.&#x200B;I called my psychiatrist and asked for adjustment in the schedule, so hopefully, I can meet her sooner. I can meet her tomorrow.BUT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SURVIVE THE NEXT 36 HOURS. THE NEXT APPOINTMENT IS 36 HOURS AWAY. CAN YOU PLEASE GIMMIE ADVICE ON HOW TO SURVIVE THE NEXT 36 HOURS?&#x200B;. One month ago, I was listening to this piano music with airpod. Then all of sudden, I heard a huge explosive noise. It was a very big BOOOOM sound. I was so surprised. It was not part of that piano music.Today, something horrifying happened. At midnight, I was talking to my friend through airpod. It was fun, casual talk. There was a street cleaning truck right next to me. I was talking while I walked next to that truck. Then all of sudden, I heard a very, very loud PPPPPPPPPPPP sound. It was a spitting sound. (Think of it as a sound a baby makes when he/she spits) I was so confused. It was too loud and clear. The sound came from very near. I was so surprised. Then I saw a street cleaner. The street cleaner was doing something with plastic baggage. I saw him and he saw me. I passed by and made it back home.&#x200B;&#x200B;Is this a hallucination? I really really need your opinion. I properly take meds and I follow my doc's advice.However idk why but I think hypomania is hitting me recently.My thoughts are racing very fast. I am very happy, giddy and hopeful. I am too happy to the extent that I cannot my read coursebook due next tuesday.The hospital is closed until next thursday and I am lil bit scared.Sorry help me plz..I am extremely confused.So 1. A few days ago, I was listening to a pop music with my airpod. And there was suddenly a huge huge exploding sound and high-toned heeee sound. I was so surprised because the boooom -- heeee--- sound was enormous.2. Today I am sleep deprived. I only slept 3 hours. Then I went to a buffet and had lunch with parents and grandparents. I heard loud and clear snapchat alarm. But since none of my parents and grandparents use snapchat, that snapchat alarm came from my phone. However, when I saw my phonescreen, I did not receive any snapchat message.What is this? I am confused.My parents will be devastated if they lose me.My life is dipshit garbage. People hate me, I aint got no job.I got nothing to lose,But I am only staying alive because of my parentsLmao this is really pathetic but I just wanted to vent. I felt lonely but I dont wanna vent it out to my friends / acquaintances. So my situation is this...For the last three weeks, I went through a depressive episode. During this time, I had a severe oversleeping problem. The cause of the oversleeping problem is thus: 1. the sleeping pills that my doc added. 2. depression. So, at the last meeting, my doc did not subscribe those sleeping pills and I am not on the sleeping pills anymore. And this is actually the first night without those sleeping pills. Not only do I struggle falling asleep, but I also struggle to wake up.&#x200B;&#x200B;My question is, is this a sign of upcoming mania?I am very concerned about this situation.. TL DR; He says I am overthinking about bfgf / partner title. He says I am giving too much importance on bfgf / partner title. I am so confused. What should I do??He asked me on the date first, and he said "will you be my gf" first and I gladly accepted this. We are officially dating and we are planning to date more and hang out more. However, I cannot understand what he said. He said "we can talk about anything at anytime" and I was so giddy and said "ooo is that your previlige as your partner? I am glad." and then he started making statements about this. According to him, I am the one who gets the previlege because i am his FRIEND. I got confused but he kept telling me "Though I am concerned we do not really communicate. You go to school for writing however you write maybe four words on average" and I was kinda upset because I am doing my Masters degree in American novel in good school. And then, he continued saying, "Lol those last two sentence where the most elaborated statements you’ve made minus the essay of why you were upset.." I got very sad and asked what I can do and if there is solution we can work on together but he said there is no solution and it is just his opinion. He is kinda beating around the bush, so I do not know what to do. Please give me an advice.So this guy is the most perfect guy I ever met. Looks, personality, chemistry, hobby, job and everything is so perfect.But I just found out kinda shocking fact. He said that he was in an open marriage in the past. He told me that they divorced in a good manner (without any fights or hurting each other's emotions) and then he told me that he is still good friends with his ex wife and he split rents with his ex wife.&#x200B;But he says he likes me and he wants to spend time with me. He said he wants closed relationship with me.&#x200B;&#x200B;Do you think he still has feelings for his ex wife? Does he still like his ex wife?. So I started to talking to a guy on bumble.He is American and I am Asian. yeah He is deployed in my country.I gave him my sc, fb and insta but he did not add me back.Also Idk his American phone number and he gave me his temporary Asian phone number (the number which obviously he will stop using after he goes back to America)Anyways, he asked my phone number and we are doing IMessage rn.So my question is it common for young American guy to not have sc, insta, fb??&#x200B;&#x200B;I think I am detecting red flag, cuz I have seen so many foreign people who cheat on their partners, enjoy temporary fling in my country and go back to their home country.&#x200B;Am I being weird?. I am so confused.Big hospital's professor said I am Bipolar but it is NOS.Another hospital's doctor whom I have seen for 4 years said I am Bipolar but it is also NOS. This doc told me that I am some sort of RARE case because I show symptoms of ptsd, borderline personality disorder and bipolar... She said I am difficult to diagnose.I am really dissatisfied about NOS diagnosis because since it is NOT clear what my medical conditions really are, my future life plans also become NOT clear as well.I want to make very sophisticated and successful life plans and stick to my life plans, but I cannot make any plans atm because of my NOS diagnosis. I am very sad.&#x200B;How should I deal with this NOS diagnosis? I really do not know how to deal with my confusion.So I (26f) got a new date (25m).He is very affectionate and fun and sweet. He really likes my looks and personality. The chemistry and convo is amazing too.However, today morning I saw him posting screenshot of facetiming his female """"best"""friend on ig story. He calls her charmander. I got outraged and expressed my feelings. And he posted a meme on IG story. The meme was this: "overthinker unstable gf and stable greenflag bf."So he basically addressed me "overthinker unstable GF"But we talked thru this. I told him I got cheated on multiple times and I need reassurance and trust. I told him I have trust issues and abandonment issues And he constantly reassured me and said "its okay love" Also after this lengthy convo he said I am perfect to him.What is this? Is this red flag?Iam so confused. I deeply like him .((We are not official bf gf yet)). I was very very obsessed with my looks since I was a little girl.I had small eyes and I was fat. My entire highschool girls bullied me from 10th grade to 12th grade.So after highschool graduation, I lost weight and got cosmetic surgery. My eyes got bigger and I got more popular to my opposite sex. Guys started liking me more.But guys kept abandoning me on and on and on. (Leading me on having s** and dumbing me) And I am completely devastated. All I got after all these shit is body dysmorphia ocd and severe abandonment issues.I firmly believe past guys abandoned me and abused me because of my looks. I cant change my belief. I obsessively search for cosmetic surgery infos, go get consulting from surgeons. I have shit ton of makeup. For instance I have 60 lipsticks in my room. I have 90 eyeshadows and 20 highlighters. I put makeup every day. I take like like 30 selfies in one day.People say my eyes nose and lips and aint issues. They say I look good. But none of their compliments help me. My abandonment issue only worsens everyday. My abandonment issues do not go away no matter how much makeup I put, how much surgery I get, how much weight loss I have. I am so exhausted. What should I do??Fixing my face and body do not help my abandonment issues never helped my abandonment issues and my life is hell.So when my trauma is triggered, I have severe anger outburst. I do not express it outward, but I completely lose my shit inside. My eyes go blank, time and space fades away and the only thing that is left in the world is anger and me. Then, physical response (panic attack) overwhelms me. Idk how to cope with this intense anger.The first solution I found is xanax, but I wanna find out other non-medication solutions.I really wanna know your opinion. Thank you so much.Sending much love 🦄🦄❤️❤️. &#x200B;Recently I got a first, official, real boyfriend in my life. I am 26 yrs old female and this is my first real relationship. But the more I interact and talk to him, I feel like I am losing my sanity.First of all, my anger outburst is at maximum. I cannot control my anger at all. I have been exploding like a volcano for the entire week. When my boyfriend texts me late, does not text me good morning, and write short-sentenced messages, I lose my shit. My body trembles. My heart beats like crazy and I have a nervous breakdown. Those kinds of actions remind me of my past traumatic relationships with the opposite sex and I just 'go nuts. When I disliked the tone or words of his messages I lost my sanity and I could not do my school homework. Second, I am extremely unhappy. I am a piece of shit and I am unlovable. I know I do not deserve any kind of real, genuine love because I never got one for 26 years of my entire life. I am not "VERY" attracted to this man but I am dating him because no one else will love me and he is the only person who acts "AS IF" he likes me. My boyfriend tells me "you must learn to trust me" but honestly IDK. I cannot feel anything. I feel so numb. I just lost the ability to reciprocate and mutually communicate anything whatsoever.Third, I feel strong desire of doing extreme actions on me and him. Today, he pissed me off because he suggested that me and his female friend and him, the three of us can do local tour. I literally exploaded and contemplated very bad actions multiple times. At the very moment when I am writing this, I still feel the great urge to do so. I am so sorry. He pissed me off and I felt like I am abandoned and abandoned and abandoned and abandoned so I got devastated and had bad thoughts. I also seriously contemplated on taking real big revenge when he said three people going on tour. &#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;I really do not know what to do with my boyfriend. The more I talk to him, the more I feel the strong urge to do bad things to myself.&#x200B;Please give me any advice thank you so much so much. So my doc said "you dont have to worry about psychosis" multiple times. But my doc said I seem to be like bipolar.But anyways is it possible to have bipolar without psychosis?Thank you yall have good day.So, as far as I know, people with bpd (including me) have abandonment issues.I have this a lot. I constantly and paranoically worry if someone hates / dislikes me in friendship and romantic relationships. I obsessively try to detect any sign of the slightest disinterest / hatred and so on. Whenever I detect any sign of the slightest disliking in people, I start hating them a lot.And if I actually do get abandoned (ex. friends blocking me, situationship dumping me, etc) my anger issues literally explode like massive volcano. This is the moment when I dissociate, panic and cry and think very bad thoughts. I got somewhat better than in the past, but when I was younger, I used to say really extremely bad stuff to guys. For example, I told them "Don't leave me I am on the verge of #####". I also had lots of ridiculous stuff just because I want to be approved with males' love and attention. I ridiculous stuff just to get approval from the opposite sex, looking for true love, forever romance that kind of stuff.&#x200B;Anyways, So do you guys have a similar response like me when it comes to abandonment issues?. I got r***ed twice. I got emotionally abused by romantic partners and my crushes for years. Now all I got is this borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphia and anxiey disorder. I am 26 and all my peers are in stable romantic relationship and settle and live happy life.But my life, it got so fucked up.I have been working for years to fix my body dysmorphia and oh and it well never works. I was never loved by my opposite sex.So we were first matched on bumble.I am just a student and he is a traveler visiting my country.Yes, it is a month-long business trip. During his free time, he visited my city for a trip and we met yesterday. He told me that he likes my looks and personality. We met for a short time and it was so good. I like it a lot. The conversation was good. It was kinda heavenly.&#x200B;I like him a lot. He is my dream guy. He is hot. He is fun. He is kinda gentleman. I love his southern accent. I like what he does for a living. We have the same music taste. It was super fun sharing our hobbies.&#x200B;However, He kinda has an interest in me. It's just that he is not HUGELY interested in me.Also, he leaves after a few days. I doubt he will come back to my country. After he leaves the military he will be an engineer. So, yeah he will never come back here.&#x200B;Should I at least tell him that I like him tons or just block him or what?&#x200B;Thanks in advance.So I grew up under very awful family.My parents were horrible, the worst couple ever. However at the same time they were good parents.I will omit the specific details for the sake of you guys being triggered. But to summarize,They were emotiomally violent against one another and they cheated on each other. I was so stressed and shocked to the extent that I prayed everyday my parents get divorced. Even to this day, I envy those households who got divorced. I am not kidding. My parents are really fucked upCouple. I am 26 now. Whenever my mom speaks in loud voice I have nervous breakdown and when my parents actually fight, I dissociate and lose my shit. I have panic attack.How should I dealWith my trauma?Any advice please?. Like I am panicking rn I can hardly write rnCan somebody please tesch meV !???? Thank uiu. &#x200B;I get angry sometimes. I get explosively, vehemently angry sometimes. In one day, in 24 hours, my mood change from very happy to very angry. And usually my anger arises from specific, very negative, past events.From 9th grade to 12th grade, I got severely bullied by my entire schoolmates and the school girls mocked my looks a lot. Also, in my adulthood, dudes in romantic / dating relationships treated me like shit because of my looks. All this shit baffles me until to this very day and I suffer so much. I get so easily exploded and angry whenever topics about looks come up. When I take a selfie and it looks ugly I literally throws temper tantrums and I cry in my room for like two to three hours. I literally explode when my selfies look shitty and unsatisfactory.&#x200B;&#x200B;So my question is, do your anger patterns resemble that of mine? Do you guys get angry because of the specific life event / trauma / memory? Or are your anger issues triggered by biological reasons?. My symptom is this:I live in Asian country, but I major English and I am doing my Master's degree in my country.However, I am very eager to go to top schools in either UK or US. and be a writer and professor.All my classmates and professors do admit that I am a very enthusiastic student and my professor likes my enthusiasm for books and theories.Whenever I read the class books, I become really mesmerized and I feel like 'man I wanna write books like them.'I really want to be a GREAT scholar and thus I will apply to as many schools as possible.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;After my doc saw this, this is manic state. So, he wrote in my prescription paper that I am Bipolar NOS. He said my condition ain't good because I am unrealistic and my dream is tooooo big.&#x200B;However, I think my dream is NOT delusional. I think my dream somewhat makes sense.\- My father earns $76000 per year and my mum promised me that she is willing to support me financially. \- My GPA is 3.9/4.3. (in 100 scale, it is 95.5) I researched Oxford? Cambridge? (I forgot lmao) and their minimum GPA requirement is 3.9/4.3 so I can actually apply those good schools.\- I am searching for internships / temporary jobs in book companies so that I can improve my resume when I apply for PhD degree later. (I am planning on applying to book companies because I want to earn my living fee and add some stuff on my resume.)\- Although I am sometimes depressed and frustrated and then become lazy, I do finish my assignments and reading materials and discussions somehow. \- I am semi-professional and I am kinda dumb but I do wanna publish my stuff in the future. I wanna publish a lot a lot a lot of things and I wanna publish amazing dope stuff. &#x200B;Anyways I do have some specific plans for future,but my doc said it is manic state.&#x200B;I am extremely confused.Is my doc misdiagnosing me? ORIs this really manic episode??&#x200B;&#x200B;Once again thank you so much for reading this long and confusing storyHope yall have a good dayI love you all :). Is your depressive episode caused byspecific life event (triggering event)orflow of time and biological cycle?&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;mine is caused by specific life event (triggering event)and idk how other people go thru depressive episodesi am recently diganosed (my doc was confused about my symptoms and tracked me for a long time)and i want to be educated&#x200B;&#x200B;thank you so much and hope yall have a good day. And I got diagnosed with bipolar when I was 24.Is any of you diagnosed with depression kinda stuff during childhood?I feel I am the only one and this feels goddamn lonely. So when I am going thru depressive episode,extremely severe body dysmorphia recurs and torture me so much.I am in so much pain and I do not know what to do.I lock myself up in my room and take hundreds of selfies and check my looks and find every single flaw in my face and cry over and over again for hours. Honestly this stuff is getting outta my hand.&#x200B;Do any of y'all suffer same stuff like this? How did you guys overcome this?I am really desperate for help. I need advice asap. This dysmorphia shit fucked up my performance in school.I have 3.96 gpa, but I need to make 4.0 gpa.If I fail my gpa this year, like my life will literally....I mean my depressive episode is getting worse and worse and worse because of my crush.I have huge crush on this guy.At Feburary, this crush ghosted me after first s**. I felt miserable.And about like a week ago, all of sudden and very unexpectedly, he asked me we can meet if I want to.So I said "yeah lets meet."We were supposed to meet today, but instead of me, he chose clubbing with other girl.This entire stuff worsens my depressive episode.I am hitting the rock bottom.so today I was alone in my homeI was searching something on insta and while at the same time simultaneously, tv news was turnt on.then all of sudden there was this low-tone "woooong wooooong" sound.it was not word, it was not phrase, it was not sentence, it was not a conversation&#x200B;just "woooong woooong" i dont even know if this is hallucination or news announcer&#x200B;this is my first experienceso is this gonna develop into human voice and stuff?. 1.I was at a living room. I thought I very dimly heard youtube video in my room. (My room is right next to the living room) So I went to my room to check whether there was youtube video playing or not. It turned out that there was no youtube video clip playing. The sound I heard was not human voice, human conversation, etc. It was just a dim sound.&#x200B;2.I was watching youtube in my room, while tv was turned on. Then, for like 5 seconds, I heard a weird noise. It is not a human voice, it is not a human conversation. It was a mumbling sound, very incoherent. The sound was like a broken radio sound, a mumbling sound.&#x200B;&#x200B;I am 27 years old and this is the first time this stuff happened.Is this hallucination?. I am from east asia and unlike other people in my country I use snapchat. So anyways, recently, something bizzare and fun is happening to me. lol.Like literally every day, two to three American dudes that I don't know at all add me as a friend. (I checked it but none of them are spams and bots. They are real people who work in my country.) These guys mostly want to have conversations with me and hangout/ date me in weekends. Moreover, They compliment my looks a lot.When I wake up in the morning, literally like five to six guys send me messages like "good morning cutie" and stuff like that.When I post my selfies on snapstory, they send messages that compliment my looks. I receive too many messages flirting on me on a daily basis. I receive too many messages to the extent that I confuse their names and don't remember most of the conversations I have with these guys. I find it kinda bizzare. &#x200B;So my question is, is this kind of pre-dating, snapchat experience that vast majority of American girls go through on the daily basis?. I am triggered about specific health condition, a very specific disease.I have so-called hypochondria and OCD about this specific disease.Whenever I see anything related to this very specific disease,I obsessively check if I have that disease or not and my anxiety level skyrockets.&#x200B;So, today, I got triggered. I saw a media news about my trigger, and then I became nervous. I saw visual hallucination and experienced dizziness.In this trigger moment, I have visual hallucination (sometimes I get both visual hallucination and dizziness)&#x200B;So, may question is, am I the only person who gets hallucinations when trigger happens.I feel really weird rn. I wonder if I am the only person.I recently started talking to a guy. He is really awesome. I like himBut here is the problem: I wanna block him and runaway from him cuz I am nervous and scaredWhat scares me a lot are following:- what if he lose interest- what if he run away- why does he NOT text me first?- what is he doing in his work? Why does he not looking at his phone what‘s wrong?I like him but I am nervous. What should I do?. So... my ptsd becomes out of control and I go literally nutswhen I simply just step outside my home door. It takes me a lot of courage to go outside of my house.I first have severe intrusive thoughts and then I develop severe obsessive-compulsive behavior.These symptoms eventually lead me to panic attack / extreme dizziness / faint (or feel like fainting)&#x200B;So... looking at my symptoms, my doc gave me emergency meds. She gave me xanax for me so that I can carry it in my bag whenever I feel nervous and scared. &#x200B;Do you guys have emergency meds like me?. Se@@@l violenceAnd R@@@And ver@@@ harrassment (from bf)And getting treated like garbage/baggage on almost every date I hadAnd liteterally never genuinely being loved by anybody for 26 yearsGenuinely turned me intoA bitter loserAnd idk since when but hetero couples startedTriggering me I become insanely infuriated and miserable and depressed and worst when I see hetero coupleWhat should I do?. Lol Idk what to sayWe were in talking stage and everything was really awesome.He tried to have some explicit physicalStuff with me but I have physical trauma.He triggered me so I acted off.After acting off, I explained to him I have ptsdAnd then he ghosted me hahaEverything got fucked up and he doesnt even read my text.
    I (23F) am in relationship with a great guy. Long story short my last relationship was 4 years ago and I broke up with them because I don’t like to project my lows/highs. It broke my heart and at times in my manic state I was selfish and reached out to them. They were unconditionally supportive and I knew I had to let them go. We haven’t talked in years which I love and respect because I wish nothing but the best for them! I reflected and acknowledged that they felt responsible to take care of me. We were young & grew up together so I could read him easily. He was falling into a depressive state when we were together. Ultimately, we parted ways. Recently, I’ve hit a low. I’m terrified of displacing my feelings on my new partner and I don’t ever want to hurt someone the way I did in my last relationship. This is the first time I’ve been open and honest about my struggles. My current partner asks me how he can help and tries his absolute best. I know I shouldn’t end the relationship out of fear because nothing has happened yet, but I don’t want to repeat history. I’m so torn and confused. I never want to put that weight on someone again.How do I overcome this fear? How do I learn to trust myself to not hurt others? There’s a lot of history that would take way too long to explain but I tend to isolate when I experience these lows. During my manic state I’m hypersexual and indulge in drugs/drinking. I haven’t had an intense episode in a little over a year. Luckily my meds have helped along with a healthy lifestyle. I also realize I’ve been blessed to have partners who try and support me. I like to think that I love them enough to let them go. I can understand why people see this as me assuming their feelings, but I genuinely saw them fall apart when I did. I don’t want to do this again. It’s taken me years to forgive myself for my past, and I’m terrified of repeating history.I know they aren’t close anymore and haven’t been for a while. Does anyone know the details??. I never knew she came out as bisexual. Maybe I missed it. She seemed happy in her recent tiktok about it. Hope she finds someone other than Elon 😂. I keep seeing posts and comments about Olivia’s substance abuse. Where is the proof? Has she spoken about this?. I just can’t get high anymore. I’ve taken T breaks before and was on one right before starting wellbutrin. No matter how much I smoke I can’t seem to get high. Has anyone else experienced this? Maybe it’s something else. Idk.
    Hi, I've been struggling with hypersexuality for about a year. I came out of a manic episode a year back but i was still left with strong hypersexual symptoms along with low grade depression that are both still here. I'm happily married and have felt it so difficult to manage my hypersexuality in a close loving relationship. My wife works long hours so I'm alone a fair bit and find it so hard to avoid dating apps, escort websites and porn. We have a 4 Yr old and have been trying on and off for a second child. It's so difficult trying for a child and being hypersexual, I have to be 'ready' for my wife's ovulation date each month and it means abstaining from masturbating for a week or ten days before that. Living with the hypersexuality during those times is a nightmare. I've slept with two escorts in those times over the past year, I'm so ashamed of it. I haven't told my wife, she knows I'm struggling with hypersexuality but we haven't gone into the details of what that means. She works really long hours and doesn't have much energy or time to talk in the evenings. I tried to open up to her last night but she said she was too tired. She's been away with work last week and is going away again next week. It's so soul destroying, I don't think I can confide in anyone I know and my therapist wasn't helping so I stopped seeing him. Thought this would be a place I could share and get some advice without too much judgement (at least not as much as I judge myself as a terrible person). I used protection with the escorts and got a full sti check once I came to my senses, it came back clean.
    Does anyone else have the uncontrollable urge to contact your exes or people from your past that you reeeeally shouldn’t? I’ve noticed this is a thing for me and I just made a horrible mistake. How do y’all deal with this sort of temptation?. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 around a year ago. I also have ADHD, GAD, an essential tremor, and a hormone disorder. Finding the right combo of meds that don’t have side effects that are deal breakers or make my other conditions worse has felt so tiring and disheartening. My meds change about every 2-4 weeks. Sometimes I cry at night because I’m afraid I’ll never be fully functional or ok. I feel alone in this. How many of you have made it to the other side? How long did it take?. The final tie I had to him has been severed and I thought I’d feel free but instead I feel… uneasy? It feels like we’re breaking up again and like I’m losing some kind of safety net, like that feeling when you’re in the pool and you feel that shift when you pass the edge of the shallow end and find yourself in the deep end. My self trust is damaged. It was already in a bad state when we met and the relationship I had exacerbated it even more.I have these moments when I want to cling to him and not let go. We’d been in limited contact due to financial reasons that have finally been resolved. This is real no contact now and I’m kinda freaking out, trying to stay strong. I’ve been using a DBT method my therapist taught me: I recognize and acknowledge my feelings and impulses, then I figure out what the opposite action is to contacting him (read the list of reasons not to talk to him I made out loud to myself), and do that instead. Or I call a friend. So far, it’s been working pretty well but I’d like to maybe have some other tricks up my sleeve too. I have a couple of mental disorders that impair my impulse control at moments. What do you do to stay NC?TLDR: struggling to maintain NC and would really appreciate some tips on how to stay strong. I’ve been working on this lately and it’s hard! Since putting in some work on my self esteem, it’s gotten higher and the negative self talk hurts more than it used to. It used to be a “yeah whatever I know” kinda thing and now I get bothered when I impulsively call myself stupid or crazy for no other reason than being human. It feels like I’m constantly fighting myself. Can any of you relate? What has worked for you so far? I usually refute it out loud or read some personal affirmations I made myself. Just curious. You know what I mean? When you’re with someone that tells you that you can’t be trusted to do anything right over and over for years until you give in and let them control everything they possibly can to the point you barely do anything for yourself out of fear and insecurity? Yeah, that. Now I have to keep reminding myself that I AM capable of doing things myself, basic and maybe even more difficult things if I really apply myself. Can you relate?Edit to clarify: I left him months ago and I’m working on healing/rebuilding myself from the inside out.I started talking to someone from Reddit in a casual, sexual way last summer and we’ve ended up becoming really close friends. He’s younger than me and lives thousands of miles away so this feels pretty new to me. I live in the US, he’s in Scandinavia. We talk for hours a day if we don’t stop ourselves. I wouldn’t say I’m in love but I like him a lot and am ready for an adventure. I’ve wanted to travel abroad for a long time so why not do both at the same time? He’s offered a lot of his personal info to make me feel safer (full legal name, name of a parent who is somewhat well known, college he attends, national ID & driver’s license, etc) Talking to him feels so natural and we both are dying to meet each other but I’m still pretty nervous and feel vulnerable. Is this a bad idea? The plan is to stay in a hostel on my own the first few nights then staying with him at his place for a couple of nights, then a hotel at the end. Is this a bad idea? Are there any other steps I could take to feel safer & ease my nerves?. I finally have some self worth for the first time in a while and now I’m enraged with how horrible he was to me. No more sympathy or excuses because of his mental health or traumas. He’s an abusive piece of shit man child that blames his mommy for everything wrong with him while exploiting her emotionally and financially. He’ll never grow up. He’ll never change. He will go his whole life using and abusing people until he’s all alone feeling sorry for himself while ignoring that he’s the cause of it all. Thank fuck I got away from him. I can live a life of my own free of his control and abuse. I can finally heal. I can say with confidence that I deserve better and he never deserved my love in the first place. Good riddance!!!. I want to be more independent and do things for myself in my home like hang photos, install curtains, use tools, etc. Are there any blogs or YouTube channels you’d recommend? The simpler the better. Thanks in advance!. I can’t seem to let go. Everyone around me who knows the truth is worried. I know the chances of him changing are slim and that there’s a grieving period for the loss of a relationship. I’d say I’m in the “bargaining” phase where I think of ways he could still be my person in a different universe where he never did the things he did to me and he never ever would. It could have been so different if only he was the man I thought he was. I know that universe isn’t my reality. The reality is that he’s a great manipulator and knows all of the right buttons to push to make me question myself and my decision to leave. One day I’ll move on from this and be better for it. Not sure when but I know I will eventually. I’ve never struggled like this. Wish me luck!. I’ve been window shopping for permanent hair removal options and skimming reviews, etc. A lot of positive reviews mention getting services over the span of years. I thought electrolysis was one of those things that you got done in a few treatments over months and it was over. Is that wishful thinking? What’s been your experience with it? I’m dying to get rid of this facial hair for good. I’m going to visit and stay with my bipolar best friend shortly. Context: she’s been medicated for a while now, like over a year or so. No therapy in a while as far as I know. Anyway, we FaceTime often and her mood sometimes shifts. Lately, she’s seemed very cold and indifferent to talking to me and I don’t really know how to address it or how to take it. I have my own mental health issues (potential bipolar also but still in process of diagnosis) and insecurities that may be getting triggered in these interactions as well. I start to wonder if she still cares about me or wants me around anymore. I suspect we also have different attachment styles. I try to reassure myself that I haven’t done anything wrong but I can’t help feeling less lovable at moments. I guess what I wanna know is; is this normal? Her coldness, my feelings, etc? She’s one of the most important people in my life and I don’t want to think that I’m losing her. What should I do?. My (26F) dad (68M) passed away nearly 3 years ago and I still can’t accept it. Everyone said he was getting better but he still signed a DNR. He had bilateral pneumonia and went into cardiac arrest Thanksgiving morning while I was living on the other side of the country. I should have been there. Why would he sign that if there was hope that he’d recover? Was he even “sound of mind” when he signed that? It all seems so wrong.Not officially diagnosed yet, the psychiatrist wants me to try the meds first to see if they work (weird, I know). I felt mostly alright and a little groggy at times at 20mg. I just took my first 40mg dose last night and, oh boy. I can barely get up. I’m sunk into the couch, bed, so pooped. I do feel less jumpy though which is nice. Will this feeling go away or is something wrong? I remember the grogginess at 20 lessened over time so I’m hopeful. Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks in advance.

I told him to his face that it would be best for my mental health and healing process for me to block him on everything again except for an email address specifically for him for financial purposes. He said he didn’t want me to block his phone number because he might need me if he’s having an emergency. I told him I couldn’t be his person anymore or even his last resort. He insisted and said that he “has no one else” which I think is BS. He still got me to agree not to block his number. I hugged him goodbye, got in my car and left. As I drove away, I just felt angrier and angrier. When I parked my car, I texted him and let him know that after all he put me through, he doesn’t get to keep me in his back pocket and if he’s having an emergency, he needs to call a hotline. I’m not the one. Blocked.It felt so good to stand up for myself! Now all I need to do is practice self control, not unblock him for anything, and focus on my healing. Thank you everyone who has listened and gave me constructive advice!. I had to set some hard boundaries with my ex today. I’ve had enough of his manipulation and I made it clear today by blocking him on everything but email for financial reasons. This is as close to no contact as I can get for now. I said what needed to be said but now I feel bad and I’m worried about his mental health bc he’s unwell. I’m also unwell and the way he treated me the past 4 years exacerbated it so I had to cut him off. How do I psychologically let go of this person that I loved so deeply but caused me so much pain and trauma?. My mom & I have a good relationship overall. There have been some rough patches over the years but we are good at this time. The only thing that isn’t great is that we have different communication needs. Finding the balance in this has been an ongoing struggle. If it were up to her, we would be talking 24/7 and I often feel like she’s pressuring me to be a certain way that I’m not. We’re trying a new system (her idea) where I send a specific emoji when I don’t feel like talking. I’ve used it already I think twice. It still doesn’t sit right with me. It makes me feel like I have to be the one to reject her and it feels bad. Is this a good system or is something off? I feel like something is off. I just wish she could understand that I don’t want to talk everyday and share every detail of my life all the time.I broke up with my ex back in July after being together almost four years because he was controlling, manipulative, and emotionally abusive. I tried to go NC and have failed more than once. We’ve also slept together multiple times. I’ve basically failed everything short of taking him back. Now he’s going to therapy, taking meds again, working on his anxiety and control issues, becoming more financially stable, being kind, etc. There have been times where he acted this way and I found out that he was still nasty and controlling towards others when I wasn’t around to see it so it’s hard to know what’s real and what’s an act. I just need someone to tell me why I shouldn’t take him back. I’m so lonely at night it hurts. I know it’s sad and I’m not proud of all the times I’ve invited him to my bed and the other way around. I don’t know how to stop. I lost my trauma bond workbook and I feel like I’m failing. Is going back ever successful or does it always blow up in your face? Just tell me the truth please.Edit: I didn’t expect you all to show up for me like this and I appreciate it so much ❤️ I definitely needed the reassurance. If I don’t get a chance to reply to you individually, just know that I’m still grateful for your contribution. Thank you. Long story short, my friend and I were both raped by the same man around 10 years ago. I was a minor. Certain details lead me to believe that he may have been/ may be a serial rapist. Years later, he became a sheriff deputy in my hometown but lost his position 6 months later due to something unrelated. There’s no way for me to know if he ended up getting hired again in a different county as many dirty cops do. The things he did to us haunt me and make me worried for the general public (especially women) with him possibly still being in a position of power. I blamed myself for a long time so I didn’t report. Do you think I should report it now? Have any of you had success pressing charges this many years or more later? Any advice appreciated. Thank you. It was prescribed by my gyno bc I haven’t had a period since end of May. Has anyone else done this? Does it take a few days sometimes? I did accidentally skip a day but just took it the next day and finished all the pills. I’m kinda worried.After everything he put me through I still find myself missing him. I miss his smile, his voice, his laugh, his touch, our jokes, having someone to love. Last week I tried to kill myself and I wanted to call him but I didn’t. He’s the reason I got this low in the first place. He took away my autonomy and sense of self. I know reaching out to him is one of the worst things I could do at this point. I feel so lost. I miss my person but I couldn’t lose myself anymore to keep him in my life. It just wasn’t healthy. It doesn’t make this any easier. My heart hurts. I’m failing school, I just found out I’m an asymptotic carrier of herpes. I have nothing really going for me at this point. You win, depression. I don’t see a reason to stay. No one will ever really love me. I’ll always be someone’s last resort because they’re too afraid of being alone. Who would really want a mentally ill, diseased, good for nothing person like me as a partner. I feel sorry for the friends and family that will be hurting from this but I just can’t go on being miserable forever. Hopefully I’ll be easy to replace. I’m ready for the long sleep. I gave my kitten extra food and water to last however long it takes for people to figure out I’m dead, I told my best friend that I love and appreciate her, the step ladder and belt are ready to go and so am IFuck you, worldEdit: so, I didn’t go through with it. The crisis line and my friends talked me down. I think I have a lot of healing to do. I was already wanting space from our “friendship”, he verbally backed me into a corner, and I just had to set him straight. It really sucked. He’s still the selfish, manipulative liar I spent too many years on. It’s not permanent because he owes me money (and before any of you say it, I’m getting that money back and I’m not taking no for an answer. I have a contract and a witness) but for now, he’s blocked on everything and I can finally see how talking to him on a regular basis was hurting me more and stunting my healing process. I’ll be taking my time healing before I reach out to him again for the money. I’ll also be speaking to an attorney about small claims court if that’s what it comes to. Some days I feel strong, other days I don’t. But one thing I don’t feel about this decision is regret, not an ounce.TW: suicidal ideation I broke up with him and I’m starting to see that wasn’t even the hard part. Within a week we were talking regularly again bc I drunk dialed him, now we hang out and have started sleeping together again. He’s been so damn charming and sweet, showing all his best sides. I wrote a list of all the reasons not to see him, talked through my boundary issues with my therapist, and still went to his place at 2am the same night. I’m a mess. I get all the butterflies I did in the beginning and when I leave to go home without him, I feel sick,empty, and embarrassed. I’m not strong like the rest of you. I know I need to go NC but idk if I can do it. I’m just hoping life gets too busy for me to make time for him when school picks up. I feel like it’s my only hope at this point bc I don’t have the self control to stay away from the man who manipulated me and controlled my life for years to the point I literally wanted to die. End rant. That is all. No one got hurt. He slammed into some parked cars. Apparently he’d just been hired as a cop and got fired for the DUI. HAHAHAHA Fuck that piece of rapist shit. All the bad karma for him. Anything he gets is too good for him after what he did to my friend and I. Those memories haunt me everyday. I wouldn’t have shed a tear if he died that night. The world would be a better place without him.We decided to stay friends despite everything because I still care about him and I don’t think he’s a bad person, just really sick. I feel like as long as I keep enough distance so he can’t control my life or manipulate me, we can maybe have a healthy friendship (typing that out and seeing it makes me want to rethink this whole thing. Shit. Like I shouldn’t have to keep friends at a distance to protect myself but anyway). I went over to his house to see him & his family. He wanted help with something but we just ended up hanging out and…. yeah. Even though alarm bells were ringing in my head the whole time, I couldn’t pull myself away. Touch is one of my love languages, I’m not ready to explore that with anyone new yet, and he knows me too well. It’s frustrating because I set clear rules for myself before going over there and I broke them all. I wish the sex was bad and my feelings for him were gone. I think I need to spend some time away from him. I can’t go NC because he owes me money. I’m trying not to beat myself up over it but ughhhh. He started a fight about some trivial crap yesterday and it was a last straw moment. I just felt like it was then or never so I ended it, picked up my stuff today, and got a bit of closure. I’m already kinda questioning myself and missing him, of course. He had a lot to say today and it seemed like he finally understood his role in this madness. He said all the right things and yet I still caught him in a few lies so I know I made the right choice. It hurts like hell right now but I’m hoping to feel better when I’ve healed more. Anyway, thank you to everyone who showed me patience, kindness, and offered helpful advice the last few months. I appreciate you all very, very much ❤️. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous. I’m thinking about working out to feel more confident in my skin. Kinda worried about dealing with cattiness/drama but I guess I could just avoid that by keeping to myself mostly. I also want to drink less or not at all but my social anxiety can be difficult to manage sober. Any advice about confidence, anxiety, avoiding drama, etc?Thank you lovelies. I admitted to myself, my closest loved ones, and him that he has been abusive and manipulative for the majority of our almost 4 year relationship. I moved out and told him I need my own space and now mostly see him on my terms. He is still trying to control and manipulate from a distance and it’s not as effective for him. He’s also not doing much of anything I told him I needed to see for our relationship to move forward and we had that talk about 6 weeks ago. Deep down, I know my dream of us living a happy life together is dead and that I no longer see a future with him but I just can’t bring myself to end it. I’m still attached to him and maybe I’m also afraid of being alone or starting over romantically. How did you do it? I’m already working on breaking the trauma bond and it’s really hardThanks for reading. My mom is well meaning but definitely a boundary pusher. We have a history of ups & downs and have been working on our relationship for a long time. Things have improved a lot over the years. She told me recently that I’m the one who taught her about boundaries. Well I still struggle with certain things. I don’t like hurting people’s feelings. One thing she does consistently that kind of bothers me is that she texts me constantly and always wants to know what I’m doing everyday. I’ve tried just ignoring it but she will keep asking and not take the hint. It makes me feel like I’m being tracked or monitored and I’m really not a fan of it. It feels somewhat infantilizing in a way? I’m a grown woman in my mid 20’s and I don’t think it’s necessary for her to know everything all the time. How do I tell her nicely (but not so nice it goes over her head) that I don’t like this?Thank youTLDR: how do I tell my mom in a kind and assertive way to stop asking me what I’m doing or where I’m going on a daily basis?. My (26F) mom (60F) is well meaning but definitely a boundary pusher. We have been working on our relationship for a long time and things have improved a lot over the years. She told me recently that I’m the one who taught her about boundaries. Well I still struggle with certain things. I don’t like hurting people’s feelings. One thing she does consistently that kind of bothers me is that she texts me constantly and always wants to know what I’m doing everyday. It makes me feel like I’m being tracked or monitored and I’m really not a fan of it. How do I tell her nicely (but not so nice it goes over her head) that I don’t like this?Thank you. Recently, I (26F) moved out of my boyfriend’s (34M) home and told him that I needed to see specific action/effort from him for our relationship to continue. I told him that I wouldn’t accept being controlled or told how to live in my own space, that I needed him to take care of his physical health (feeding himself, taking care of his teeth, seeing the doctor on his own, etc), mental health, and to start treatment for his abusive tendencies. I’m reading articles online that say ultimatums are bad. Should I have done it differently? I’ve told him countless times that his behaviors have been damaging my mental health and he has never listened so this was my last effort to get him to do something different. So far, it’s not really working. He’s full of lies, excuses, and fake niceness. But from what I’ve read (yes, Lundy Bancroft) I guess it’s to be expected that he won’t change. Did I mess up? He’s usually the one giving me ultimatums all the time to control me. I have given him a few in the past as well without thinking about it too much which maybe wasn’t the healthiest. Our whole relationship has been pretty toxic though, if I’m being honest.TLDR; gave controlling manipulative partner an ultimatum and am now wondering if that was the right thing to do and what I could have done differently.Edit: thanks to everyone who left kind, insightful responses. I appreciate it. Eventually, he admitted to being wrong (which is rare) but for a while we got in arguments about my sexual orientation and cultural identity. I felt like I had to prove and defend myself. It made me super angry and usually I just let him think he’s right about everything but in these instances, I pushed back. Who does he think he is telling me who I am?? Has anyone else seen this? Is it some kind of specific type of abuse? Is it intentional or just arrogance?. Not sure if I have an ED or not but I wasn’t sure where else to talk about this. I used to be very thin 4+ years ago and did a lot of nude modeling. Also did some s*x work. By today’s standards, I’m far from overweight and sometimes I like my body but other days, I hate myself and feel so ugly. My confidence is so low and I find myself missing external validation I’d get from strangers objectifying me before I got into a long term relationship and left my old profession. I was looking at old modeling photos a little bit ago and kept thinking fuck, what happened to me? It’s only like a 25 pound difference. The wildest part is I didn’t even like myself back then either. I’m sure some of you can relate.It’s been almost a week since I moved into my new apartment alone. I didn’t break up with my boyfriend but I told him that I need space to be my own person again because his abuse has harmed me in multiple ways including taking away my personal autonomy. I told him exactly what I need to see from him for us to have a future and I will decide on an appropriate timeline for that soon.I really love this apartment! It’s cute, comfy, peaceful, and everything I was looking forward to. It’s all great until the sun goes down and my anxiety & loneliness take over. Then I start to really miss him. I also have paranoia/stranger danger and it takes me a while to settle fully into a new place. Until I’m fully used to a new place, I’m kinda jumpy and any noises make me a little scared. How do you deal with these feelings? Do you distract yourselves? Say affirmations? Please share. Thanks!. I haven’t seen anyone on here talk about this yet but I’m sure a lot of you can relate. Making decisions on my own for several days, miles away from my partner who has controlled my life for over 3 1/2 years is both liberating and terrifying at moments. Going to the grocery store and freely picking what I want without anyone watching and criticizing my every move: fucking awesome, highlight of my day. Making multiple basic decisions in a row (where to next, should we do this, is this safe, etc): panic inducing. I’ve been having daily panic attacks and other physical manifestations of dread since I’ve been away from him because I haven’t been on my own in so long and I know that’s not healthy. It’s really shown me how much this relationship has damaged my self trust. I knew it was gonna be hard to be independent again but I didn’t anticipate anything to this extent.It’s my first night away from my boyfriend and I’m falling apart. We’re not even broken up I’m just having intense anxiety being alone for the first time in years. I’m on a trip and it’s off to a rough start. I had a panic attack on a plane and my dinner made me sick. I’ve been awake almost 24 hours bc this anxiety and stomach ache from the bad food won’t let me sleep. Now all I can think of is how different it would be if he was here. He would have held my hand on the plane instead of a stranger. He would have comforted me and probably would have brought some kind of medicine with him bc he has digestive issues sometimes. I’m supposed to be on vacation on my own to see how it feels to be independent and I miss him so much. I feel so hopelessEdit: I made it through the night and got a few hours asleep. My stomach ache is gone and I feel less desperate. Thanks for the words of encouragement!. I posted the other day about an emotionally demanding person in my household. Today, I let her know that I am focusing on myself and that I don’t have time for any more long conversations or unsolicited advice. It was a little scary as I can tell she really wants to talk to me and (s)mother me but I need to practice putting myself first instead of doing things I don’t want to or don’t have the energy for to make others happy at my expense. Thanks for the support btw! I appreciate anyone who took the time to talk to me or even read my post :). My bf & I live with his mom. She is kind and means well most of the time but is exhausting to live with. I feel like most of the time I can’t go downstairs without her starting a conversation with me and if I don’t tell her to stop, she will literally talk nonstop for hours. It makes me not want to go downstairs at all to avoid it altogether. A lot of the conversations feel very one sided and draining. She will usually stop if I ask her nicely but it’s tiring to have to even do that and I feel bad telling someone to stop talking who is so nice to me. Then there are other boundaries that are harder to enforce like not being her messenger which she constantly tries to do no matter how many times, how nicely or how bluntly I’ve told her to stop. Does anyone else deal with someone like this? Some days are genuinely fun with her and I enjoy her company but as an introvert, I need time to recharge and she doesn’t which makes living together hard on me. My bf feels the same way I do and he's not introverted at all so maybe it's beyond that. He’s not as intense as her either. Edited for extra context*.
    I mean this is so important to me.I slept like 3 hour-ish that day. I did not get much sleep. However, I did not try to sleep more and i instead had 4 shots of caffeine to see a friend of mine. After our lunch, I was in an underground subway station. I was walking with my friend and we had a conversation. There were people in the station. Just as usual. Then all of sudden, I heard a sound like mhmmmm for like three seconds. I saw that there were people in the subway station. Today, I was very anxious and nervous so I checked that subway station. It turned out that people's sound kinda echo in that space (the station is big so yeah)&#x200B;Any hacks for differentiating psychotic hallucination and real sound?. I am 26 yrs old. I had nothing to blame in my life. I have rich, loving parents. I graduated a good school with a good gpa. I am in Although I started having depression since I was a little kid and started seeing a psychiatrist since 22 ish, my life had been good. The process was not easy, but I trusted my doc and listened to her advice. I started getting better and my doc told me we can taper meds and I will do fine in my life. She told me we could taper my meds in September of 2023. I was happy. She was happy and my family was super happy. Everything was fine. However, things got fucked up. I relapsed and psychosis came to me. Ik there are many criteria for psychosis, but recently, I started developing auditory hallucinations. I discussed my symptoms with ENT doctor and the ENT doctor said it is not an ENT problem but a psychiatric problem. I am starting to hear things that do not exist. It is mild and it has not reached its severity "yet," but it is a hallucination.&#x200B;I am so devastated. I am afraid that everything I had in my life will get fucked up. I do not have anyone who supports me. In the past, I told two of my friends I have bipolar and those two friends said mean shit about my diagnosis so I had to block them. Therefore, I can never ever ever reveal my symptoms to other people because shit will get worse. &#x200B;I am so alone. How should I admit this shit? I do not want to admit this shit but I have to admit this shit at some point in my life.. Soo.. I know that hallucination and tinnitus are different symptoms.However, these days I am very confused. I sometimes hear bizarre sounds. For example, I was at a subway station with my friend. Of course, there were people passing by in the same space. My friend and I were talking to each other. But, all of a sudden, I heard the humming sound of a woman for like three seconds. I do not know if this is a hallucination or a real sound.So, my question is, how did your auditory hallucination first manifest?. I have smoked for 7 years. I smoked half pack ~ 1 pack in one day. It has been so long and I dont even remember the times without cigarettes.However, I decided to be strong, so I completely cut off.It has been 4 days and my withdrawal symptoms started kicking in and this goddamn MIXED EPISODE became worse.What should I do? I wanna quit smoking but this mixed episode is just too overwhelming.I have my doc's appointment like 10-11ish days later. But I am going thru hypomania. Idk how to put it into words. My chest is burning and my head is like volcano.I think the best thing I can do is change meds. What should I do?? It is so torturous to wait 10 more days to see my doc.I really do not want to admit it.However it turned out that I am starting to develop auditory hallucination. Honestly this shit scares the fuck outta me and Idk what to do. Any advice?. I was depressed since 13. Back then, me and my family thought I had this quirky, eccentric personality. Back then, my country did not have mental health awareness shit, so we just left it untreated. Time passed by and I got into college and it was then my depression symptoms showed. I could not read books and I had great difficulties going outside of my home. I guessed it was a depression so I went to hospital all by myself and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. That was the spring of 2017.&#x200B;From 2017 to 2021 winter, I had psychotherapy and medical treatments. They were not quite effective for me. Up until the winter of 2021, we thought it was depression. However, in December, after I had a hypomanic episode, I was officially diagnosed with Bipolar II. My doctor started with lithium.&#x200B;For the entire 2022, I could not sustain a so-called normal life. I had been a top-notch student whom all the professors were very fond of. I had been a smart student and all the professors really thought I was an outstanding one. However, I could not study at all. I barely managed to get As. It was utterly hell. I could not study like the past me. (high school and college.. I was magna cum laude) My doctor tried hard to find the right mix of meds and we changed the meds three times. It was so painful finding the right meds. It was a pure nightmare.&#x200B;In 2023, I recovered quickly, and I have been stable. My doc congratulated my recovery and she said I have matured, and 90% of my personal growth is well-achieved. My doc even said we can get off meds and minimize the dosage of meds.&#x200B;However, starting at the end of this September, everything went spiral down. It all started with a hypomanic episode and then mixed episodes (depression and hypomania) followed. I thought I was a very successful person and I thought I was so fine. But everything got fucked up and all my past achievements are nullified. They mean nothing. They are worthless.&#x200B;I completely lost hope in my life. I am devastated that another (hypomanic or depressive and whatever) episode is awaiting me in my future life. I cannot change my fucking brain and this will happen to me again at some point in my life.How should I regain my hope?&#x200B;&#x200B;goddamn it I have a grammatical error in my title. ah. my brain is so damn foggy.&#x200B;. My doc said this is my mixed episode.Yeah my brain is foggy. Everything is hard. Walking, eating, breathing and everything.Even typing my post here is so difficult.............. I am barely writing this and Idk what is going on. My brain is literally like nothing..&#x200B;My appointment is 2 weeks later. What should I DO?. Hello, so I really do not know what I am going through rn is auditory hallucination and tinnitus.Note: My mom has Meniere's disease and she has hearing loss. Unfortunately, it also has a possibility of passing down to me. I do hear sounds, but they are very weird. 1. On the left ear, I hear beeeeep sound and my ear is so full. It is as if my head is under water.2. When I listen to calm jazz music with airpods (I have been using this airpod for more than 2 years) I heard a big explosion sound and heeeeeeeeeeeee sound.3. I was alone at my home and suddenly I heard some kind of radiowave (ish) sound. It had no meaning. Mechanical sound.4. Recently, at night I was walking at the street and I was talking with my friend with airpods in my ears. As I walked by, there was a trash car next to me and men were working with bin bags. Then, I suddenly heard very loud pppppppppppppppppppp sound. I got so surprised. I do not know if I should go to ENT doctor or Psychiatry doctor. Where should I go??&#x200B;. I am 26F. So far, I never had sleeping problems. But in August 2023, during my depressive episode, I had oversleep issues. My doc adjusted pills.Then, at the end of September 2023, hypomania kicked in. I then started having another sleeping issues. I struggled so hard to sleep, but I only get 4-5 hour sleep everyday.I lost my shit at this point and I cannot prepare for this huge upcoming exam in this December.What should I do??. So I have this horrible event that happened in 2016. I forgot about this event for a long time, and then my ptsd started in the winter of 2021. My symtpoms were so severe. Panic attacks, depressions, obsessive-compulsive disorder, fear, anxiety messed up my life. I was always this high-achieveing and smart student in the class, but after ptsd, my school work was totally ruined. I was unable to concentrate on my course material and I had difficulties writing papers. Of course, my gpa dropped. Because of my obsessive-compulsive disorder, I could not go outside of my house, so I could not attended my classes. (When my ocd symptoms explode, I have panic attacks so I could not go outside of my home.) Anyways, 2022 was the worst year of my life. I hit the rock bottom of my life.However, fortunately, I got better and my ptsd became mild. I made friends, performed good at school, and my doc said "Oh hey you are doing great. You made amazing progress."But recently, this October, these two horrifying, unspeakable, terrible events occurred. (These two events are very similar to the ones that happened in 2016.) Ever since then, my life is crumbling apart again. I have those ptsd symptoms again. I cannot do anything. I am stuck in my house. All I can do is eating and sleeping. Typing my story on reddit rn is so difficult. It is so difficult.&#x200B;I called my psychiatrist and asked for adjustment in the schedule, so hopefully, I can meet her sooner. I can meet her tomorrow.BUT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SURVIVE THE NEXT 36 HOURS. THE NEXT APPOINTMENT IS 36 HOURS AWAY. CAN YOU PLEASE GIMMIE ADVICE ON HOW TO SURVIVE THE NEXT 36 HOURS?&#x200B;. One month ago, I was listening to this piano music with airpod. Then all of sudden, I heard a huge explosive noise. It was a very big BOOOOM sound. I was so surprised. It was not part of that piano music.Today, something horrifying happened. At midnight, I was talking to my friend through airpod. It was fun, casual talk. There was a street cleaning truck right next to me. I was talking while I walked next to that truck. Then all of sudden, I heard a very, very loud PPPPPPPPPPPP sound. It was a spitting sound. (Think of it as a sound a baby makes when he/she spits) I was so confused. It was too loud and clear. The sound came from very near. I was so surprised. Then I saw a street cleaner. The street cleaner was doing something with plastic baggage. I saw him and he saw me. I passed by and made it back home.&#x200B;&#x200B;Is this a hallucination? I really really need your opinion. I properly take meds and I follow my doc's advice.However idk why but I think hypomania is hitting me recently.My thoughts are racing very fast. I am very happy, giddy and hopeful. I am too happy to the extent that I cannot my read coursebook due next tuesday.The hospital is closed until next thursday and I am lil bit scared.Sorry help me plz..I am extremely confused.So 1. A few days ago, I was listening to a pop music with my airpod. And there was suddenly a huge huge exploding sound and high-toned heeee sound. I was so surprised because the boooom -- heeee--- sound was enormous.2. Today I am sleep deprived. I only slept 3 hours. Then I went to a buffet and had lunch with parents and grandparents. I heard loud and clear snapchat alarm. But since none of my parents and grandparents use snapchat, that snapchat alarm came from my phone. However, when I saw my phonescreen, I did not receive any snapchat message.What is this? I am confused.My parents will be devastated if they lose me.My life is dipshit garbage. People hate me, I aint got no job.I got nothing to lose,But I am only staying alive because of my parentsLmao this is really pathetic but I just wanted to vent. I felt lonely but I dont wanna vent it out to my friends / acquaintances. So my situation is this...For the last three weeks, I went through a depressive episode. During this time, I had a severe oversleeping problem. The cause of the oversleeping problem is thus: 1. the sleeping pills that my doc added. 2. depression. So, at the last meeting, my doc did not subscribe those sleeping pills and I am not on the sleeping pills anymore. And this is actually the first night without those sleeping pills. Not only do I struggle falling asleep, but I also struggle to wake up.&#x200B;&#x200B;My question is, is this a sign of upcoming mania?I am very concerned about this situation.. TL DR; He says I am overthinking about bfgf / partner title. He says I am giving too much importance on bfgf / partner title. I am so confused. What should I do??He asked me on the date first, and he said "will you be my gf" first and I gladly accepted this. We are officially dating and we are planning to date more and hang out more. However, I cannot understand what he said. He said "we can talk about anything at anytime" and I was so giddy and said "ooo is that your previlige as your partner? I am glad." and then he started making statements about this. According to him, I am the one who gets the previlege because i am his FRIEND. I got confused but he kept telling me "Though I am concerned we do not really communicate. You go to school for writing however you write maybe four words on average" and I was kinda upset because I am doing my Masters degree in American novel in good school. And then, he continued saying, "Lol those last two sentence where the most elaborated statements you’ve made minus the essay of why you were upset.." I got very sad and asked what I can do and if there is solution we can work on together but he said there is no solution and it is just his opinion. He is kinda beating around the bush, so I do not know what to do. Please give me an advice.So this guy is the most perfect guy I ever met. Looks, personality, chemistry, hobby, job and everything is so perfect.But I just found out kinda shocking fact. He said that he was in an open marriage in the past. He told me that they divorced in a good manner (without any fights or hurting each other's emotions) and then he told me that he is still good friends with his ex wife and he split rents with his ex wife.&#x200B;But he says he likes me and he wants to spend time with me. He said he wants closed relationship with me.&#x200B;&#x200B;Do you think he still has feelings for his ex wife? Does he still like his ex wife?. So I started to talking to a guy on bumble.He is American and I am Asian. yeah He is deployed in my country.I gave him my sc, fb and insta but he did not add me back.Also Idk his American phone number and he gave me his temporary Asian phone number (the number which obviously he will stop using after he goes back to America)Anyways, he asked my phone number and we are doing IMessage rn.So my question is it common for young American guy to not have sc, insta, fb??&#x200B;&#x200B;I think I am detecting red flag, cuz I have seen so many foreign people who cheat on their partners, enjoy temporary fling in my country and go back to their home country.&#x200B;Am I being weird?. I am so confused.Big hospital's professor said I am Bipolar but it is NOS.Another hospital's doctor whom I have seen for 4 years said I am Bipolar but it is also NOS. This doc told me that I am some sort of RARE case because I show symptoms of ptsd, borderline personality disorder and bipolar... She said I am difficult to diagnose.I am really dissatisfied about NOS diagnosis because since it is NOT clear what my medical conditions really are, my future life plans also become NOT clear as well.I want to make very sophisticated and successful life plans and stick to my life plans, but I cannot make any plans atm because of my NOS diagnosis. I am very sad.&#x200B;How should I deal with this NOS diagnosis? I really do not know how to deal with my confusion.So I (26f) got a new date (25m).He is very affectionate and fun and sweet. He really likes my looks and personality. The chemistry and convo is amazing too.However, today morning I saw him posting screenshot of facetiming his female """"best"""friend on ig story. He calls her charmander. I got outraged and expressed my feelings. And he posted a meme on IG story. The meme was this: "overthinker unstable gf and stable greenflag bf."So he basically addressed me "overthinker unstable GF"But we talked thru this. I told him I got cheated on multiple times and I need reassurance and trust. I told him I have trust issues and abandonment issues And he constantly reassured me and said "its okay love" Also after this lengthy convo he said I am perfect to him.What is this? Is this red flag?Iam so confused. I deeply like him .((We are not official bf gf yet)). I was very very obsessed with my looks since I was a little girl.I had small eyes and I was fat. My entire highschool girls bullied me from 10th grade to 12th grade.So after highschool graduation, I lost weight and got cosmetic surgery. My eyes got bigger and I got more popular to my opposite sex. Guys started liking me more.But guys kept abandoning me on and on and on. (Leading me on having s** and dumbing me) And I am completely devastated. All I got after all these shit is body dysmorphia ocd and severe abandonment issues.I firmly believe past guys abandoned me and abused me because of my looks. I cant change my belief. I obsessively search for cosmetic surgery infos, go get consulting from surgeons. I have shit ton of makeup. For instance I have 60 lipsticks in my room. I have 90 eyeshadows and 20 highlighters. I put makeup every day. I take like like 30 selfies in one day.People say my eyes nose and lips and aint issues. They say I look good. But none of their compliments help me. My abandonment issue only worsens everyday. My abandonment issues do not go away no matter how much makeup I put, how much surgery I get, how much weight loss I have. I am so exhausted. What should I do??Fixing my face and body do not help my abandonment issues never helped my abandonment issues and my life is hell.So when my trauma is triggered, I have severe anger outburst. I do not express it outward, but I completely lose my shit inside. My eyes go blank, time and space fades away and the only thing that is left in the world is anger and me. Then, physical response (panic attack) overwhelms me. Idk how to cope with this intense anger.The first solution I found is xanax, but I wanna find out other non-medication solutions.I really wanna know your opinion. Thank you so much.Sending much love 🦄🦄❤️❤️. &#x200B;Recently I got a first, official, real boyfriend in my life. I am 26 yrs old female and this is my first real relationship. But the more I interact and talk to him, I feel like I am losing my sanity.First of all, my anger outburst is at maximum. I cannot control my anger at all. I have been exploding like a volcano for the entire week. When my boyfriend texts me late, does not text me good morning, and write short-sentenced messages, I lose my shit. My body trembles. My heart beats like crazy and I have a nervous breakdown. Those kinds of actions remind me of my past traumatic relationships with the opposite sex and I just 'go nuts. When I disliked the tone or words of his messages I lost my sanity and I could not do my school homework. Second, I am extremely unhappy. I am a piece of shit and I am unlovable. I know I do not deserve any kind of real, genuine love because I never got one for 26 years of my entire life. I am not "VERY" attracted to this man but I am dating him because no one else will love me and he is the only person who acts "AS IF" he likes me. My boyfriend tells me "you must learn to trust me" but honestly IDK. I cannot feel anything. I feel so numb. I just lost the ability to reciprocate and mutually communicate anything whatsoever.Third, I feel strong desire of doing extreme actions on me and him. Today, he pissed me off because he suggested that me and his female friend and him, the three of us can do local tour. I literally exploaded and contemplated very bad actions multiple times. At the very moment when I am writing this, I still feel the great urge to do so. I am so sorry. He pissed me off and I felt like I am abandoned and abandoned and abandoned and abandoned so I got devastated and had bad thoughts. I also seriously contemplated on taking real big revenge when he said three people going on tour. &#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;I really do not know what to do with my boyfriend. The more I talk to him, the more I feel the strong urge to do bad things to myself.&#x200B;Please give me any advice thank you so much so much. So my doc said "you dont have to worry about psychosis" multiple times. But my doc said I seem to be like bipolar.But anyways is it possible to have bipolar without psychosis?Thank you yall have good day.So, as far as I know, people with bpd (including me) have abandonment issues.I have this a lot. I constantly and paranoically worry if someone hates / dislikes me in friendship and romantic relationships. I obsessively try to detect any sign of the slightest disinterest / hatred and so on. Whenever I detect any sign of the slightest disliking in people, I start hating them a lot.And if I actually do get abandoned (ex. friends blocking me, situationship dumping me, etc) my anger issues literally explode like massive volcano. This is the moment when I dissociate, panic and cry and think very bad thoughts. I got somewhat better than in the past, but when I was younger, I used to say really extremely bad stuff to guys. For example, I told them "Don't leave me I am on the verge of #####". I also had lots of ridiculous stuff just because I want to be approved with males' love and attention. I ridiculous stuff just to get approval from the opposite sex, looking for true love, forever romance that kind of stuff.&#x200B;Anyways, So do you guys have a similar response like me when it comes to abandonment issues?. I got r***ed twice. I got emotionally abused by romantic partners and my crushes for years. Now all I got is this borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphia and anxiey disorder. I am 26 and all my peers are in stable romantic relationship and settle and live happy life.But my life, it got so fucked up.I have been working for years to fix my body dysmorphia and oh and it well never works. I was never loved by my opposite sex.So we were first matched on bumble.I am just a student and he is a traveler visiting my country.Yes, it is a month-long business trip. During his free time, he visited my city for a trip and we met yesterday. He told me that he likes my looks and personality. We met for a short time and it was so good. I like it a lot. The conversation was good. It was kinda heavenly.&#x200B;I like him a lot. He is my dream guy. He is hot. He is fun. He is kinda gentleman. I love his southern accent. I like what he does for a living. We have the same music taste. It was super fun sharing our hobbies.&#x200B;However, He kinda has an interest in me. It's just that he is not HUGELY interested in me.Also, he leaves after a few days. I doubt he will come back to my country. After he leaves the military he will be an engineer. So, yeah he will never come back here.&#x200B;Should I at least tell him that I like him tons or just block him or what?&#x200B;Thanks in advance.So I grew up under very awful family.My parents were horrible, the worst couple ever. However at the same time they were good parents.I will omit the specific details for the sake of you guys being triggered. But to summarize,They were emotiomally violent against one another and they cheated on each other. I was so stressed and shocked to the extent that I prayed everyday my parents get divorced. Even to this day, I envy those households who got divorced. I am not kidding. My parents are really fucked upCouple. I am 26 now. Whenever my mom speaks in loud voice I have nervous breakdown and when my parents actually fight, I dissociate and lose my shit. I have panic attack.How should I dealWith my trauma?Any advice please?. Like I am panicking rn I can hardly write rnCan somebody please tesch meV !???? Thank uiu. &#x200B;I get angry sometimes. I get explosively, vehemently angry sometimes. In one day, in 24 hours, my mood change from very happy to very angry. And usually my anger arises from specific, very negative, past events.From 9th grade to 12th grade, I got severely bullied by my entire schoolmates and the school girls mocked my looks a lot. Also, in my adulthood, dudes in romantic / dating relationships treated me like shit because of my looks. All this shit baffles me until to this very day and I suffer so much. I get so easily exploded and angry whenever topics about looks come up. When I take a selfie and it looks ugly I literally throws temper tantrums and I cry in my room for like two to three hours. I literally explode when my selfies look shitty and unsatisfactory.&#x200B;&#x200B;So my question is, do your anger patterns resemble that of mine? Do you guys get angry because of the specific life event / trauma / memory? Or are your anger issues triggered by biological reasons?. My symptom is this:I live in Asian country, but I major English and I am doing my Master's degree in my country.However, I am very eager to go to top schools in either UK or US. and be a writer and professor.All my classmates and professors do admit that I am a very enthusiastic student and my professor likes my enthusiasm for books and theories.Whenever I read the class books, I become really mesmerized and I feel like 'man I wanna write books like them.'I really want to be a GREAT scholar and thus I will apply to as many schools as possible.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;After my doc saw this, this is manic state. So, he wrote in my prescription paper that I am Bipolar NOS. He said my condition ain't good because I am unrealistic and my dream is tooooo big.&#x200B;However, I think my dream is NOT delusional. I think my dream somewhat makes sense.\- My father earns $76000 per year and my mum promised me that she is willing to support me financially. \- My GPA is 3.9/4.3. (in 100 scale, it is 95.5) I researched Oxford? Cambridge? (I forgot lmao) and their minimum GPA requirement is 3.9/4.3 so I can actually apply those good schools.\- I am searching for internships / temporary jobs in book companies so that I can improve my resume when I apply for PhD degree later. (I am planning on applying to book companies because I want to earn my living fee and add some stuff on my resume.)\- Although I am sometimes depressed and frustrated and then become lazy, I do finish my assignments and reading materials and discussions somehow. \- I am semi-professional and I am kinda dumb but I do wanna publish my stuff in the future. I wanna publish a lot a lot a lot of things and I wanna publish amazing dope stuff. &#x200B;Anyways I do have some specific plans for future,but my doc said it is manic state.&#x200B;I am extremely confused.Is my doc misdiagnosing me? ORIs this really manic episode??&#x200B;&#x200B;Once again thank you so much for reading this long and confusing storyHope yall have a good dayI love you all :). Is your depressive episode caused byspecific life event (triggering event)orflow of time and biological cycle?&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;mine is caused by specific life event (triggering event)and idk how other people go thru depressive episodesi am recently diganosed (my doc was confused about my symptoms and tracked me for a long time)and i want to be educated&#x200B;&#x200B;thank you so much and hope yall have a good day. And I got diagnosed with bipolar when I was 24.Is any of you diagnosed with depression kinda stuff during childhood?I feel I am the only one and this feels goddamn lonely. So when I am going thru depressive episode,extremely severe body dysmorphia recurs and torture me so much.I am in so much pain and I do not know what to do.I lock myself up in my room and take hundreds of selfies and check my looks and find every single flaw in my face and cry over and over again for hours. Honestly this stuff is getting outta my hand.&#x200B;Do any of y'all suffer same stuff like this? How did you guys overcome this?I am really desperate for help. I need advice asap. This dysmorphia shit fucked up my performance in school.I have 3.96 gpa, but I need to make 4.0 gpa.If I fail my gpa this year, like my life will literally....I mean my depressive episode is getting worse and worse and worse because of my crush.I have huge crush on this guy.At Feburary, this crush ghosted me after first s**. I felt miserable.And about like a week ago, all of sudden and very unexpectedly, he asked me we can meet if I want to.So I said "yeah lets meet."We were supposed to meet today, but instead of me, he chose clubbing with other girl.This entire stuff worsens my depressive episode.I am hitting the rock bottom.so today I was alone in my homeI was searching something on insta and while at the same time simultaneously, tv news was turnt on.then all of sudden there was this low-tone "woooong wooooong" sound.it was not word, it was not phrase, it was not sentence, it was not a conversation&#x200B;just "woooong woooong" i dont even know if this is hallucination or news announcer&#x200B;this is my first experienceso is this gonna develop into human voice and stuff?. 1.I was at a living room. I thought I very dimly heard youtube video in my room. (My room is right next to the living room) So I went to my room to check whether there was youtube video playing or not. It turned out that there was no youtube video clip playing. The sound I heard was not human voice, human conversation, etc. It was just a dim sound.&#x200B;2.I was watching youtube in my room, while tv was turned on. Then, for like 5 seconds, I heard a weird noise. It is not a human voice, it is not a human conversation. It was a mumbling sound, very incoherent. The sound was like a broken radio sound, a mumbling sound.&#x200B;&#x200B;I am 27 years old and this is the first time this stuff happened.Is this hallucination?. I am from east asia and unlike other people in my country I use snapchat. So anyways, recently, something bizzare and fun is happening to me. lol.Like literally every day, two to three American dudes that I don't know at all add me as a friend. (I checked it but none of them are spams and bots. They are real people who work in my country.) These guys mostly want to have conversations with me and hangout/ date me in weekends. Moreover, They compliment my looks a lot.When I wake up in the morning, literally like five to six guys send me messages like "good morning cutie" and stuff like that.When I post my selfies on snapstory, they send messages that compliment my looks. I receive too many messages flirting on me on a daily basis. I receive too many messages to the extent that I confuse their names and don't remember most of the conversations I have with these guys. I find it kinda bizzare. &#x200B;So my question is, is this kind of pre-dating, snapchat experience that vast majority of American girls go through on the daily basis?. I am triggered about specific health condition, a very specific disease.I have so-called hypochondria and OCD about this specific disease.Whenever I see anything related to this very specific disease,I obsessively check if I have that disease or not and my anxiety level skyrockets.&#x200B;So, today, I got triggered. I saw a media news about my trigger, and then I became nervous. I saw visual hallucination and experienced dizziness.In this trigger moment, I have visual hallucination (sometimes I get both visual hallucination and dizziness)&#x200B;So, may question is, am I the only person who gets hallucinations when trigger happens.I feel really weird rn. I wonder if I am the only person.I recently started talking to a guy. He is really awesome. I like himBut here is the problem: I wanna block him and runaway from him cuz I am nervous and scaredWhat scares me a lot are following:- what if he lose interest- what if he run away- why does he NOT text me first?- what is he doing in his work? Why does he not looking at his phone what‘s wrong?I like him but I am nervous. What should I do?. So... my ptsd becomes out of control and I go literally nutswhen I simply just step outside my home door. It takes me a lot of courage to go outside of my house.I first have severe intrusive thoughts and then I develop severe obsessive-compulsive behavior.These symptoms eventually lead me to panic attack / extreme dizziness / faint (or feel like fainting)&#x200B;So... looking at my symptoms, my doc gave me emergency meds. She gave me xanax for me so that I can carry it in my bag whenever I feel nervous and scared. &#x200B;Do you guys have emergency meds like me?. Se@@@l violenceAnd R@@@And ver@@@ harrassment (from bf)And getting treated like garbage/baggage on almost every date I hadAnd liteterally never genuinely being loved by anybody for 26 yearsGenuinely turned me intoA bitter loserAnd idk since when but hetero couples startedTriggering me I become insanely infuriated and miserable and depressed and worst when I see hetero coupleWhat should I do?. Lol Idk what to sayWe were in talking stage and everything was really awesome.He tried to have some explicit physicalStuff with me but I have physical trauma.He triggered me so I acted off.After acting off, I explained to him I have ptsdAnd then he ghosted me hahaEverything got fucked up and he doesnt even read my text.
    I have been struggling lately. My mixed state has taken a nose dive to depression. I hate how I feel. The loneliness, the rumination, the cutting off of friends si I don’t hurt more. I looked online and I don’t see any antidepressants are recommended for Bipolar Disorder. How am I supposed to deal with just the depression. I just don’t want to fuck up my life again.I’ve finally grown out of Shonen anime and have been going for more adult content. So far I have watched shows like Parasyte, Tokyo Ghoul, Tokyo Ghoul:Re, Hellsing, and Hellsing ultimate. I have watched Castlevania on Netflix, but no interest on the spin off. I want to know what you would recommend based on what I’ve watched.I haven’t had a fingerboard since the hype in the mid 2000s with Tech Decks. I still miss my blue Darkstar board. I’ve seen that hot wheels have fingerboards at Walmart. I just want to know what everyone is on since the community has definitely grown.I was wondering if anyone knows the process for a name change in Texas. Would any of you know if I need to get a lawyer, pay some fee, or how long it would take?. I recently got into comics, and a lot of the series I’ve read are written by Peter David and I absolutely love his stories. I’m currently reading the New Fantastic Four series and I’m having a blast. Do y’all have any other writers that are comparable to David?. I am a Maverique who is AMAB. I have recently had this feeling that I am a Tomboy. Most of the time, I feel like a Femboy or voidgender. It’s always a gendered feeling, but never leaning towards the binary. I came across Propegender and Versandrogyne and they both seem close pretty close to how I feel, but I want to see if there are other similar genders. It’s not something I’m to worried about an answer, but I am curious. I was just shooting the shit with him about bands I like because I have been getting into some hardcore like Hatebreed, Knocked Loose, and Suicidal Tendencies. He told me a bunch about playing on the same stage as Bring Me The Horizon in front of 150,000 people, hitting 1,000,000 streams on a song, and the bands copyright struggle with the producer.I have recently gotten into effigies with a voodoo doll I bought in a gift shop. I know that the Greco-Romans had Kolossoi and the Egyptians had the Ushabti, but I’m sure there are more in other cultures. I just wanted to know if y’all knew others and if you worked with them.I consider myself an Eclectic Witch. I have been working with some crystal magic, birth charts, and some tarot. I’m still new, but I’m trying to find some house rituals. I want to get into herbalism, cooking and cleaning rituals, and other magic for the home. I can’t even find any information online because google just tries to sell me books. I don’t want to follow anyone exactly. I just want ideas and make it my own because that’s how I think it works best for me. I was hoping someone here would have some articles or guides to look at.5 years ago, I took the official test and I got INTP-T(Logician). I just took the test and got ENFP-T(Campaigner). I didn’t know personalities could change, but I may understand why. A year ago, I sought therapy because my mental health was crashing. 6 months ago, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression and was prescribed Lexapro. Mentally, I feel better than before I even started therapy. I do realize that I am more out going and more in touch with my feelings. I was just wondering if anyone else experienced the same thing because I feel like both of my results were accurate.Could something like that even happen? How strong would the person be? Would they cancel each other out? What would it even be like?. I have had my T for 6 months now and I’m ready to upgrade. I’m looking for something that I can let walk around that wouldn’t just bolt like my pink toe. I’ve looked at Mexican Red Knees or fireleg, Brazilian blacks, or a green bottle blue. I’m also open to other’s. I love Ts. First of all, I’d like to let y’all know I identify as a Maverique, I am Demiromantic and Greysexual. I know that LGBT has been used for a while and the LGBTQIA+ is the latest evolution. I personally don’t feel like everyone is represented equally with LGBTQIA+. I personally use queer, but I know there are some members that have been hurt by that word. I was wondering if we could get some neologists in the group to make new words to label the group that we could vote on.“Don’t worry daddy, I didn’t see anything”, she said with a sharpened spoon and black holes for eyes.I’m looking at spade drill bits for ventilation in my new A. Avicularia tub. The smallest bit I can find is 1/4 in., but I don’t know if that’s too small or too big. If these are too big, should I switch to a step bit, or should I go bigger? I’m also considering just sticking with it and making more holes. The tub is 16x12x24.
