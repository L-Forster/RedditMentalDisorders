I was having food today in a restaurant, eating some salad and then suddenly choked on the food. It felt I couldn't breathe anymore, stated to cough super loudly (probably as an automatic responde by my body) I grabbed water and started to drink it but it was really a challenge since the food was still stuck in my throat. Luckily after standing up and some more coughing I could breathe again but the whole situation was super scary. I really thought I was going to die. The most shocking part was that people in the restaurant were just looking at me, not even trying to help or ask if I was okay after I stopped coughing (extremely).Does anybody has any experience changing the name and adrress of the name in your AdSense payment profile? Is it possible? I see a pencil next to all of the field in the payment profile but don't want to risk anything.I've got a monetised YouTube channel with a linked AdSense account but I'm moving to live in another country and therefore will also be making use of a bank account in this new country.Whats the best solution to still get my payments from AdSense, close my current account, which is registered to the previous country I stayed and set up a new account with the address details of the new country I'm staying?Or just keep the current AdSense account and make another one with a different email address? (I'm a bit sceptical of this since I've read numerous times that Google is very strict about having multiple accounts, just not sure if it counts if you use another email address).Any advice or tips are more than welcome! Thanks.I know this friend since I'm a child. I'm in my 30's now. He was always like my best friend but changed a lot in the last few years and became quite distant (literally) we still talk almost every day, but through WhatsApp (even though he lives in the building next to me). He just doesn't like to meet people in person anymore, including me. Some weeks ago I got this new small condo (the one I'm staying at right now) and somehow we started to talk about the usage of a good TV. To be honest, I don't really care about stuff like that, I rather go on a nice hike. He still managed to convince to purchase a good quality Oled TV and said: once you have one you'll understand why I hardly leave my place anymore.The television is in my room now, unpacked, installed. But I actually don't care about it and hardly use it. I would be much more happy to spend time outdoors and most importantly to spend time with my good friend again (in real, not through online messages).Cotton is a non wicking fabric, which gets completely saturated with sweat and takes forever to dry, yet I still see so many people wearing cotton clothes (with all the sweat visible on the shirt).
    On one of my previous posts I shared about how I bought my gf flowers. I did so not knowing it was the first time someone had ever bought her flowers and she ended up crying.After I posted that, I was inspired by one of the comments on that post to get my gf LEGO flowers. A couple of months ago my gf mentioned to me that she loved to build LEGO when she was a kid. When she mentioned that, I remember years ago when I was in an Oregon LEGO store, I saw a LEGO set that was basically a bouquet of flowers and thought, ‚Äúthat would be a sweet gift to give someone‚Äù.Fast forward years later on my GF‚Äôs bday‚Ä¶Before I dropped her back off to her place after we hung out, I told her something like, ‚ÄúI got you another gift. Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs flowers again. But before I give you these flowers, I wanted to let you know that I will love you until the last flower dies‚Äù.Then I pulled out a big yellow LEGO bag and she started crying again üòÇI pulled out the bouquet of LEGO flowers that I saw years ago in that LEGO store in Oregon and she realized what I meant when I said that I‚Äôd love her till the last flower dies.We hung out again this past week and she mentioned that she told her mom and dad what I did and her mom said, ‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs a keeper!‚ÄùHonestly, that made me so happy. Whenever my GF tells me about the positive feedback she gets from sharing stories of us with her friends, it always makes my day.But when she mentioned that her parents liked what I did, it felt really good. Idk.Basically the title. I was at the store yesterday picking up some groceries before I was headed to pick my gf up to hang out.I went past the flower aisle and thought, ‚Äúah, what the hell‚Äù and bought some flowers. The cashier who rung me up was like, ‚Äúflowers and poke bowls, ay?‚Äù and smiled.I went to pick up my girl and right when she got into my car I said, ‚Äúguess what?‚Äù Her: ‚ÄúWhat?‚ÄùMe: ‚ÄúChicken butt‚Äù *pulls out flower bouquet üíê *She ended up crying and I was laughing asking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù And that‚Äôs when she said that she never got flowers before in her life.Then it kinda made me sad for a bit tbh. I thought about this new generation and how fast-paced and cold we can be sometimes. I feel like every girl should get flowers from the ones they love. Especially ones they‚Äôre dating.We went home and hung out for the rest of the day. I didn‚Äôt own a vase so I just put it in a water jug. Fellas, buy flowers for ya girl. Ladies, buy‚Ä¶ whatever guys want for ya man (idk i‚Äôm bad at this .-.)Edit: Thank you all so much for all the love in the comments! I went to sleep last night right after I made this post and I woke up this morning with all these sweet stories and messages of your guy‚Äôs own. I absolutely love reading the comments and will read more when I get home.(Apologies to the mods, I initially had it as ‚Äújust chatting‚Äù in the flair but I realize yes, ‚Äúlife stories‚Äù is a much better flair. Thank you for changing it!). "Truly from the bottom of my heart... it's been an honor being a fan of this show along with you all. For some reason, this show managed to cultivate a fanbase that has been some of the most beautiful and open-minded group of people that I've seen. From all the theories, through all the thought-provoking discourse, to the shared laughter and raw emotions we've had through the beautiful moments we got to experience throughout the show, you've all been nothing but great company to enjoy this show with. No matter how near or far we were from each other, each episode made me feel like I was watching it with  ªohana (family) and it's been one of the most coolest feelings I've had in long while. It's truly been a blessing loving this show along with you all. I wish you all the most beautiful experience with this last episode and hope the love and inspiration you gain from this series uplifts you throughout the rest of your life. Me ke aloha pumehana, Golden Kaleo". It is currently 2:49 PM as I write this. Around 6 hours before Atlanta's series finale drops. Here is a (growing) list of theories that I've seen in the past that I wanted to document before we head into the last episode: 1. "**Atlanta is a simulation**" - This one I feel the most strongest for. From the Deja Vu thing that Darius experienced in the first ever Atlanta episode to the fact that this last episode is going to be a Darius centered episode confirms this theory even more. There's an interview with Zazie Beetz where she even talks about how Donald Glover spoke to her about this theory that we are all in a simulation (I'll try to find the link of that interview and post it here later) so the fact that Donald is even aware of simulation theory gives this Atlanta simulation theory more of a forefront thought than ever before. 2. "**Paper Boi dies**" - don't know why people are saying this tbh. but I've seen countless of theories that PB will die this last episode. Don't know if it'll happen or not, but it's there. So. 3. "**Van and Earn move to LA with Lottie**" - this one I hope happens. that S4E7 story was so amazing. To have that only be anything else will break my heart. Which actually leads me to... 4. "**Van and Earn split**" - Don't want this to happen but there's been theories going around that Van and Earn will have an amicable break up after realizing that the love they share for Lottie is not enough to keep them together :( What are your last minute finale theories? Feel free to add yours in before the episode airs.Mines is: ‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt ‚Äòkidnap‚Äô your own dad. I don‚Äôt have time to explain it to you right now, but the word *kid* is in it. So mathematically, it‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù. My previous romantic relationship was basically scored with music from Sade.Unfortunately our relationship didn‚Äôt end in the best way, but this episode made me remember all of those beautiful moments I got to experience with her.Through all the episodes of Atlanta, I couldn‚Äôt figure out which one was my favorite.This one will not only be my favorite episode of Atlanta, but my favorite episode of television forever. It was like it was made just for me.Thank you, Atlanta. You truly are a beautiful show. Thank you so much for letting me remember what it was like to truly love someone with all my heart.Me ke aloha~ Golden Kaleo. That way if they don‚Äôt want it or they are unable to receive it, you can at least enjoy it for yourself üëç. Might be big fish, let me check.Is it really all that it‚Äôs cracked up to be?. Alright folks, I need all hands on deck for this one.There‚Äôs this guy whom I met at one of my gigs. Fellow musician and videographer. Super sweet dude.He explained to me that he‚Äôs houseless at the moment but would like to help me out in recording, videotaping, and documenting my music shows for me.Told him I was down to have him at my shows, but I want to help him out as well.My current plan is to get a gym membership for him to at least give him access to shower and stuff.I don‚Äôt make much as a musician, but I make enough to be able to buy him food when he comes down to my gig, and also give him some money from the tips I make.The main problem I‚Äôm struggling with is that I have no place to have him sleep since the place I‚Äôm staying at doesn‚Äôt allow overnight guests, but if you guys have any good ideas on that part, please lmk. He‚Äôs currently bouncing around airBnB‚Äôs and doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôll be once that is over.Any bit of advice would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask questions in the comments if you need more info about the situation.(To the admins: I‚Äôm posting this anywhere I can, but please lmk if this violates any rules and I‚Äôll delete it immediately.)Thanks in advance.Alright folks, I need all hands on deck for this one.There‚Äôs this guy whom I met at one of my gigs.

    The area right under my left eye (always my left eye) will temporarily twitch on and off for about 10mins, maybe a couple times per day. I don‚Äôt really mind it, per say, but it gets a bit embarrasing when I‚Äôm at work.I drink a half cup of coffee in the morning, and I thought it was the caffeine, so I cut it out for a week but the twitching persisted. Also, this twitching has only started to be common in the past couple of months, and prior to that I actually drank more coffee. I notice that its more likely to happen when I am tired, like at night or mid-day if I don‚Äôt consume any caffeine. Also happens momentarily when I wash my face and if I blink tightly.I think I drink a good amount of water, take multivitamin+calcium+vitamin d3+ magnesium glycinate+creatine daily. I get probably around 8hrs of sleep, and even on the days that I do get more sleep, it still persists. What am I to do? üò©Edit: my left eye-bag*. Hi all! I am interested in volunteering my time at a bleach clean up. Unfortunately it seems that most of them are located on the west coast (2-3 hrs away from me) or located down by Miami (way too far). I'm located by Tampa so somewhere on the gulf coast would be preferable, like Clearwater, St. Pete, etc. Also, it would have to be on the weekends as I work on the weekdays. If you know anything like this, or know where I could find more information, please lmk. Thank you in advance.I‚Äôm 24M and most of my male friends are single or have a girlfriend but one of them is married and has children already (he‚Äôs a year younger than me). I was catching up with him since I hadn‚Äôt seen him in years, and when he was telling me stories and whatever, he would say ‚Äúmy wife‚Äù cause I didn‚Äôt know his wife‚Äôs name. For some reason hearing that just sounds so cool and manly idk why. Like hearing ‚Äúmy girlfriend‚Äù ‚Äúmy partner‚Äù is common but hearing ‚Äúmy wife‚Äù for me is pretty unheard of. Not to mention him having a wedding band on his finger causes me a bit of envy lol.Have any of you guys felt like this? It might be more common to feel this way as a woman, but I never hear guys talking about this. There‚Äôs been slightly related questions asked on this sub, but not this one specifically. I‚Äôm interested in teas that have a high concentration of L-Theanine, and at least a moderate to high concentration of caffeine. If you have a specific brand/product you recommend that would be great also üòä. When I was in high school, I wasn‚Äôt the type to hang out on friday or weekend nights, so instead I would always stay in my room and have a ‚Äúmovie night.‚Äù Since I didn‚Äôt have school the next day, I‚Äôd be super excited to stay up later than usual while watching a movie and eating some popcorn.Now that I‚Äôm older, I can watch a movie whenever and stay up later, and even though I still find it enjoyable, it‚Äôs certainly not as exciting. Oh and also I‚Äôm more than likely to fall asleep in the middle of the movie lol. I grew up on the east coast and I haven't seen that many Japanese families growing up so I don't know if my mother's behavior is stereotypical of Japanese moms. I love her to death but she's always been a super clean freak and extremely frugal to the point where it's difficult to live with her. Are your guys' moms like that too?. Hi all, I bought my first ever car yesterday, it's a 2015 Honda Civic with 93k miles. I've never owned a car before and I want to make this thing last as long as possible. What are the things that I should do to for maintenance and proper upkeep? The only one I know of is to get a full synthetic oil change every 7.5k-10k miles.This thought was sparked by this tweet:https://twitter.com/ceosonson/status/1654981918717358080?s=46&t=Qleyk1gqreeukxFBtts9AANow, as deranged as it seems, it does make sense to not want you pepperonis cut. But, we also want our slices to be as similar in size as possible. Let‚Äôs assume that the pizza is a perfect circle. Let there be 2 parameters: # of slices and # of pepperonis. If those pepperonis are randomly placed on the pizza, is there an algorithm to find the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù way to cut the pizza so that the area of the slices are equal as possible? Does such a solution exist for the slices to be all equal? Is this solution unique? And how does this vary for the two parameters?.
    A cute little thing happened to me.I moved into a new apartment 6 months ago. Since then, I've been crushing on a neighbor I rarely meet. Her eyes are simply gorgeous.One day, I'm making dinner at around 8pm when I hear a knock on my door. I open it, and surprise, surprise, I see the neighbor in question. I live on the ground floor and she's just dropped her cigarette pack, and would like to check if it's fallen into my garden. She picks it up, we have a quick chat and she leaves.I was looking for a subtle way of getting to know her without making her feel uncomfortable, as neighborly relations can be tricky. So I bought an extra pack of cigarettes and put it in her letterbox with a note saying: "Don't drop this one!Yesterday, she came by and knocked on my door. She came in with a big smile and said "I think it's lovely" and "it made me laugh a lot" but "I can't accept it" as she handed me back the pack. On the other hand, she promised to "be more careful not to drop the next packages! She left fairly quickly afterwards.I take this interaction as a sign that she's not interested, but the fact that she took the time to return the package in person and appreciated the gesture warmed my heart. It's something that must have made her day.I've never been so happy to have bought a pack of cigarettes.Hello fellas, I had a series of bad streak this past year while dating. Even though I try to not think too much of it, it's hard to not let it affect my self esteem.Do you have any ideas how to not let it affect me ?. Hello everyone,So I'm a 26 years old Male. I injuried my right hand while doing MMA this monday, so 4 days ago. I did it because because I blocked a kick with my hand, that put my fingers in hyperextension.To be more precise, it's my middle finger. It hurts when I'm doing a hyperextension on the joint between the middle and proximal Phalanges. Finger don't swell.I immobilized the joint during two days. It hurts less but it still hurts a little.I wanted to know: * How long should I expect it to hurt ? * When will I be able to do mma again ? * Can I do weight lifting ?Thanks !. Hello tous le monde,J'habite une grande ville en province, en hyper centre, et je suis locateur de mon appart. Je gagne environ 2600e hyper net par mois, et paie mon loyer 675e par mois (600e de loyer + 75e de parking).A la base, en louant mon appartement, je pensais que le bail du parking √©tait indivisible de mon appartement, mais il s'av√®re que non. Je n'ai pas de voiture √† mon nom. J'h√©site beaucoup √† r√©silier ma place de parking. D'un c√¥t√©, c'est une somme vraiment non n√©gligeable. √áa fait presque 1000e par an. De l'autre, je suis en hyper-centre, et il n'y a pas de parkings √† proximit√©. J'ai pas vraiment de solutions pour quand je re√ßois. Les places parkings visiteurs de ma r√©sidence sont en permanence occup√©e, et toute la rue devant ma r√©sidence est en stationnement limit√©e...Des id√©es pour ce gouffre financier ?Merci,. Hey everyone,I've been lifting weight for two years now and wanted to go back to martial arts (I've trained muay thai for one year and a half, but only once a week, some years ago. Still very shitty at it though ). I went to a new mma gym near where I live, and I found the training... Intense ?I did only a boxing course.At first, we focused on warmup, then technique, then sparing, then a little bit of conditioning again.During the sparring, I felt like, my partners were more experienced than in my two previous gyms (which is good), but also went harder. Two guys went kind very hard, in particular.One of the two, in particular, stopped during the sparing and asked me to hit him in the head, because I spare lightly (I tend to stop before hitting, just touch, or sometime aim a little near the head, not the head directly). I did, and he hit me pretty good, and I got a nose bleed (first time in all my practice). We're the next day, and my nose still hurts a little. Felt a little bit light-headed during the sparing.I'm kinda scared to go back, especially considering that I have experience in boxing, and it went kinda, bad, I'm scared about Bjj or MMA. I want to learn, I'm not here to compete. But I might be a little bit paranoid (I'm working a desk job, so I tend to be very protective of my brain health). But at the same time, i'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not ?. Hello tout le monde ! Aujourd'hui, j'ai perdu ma carte d'identit√©.Un voisin l'a retrouv√©, ce qui m'a rendu plut√¥t content, m√™me si j'avais fait toutes les d√©marches (y compris prendre rendez-vous et payer le timbre fiscal) pour la faire refaire. J'avais rendez-vous demain √† la mairie. Sauf que, ce voisin a mis ma carte d'identit√©, au complet, sur whatsapp, sur une conversation de 120 personnes (conversation des voisin). Donc 120 personnes l'ont en m√©moire sur leur t√©l√©phone. 120 personnes ont donc une photo de ma carte d'identit√©.Je sais pas trop comment g√©rer le truc, et je ne vois pas vraiment de documents sur internet. √áa craint ?Est-ce que le meilleure move serait pas de quand m√™me d√©clarer la perte et de faire refaire ma carte ? (m√™me si ce serait mentir sur une d√©claration sur l'honneur).Hello,Je viens de voir mes p√©riodes de l'assurance retraite, et j'ai quatre mois o√π rien n'est mis (de Juin √† septembre inclus 2023).J'√©tais au ch√¥mage.C'est normal ?

Avant d'effectuer ce changement, j'aimerais prendre deux semaines de cong√©s.Mon employeur me propose de solder mes cong√©s plut√¥t que de les prendre, et donc d'avancer ma date de d√©mission.Est-ce que c'est plus avantageux de poser mes cong√©s ou de faire un solde de compte ?√Ä savoir que je suis sous convention Syntec, et quand je pose le vendredi, √ßa me prends deux jours.Edit: je me suis mal exprim√©.

Hello folks,So, I work as a software engineer. The pay is good (even though it's bad compared through United states, I work in Europe, in France) and my workplace tends to be a little bit toxic lately. We're way behind of schedules because of management and some dumbs architectures decisions. One higher up already burned out and had to take medical leave, and I'm sure other might pretty soon.I have more and more problem from disconnecting from my work. I have more trouble sleeping, feel fatigued all the time and don't enjoy my activities I used to enjoy anymore. I also find myself unmotivated to work. The stress is kind of getting me on my "down time" and I'm still thinking about my job.I'm also in the process of seeking new jobs. But in the meantime, do you have any advices on how to "disconnect" and to manage the stress of work on my off days ?. Hello everyone,So I was talking with that girl on Hinge yesterday. She was pretty, nice, intelligent, and very funny. She had very good vibe.But, she told me she had depression and eating disorders (nothing wrong with it, it just tend to make me uncomfortable because of past relationships with girls having the same illnesses that drained me, and she seems to be at a "low point" to be honest, not sure if that's the best moment for her to date). She told me that she cheated before, in her last relationship (which she regretted, but still worries me). She told me she was unemotionally available, that she wanted a relationship but didn't want to admit it to herself (while I'm really looking for a relationship, myself). It's usually hard for me to find a girl with who I do really connect or "vibe", so I'm doubting myself. Was I wrong to turn her down ?.

Hello tous le monde,Je viens d'emm√©nager dans un nouvel appartement. √Ä la signature du bail, je me suis rendu compte que le bail √©tait en faite deux bails: un pour une place de parking, un pour un appartement. L'addition des deux font bien le montant dans l'annonce (680‚Ç¨/mois), et la place me co√ªte 75‚Ç¨/mois. J'insiste sur le fait que ce sont deux bails s√©par√©s. Il est aussi mentionn√© sur le bail du parking que je ne peux pas sous louer.Le hic, c'est que je n'ai pas de voiture. Donc elle ne me sert √† rien.De l√†, j'ai 3 solution :- soit je garde la place, et elle me sert juste pour d√©charger des meubles 1 √† 2x par ans (ou pour la voiture des potes), et je perds 75‚Ç¨/mois, soit 900‚Ç¨ / an, pour "rien".- soit je r√©silie la place, mais je pense que le propri√©taire me demandera de partir au bout de 3 ans (car il voudra forc√©ment louer √† quelqu'un qui acceptera de louer sa place, m√™me si beau s√©par√©).- soit je sous-loue: j'ai trouv√© quelqu'un de la r√©sidence d'int√©ress√©, pour 50e / mois. Malheureusement, le bail du parking indique que je ne peux pas la sous louer, du coup ce serait "au black". Apparemment, ce serait des gros risque au point de vue l√©gal, ce qui est frustrant car √ßa arrangerait tous le monde.Quel serait la meilleure solution ?. Hello tous le monde !Je m'appr√™te √† prendre un nouvel appartement en location mais l'agence immobili√®re me demande d'effectuer le virement de tous (frais, caution, ect) avant la signature du bail (et m√™me la r√©ception de celui-ci). C'est l√©gal ?Si non, sur quel texte me baser pour la r√©ponse √† celle-ci ?Le mail que j'ai re√ßu de l'agence : [https://imgur.com/a/M9cUZj0](https://imgur.com/a/M9cUZj0)√áa me stress vu que je suis cens√© effectuer le virement demain, vu que signature du bail jeudi, mais ils disent tous ce qu'est pas forc√©ment l√©gal en ligne...Pareil, ils semblent imposer le virement automatique pour payer le loyer...Hello tous le monde,Je compte enfin l√¢cher mon appart √©tudiant et recherche un nouvel appart √† louer et me pose la question de quel budget je devrais allouer. Je suis ing√©nieur informatique, √† 37k‚Ç¨, en province, ce qui repr√©sente environ 2400‚Ç¨ net, et 2100‚Ç¨ net apr√®s imp√¥ts, soit un budget d'environ 700‚Ç¨ par mois pour louer si on applique la r√©gles des 1/3, m√™me si j'aimerais √™tre plus aux environ de 600/650.Un appart me plait beaucoup, mais il est un poil hors budget (716‚Ç¨ C.C.). Son gros avantage √©tant qu'il est en hyper-centre, ce qui est int√©ressant puisque je n'ai pas de voiture. Avec √©l√©ctricit√© / chauffage, √ßa me ferait 800‚Ç¨ de d√©penses incompressible, je me demande si c'est bien sage vis-√†-vis de mon salaire actuel et ma volont√© d'√©pargner agressivement. La seule chose qui me ferait pencher vers la location de ce dernier, c'est que je n'ai pas de v√©hicule (et ne pr√©voit pas d'en acheter un). Le surcro√Æt de co√ªt par rapport √† mon budget initial repr√©sente 600 √† 1200‚Ç¨, ce qui est facilement inf√©rieur au co√ªt mensuel d'un v√©hicule.Hello, hello,Je poste ici car j'ai du mal √† trouver des infos pr√©cises sur le sujet.J'ai sign√© un CDI en tant qu'ing√©nieur Fullstack il y a environ deux mois. Je suis sur une stack full Js serverless (React / typescript / aws (cdk)) et suis r√©mun√©r√© environ 37k, en province. J'ai environ 2 ans d'exp√©rience maintenant (mais j'ai un dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur robotique, pas informatique g√©n√©ral, si √ßa joue).Je me demande si ma r√©mun√©ration est congruente avec le march√© ?. Hello hello,Actuellement en CDI, j'aimerais progresser techniquement tout en ayant un compl√©ment de revenus. La freelance (que j'avais d√©j√† effectuer auparavant) me semble un bon moyen de parvenir √† ces deux objectifs. Mon employeur est d'accord (c'√©tait une condition √† la signature de mon CDI).Je ne trouve cependant pas de mission √† effectuer le soir / weekend (je cherche sur malt et comett.co). Est-ce que vous auriez des recommandations ? Je suis plus sur une stack react/node/Aws/typescript. Hello fellas,So, I've been using online dating but wants to quit, but I don't have any alternatives I would find satisfying. My hobbies tends to be masculine or solitary (Weight lifting / guitar / boxing) and when I go out with fellas, we tends to only hangout with other men. My professional environment is also very male dominant (I suppose it's the perk of working in computer sciences). I've been going to cultural events / museum, and that's the only social thing where I tends to meet women my age.So... What would be the best alternative to online dating for a young men in a male dominated social circle / professional life ?. Hello,Actuellement ing√©nieur Fullstack avec 2 ans d'exp√©rience, je pense de plus en plus √† l'expatriation (principalement pour fuir le syst√®me des ESN). J'aurais aim√© savoir si certains d'entre vous ont franchi le pas, et si oui, quel a √©t√© votre exp√©rience ?. So... I've been back on online dating and have been kind of burned out by it (between the ghosting, the lack of matchs and first dates that don't go anywhere).It's my only outlet, since I do work in computer science, have mainly guys friends and do mainly masculine or lonely hobbies (weight lifting / boxing / guitar). At the same time, still being on online dating depress me a little, because of my lack of success, but I know that if I don't try, it won't go anywhere...Hello everyone,I want to do E2E testing on an application with AWS and Cypress.Do you know if there is any way to migrate a DynamoDb database from cypress / local testing ? It's needed for test-interdependance.Hello,I'm the happy owner of a pixel 6.I just remarked that the magic eraser used to be here but is not present anymore.I tried to update the system and clear the cache of the photo and camera apps but it's still not showing.Any ideas why it happens ?. Hello everyone,So I had a little problem while changing the thermal paste of an old laptop. When assembling it back up, it smelled really bad, like something short circuited.And indeed, there was a little short circuit on the board. Problem is that, the connector that short circuited was right below the battery and did damage it a little bit.(Here is a photo)[https://imgur.com/a/MlZEXGQ] . Only plastic seems to have been impacted, melted a little.Can I use it or should I dispose it carefully ?. So, two days ago, I was at an exhibition, and one of the hosts was a super cute girl. I talked to her briefly to get the direction and we both smiled a lot.I saw her again at the home of the exhibition, talking to two of her coworkers, but I didn't have the guts to go see her once again. I caught her staring and smiling at me, too.So... How do you get over the regret of not approaching someone ? I've been beating myself up for the past day...Hello,J'ai eu une proposition d'une start-up et j'h√©site pas mal √† la prendre ou non.

    Hey there, pretty much what the title says. I'm looking for websites/companies that are open to hiring remote positions.I'm a Graphics Designer (expert in Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma and Premiere Pro)If you know any companies/website that is hiring remote graphic designers please share.My expectation is around $500 per month. Thanks!. Last night I was sweating thinking about how will I pay the installment that's due on 5th of October. I had taken a personal loan from the bank some time ago and I have been paying all my installments on time. All was going well until I had a sudden tooth issue that needed to be taken care of ASAP. The dental costs put a huge dent in my wallet! I didn't pay using my credit card which I think I should have...I get paid on 9th every month and my installment was due on 5th which is tomorrow.I literally had nothing in my account. Clueless of how to pay the installment, I receive a message that says 500$ is credited in my bank account. Obviously I was surprised and my thoughts got interrupted by a phone call from my friend.He told me that he transferred the money to my account. I had given him 500$ some time back. Well he had asked for some funds for his mother's cancer treatment and I had given him 500$ without expecting to see my money back. And I never asked him about it either, I just forgot about it totally.Anyways, he told me that his mother is doing good now and she's cancer free (woo hoo!), also he got promoted to a new high paying job.Besides that, his mum had asked to sell of their ancestral land when they were in need of funds and turns out they got a great deal with the land.So he and his mum decided to use the funds to pay back to everyone who helped him with the treatment. The first thing I did after the call was to pay the installment. Phew it was a close call!I just thought of sharing this you all. Thanks for reading!. Hello everyone!I would like to know your thoughts on uTest. Is it legit? How much can you potentially earn from this app?Any inputs would be great!Thanks!. Hi,So I'm currently unsure and confused if we are allowed to replicate a website strictly for tutorial purposes.My idea is to create a Figma Tutorial video where I will demonstrate how to recreate the UI and UX Design of any website.Does anyone have any link to any Guided Meditation that was/is in Osho's voice?Kindly share! Thank You!. Hi!Firstly let me be honest, I'm not a marketing professional, but I used to assist a Marketing Executive based in US.They used to offer Google Ad Services so they used to ask me to do the following:1. Find businesses that are in a particular location using Google Maps.2. Find out who the founder/CEO of the business.3. Find the founder's LinkedIn and email.4. Enter all the details in a Google Sheet. Typically I was working for 30 minutes everyday except on weekends. On an average I would collect ~ 200 leads per month.I was getting paid $35/month for this. So I was wondering if anyone out here wanted this kind of a service, I would be happy to help!As for payment I can only accept PayPal.I'm curious to know your stories about how you first learned about Osho. I will go first:Alright, so I'm from Goa, India and I come from a very religious Hindu family. I was extremely "religious" too.In around 2007, someone shared a video of Osho talking about the word "fuck". Its a hilarious video and I was in engineering college back then and we all laughed about the video. And that's that.Then I moved to Pune in 2011 because I got a job in a software company. One of my friends lived close to German Bakery Koregaon Park, which is close to Osho Ashram. So I passed by the ashram several times...and saw many sanyasis walking around in the maroon robe. Somehow the slippers caught my attention, I think they are made from jute? Anyways I bought those slippers from just outside the ashram, from street vendors.Coincidentally, my team lead who is a native of Pune was saw me outside the Ashram. Next day, he started joking like "Oh did you go to the Osho ashram for sex orgies?", I laughed it off and said no. He later went on to say how there are several orgies that take place there and talked about Osho in a way like as though he is some Sex Guru.I didn't know anything about Osho at that point and neither was I interested so I just ignored and carried out my day to day life. A few years later, I moved back to Goa because I had a job that allowed me to work remotely. Things were going good but somehow I was feeling a bit empty from within. Then one day randomly a video popped up on my YouTube and I started watching it. The video was not from official YouTube channel of Osho. The video was a compilation of jokes on Mulla Nasruddin. I found it funny and I started looking for more videos. Then one day I listened to a video that hurt my Hindu sentiments. I grew angry towards Osho, and because of other's opinions about him I started thinking he is a con man and stopped watching his videos.After a few days I found myself depressed. One day I got a YouTube video recommendation of the discourse "Bheed Ghulam Chahti Hai". My whole perspective about Osho changed from there, I realised how I was wrong for my earlier assumption of Osho being non-religious...in fact the more I listened to his discourses the more I realised the real definition of religiousness...I started listening to him everyday, his words, his wisdom and the pauses in his speech brought me so much fulfillment. It felt like I'm meditating when I'm listening to him, it still feels like that...My attitude towards life changed and I felt so much lighter. I also started reading his books and found a lot of wisdom there but listening to Osho and watching him speak is still so much better. Alright, I think I will stop writing now. I'm curious to know your story! Please let me know! Thank you.Edit: Fixed some punctuation mistakes for better readability.Sometime ago I had listened to a couple of videos by Osho in Hindi on some YouTube channel. I loved these videos and often watched it again and again because of the deep message. But unfortunately, seems like that video and channel has been taken down for some reason and I have been searching for the videos all over the internet without any result.So I need your help to find this video...In one video Osho recites a poem with the words"Khojna hai talashna hai, Jeevan keval unka hai jinke antaratma me anveshan hai, astitva keval unka hai, Jo Satya ki nirantan sodh me lage hai, jinohone ek shan ko bhi ye baat bhulaiyi nahi ki hum kahi se aaye hai aur hame kahi jaana hai..."In second video he says something like this: "Maut ko saamne rakh kar jo vyakti jeevan ko jeeta hai woh sanyasi hai, aur maut ko kinare rakh kar jo vyakti jeevan ko jeeta hai woh sansari hai...ab maut ko saamne rakh kar jeena kathin kaam hai. Himmat na hogi..."If anyone of you have any idea about these two videos, I will appreciate your help if you can send me the links!Thank you üôèPS: forgive my Hindi transcription...not a native Hindi speaker but I do enjoy/prefer listening to Osho in Hindi. Hi,I have been to Hanoi multiple times and have fallen in love with the city. I wish to settle in Hanoi and make it my forever home.

I finally found a remote job that pays decent salary, but their contract has this clause that I cannot quit the company before completing 1 year. I was excited to join this company but ever since I recieved this contract in email, I have lost the excitement. Thinking of avoiding this. Curious to see what you all think of this.Hello everyone,I'm from India and currently I'm taking up a TESOL course.So far everything is going well, but I'm a bit concerned about my Indian accent. I mean it's not that bad at least, that's what what I have been told by my clients/friends who are native speakers of English. But I'm worried if this would be a deciding factor when I look for an English teacher jobs in a non-English speaking country. Any advice in this regard would be highly appreciated! Thank you!.
    I've been trying to learn how to write lyrics a lot like Nic D's "Icee Pop", "Cotton Candy", and "Fine Apple". I love the quick snappy, witty lines.It doesn't have to be strictly his vibe, just his sort of "flow". I even found [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amzez1Z06Zs) recently (big time throwback) that I liked a lot and had that quick sort of snappy rap.I've been trying to learn how to write lyrics a lot like Nic D's "Icee Pop", "Cotton Candy", and "Fine Apple".

Does anyone recognize what song I'm referring to?I believe the song was like late 90s or early 2000s maybe? It's been driving me crazy.I (26M) work from home full time, but work part time at a local club taking photos (about once a month or so).When we were wrapping up last night, a girl on the rail finally got my attention and asked if she could have my number. As a guy, being expected to make the first move, this doesn‚Äôt happen very often. Made my night, especially since I‚Äôve been a little down on myself in the dating department lately.Just wanted tell someone. And to any other girls wondering about this, yes, some guys do appreciate you making the first move sometimes. (:. Pretty new to this sub, nice to meet you guys! In the coming months, I'm hoping to finish up my woodshop at home and get started on a small project.Lately, I've been getting into music production, learning how to mix and master within Ableton. Have been absolutely loving it and am wanting to build a new subwoofer for my setup. Currently, I have two Yamaha HS7s with an HS8S. The setup sounds great, but the subwoofer lacks the low-end I'm looking for (nice flat response, but begins to roll off around 60hz or so).I'm considering getting a 10 inch subwoofer (likely from Parts Express) and building either a ported or 4th order enclosure so that I can get it tuned down to the 30s and 40s. I built car audio setups for about 5 or 6 years and absolutely love this range of sub bass.I was wondering if you guys have any good experiences with specific subs, or any ideas for an enclosure? The ported enclosure would be just so I could dig lower, but if I could figure out the calculations, a 4th order may give me a flatter response down low.I (26M) have a really great relationship with my grandfather. Someone I've always looked up to a lot and share a lot of great memories with.Was just wondering if you all might have some great memories you'd like to share? (:. Have been playing guitar for about 6 years or so and just picked up piano. By no means good enough to play an open mic, but having a hard time finding friends who are down to meet up and jam out. Any good ways of finding these people?. So my roommates and I love to play board games while winding down from work. One of them, however, is ULTRA competitive. I mean, when we played Monopoly, he would tell us where we landed the second the dice hit the board and why he chose certain properties based of statistical probability. Basically, he hates\* to lose.His girlfriend and I are looking for a new game to play that we can all have a fresh start at. Something not too drawn out (less than 2 hours or so), but has some sort of statistical thought behind it like Monopoly or Risk (even if those are horrible examples, I hope you get what I'm putting down).We just tried Azul for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was fun, but would like something a little more complex. Does anyone have any suggestions?. After graduating college, I began working at one of the Big 4 for a very specialized consulting practice. Shortly after, I finished my CPA and obtained my license. I don't want to say exactly what we do, but we don't work with any\* financial statements. We basically audit metrics used in business. After 2.5 years (1 year as senior), I've been heavily considering leaving and trying something new. I don't see myself staying here for the long run and feel like I may be digging myself into a hole pursuing this specialization. Am I making a mistake by not getting financial experience, for example in audit or industry accounting? For more context, I've been networking with recruiters and potential employers a lot the past month or so. Even with my CPA license and Big 4 experience, it doesn't seem like many places are interested because I don't have "financials" experience. I'm also open to completely different directions as well, just not sure what's out there. I'm extremely\* extroverted and love talking to people/working on projects collaboratively. I've even considered switching to sales or recruiting, but just not sure if I could find a salary even close to what I'm making now.After graduating college, I began working at one of the Big 4 for a very specialized consulting practice.

I started off by DJing for a little while. Had a really\* interesting perspective shift during this time. It felt as if I was experiencing a different version of my life with every song that played. In a way, it sort of helped me tackle one of my childhood fears.I was always afraid of growing up to be an average guy. Someone who never really accomplished much and lived a very mundane life.These "versions" of my life were basically on the spectrum of how "average" or "extraordinary" I could live up to be. But in doing so, it made me realize that living an average life, one without chasing money, fame, or highs, might be the most enjoyable outcome. The one where I would be able to spend the most time with the people I love and help to build up a strong community with those around me.After that, I laid on my bed and just enjoyed the present moment I was in. Everything I had worked towards so far. Then my roommate's cat had jumped on me and, me being deep in thought, was NOT ready to be confronted with a large orange fluffball. Great way to end the trip lolol.Hey guys,Fairly new to Serum and going crazy trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong here.I keep trying to increase the release on Envelope 1, but it resets to 0.0ms every\* time a note is triggered.I've looked everywhere, and know it's gotta be an easy fix, but just can't figure it out. Any guidance?Thanks!. Hi everyone! Lately, I (26m) have been reconsidering my career choice. To be fair, I was never fully sure in the first place. To make things short and easy, I'll just provide some background:**Experience in My "Field"**Bachelor's in AccountingCPA LicenseGoing on 2.5 years at a Big 4 Firm (1.5 as Staff, promoted to Senior August 2022)**Other Experience**6-7 years providing photo/video services under my LLC4-5 years of professional car audio installation (worked at two different shops)2-3 years (seasonal) providing professional finish woodworking servicesSome concrete experienceTwo restaurants (front and back of house)Recruitment Chairman of my fraternity (actually applied for a recruitment internship during\* my accounting internship, they said no lol)Recently have been learning music production and DJing**My Struggle**I guess right now I'm in a place where I'm just really lost and unsure what my next move should be honestly... I mean, my situation right now is pretty incredible. I'll be making 6 figures by August more than likely, paying $650/month in rent while living with a high school friend, and able to save roughly $2k/month for a house.Realistically, I don't need a lot of money... Nor do I care to retire early. I actually love\* working. And later in life have already decided I really\* want to be a teacher. But, I do highly prioritize having the freedom to do the work I\* want to do. Meaning, be able to afford to pay off a house, and possibly help pay off my parents too (around $230k home, probably half paid off).Right now, my main concern is that I'm not being put to my full potential. My soft skills are honestly incredible and I'm the type of person who can befriend just about any stranger I stumble upon. Funny story, I accidentally bumped into a guy while in NYC doing accounting on-sites. He invited me back to his table with some friends, we talked had a great night, exchanged numbers, and later found out he was the former Chief Investment Officer of Black Rock Investing. Just an example of a random day lol.I love my parents to death, but neither of them really have any experience in the business world. I was hoping to talk to someone who might be able to help steer me in a better direction that I could find some deeper purpose and fulfillment.Realistically, my biggest\* struggle right now is loneliness. Both romantically and platonically. As I mentioned, I'm not an awkward guy, my therapist agrees lol. I just miss seeing people. And I've already decided that if I can still make a 6 figure salary, I would maintain my normal cost of living and dedicate anything over that to bettering my community. Specifically, to help improve our nation's mental health crisis, which I believe stems primarily from loneliness.If you've made it this far, I really appreciate your time. Any inputs or perspectives would be greatly appreciated. (:. **Background**I'm currently 26 years old, have a bachelor's in accounting, CPA license, and have been working at a Big 4 accounting firm for going on 2.5 years now (1.5 as staff, promoted senior August 2022).After my time at the firm, I'm heavily reconsidering my career path. I've really tried to stick it out to give it an "honest effort", try to learn my job, get used to the ups and downs, but it just doesn't feel right. Best way I can describe "this feeling" is like forcing yourself to do something that just doesn't make sense to you. Like, imagine joining a professionally dance team, not knowing how to dance, and them just telling you "figure it out" mid performance. That's the kind of anxiety this job gives me most days lol.**Alternatives**Going Public to Private is always an option, but really unsure if this would be any better, especially considering the pay cut it seems like.I also own an LLC providing photo/video services. Before you say, "well that explains why you're burned out", this is realistically my "hobby". I just fortunately get paid to have fun and do that. I'm just not sure if I would get paid enough to replace a full-time salaried job honestly...One of the things I struggle with most here honestly though is WFH. I do enjoy it, but I'm extremely\* extroverted and love talking to people. I actually applied for a "recruitment internship" during\* my accounting internship at the same firm (they said no lol).So I've considered this route too.I don't know honestly. Feeling very lost and confused as to where I should try to go to next.Currently have a Novation 61-key Launchkey, but looking for something that‚Äôs fully weighted.Went to Sam Ash today and tried a few. The Roland FP-90X is the one that caught my eye. Just had a couple questions though.Would anyone recommend any other model over this one? Anything I should consider?. Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place to ask, but figured it'd be a good place to start. I was wondering if there's any sort of music library that would allow you to store songs and notate them in a sort? In a sense to analyze some of your favorite songs and learn how their grooves/sound design works?So think of it sort of like Serato in a way, but you could leave markers/selections of points or regions of a song that you really like. Whether that be a specific synth sound the artist might've used or the groove they created.Just have been trying to find a better way to take notes and analyze some of my favorite songs. If anyone can steer me in a better direction for this, or a better method you use for this, it would be greatly appreciated it!. Hope this hasn't been asked a ridiculous amount of times, but had a hard time finding a close enough related thread.**My Goal**Looking to gradually build a portable PA system that I can take places and set up "pop-up" DJ setups. Not for any specific parties or events, just really anything.We want to hang at the beach for a few hours? Bring the setup. Go camping? Bring the setup. Just really a portable way to jam and vibe together. Could be groups of 4-5 in a backyard or 30-50 people at a beach.Because I want to have this flexibility, I'm not looking so much for "cheap budget brands". I'm ok with investing the money into it.**Plans So Far**I've been looking around for awhile and have been leaning towards the QSC KW Series and K.2 Series. I don't have a ton of experience with PA speakers, but have liked the QSC products when I have worked with them.Was looking specifically at the 12 inch drivers in these lines for a mix between having enough for the low-end, but also being somewhat portable. I would likely start with one speaker, then two, then eventually a subwoofer. Looking at getting the Pioneer RX3 to match with it.**Questions**Was wondering if anyone has anything good or bad to say about these two QSC lines? Also if anyone has any other brands they would recommend more?Also, best way of powering them? I know the easy answer would be a portable generator. To that, I would want to have one fairly quiet, but am more so wondering how much power I would need to at least get two speakers and the board up and running?I was wondering if I wanted to avoid to generator, assuming I don't have power outlets available, if solar panels and a battery may be an option? Even if they may be higher quality premium ones? Just a thought and wanted to run it by you guys.Thanks for your time and consideration!. Hey guys!I'm looking to build a sub enclosure for my studio and am looking for amplifier recommendations. I haven't found many studio subwoofers that will hit the lower frequencies (i.e., 28-40hz) as well as I'd like it to. Yeah, the Yamaha HS8s does have a frequency response down to 20hz, but I know it won't hit those low frequencies well. Looking for more of a 10 or 12 inch woofer on 250-1,000 watts.*Current Setup*Running Ableton off my Macbook Pro running audio to a FocusRite 2i2 connected to two Yamaha HS7s. Looking to upgrade my FocusRite interface to a Universal Audio soon, but it'll do for now.Since I'm running the HS7s, I'm looking for an amp that will accept XLR or 1/4" jack connections. Preferably one that has pass-throughs. But I can figure something out if it doesn't.*What I've Found*[Dayton Audio APA1200DSP](https://www.parts-express.com/Dayton-Audio-APA1200DSP-1200-watt-Power-Amplifier-with-Integrated-Digital-Signal-Processing-300-1000?quantity=1)This has been the best one I've found so far. I found some reviews saying it doesn't push out as much power as it claims though which worries me about quality. Everything else seems pretty good though.##### [SpeakerPower SP1-700](https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/AMPS/SpeakerPower-SP1-700-Subwoofer-Amplifier)Here's another option I found, along with a similar "Hypex" brand on this same site. Not sure what to think about build quality with these amps either.*Conclusion*Really just looking for anyone who has experience with these amps, plate amps or rack amps. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!. It seems like people always talk about how younger kids have so much energy. That as you get older, you simply don't have as much energy as you used to. What if this was less correlated with age and more related to the amount of novel experiences you seek in your daily life?As a kid, everything\* is novel. You experience new things on a daily basis. Whether it's as simple as new classes every six months or learning about sex for the first time. But as we get older, we fall into repetitive ruts and don't seek out novel experiences.Not sure where I was going with this, just found it odd because no matter how much sleep you get, you can oftentimes feel exhausted. And I'm starting to think that "excitement", or novelty, plays a larger role in our energy levels throughout life as well.Does anyone have any recommendations for a good plate amplifier for a DIY subwoofer in a music studio? Would need to be compatible with XLR cables so that it could connect to my Yamaha HS7s and audio interface.The only real options I can find so far is this one, along with the 250W counterpart:[https://www.parts-express.com/Dayton-Audio-SPA500DSP-500W-Subwoofer-Plate-Amplifier-with-DSP-300-8012?quantity=1](https://www.parts-express.com/Dayton-Audio-SPA500DSP-500W-Subwoofer-Plate-Amplifier-with-DSP-300-8012?quantity=1)Was hoping to build my own subwoofer cabinet with a 12inch subwoofer running 500-1,000 watts RMS.I've been really interested in learning how to use session view better, but am having trouble finding lessons on it. It feels like the majority of what I find on YouTube is a basic breakdown of what it is, rather than people showing how to get better at using it.I'd really like to learn how to use it like Ben Bohmer. He has a couple videos, but I was wondering if anyone knows anyone else I could look into on YouTube?. My dad gave me his old Sansui 8080. It has always worked well, until recently. For some reason the left channel will occasionally start acting funny where it will begin with soft static until it starts getting worse. The left power output meter will begin bouncing up and down pretty randomly until it starts getting past 50-100w. It will usually do this for awhile, but on a rare occasion it can throw itself into protect mode.I've opened the receiver up and checked for blown fuses, blown capacitors, or any other noticeable marks of burns or bad soldering joints. Can't seem to find much. I have a fairly basic understanding of circuits, but am not super familiar with these receivers like I know some of you probably are.Any ideas what may be causing this left channel to bounce around like this?. Hey guys! New to the subreddit, but was hoping to see if anyone had a used turntable available that they'd like to sell? I'm located in Tampa, FL in the 33559 zip code area!Open to options, still not sure what I want. Just wanted to see if anyone had anything available. Looking to pair it with a Sansui 8080 receiver.Thanks!. Just had a quick question and was curious since I'm not very experienced in coding yet.I was wondering if there was any way to make a "pokeball" display that updates live from Pokemon Go?So basically, you have a pokemon on Pokemon Go with stats. Is there any way to frame a display run off an arduino that pulls the pokemon's gif, displays it on a monitor, and could also pull like its level over to display? As you leveled it up, it would update automatically?Not sure if this is possible, but want to understand what it would take to make it work. Like would you need to be able to connect to Pokemon Go's internal servers to retrieve that data? Or would it really just require like a path to the app along with your login credentials?Just curious and wanting to learn more to try building some fun projects! Any advice on this would be great!Thanks!. At the library and currently having a mental breakdown while trying to study for my REG exam this upcoming Monday.I started studying for the CPA in January 2020. It has been an absolute shit show since then considering my first exam (REG ironically) was scheduled shortly after Prometric started shutdowns due to COVID.At first, it was delayed to April. Then to May. Then until further notice. I stopped studying because we had no clue when it would be available again. Of course, June it finally came back in my area. I had two options. Schedule for one week out or schedule 2 months out while knowing my NTS for FAR would expire about a week after that. Took REG a week out, failed with a 71.After that I took FAR, passed it with an 84. Took REG again, failed it. Took a break with AUD, failed with a 74. This is when I started full time with a big 4 firm. Took AUD a second time, passed with a 79. Took BEC, passed with a 75. Another attempt at REG after being totally burned out, failed once again.This will be my 4th attempt at REG and I'm beyond through with this. It has consumed my mental, emotional, and physical health. My bonus will expire in January and my FAR credit expires in March. I don't know if I even have the mental capacity to take another attempt at it if I fail this go around.But anyways, thanks for coming to my rant. Regulation Satan is calling to remind me I belong to him now down in hell. Any support or advice would be greatly appreciated.Started studying for the CPA in January 2020. First attempt at REG was scheduled for end of March. COVID pushed that exam back to about June and ended up failing it with a 71 due to the craziness of rescheduling and cancellationsEnded up taking FAR, AUD, and BEC, passed those three and my FAR credit will expire in March 2022. Attempted REG two other times since then, but failed both times since I started working at my firm and had little time to study. Been really trying to hammer it down the past couple weeks and feeling better about this last attempt which will be September 20th. Scheduled some vacation the upcoming week and following week to make sure I'm well prepared. Was just wondering if anybody have any last pieces of advice for taking REG? I'm using Becker and have done nearly every MCQ practice for every module throughout the program (a little over 1,000 questions). I've kept track of all of my scores and every area I should look back on during final review. I plan on going through some simulations once I finish these.Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated since tax and business law were my weakest areas during my undergraduate! Mental and emotional support is always greatly appreciated as well haha!.
    I walked to the Starbucks after work today. There were two girls in front of me, they looked like they just got out from school. The Starbucks employee told them something along the lines of how their policy states they can‚Äôt stay in the building because they were under the age of 18. Cool. So I‚Äôm next, I order my drink and the employee tells me the same thing about their policy. I just laugh it off and that I‚Äôm 22. Both of the employees at the counter have surprised looks on their faces. One of the employees said that I looked 15. I could tell that he was kind of embarrassed so I‚Äôm just laughing with them. I know that I have a young looking face, but to be mistaken as a 15 year old‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm short too. The employee then said that I had great skin and I‚Äôll look 20 while in my 40s so I guess there‚Äôs a bright side to it.
    I (F17) am moving out soon, and I know absolutely nothing about cars other than how to check tire pressure and other easy things üò≠. Before I move out I want to learn more about cars(and life in general, but for now, cars.)I've heard lots of jokes about women getting ripped off and stuff at car shops because they don't know much. But I don't want that to happen to me, and even be able to do some of it myself. I also think cars are really cool and want to know more about how they work.Also why do people hate teslas? is it just because of who created/owns it or is there actually a reason?Please leave knowledge/advice I should know about cars in the comments I'd appreciate it a lot. Also I'm sorry if this was the wrong place to post this I wasn't sure if it should be here or in a car thing. I have ADHD, and I guess because of that it's really hard for me to remember things. It's frustrating especially with school or remembering things for people I love.Sometimes my boyfriend will tell me like he has a test tomorrow and i'm like oh what kind or something and he tells me he's told me 3 times and that I replied the same every time.It really feels like he's messing with me. I trust him more than anyone so i always have listened and believed him but i never remember these things.When we remember something differently i always just believe him because of my memory problems. is this the right thing to do? even if i really have no memory of what he's saying?I think he's amazing. I do trust him and don't think he would lie seriously, but he does have some problems himself, like thinking he's better/ smarter than most people. He also is a jokester. So I sometimes think he might be telling me something wrong so he looks better or just for a joke?I would really appreciate help on what to do.I (17F) wanted to do something for my boyfriend (17M) for national boyfriend's day. I decided to get him roses, chocolates, and a bear. He has never accepted gifts well, even things I really thought he would like, like a lego bonsai tree. But oh boy, he hated the flowers. They arrived right before he got home from work, so his mom saw them first. He assumed I sent them when she told him, but told her to throw them away. He didn't tell her he knew they were from me or anything. When he told me he was piisseeddd and i was like they are for national boyfriends day and he's like yea whatever üôÑHe got home and his mom like read the card which I just put "happy national boyfriends day!" But she knew they were from me then and she was confused why he didn't appreciate it. He was very mad and i just kept apologizing because i didn't know what to do üò≠Then he was just mad for so long, he gave away the chocolates to his step dad and the roses to his mom. He kept the bear though which is nice. He bought me a game on steam to try to give me my money back. üòû I didn't want to accept it but knew he would be irritated if I didn't. Anyway now everything is okay, his mom made him apologize and everything. Just wanted to share the story because it's kinda silly.
    Friends, the office, the big bang theory, parks and recreation, Brooklyn 99, silicon valley.I'd basically enjoy anything as long as it's long. Please don't suggest Seinfeld and modern family.I never explicitly put on any of her songs until this afternoon. I have wanted to keep away from her because I had thought she was just another overhyped artist with a teenage fanbase. This afternoon however, I decided to actually give her a try. I opened Spotify and I listened to some of her most famous songs, and oh my god, I am blown away, she is SO GOOD. I have honestly been missing out. I don't know why but listening to her brought out so many emotions, and I cried at least twice. HOW IS SHE DOING THIS?????. Hello. I'm a solo game developer. I'm currently developing a 3D game and I have a very specific problem, and I wonder if there is any math tool/subject that I can read about that could help me solve it. This might not make sense at all, so please forgive any shortcomings in my explanation.Basically, my problem realted to calculating the surface area of an object, where a discrete section of it has a larger "weight".My problem is extremely specific and it will take a long time to explain, so let me give you an example:Suppose that I'm a farmer and I want to sell my farm. To set a price for it, I measure the area of my farm, and let's say I assign 500 dollars to each meter square.However, part of my farm is somehow better (maybe the dirt is better or something I have no clue how farms work), and so I actually want to assign a higher price for each meter square of this part, say 600. So now, let's say I have 100 meter square of land, but my value isn't 100 * 500, because part of it is more expensive. My value is (80 * 500)+(20 * 600).So an object seemingly has a certain surface area, but if we consider another angle or another dimension, the value of this surface area increases. (I know this might not make sense).My question is whether there exists a better way to calculate, represent, or express such as system. Anything will do really. Thanks a lot.Sorry if the title confused you. Basically I am studying computational complexity theory on my own right now, and for every little thing that I learn I find myself playing around with it. For example just a few days ago I learned about NP-Completeness, and I immediately started to attempt to prove that some problems that I came up on my own were NP-complete. Note that I did that without first having a deep understanding of the subject, or without first checking out a lot of proofs. Of course I will continue to study it, but I'm just wondering if there is any downside to this. It's like I learn a concept and I immediately start thinking about doing stuff with it. I just feel like I get excited too quickly and I'm not patient enough to wait and gain a deep understanding before I start thinking about doing something with it on my own.As someone who pirates all movies and have never paid to see one (unless going to the cinema), I don't get how people watch the majority of movies. I mean, let's say your friend recommends a movie to you, and you wanna watch it, how do you do it? Most streaming services have only a small subset of movies, and unless you're paying for all of them, how do you watch movies? Do you buy each individual movie?. Hello! So lately when I open Google it consistently gives me reCAPCTHAs to solve and I noticed, as you can see in the image I've linked below, it shows my "my" IP address, only it's not my IP Address. I googled the IP address and apparently it belongs to my ISP. Is this normal? https://imgur.com/a/HyURXhV. Hello, I recently bough a Yamaha C40, and I noticed that the action increases across the fretboard. For example on the first fret the action is about 3 mm, while it's about 6 mm on the 10th string. Is this normal? If not then what could be the cause?. I spent about a year building up my Elo on chesscom to 1200, then it went down to 1100 soon after, no big deal. I stayed at that level for several months. But I have lost about 150 points in the last month. Currently I am getting absolutely destroyed by 950s. I don't know what happened. There's a friend of mine that I play with every other day. About a month ago I'd absolutely destroy him, currently he wins 4/5 of the games we play. Has anyone experienced this? If so how did you overcome it? I'd appreciate any advice/tip.The official one on play store just sucks. It's infested with ads, I mean there are SOOOO many ads it's just crazy, and it's so slow, it takes ages just to load the game. I just want a simple Tetris game that I can start playing right away when I have a craving.I'm studying computer science and engineering. Where I live not many tech companies offer internships directly (as in on their website). The ones who do though only hire people who have completed 6 semesters in college, and I have completed 3 soon to be 4. So I was wondering if I can just email companies and ask if they can give me unpaid internships. Is this an acceptable way to get internships?. I'm studying computer science and engineering.

Some earthquakes happened and now we are all off for the next 5 days, and I am just gonna go insane if I don't find something to occupy myself with. It can be anything, books, movies, games, TV shows.So let's say I have an LED connected to a circuit, but I want to detect if current flows through the LED and send the information to my Arduino. How can I do that? I know current sensors exist. but are there any other ways? could relays be used for something like this?. So I had this song in the early 2010s on my Nokia phone, the song was titled Blue - Breathe Easy, or something similar. Fast forward to maybe 2017 when I no longer had the phone, or the song, I tried to find the song on youtube, there was and still is a song named breathe easy by blue, but it's NOT the same song, at ALL. I was going absolutely crazy, I searched so much for it but never found it. Fast forward to today, I remembered the song again. Once again, I tried to find the song, by the melody, the lyrics I remember, NOTHING. THIS SONG DOES NOT EXIST NOW. Posting here is my last resort. I really hope that one of you know about it.It's a sad song. It starts with one of the members of the band singing calmly, this is the closest thing I remember to the lyrics:**I made you cry, come back into my life, I'll make it up to you tonight.**After this, a beat drops and the song gets faster.**Tell me why ------- baby I'm so sorry. Can't breathe easy****I can't even sleep, girl, baby I'm so sorry. Can't breathe easy.**Here a rap part starts.Hi all!I'm looking for some interesting CS/E books to read in my free time. Something that I can just lay down and read that doesn't involve a lot of technical stuff, as I read lots of that already for school.Thank you.Are they the same? What are the differences? I'm very confused.So I have a simple application that works with a lot of images. Right now I have a .js file that contains the path to all the images, and in my components I simply import that file and work with it. However, if I want to publish the App, then I need to get the data online and not from my computer. I have no knowledge of databases, is there a simple way to achieve this?. This happened about a year ago and I cannot forget it, I truly feel so guilty. I was playing a local chess tournament, and I was really sick, it was my last game and my opponent was a little girl, maybe 8-11. Maybe even younger. Near the end of the game, naturally I was doing much better than her, and when she started getting really low on time, I did what chess players called 'flagging', it's when you play really fast, trivial moves in order to run your opponent out of time. For the most part it's considered unethical. At the time I was really really tired from my sickness and I just wanted to end the night and go home. I played move after move without stopping for a second, and that poor kid barely had time to even think about her movies. I did this until, several moves later, she ran out of time. I still remember the empty look she gave me. I don't understand why I couldn't be patient enough to just play normally, I mean I was winning, there is nothing wrong with that, but why did I have to do it in such a mean way. I tell myself I was just sick, but I don't think that's a good excuse.Hello. I have been making random applications in my free time and I have been having so much fun. My apps consist of various calculators, puzzle games, static information apps, and such things. I was wondering if I publish them on play store, would I be able to make pocket money? I'm a college student with my tuition and living expenses already accounted for, so I'm not expecting huge amounts, just maybe enough money for gas from time to time. How hard would that be? By the way I don't want to make my apps paid, just in-app ads.When I put it down on a table, or any other surface, even lightly, it makes a little rattling/shaking/buzzing sound, as if something inside is loose. Is this like this itself or something is broke?.
    I just want to talk about what my boyfriend did for me. I had a bad day, and was looking forward to just watching a movie with him tonight. Well, we watched our movie, and then I woke up and threw up all over his floor. I started crying and apologizing profusely, but he took care of me and even cleaned it up. I‚Äôve never had someone love me like this, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm going to have to get used to. I still feel bad, but he reminded me that I‚Äôm human and these things happen. He‚Äôs asleep right now and I‚Äôm awake cause I still don‚Äôt feel good, but I couldn‚Äôt have asked for anyone better.I've been feeling under the weather lately and I think it's from seasonal allergies, I also may have had a touch of something. I took Sudafed last night and had a pretty bad reaction. I'm anxious, my heart is racing, and my head hurts. I called the pharmacy yesterday and they said it would be fine to take it with my medical history, but my friend said that it shouldn't be taken with the anxiety meds I take. I took some Claritin and am starting to feel better, but I've had anxiety all day. How're you doing?. I dyed my hair pink in July and I want it back to blonde. I bought the Malibu un-do-goo clarifying shampoo but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs working. Should I do a few washes when I‚Äôm showering to get it out?. I‚Äôm in a hotel room with my family and can‚Äôt sleep. Why‚Äôre you awake in the middle of the night, or if it‚Äôs daytime where you are, how‚Äôs your day going?. I‚Äôve noticed that my mascara, Lash Blast by Covergirl, has made my eyelashes thick and clumpy the last few times I‚Äôve bought the product. Does anyone have any recommendations for a mascara that will give me long, thin lashes?. My boyfriend and I were hiking Raven‚Äôs Ridge in North Ferrisburgh this weekend and we heard a pack of coyotes. We didn‚Äôt see them, but they kept getting louder so I know they were nearby. I‚Äôve been visiting the North Ferrisburgh area my entire life and have never heard anything like that. Has anyone else experienced this? I was terrified in the moment, but looking back it was actually a pretty cool experience.
    Before I (31F) started a GLP-1, I would crave sweets and other junk food for 2-3 days before my period, max.Due to the Wegovy shortage, I started my GLP-1 journey on Saxenda before switching over to Wegovy about two months ago. On Saxenda, which is a daily injection, I didn't experience any period cravings at all.Since switching to Wegovy (1.7), though, I notice myself craving junk food for upwards of a week before getting my period. And I'm convinced it *is* correlated with my period because the cravings end once it arrives (this has happened to me twice).Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, have you found any ways to minimize the cravings?. Sorry if this is a trite question. It didn't seem to break any sub rules, but if there's a better sub to ask this question in, please let me know.Robert Egger's The Witch (2015) has been on my watchlist forever, but I've never gotten around to it. It's my turn to pick the movie this week for movie night with my mom, and I was thinking of finally pulling the trigger on Witch because my mom's a history nut and will love the olde New England setting. However, she can barely handle horror movies, which is why I hesitate.I've read the parent advisory guides for Witch and basically know all the "bad" things that happen in the film. Still, it's hard to judge from that alone. (Especially since The Lighthouse, which I didn't find scary at all, was marketed as a horror movie.)And yes, I should probably just watch the bloody thing myself before Sunday. But just in case I don't: in your opinion, is The Witch actually scary? Or is it more so just tense, suspenseful, unsettling, etc.?. FTR, I have no skin in this game. I just want to know if I have terrible taste. Also, when I say "Chinese food," I mean Americanized Chinese takeout (e.g., fried rice, pu pu platter), not authentic Chinese cuisine.This weekend I visited my sister, who said that her sister-in-law is dealing with some drama over her wedding menu. Sister joked that they should just order Chinese. I, unironically, said that was a great idea and that I'd be pumped to be served Chinese food at a wedding. She and her husband vehemently disagreed and said they'd find it insulting.So who's right?. Hello, folks! I just took my very first Saxenda injection (0.6 mg) this morning. It's been about seven hours since then, and I notice no ill effects so far. In fact, I'm feeling pretty good, with a conspicuous lack of hunger.If you've experienced Saxenda side effects, at what point did they start to kick in? My heart is hoping and praying that every day on Saxenda can stay just like this, but my brain is waiting for the hammer to drop with nausea and fatigue setting in.Technically a YIFU, but close enough.Yesterday, I came home from an impromptu, extremely draining trip out of state to attend a relative's funeral. Notably, I am a chonky biatch trying to lose weight, and I was proud of myself for sticking to my diet through a very stressful week. I spent the first six hours of my day yesterday dealing with airports, buses, and cabs trying to get home, which I did around 4 in the afternoon.Now, I was exhausted and extremely hungry by this time, but I was determined to stay on the wagon and thus decided to make myself a turkey chili to have for the week. I'm lucky enough to have a grocery store five minutes down the street from me, so I felt I had no excuse *not* to grab the ground turkey and peppers I needed to proceed. So after a quick trip to the store and an hour of chopping, browning, and stirring, I finally got to dig in to a hearty, delicious bowl of chili.I had a few other chores I wanted to do that day, but I called it quits after cleaning up the mess. I ladled the chili, which was still very hot, into (heat-proof) containers and left them on the counter to come down to room temperature before putting them in the fridge. Then, with my last ounce of energy, I decided to take a shower, reminding myself to chuck the chili in the fridge before going to bed.I'm sure you can see where this is going.Today, I walked into the kitchen to behold my now-ruined chili sitting on the counter. And I screamed "**FUCK**" loud enough to make my dome light ring. I should have just had cereal. FML.TL;DR: made chili while tired, ruined it by leaving it out overnight. My sister is a kindergarten teacher of about nine years. As you've likely noticed, education has taken a horrifying nosedive across the board in the US and she needs to change careers before she drops dead from stress. (Not kidding; she's needed to start Zoloft and Ativan to deal with this job.)She has no idea what she wants to do outside of education. Her whole life, the only thing she ever wanted to be was a teacher. She really needs a person who can help her find a satisfying career path and navigate the changes between industries. She'll also just kind of need help making the shift from public sector to (likely) corporate and professionalizing.I think a career counselor (or coach?) would be great for a person like her, and I would gladly pay for it, assuming it's affordable for me. But I'm just wondering... Are they legitimately helpful? Are there ways to tell bad ones from good ones? Has anyone here ever had any experience with them, positive or negative?. Seriously... I'm not going to name names, but the pizza I've had in my five years of living in Danvers has been mediocre, at best. If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears.4/22/23 Update: In case someone finds this later on looking for a good pizza reference, I give two thumbs up to Osteria Peppino in Topsfield. There's no online ordering and they're on the pricy side (cost me $36 and change for a cheese pizza and a pizza with four toppings). But the sauce and cheese were perfect, as was the crust (the CRUST! OMG! Toothsome, chewy, crunchy, perfect thickness... Such a satisfying alternative to doughy, tasteless Greek-style pizza).Got my helix done on Jan. 12. Woke up today to find the stud gone. The hole isn't super visible, and I don't have a spare stud to stick in it. If I'm stuck at work for the next several hours, do you think I'll be able to put a new stud back in after work and save the existing piercing? Or do I need to get it re-pierced?. Okay. This may be one of the dumber questions I've asked this community, but I'd appreciate any input.I don't know if this is a universally-acknowledged thing or not, but in my experience, baked goods *always* taste better the next day. I have a vague notion that this is due to the ingredients having time to really meld together and what not, but I'm not sure exactly how that process works. Which leads me to my question: If I want to make sure I'm serving the best version of a cake, would it be enough to let the batter sit overnight and bake it in the morning? Or should I just bake the thing the night before and let it sit overnight?. When I was 14, I was a depressed, angry little shit who had no friends. So my parents forced me to go to this summer camp program at the local YMCA, which I was NOT happy about. I couldn't get out of going, but I hated every minute of it.One day, the activity was for us junior high kids to put on a "haunted house" for the little kids. Translation: we got a bunch of ratty costumes and props and had the kids walk through the gym with the lights off. It was goofy as all hell, but one little kid got scared by a guy in a gorilla suit.When I walked into the bathroom, she was in a stall crying. When she heard me come in, she asked, "Is he still out there?" And me, being the asshole that I was, said, "Yes, he's coming to get you" And this poor kid just *exploded* into tears. I walked out, and that was that.At the time, I honestly thought it was funny. But now, I'm horrified by what a dick I was, and I hope some poor lady doesn't have nightmares because of me...Context: sometimes I just feel like making scam callers miserable. Sorry if this is a super basic question, but I haven't been able to find a definitive answer anywhere.Some background: I have naturally dark brown hair that has some gray in the front. I've been dying my hair with permanent box dye about once every 60 days for the past 2.5 years. The colors I've been using have ranged from very dark brown to off-black; my goal was never to change the color of my hair, just to get as close to my natural color as possible while covering the grays. Also, please note that I have never bleached my hair.In that 2.5 year span, I've definitely erred on the side of going too dark at times. So now that I've finally found my perfect shade of box dye, you can't even see the color on my hair because it's too dark from the previous dye jobs.Which is why I'm wondering: If I use Color Oops (or some other hair color remover), will it simply strip out the dye and leave my natural color behind?. Hope this question isn't too simplistic; I just really want to make sure I don't F this up.I'm making a Boston cream pie for my Christmas dessert this year. I'm combining the best elements from two recipes that I really love (the cake from [Lidia Bastianich's recipe](https://www.goodtaste.tv/recipes/lidia-bastianichs-boston-cream-cake/), and the ganache and pastry cream from the America's Test Kitchen recipe. Can't link ATK's recipe here because it's paywalled, but if anyone really wants it, DM me and I can share.)Anyway: Lidia's recipe has this lovely Italian flavor from the olive oil and orange in the cake and the rum in the ganache. I think ATK's ganache has a better consistency, but I'd still like to get the rum flavor in there. So with that said: does anyone have any suggestions for getting rum into this ganache recipe without ruining it? I'm terrified of the chocolate seizing or something.Here's ATK's ganache recipe:¬∑ ¬Ω cup heavy cream¬∑ 2 tablespoons light corn syrup¬∑ 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine9. FOR THE GLAZE: Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and add chocolate. Whisk gently until smooth, 30 seconds. Let stand, whisking occasionally, until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.This may not be an answerable question, and it requires a bit of a long story to explain, so I apologize in advance. But I'd appreciate any guesses.I was making [this recipe](https://www.thekitchn.com/bumpy-cake-22931838#post-recipe-14148) for fudge icing (scroll down to "*for the icing*" for ingredients and Step 6 for procedure) when I accidentally cooked the icing WAY too far. I'm not sure how hot it actually got, because my thermometer was bouncing around like crazy (that's what I get for using a cheap meat thermometer - lesson learned). But it smelled somewhat burnt, so I yanked it off the stove and desperately stirred it to smooth it out. It was SUPER thick, like slightly warm taffy, and my mom tasted it to see if I'd killed it. But she immediately told me to dump it into a glass dish and toss it in the fridge, which I did (and then proceeded to remake the icing - this time correctly).Well, a couple hours later, we dug into what had become very firm, but INCREDIBLE-tasting brown butter fudge. That's the only way I can think of to describe it: roasty-toasty tasking fudge. Like dry aged steak in fudge form. It was uncommonly awesome--and I haven't been able to replicate it since, despite two attempts to do so with brown butter.So, with all that being said: has anyone ever done or tasted anything remotely similar to this before? And does anyone have any tips on how to achieve it?. Pretty much just what the title says. I made this amazing chocolate sheet cake with fudge icing and brought it into the office. Shared it at lunch to many compliments. About 10 minutes after lunch ended, I went back to the break room to refill my tea, and walked in on my supervisor sneaking a spoonful of fudge from the cake box. She looked horrified and immediately blurted out, "Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I SWEAR I didn't lick this spoon-". And I just burst out laughing. Having someone secretly steal a big bite of your food is probably the best compliment you can get on your cooking. It just meant a lot to me because I love to cook.I'm thinking of getting my sister a wine subscription for her birthday. I know there are several subscription services that ship wine to MA, but logistically it still seems kind of fraught. She and her husband both work 9-5, so there wouldn't be anyone home to sign for an alcohol delivery if it showed up in that window. Would that leave them on the hook for picking it up from UPS/FedEx every month? If anyone has received/gifted wine subscriptions, can you please tell me how it's working (or worked) out for you and if it's worth it?. I (29F) have been researching the sleeve for about four months and finally pulled the trigger on putting my deposit down yesterday. My surgery is scheduled for early November at a very reputable clinic in Tijuana.And now... I have to break the news to my very high-anxiety mom (65), whom I live with (and to whom I have not uttered a word about weight loss surgery). And she is going to *freak. out.* I may be able to sell her on the surgery itself; I've been heavy since I was a child and am now about 100 lbs. overweight (which she's in total denial about; she thinks I'd be perfect if I lost 30 lbs.). There's *no way* this weight is going to either come off or stay off without surgical intervention. Hopefully I can convince her that the risks of surgery, which are minimal, are dwarfed by the danger of my weight itself.And then there's the whole Mexico part. My clinic (OCC) is a 10-minute drive from the US border. I have no concerns about my safety in Tijuana. But my mom is one of those people who hears "Mexico" and immediately thinks that drug cartels are waiting to kidnap people on every corner. Or she'll conclude I'm being operated on in some dirty, back-alley clinic by a fake doctor. And I'm not sure to what extent I'll be able to change her mind, even with evidence.So yeah. I'll probably hold off on telling her for a few more weeks, which I think is fine because the surgery isn't for a couple of months. If anyone has any advice for talking to family members about the surgery, especially nervous ones or ones who took the news badly, I'm all ears, because it's gonna be a shitshow. Thanks.This is kind of a nitty-gritty question, but it makes a difference for me because I don't really have friends/family in my state who are capable of traveling (in the US or abroad).If you have been sleeved or are in the process of booking the surgery, can you please tell me if your surgeon/clinic ever required you to bring somebody else with you? And for context, can you tell me if you needed to travel--domestically or abroad--to get your surgery? Thank you!!. Hello folks! I (29F, USA) have been researching the sleeve for a few months and am getting ready to pull the trigger on moving forward with it. My question is about the role, if any, of my PCP in this process. I'm paying out of pocket, so insurance (to my knowledge) isn't a concern. But who do I approach about the gastric sleeve first: the surgery clinic, or my doctor? I understand that I need to do lab work before the surgery, but does my PCP also need to examine me/sign off on the surgery?The main reason I'm asking here, as opposed to just asking my doctor or the surgeon, is that I'm not entirely sure my PCP will be thrilled about the idea of me getting the sleeve. I have no health issues other than obesity, which I've been struggling with for as long as I've been her patient (6 years... and been obese my whole life, really). I'm prepared enough to push back if she tries to talk me out of it (unless, of course, she presents me with valid medical reasons not to go through with it). But what if she gives me a hard "no"? Is that the end of the line, or is there another way to get okayed for the surgery?Or perhaps I don't even need to worry about any of this...? Or perhaps it varies by surgeon, especially if I end up pursing one in Mexico? If you've gotten the sleeve or are in the process of getting the surgery authorized, please tell me about what you needed to do to get clearance from your PCP/other physicians versus your surgeon. Thank you!. Pretty much just what the title says. About three years ago, an adorable independent tea shop opened up on the outskirts of my downtown. Somehow, the business survived through the pandemic, for which I'm very proud of them.About four months ago, I noticed people starting to come out from the building across the street holding brightly-colored shakes and drinks. Well, today, I finally found out that a "nutritional boutique" went into the building and sells $16 teas and shakes loaded with Herbalife crap. I'm super surprised, as you really don't hear of people participating in pyramid schemes in my region (MA. Or maybe they do and I'm just not aware of it. idk.)The store has almost 50 reviews, most of them 5-star ratings showing off very instagrammable pictures of colorful drinks. Other than me, only one other person pointed out that the store hawks Herbalife products, so I think most of their customers genuinely don't know (no idea if they're open about it in the store or not; I just found one picture on their Facebook page acknowledging that they use Herbalife).But yeah. It's bad enough that an Herbalife front has invaded my community. But the fact that they have the nerve to set up shop *right across the street from a legitimate tea business* just pisses me off to a whole 'nother level. Not really sure if there's anything to do other than leaving a 1-star review.Just threw a couple of steaks in a Ziploc bag of marinade (one third of [this recipe](https://therecipecritic.com/worlds-best-steak-marinade/#wprm-recipe-container-56321), if it matters). Literally about six minutes later, I open the fridge to find that the olive oil has separated from the rest of the ingredients.What exactly is the point of marinade recipes that call for oil but not an emulsifier? Are they bum recipes, or is the oil actually doing something?EDIT: Huge thank-you to the folks who answered my multiple questions! If you're a noob like me looking for info on marinades, please see Meathead's super comprehensive and easy-to-read article [here](https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/marinades-and-brinerades/science-of-marinades-and-brinerades/) (thanks a million for the source, u/Picker-Rick). My biggest takeaway here is to **not** default to marinating whenever I want to flavor meat. Marinating is not nearly as effective as I thought it was at adding flavor. A spice rub would have given my steaks the same amount of flavor (if not more) in a fraction of the time.EDIT 2: Steaks marinated for 4 hours. They grilled up fine after a pat-down and were very good, but barely tasted like the marinade. A rub definitely would have been the way to go!. I tend to react to conflict and confrontation in one of two ways: shutting down, caving, and going silent (95% of the time), or exploding--hurling insults, making personal attacks, swearing, etc. (5% of the time).Does anyone else have experience trying to solve this problem? Does anyone know of a good book (or other resource) on productively handling conflict and confrontation?. It's a dumb question and likely doesn't have a "right" answer, I know. I'm trying to find a SUPER high-value treat to help my dog get over his fear of taking food directly from my hand. Thus far, I've been using chicken, carrots, baby Swiss, and hard-boiled egg, all of which he loves, but they don't move him to extraordinary lengths. (I am 100 percent conscious of the fact that helping my dog over this fear is going to take MANY attempts over a long period of time. I'm not looking for an easy way out of this.)Cheese seems like a convenient treat option, and I'm wondering if anyone has found smellier cheeses to be more motivating than milder-smelling ones. Dude loves rabbit turds more than anything and seems to be extremely scent-driven, so I'm just guessing.And while we're here, I might as well also ask: What treats/rewards do y'all's dogs consider God-tier?. Does anyone have experience with any good local dog trainers? Have a very anxious little dude (just turned one) who just got his last vaccine and could really use some help. I'm in Danvers, and I'd appreciate any recommendations. Thanks!.
    My baby girl turned one in July and began walking shortly after her birthday. I‚Äôm looking to get her some comfortable fall/winter boots, does anyone have any suggestions? I was looking at the Gap website and they have Ugg replica boots on sale that I was looking into getting. The ratings for those are average so I wanted to see if any has some recommendations on here. Aside from boots, any other shoes suggestions that are comfortable to walk in for an active toddler? ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I‚Äôve had so many times where I wanted something in life and it just wouldn‚Äôt happen but when I stopped caring about the situation and didn‚Äôt think about it at all anymore, that‚Äôs when it ended up manifesting. The most significant one was where my boyfriend and I kept trying to conceive for like 9-10 months. It came to the point where I accepted that maybe it wasn‚Äôt the right timing and the universe had other plans in store for me. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get pregnant. And guess what? .. a few weeks later, I actually ended up getting pregnant. Why is it when we want something so badly and try to manifest it, it doesn‚Äôt want to happen? But it‚Äôs like the minute you stop caring about the given situation, boom, your wishes and hopes become a reality.I often times do my makeup on the train to save time (I‚Äôm a 27 year old woman). I don‚Äôt take up extra space or anything like that. People constantly stare like I‚Äôm doing something wrong. I‚Äôm almost positive this girl took a photo of me on the train yesterday then sent it to someone and laughed a minute later. On Chicago trains and buses, people smoke/drink, blast loud music, gamble, argue and the list goes on. There‚Äôs craziness everywhere. But for some reason, seeing a girl do her makeup is bizarre to some and people think it‚Äôs okay to stare and take photos of others and make fun of them for minding their own business. What do you guys think? Is it weird given all the other crazy stuff that goes on with public transportation? I have anxiety so people staring at me makes it even worse.Edit: Wow, I did not expect to come back to 200 replies! Thank you all for the feedback and insight. I‚Äôll try my best to respond to most of the comments later today.I also have a one year old daughter. I was a dog walker/animal caretaker for 5+ years. I joined Reddit exactly 5 years ago on yesterday‚Äôs date. Just some random fun facts - AMA!. I used to have severe social anxiety and never knew how to properly talk to people in public. Sometimes I‚Äôd be extra quiet and barely say anything, other times I‚Äôd say something really weird due to being so anxious. My social anxiety used to be A LOT worse in middle school/high school, but it‚Äôs still there sometimes. I also have adhd and depression, so I never know how to respond and struggle to find the right words to explain my thoughts.(I explain myself much better in writing)This also lead to other struggles with friendship, academics and career. How lovely it is having mental health issues *sighs* ü´†. People feel so fucking entitled. I got on a full train. I see there‚Äôs an empty seat but this guy had his bag laying on it. I pointed to his bag and politely asked if I could sit down. He started at me in the eyes for a good 5 seconds debating if he should move his bag before moving it for me to sit down. As if I had the audacity to ask him to move his shit. I‚Äôve had multiple bags with me before and yes, I have put them on the empty seat next to me ONLY if the train/bus is empty. As soon as I start seeing it get full, I immediately remove my things and place them on the floor. People do entitled and stupid shit on trains and buses all the time here in Chicago but it‚Äôs crazy how someone feels entitled to two seats when others are standing. Craaaazy.I moved out and only took a few things at the beginning of August. I was told I have the entire month to get my stuff since they won‚Äôt be renovating the apartment yet and that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt take everything right away. I got a few things and was planning on getting the rest at another time. I was told my stuff was already thrown out when I asked to get the remainder of my things. I asked what happened to my brand new laptop and he acted like he didn‚Äôt know anything but it was gone when I got my stuff the first time. I was fucking pissed but whatever. My mom lives in the same building. This was three weeks ago. Today I saw some of my old stuff in the garbage. The landlord LIED AND PRETENDED MY STUFF WAS THROWN OUT. It was still there for three weeks but he didn‚Äôt allow me to get it so he could take what he wanted after he already stole my laptop. My lease was up so I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it but what a scumbag. My daughter just turned one and I recently got her SS card. That was in the apartment and now I have to renew it and get a new SS card for her. This is such bullshit. I hate people.I was waiting for the train and this woman walks by and says ‚ÄúI wonder why people have adult acne‚Äù. At first I was confused and thought wtf is she going on about. A few seconds later I realized she was talking about me. I have adult acne. I just glanced at her and went back to my phone. She then proceeds to say ‚ÄúI wonder if it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt wash their face. Or maybe they eat nasty roach-y ? food at home?‚Äù I stared her down for 5 seconds thinking is this bitch serious right now.. but I chose not to engage. And I‚Äôm proud of myself. She walked away then came back a few seconds later. My phone was on a stand while I was fixing my hair and looking at the camera. She says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not going to take your phone‚Äù and something about reading my messages. At that point the train came so I got on and left the crazy lady. I‚Äôm so proud of myself. I usually let people get to me and talk back if anyone says or does something rude. I‚Äôm not one to ignore things or ‚Äújust let it go‚Äù most of the time. I‚Äôve been working on not allowing irrelevant things, or people, bother me. Here‚Äôs to self improvement and choosing peace of mind over anger and confrontation. ü´∂üèºüåªFor those of you wondering, I live in Chicago and this is quite common. People are weird.. some are mentally unstable. Others are just assholes. But people love starting shit for no reason with others, especially on buses and trains. **‚ÄúNever wrestle with a pig because you'll both get dirty and the pig likes it." - George Bernard Shaw. Positive energy is much more powerful than negative energy.** ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I sent him the Ryan/Tilapia post and I‚Äôm actually on my way to visit him right now. Since so many people are invested in Ryan and Tilapia, I‚Äôm going to find out if any of his nurses names happen to start with Ti (he‚Äôs had over 20 different nurses and I‚Äôm not exaggerating) and get back to my fellow Redditers with some tea if I can find any. ‚òïÔ∏èüëÄ. It‚Äôs a Sunday and a holiday weekend. Traffic is horrible. Buses are packed. I got on the bus and it was completely full. People are lined up next to each other like sardines in a can. There was a man and woman, both in wheelchairs, together. They took up most of the space on the bus, which is fine, but kept talking shit to other passengers about space. Luckily I wasn‚Äôt near them but they started telling people to turn around and not breath on them and to face the other way, followed by ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt speak English? This is America‚Äù, when the people would ignore them.. then they talked about how people need to move and not stand so close to them, (there was literally NOWHERE to move) along with how they ‚Äòcan‚Äôt believe this shit‚Äô as if they own the bus and no one can glance in their direction. They talked shit the entire time until they got off. No one likes packed buses and traffic but being disabled does not give you the entitlement to harass others that are riding the same bus as you. If you don‚Äôt want people standing near you, don‚Äôt take the bus. Call a cab or ride service. It‚Äôs really that simple.I was walking to the bathroom at McDonald‚Äôs and passed by a table of three middle aged men talking. It looked like a job interview or something. One of them said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to be blindfolded and treated the same as..‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt hear the rest because I was too far. But I‚Äôm so curious! Why in the world is this man going to be blindfolded?! For what??? Treated the same as who? Any guesses? Lol. I got a missed call from the hospital yesterday. I called back one minute later, they said they‚Äôre not sure who called me but they took my name and number down as well as the patients name (my boyfriend). I never received a call back from them. I had to pay to get an affidavit notarized from the hospital in order to make decisions for him (his family told the doctors they want me to make decisions). I visit twice a day, every day, and ALWAYS ask the nurses how he‚Äôs doing, are there any changes and if there‚Äôs questions for me. He‚Äôs awake and able to communicate perfectly fine, but due to him having a stroke, among several other serious health issues, he can‚Äôt make decisions for himself. Today, his mom received a call from one of the doctors saying I‚Äôm hard to reach and because of that she wants his mom to be the one making decisions for him otherwise they will go to court and decide who makes decisions for him. Are you fucking kidding me?!?! I GO THERE TWICE A DAY AND CONSTANTLY ASK FOR UPDATES. I PICK UP WHEN THEY CALL OR CALL BACK WITHIN MINUTES IF I MISS THE CALL. It‚Äôs honestly ridiculous that they‚Äôre implying I‚Äôm difficult to get a hold of and want to go to court when that‚Äôs FAR from the truth. Like what do they want me to be on standby 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, staring at my phone waiting for them to call???? I go out of my way to do everything I can to make sure he‚Äôs okay and to communicate with the hospital but I guess that‚Äôs not enough for them. ü´†. I was waiting in line at the security desk to get a pass to see my boyfriend who is currently in the hospital. I patiently waited just like everyone else in front of me. Right before it was my turn, this woman goes and stands next to the man currently speaking to security, completing ignoring the obvious line. When he walked away, she was about to start talking to security and I kindly said ‚Äúexcuse me ma‚Äôam, I was next in line‚Äù she started giving me attitude and raised her voice saying ‚Äúgo ahead, I wasn‚Äôt trying to go in front of you‚Äù with the nastiest look on her face. I was like ‚Äúyeah, you kind of were‚Äù she was like ‚Äústop talking to me and talk to her (the lady at the security desk), I was like "that's what I‚Äôm trying to do‚Äù so as I turn and I‚Äôm about to start talking the security lady, she starts talking before me, still trying to get her way and not wait in line, so I started talking over her and she began cursing so I told the security guard standing next to the desk to that I‚Äôm here to see a patient and this women is harassing me. She turned to the women she was with and started talking shit about me. I ignored her and continued talking to the security lady thinking the interaction is over. As the security lady is writing me a pass, the girl called me a bitch under her breath. I responded with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call me a bitch, bitch‚Äù and she goes ‚Äúand you‚Äôre still talking‚Äù, I said ‚ÄúI stopped talking until you decided to call me a bitch‚Äù then she starts telling the girl she‚Äôs with something along the lines of how she can‚Äôt stand white people. I ignored her and said ‚Äúthank you so much, have a great day‚Äù to the security that gave me the pass and walked away.I get that being in a hospital is high stress for most people but that doesn‚Äôt give you the right to cut ahead of others because you don‚Äôt feel like waiting in line then getting all upset because they‚Äôre not a pushover and called you out on your bullshit. I‚Äôm certain she saw the line too, she just felt like the rules didn‚Äôt apply to her and that she didn‚Äôt have to wait like everyone else. I feel like maybe I should have let it go and not said anything, but I always stand up for people when I see them getting screwed over/bullied/harassed, etc, and only recently realized I need to start standing up for myself, too. It took me a long time to learn people will walk all over you if you let them (even if it‚Äôs something as small as cutting in line). So AITA for confronting her?Edit: I went back the next day. The kind security lady said I handled that very well and she‚Äôs proud of me for sticking up for myself and the way I handled the situation üòä. This literally just happened about an hour ago. I was at a bus stop waiting for my bus when a kid zoomed by with his bike and snatched my phone out of my hand (while I was looking at photos of my baby girls first birthday ü•∫) . I went after him but he was too fast. I couldn‚Äôt see his face. A few minutes later, a kid, no older than 13, comes up to me on a bike and says his friend stole his phone and he knows where he is and his friend wants to sell it back to me. I said fine, I‚Äôll give him $20, it‚Äôs an old phone anyway, I mainly want it back for pictures that hold sentimental value. I went to get change at the gas station and told him to call his friend. HE PULLS OUT MY PHONE AND HAD IT THE ENTIRE TIME. I had my suspicions that it was him but I wasn‚Äôt about to accuse him. Had it actually been his friend, I would have paid him for ‚Äúhelping‚Äù me. This clown stole my phone, lied to me acting like he was helping me get it back then wanted me to pay him for lying and stealing. He told me he wanted $50 for it instead, I snatched my phone out of his hand and told him he‚Äôs not getting shit. He started cursing and threatening to hit me. I went right back in the gas station and the workers made them leave. I called a Uber and had them drive me away from the area then got on the bus back home. That‚Äôs Chicago for ya.. It doesn‚Äôt really matter where you are, always pay attention to your surroundings and hold on tightly to your belongings, especially when outside and/or at nighttime. üôÉTL;DR my phone was stolen, kid acted like his friend stole and was ‚Äúhelping‚Äù me get it back for $20, turns out it was him that stole it the whole time.A twist on the old weekly suggestion threads in the sub, this one will be restaurants that can be accessed via the CTA Red line. Let‚Äôs call it a 10-15 minute walk or less from any CTA Red Line station.Previous CTA line restaurant threads:[Blue Line](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/14dptly/weekly_suggestion_thread_best_restaurants_on_the/)[Green Line](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/14kfgim/weekly_suggestion_thread_best_restaurants_on_the/)[Pink Line](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/14sjm79/weekly_suggestion_thread_best_restaurants_on_the/)Idea borrowed from u/TriedForMitchcraft ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I feel terrible for my mom as she lives in the United States and my grandma lived in Europe. She only got to see her mom every two years and she couldn‚Äôt go visit her the past 4 years because my dad is sick and she needs to take care of him. My grandma helped raise me before moving to the US and she got to meet my baby girl on FaceTime just two weeks ago.. I always said that when I visit again, I would spend more time with my grandma and now it‚Äôs too late. I didn‚Äôt spend as much time as I should have with my grandma when I visited as a kid.. ü•∫ I can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs gone. Things are never going to be the same visiting my motherland with both her and my grandpa gone. When I FaceTimed her last two weeks ago, she was crying because she missed me and I was telling her I love her and I can‚Äôt wait to see her again next summer so she could meet my daughter.. üíîI would greatly appreciate it if someone would send my mom reiki healing for grievance.

I checked the target and Walmart with with no results. Does anyone know what stores might have them? [knee protection pads](https://www.amazon.com/Crawling-Anti-Slip-Toddlers-Kneepads-Assorted/dp/B07CSXWMCP/ref=mp_s_a_1_8?crid=3OM3A95GZU6DX&dd=AzBFZr7jTbYU16TYudn_fA%2C%2C&keywords=baby+knee+pads+for+crawling&qid=1689079996&refinements=p_90%3A8308921011&rnid=8308919011&sprefix=baby+kn%2Caps%2C203&sr=8-8). So I did 700+ walks from 2017-2022 (a lot of them were repeat clients). Last August, I lost a pair of keys while on a walk. I contacted the owner apologizing and said I was looking for them. I called my boyfriend to help me look around the neighborhood. The owner came home and he seemed super understanding and compassionate about the situation. I offered to pay for the replacement key but he declined. A few days later, the owner reported me for losing his keys and for ‚Äúbringing someone else on the walk‚Äù and my account was suspended. Wag called me but I wasn‚Äôt available to talk at the time. I emailed them explaining what happened and offered a time to call back and discuss the incident. They never responded or called back then my account was permanently deactivated about a week later. It sucks because I had soooo many lovely compliments from kind dog parents that I developed close relationships with. I wish there was a way to call and try to get your account reactivated but I doubt that‚Äôs possible. Fuck Wag for deactivating people‚Äôs accounts over one minor incident despite years of great service. It kind of feels like getting fired at work for a small mistake except we‚Äôre independent contractors and not actual employees. ü•¥. I paid him back $20 with $5 interest as promised. I have proof of payment. I told him I would pay him back once my check cleared and apologized multiple times for being late on the loan, and I did pay him back immediately after my money was deposited into my account. He fabricated an entire story about what happened and to this day, people are seeing his post and messaging me talking shit every other day so I wanted to clear my name and reveal the TRUTH behind what happened. He lent me $20 with the agreement that I would pay him back May 5 - I sent him a photo of my ID that has my name and address to validate that I am legitimate and not a scammer. I‚Äôm a single mom with a 9 month old and just started a new job, finances are tight at the moment and I literally needed money for food that night after taking care of my baby‚Äôs need, I was embarrassed to ask friends/family to lend me money so I figured I‚Äôd try this subreddit. I gave him my phone number (big mistake) to send a photo of my ID because it wasn‚Äôt allowing me send the photo through Reddit for some reason. When he sent the $20 via PayPal, I was starting my work shift and we‚Äôre not allowed to have our phones with us so it was in my locker. When I went on break a few hours later and checked my phone, I see texts from the u / destroyed33 calling me a shitty person for not confirming that he loaned me $20 on here right away and saying I just wanted free money. I apologized for not responding sooner and confirmed that he lent me $20 on here. The day before I was suppose to pay him back, he asked if I‚Äôm still paying him back tomorrow. I told him I‚Äôll pay back the loan on time as I was expecting my first check from my new job to direct deposit. The next day I explained to him that my check did not direct deposit (it was my first check for this job and HR didn‚Äôt set my direct deposit up in time) and that I would have to pick up my check and deposit it manually and pay him back once I do. I explained that I had every intention of paying him back just that it would be late and apologized for the delay. I sent him a screenshot of my bank account showing that I have literally nothing and that I would pay him back when I‚Äôm able to this week. He wanted to work out a payment plan but I had no money at all on my account, I really did feel bad and wanted to pay him back immediately but I didn‚Äôt have the funds to do so and told him I will pay him back in full soon and asked him to be a little more patient with me. I understand that it‚Äôs his money and I would be upset too if someone didn‚Äôt pay me back in time but I would try to be somewhat compassionate and understanding to their situation. I remembered I had a few dollars on my old Venmo account that I have linked to my old phone number. I told him I would send him a partial payment on there but unfortunately couldn‚Äôt remember the log in and wasn‚Äôt able to do do. I apologized and reassured him I would pay him back once my check cleared. He would text me multiple times a day and get frustrated that I would take hours to respond to his texts (I‚Äôm not glued to my phone all day and am not allowed to use it while working and I have an infant that requires a lot of my time and attention), he started calling me a liar and told me I‚Äôm making excuses up so I stopped replying not to upset him even further because whenever I would tell him what was going on, he didn‚Äôt believe me and got even more mad. I was visiting my friend two days ago and she could tell I was upset because I was quiet. I didn‚Äôt want to tell her what was going on because I was embarrassed that I have money problems and was was worried she would look at me different for borrowing money from strangers online. I started crying and confined in her about what was going on and how tough things have been in general and showed her the texts between me and him. She said I should have came to her for money and that she would never judge me for that. She was upset at the way he was talking to me so she replied pretending she was me and called him a loan shark and said that if he genuinely cared about helping, he would just ask for the $20 back and wouldn‚Äôt be asking me to pay him interest back knowing I‚Äôm a single mom and have $0 in my account. I was annoyed with her for replying to him acting like it was me knowing it would create more tension and drama. I‚Äôm not a victim and I don‚Äôt want to use the single mother excuse to make people feel bad for me.I asked other people for advice on what I should do and they all said to ignore him until AFTER I paid him back because every time I offered an explanation and apology for being late, I would get called a liar. The last 2 days before my check cleared, I ignored his texts after to avoid escalating drama and making him more upset. I was planning on replying to him only after I sent the money so he wouldn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm making up excuses as he‚Äôs accused me of doing so. It turns out that was the wrong move because it made him even more pissed off. He called me a liar, thief and said I stole from him. I‚Äôm not a liar or thief and I would never use someone or intentionally hurt them. My mother raised me better than that.Now that my check finally cleared and I have money in my account, I was able to pay him back what I owed plus interest. He reported me on this sub for not paying him back on time which is okay with me because after how much severe anxiety this has caused, I NEVER want to borrow money from anyone ever again. I wish I stayed hungry that night and went to my moms in the morning to get food so I wouldn‚Äôt have had to borrow money from this man and avoided all this drama. I wish I could have paid him back in time but I had $0 up until now and couldn‚Äôt, which I do feel bad about, but I don‚Äôt appreciate being called nasty names and harassed throughout the entire day, every single day for not paying back in time. I paid him back right after my check cleared because I felt so shitty for being late. **He acted like because I owed him $20, that he owned me and I was obligated to respond to his messages immediately, and would get frustrated if I would respond hours later because my phone would be in my locker at work or I would be tending to my infant, which is why he felt the need to make that story up on the r/borrow sub.**Although I did pay back my loan, I‚Äôm still worried because he has my full name and address and I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs capable of doing. Anyways, I just wanted to explain my side of the story because people are sending me messages calling me names and accusing me of horrible things for thinking I didn‚Äôt pay the lender back. I learned my lesson and whoever got this far into my post, please don‚Äôt be as stupid as I was to share your phone number and photo of your ID with random people on the internet, even if you are borrowing money from them. That is all.
    I thought most adults who live on their own do their own chores but I guess I am just poor/dumb. Apparently he takes his dirty laundry to his mom‚Äôs house every week and she washes and folds it for him. He doesn‚Äôt even know how to. I‚Äôm so curious what his plan is for after she passes.Edit to add: his mommy and daddy pay for his rent, groceries, car, bills, etc. as well. Tonight be accosted myself and another neighbor by the mailbox area of neighborhood to tell us about this homeless guy panhandling at the gas station near us. He kept going on and on about how pathetic the homeless guy is and how even if *he* were homeless, he would rather DIE than ask someone for money or help. Very ironic considering his parents pay for the roof over his head and everything he owns‚Ä¶This man is NOT my friend. I swear he watches my house as he comes out every single time I leave to walk my dogs, get in my car, get the mail. I told him I am not trying to be his friend but he keeps showing up on my doorstep asking if I can hang out with him and will not take no for an answer.. Both are fine. There should be no shame or stigma for one or the other. I had a job for a long time that was a paycheck to pay my rent, expenses etc. it was fine and allowed me to pursue my hobbies and interests, but I was not particularly passionate about the work. I went back to get my advanced degree, and started what is now my career. I think of it as my life‚Äôs work, something that I care about and am genuinely interested it. My acquaintance (really just my neighbor who will not leave me alone anytime he sees me) keeps making fun of my career, and telling me how HIS career is so much more prestigious. I did not start this argument, nor have I responded to anything he has said. As background, he is a thirty year old man who has worked for a total of three months his entire life. He worked at a call center as essentially a telemarketer before he got fired for not hitting his numbers. He tells me he HAS a career as a financial advisor and how it‚Äôs a really big deal that he works in finance (he‚Äôs been unemployed for three years and his family pays his rent and bills). He keeps telling me that his career is really hard (again, he doesn‚Äôt have a job currently) as there are people at his [former] company that have bachelors degrees (he did school up to high school.) It really bugs me. He keeps bringing it up (I‚Äôve never brought it up). He keeps trying to misrepresent his former job (he is currently unemployed) and it really bugs me, probably because he is simultaneously putting down what I do for work.I also find it hilarious that yesterday he kept telling me how much money he makes [made] in *finance* ($45k a year). I live in a mid-high cost of living city. That isn‚Äôt a salary to brag about where I live. I also find it gross when people brag about money.Lately my one neighbor seems to ALWAYS be outside my house waiting to see me. (I am in and out throughout the day between work, errands, and walking my dogs). He is unemployed and has a lot of time. Every time I tell him I am in a rush and can‚Äôt talk, he will find an excuse to tag along with me (if I am trying to quickly walk my dogs, he‚Äôll say he was about to go for a walk and invite himself. If I am going to the supermarket, he‚Äôll say he has to pick up groceries too and we should carpool to save gas, etc.) Throughout the day he will text me nonstop to hang out. For example, he knows I work a 9-5 job during the day and have a second job on weekends, but he will text me every weekday at 2pm and be confused/upset that I can‚Äôt just drop everything and go to the movies. I already told this man that I am an introvert, I am not looking to make new friends, and I have a lot on my plate. He is not getting it. He keeps trying to make me feel bad by telling me that even though he grew up here, he has no friends. I feel bad and I don‚Äôt want to be rude, but this guy is so clingy that I truly do not have time to be his full time bestie. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs trying to get with me because he is gay and I am a straight woman. It‚Äôs getting to the point where I am wearing a hood and trying to sneak out of my house unnoticed. I dread walking my dogs now. If I need to drive somewhere, I am SPRINTING to my car to avoid time exposed on my driveway.I found a beautiful 1-2 year old German shepherd. Was super skittish and took hours to catch her. I‚Äôve been posting on Facebook, nextdoor, Ring, etc and gotten no responses from potential owners. I had a vet check for a microchip and she does not have one. She is super sweet but afraid of people and dogs. But she is so pretty, I feel like she must have an owner out there but also she is completely unsocialized and so skinny that all her ribs are sticking out. She has clean coat and teeth. I was going to keep posting and checking for lost dog signs for 10 days before just keeping her, at which point I‚Äôll take her back to the vet for vaccines and I will give her a name. Does that sound reasonable or should I spend longer than 10 days?Update: I checked my jurisdiction‚Äôs regulations and wow my city does not seem to care about dogs. Their rule for stray dogs is to hold them 6 days before you are liable for registering with the city and such. That‚Äôs seems really short. I‚Äôm not sure if I should keep posting signs for 10 days? 30 days? I need a cutoff.Trader Joe‚Äôs always has such good ice cream flavors in my opinion (both regular and seasonal product flavors). What ice cream flavors would you love to see in future?For me, I love the When Life Gives You Lemons ice cream, but in future I would love a take on Key Lime Pie ice cream!.
    Is she ok? Did she ever accept the truth? What would be like to meet an armadillo after a lifetime of armadillo denial? Do other people from North Dakota put armadillos into the same category as chupacabras? How do you grow up, join the Army, get an education and deny the existence of armadillos? What even is that path?. Get your ass off r/BaldursGate3 and get it downstairs so we can actually play! You're just up there reading when we could be doing. Pull that old ass out of bed, freshen up a bit and come eat. I'm logged in AND on r/BaldursGate3 during fights because we are nerds on purpose and we have 2 screens. The past versions of us set current us up for success in the event of this exact issue. Put the plan into action! Use the 2nd monitor and come run Shadowheart because she irritates me for reasons I can't adequately explain. You have 10 minutes before I send Raptor up to deal with your insolence. He's been running warm up laps in the living room for 2 hours so he's ready to fuck around on a level not usually considered polite on a Sunday. Edit: he came down hours ago but I don‚Äôt think he saw this and I got distracted playing and forgot. These comments made me chuckle so thanks for that. Y‚Äôall have a great night.
    So I always said I disliked eggplant since I felt my tongue itch after eating it. I thought others like that itch. So few months ago, at 27, I finally asked my family why you guys like eggplant when it‚Äôs so itchy. They all looked at me shocked and said it‚Äôs not itchy. So that‚Äôs how I found out I‚Äôm mildly allergic to eggplant.Edit: it seems zucchini, kiwi, and Pineapple are not suppose to be itchy either.Best pizza (Italian food) I have ever eaten was in a small German village made by Syrian immigrants. The pizza was Doner kebab (Turkish food) and Hollandaise sause ( Dutch ). The excellent French fry was made and served by an afghan immigrant as well.Do you consider him a social democrat ?. I see many times that people either support Russia and Palestine or Ukraine and Israel. But in both cases there are clear imperialist powers ( Russia and Israel) and clear victims ( Ukraine and Palestine). So is this the same position of you guys ?. So in my culture staying with relatives when traveling to another city is common. We are invited to a wedding in another city and our hotel reservation would cost 400$ for two nights. My cousin found out and called us today that we should stay with him. His wife also called and said the same thing. My mom says it‚Äôs a cheap thing to do and we should go to the hotel. but I have some money issues currently and saving 400$ will really help me. So will i look like a cheap guy if I take my cousin offer ? Like my cousin has stayed at our house a lot of times when he traveled to our place, so this is like returning the favor.I just played two matches and in both I was losing but decided to let the opponents try making their pawns into the queens while I just went for the checkmate. So I wanted to know if this is a common thing in lower ranks like me ?that players forget checkmate is the goal.The owner looked at peoples defiantly and without care. when we complained, she took a nearby pizza box and began ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù the mess. But the whole cabin smelled terribly, so much that everyone moved as far as possible but it still bothered everyone.So we were messaging for sometime and when we discussed relationships, she said she is not ready. Because of this and the fact that I always engaged first, I decided to moved on so I won‚Äôt be a bother.but after a few days she messaged me and asked why I stopped messaging her and that she is shy so that‚Äôs why she never message first. Since then she has been sending memes of benefit of having a short GF (she is short).I‚Äôm honestly confused on what she wants, I certainly don‚Äôt want to waste my time so I‚Äôm leaning on not having any contact with her.My cousin (M44) and his two sons (M12 and M8) came to us last week for the weekend as we live 200km apart. At around 5PM he called me and said he will come in 30 minutes. He also asked if I had any food as his children haven‚Äôt eaten lunch yet. I told him we eat dinner at 8 and they should wait until then if they can. He again asked like if I have some eggs or sausages that I can cook for his children. I told him if his children are hungry, he should feed them something and suggested a burger joint nearby. His children were too hungry so he had to buy them some burgers. Now my mom says I was a bit asshole and inhospitable as I could have prepared something for his children.Edits:1- my cousin started his travel at around 2 so I assumed he had fed his children. So I decided to rest before he came to my home2- I offered some light snacks like chips or biscuits but his children wanted a full meal. 3- eating dinner at 9-8pm is the usual norm in my culture.So I am 175 cm ( 5‚Äô9) which is average hight were I am from and I am interested in a girl who is 155 cm ( 5‚Äô1) which is considered a bit short. I know genetics can work in weird way but I want to ask people who had similar experience.Thanks in advance.Today was my mom birthday and 10 min before the party my dad told me to send him a document by tomorrow noon. In those 10 min I prepared the file but party was about to begin so I wanted to send it tomorrow morning. During the party when we were eating cake, my dad kept asking for that document for 5 min straight . I told him it‚Äôs mom birthday and I will send it when it‚Äôs finished. But he kept going on so I got angry but didn‚Äôt say anything ( you can tell when I get angry form my body ) left in the middle of party and sent him the file and then returned to the party. When I returned My dad jokingly told me that he always do things for me and he never gets angry. I told him that I don‚Äôt push him to do something asap when there is time. And if he feels that way he shouldn‚Äôt do anything for me from now on. Both of us got angry but for sake of our mom didn‚Äôt talk to each other after that. My sister later told me that we know our dad and he was probably joking about doing stuff for us. I told her his jokes are just his truth he try to hide with a joke and she agreed. So was I asshole for getting angry in the first place ? Or for my response to him ?. So I‚Äôm usually clueless in reading the lines so I want to ask it here. I was working in an office for a few months and she was my coworker and sat beside me. We had a lot of fun and were joking a lot but as we were coworkers I didn‚Äôt want to ruin work so I didn‚Äôt pursue her. Then I changed my job and after that we started messaging in our spare time. ( like I teased her that I liked a client from my previous work and she would get jokingly mad). 2-3 weeks ago I changed my phone number and I forgot to tell her. Today I made a story in my Instagram and she immediately messaged that she missed me. We chatted a bit and I gave her my new phone number.I have some feelings for her but I don‚Äôt want to ruin our friendship either. So do you guys think she is just being a friend or is she interested ?. For background my parents spend nearly 80k $ on My brother (32M) education and after graduation ( 2 years ago), he is still unemployed. My parents want him to marry him so he may be motivated to go to work. I on the other hand studied with a full scholarship and has maybe asked my parents for 5k $ in all of my life. So when they talked about this topic I just felt a bit angry and told them that I am their son as well, maybe leave something for me as well ? Now I know it‚Äôs their money and they can do what they want with it but I can‚Äôt help myself from feeling bitter.I have chance to move to either of these countries and I‚Äôm conflicted. I don‚Äôt speak German so I have to spend a year learning it. On the other hand usa political landscape and price of healthcare scares me.The god-emperor is not subjected to any rule made be lesser beings. So by joining galactic community it means others can overrule the god-emperor, thus it is the highest heresy.We broke up 8 months ago and it took me nearly 6 month to be finally over her. Now I feel like I‚Äôm ready again to be in a new relationship with this amazing girl. This is something I never thought would happen for me again, but it happened. It will happen for you too, just give it time.I thought with myself, did I really wanted to be with someone who was cheating on me with another guy?Even if we didn‚Äôt break up at that time, things would have fallen out eventually. So I realized I got lucky and we broke up before something more serious happened between us.I tried to but I can‚Äôt.I thought it would get easier, but miss her so much. Miss her good morning messages, miss her laugh, miss her smell. I know that break up was the right decision but I wish I didn‚Äôt, I wish I was still with her.So I want to start as militaristic + materialistic empire, overtime empire would compass half of galaxy. Then citizens decide to use chemical bliss while slaves do all the work. So if anyone has done this can you describe if it‚Äôs hard or easy to be done ?. I would pick Autonomy, seems cool to not want to destroy or preserve things, instead desiring independence and freedom.I don‚Äôt know why.Since it will take a longer time for us casual readers to read the book, can you please make a ban on the posts about this book ?. In past she tried to intervene in our relationship. She now sent me pic of messages that is between my gf and some guy, which won‚Äôt show if my gf is the one that is messaging, another is my gf profile pic in WhatsApp. So i doubt the validity of her claims, but I‚Äôm a bit paranoid so I don‚Äôt know what should I do.We decided sometimes ago to visit this national park, I agreed because I didn‚Äôt want to be left out. Since then one by one my friends decided to cancel it and today last 3 of us decided to cancel the trip all together. Honestly I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs canceled, I much prefer to sit in a corner and read some books rather than travel to somewhere.Mine are: 1-elend speech before leading his soldiers in the battle of Hathsin 2-Dalinar giving up his shardblade for Bridgmen 3- kaladin and shallan talking to each other in that cave.Did taln finally broke down or did odium found a way to go around it ? I ask this because I saw someone mention the latter but I‚Äôm not sure about it. Update: it seems I was right.I have all dlc and latest version. Should I go all housecarl ?. So I installed the game after 3 years. Played with Varus and had yuumi as supp. For whole game she was stuck with me and didn‚Äôt do much else. I told her to poke or ward but other team player said that‚Äôs how yuumi is supposed to be play. Just wondering if this is correct then yuumi is not really fun or good.1-Scadrial (Mistborn) 2- First of the sun (sixth of dusk) 3-sel (elantris ) 4-Nathlis (warbreaker) 5-taldain (white sand) 6-roshar (stormlight archive) 7- threnody ( shadows for silence in the forests of hell). Spook said in the books that he wish he was strong and powerful like elend and vin so he could have been useful. Was he jealous of them or did he admired them ?. After marrying elend, did she change her last name to venture ? Or added venture to her name since she didn‚Äôt have a last name ?. I specifically mean sarene and Siri from elantris and warbreaker respectively. Because ultimately both of them will age and die while their husbands will not.At the start of quarantine I decided to study some books for my work, I started well, already finished 2 books and made notes, but since last week I can‚Äôt seem to get myself to get up and study further more. I seem to be procrastinating a lot, watching tv series and movies. I don‚Äôt know when will I be able to change this current situation.So for my reread of first era I decided to also read secret history simultaneously with it. And it was a lot of fun. Suggest you guys should do it too if you have finished all of books. End of hero of ages was less sad with reading secret history and see what happened to elend and vin.I somehow imagined him like a blood angel.
    I teach PreK and, like many people, the kids generally don't like spiders. One of the kids found a spider in the attached bathroom and the entire class started freaking out. I told them that it's actually a good thing the spider is there because it will take care of things like flies and mosquitos. The kids still weren't convinced. So I suggested they give it a name. That got them. They all pondered and spitballed a few ideas before settling on Legs. Now, Legs the Bathroom spider is our friend. The kids all will say hi to him when they go in there. And, spiders in general seem to not be scary anymore to them. We found another spider on the playground and the kids decided it was Legs's cousin and must also be a friend. I don't think I'll every be able to convince my arachnaphobic husband that spiders are friends though.. I do cooking projects every week with my PreK students. I want to make fresh pasta with them. I have access to a pasta maker and a toaster oven so I was think about doing a baked pasta. Every recipe I‚Äôve looked up calls for dried pasta. How long would I need to cook it if I used fresh and what other adjustments would I need to make? Any tips and tricks would be appreciated!. My late mother's boyfriend has always been a creep. He came into my life when I was around 16 (I'm 34 now) and has always been one of those guys who seems charming at first glance but you just get a vaguely icky feeling around him. The icky feeling got a lot worse when he moved us in with his wife (yes, he was married, no his wife didn't like the fact that he moved in his affair partner) and kids. I'm not going to detail the abuse but it was a bad situation. He never laid a hand on me, but he still did plenty to scar me, metaphorically. I cut contact with the whole family years ago, but recently my youngest sibling told me that he got himself fired. You see, this man has been harassing his female coworkers for years. But he never got any repercussions because he is good friends with all of the bosses. The victims were too scared to speak up. Well, he messed up this time. He decided to ask two very young workers to flash him because he had a bad day. He asked while another male worker was in the room. Thankfully, this worker had the fortitude to do something and he called the man out on the spot and then reported his behavior. He was fired for sexual harassment. And then it gets better. He went to his second job in a foul mood and told his boss exactly why when asked. And he was fired again. I was shocked at his audacity. But I shouldn't have been surprised. He has gotten away with his behavior for decades. He didn't think he was doing anything wrong and has long since held the belief that he was owed sexual gratification regardless of what his target thought. I'm relieved that he is finally getting consequences, though I doubt he will ever learn.. He didn't get that miracle.. My mother was abusive growing up, mostly emotionally and verbally. She wasn't cartoonishly evil. That would have made it so much easier to walk away. No, her abuse was so easy to explain away. She was stressed from being a single mother to three kids and worked so hard to support us. She didn't mean to snap like that. She was exhausted from working two jobs. She had a terrible migraine and was sick and we got too loud. Of course we were going to get screamed at. Spanking didn't work on me so she had no choice but to spank my brother when I did something wrong. It was all your fault you see. It was all to easy to take the blame myself. And it wasn't all the time. Most of the time she was fun and loving and sweet. Or so I told myself. It got worse when she met her last boyfriend. He was still married but his wife didn't like sex so she was fine with him having sex with other women. She was even fine with him moving us all in (she wasn't fine with it but she pretended she was). There, we were subjected to constant screaming fights fueled by alcohol. Because, my darling mother was also a third generation alcoholic. How else could she possibly cope with the stress? She was supporting three kids all on her own you know. She's a big part of the reason I never touch the stuff. I left for college but couldn't break away. They needed me, you know. Who was going to watch the kids? And you damn well better be sure to get good grades. You're so smart. You'll get a good job and rescue us all from poverty. Or even better, use your cute face to hook a rich husband. Don't even look at a boy unless he has at least six figures in the bank. My now-husband helped me recognize how toxic the whole thing was and helped me slowly cut the tendrils that had a strangle hold on me. It took years. But I got away. I cut contact. My mother died suddenly from a heart attack just over a year ago. I hadn't spoken to her for two years prior and hadn't see her in person for years prior to that. After helping my sister take care of funeral arrangements and all that, I stopped thinking about her. I thought I was completely free. She would never call asking for money again. She would never guilt me about being a terrible daughter. She would never hurt me again. But last night, I dreamed about her. About confronting her. About telling her how much she hurt me growing up and how much she fucked me up. About the telling her how I still struggle with the anxiety and depression she shoved into me. And even in the dream, she still refused to take accountability. She refused to believe that it was her fault. I realized that I haven't let it go and I'm angry. I'm angry that I never had that confrontation. That I never straight up told her how I felt and what she did. She never really understood why I left. More often than not, she blamed it on my 'abusive and controlling' husband who is in reality, neither of those things. I am now strong enough to tell her all of those things. Strong enough to stand against her rather than just run away. And now I never can. When she died, I grieved the mother I never had. And now, I'm angry that she will not ever face that reckoning. Maybe it's a good thing that I'm angry. Maybe it's helping me burn through those lingering feelings of helplessness and fear growing up. I don't know. It's clear that I still have some healing to do. I may never be done healing. But I'm hoping that shouting all of this into the void will help. I just can't keep it buried or it will never stop hurting.I work at a year-round preschool, teaching the 4-5 age group. I got a new student for the summer who just moved here from France. She is only just learning English and while she can more or less make herself understood, she's been struggling. She cries pretty hysterically for the first hour and nothing I do comforts her. All she wants is her Dad. But yesterday, she seemed like she has begun getting comfortable. Previously, she alternated between following me around the room or drawing a picture at art. But, yesterday she ventured out and actually started playing with the other kids (who have been doing an incredible job trying to include her in their games). When we did our circle time, she showed us how to count to 20 in French. She also tried to teach me a few words in Mandarin (she moved from France, but her parents are originally from China. She grew up speaking both languages). I have managed to learn how to say "Hello, my name is (teacher)," much to her delight. It was so wonderful seeing her beginning to get comfortable and for the first time, her Dad got to see her engaged and smiling when he came in to pick her up. I'm hoping the day will come soon, that she will enter my class with a smile too. So, that's my most recent happy story. Tell me about yours. What victory have you had lately?. As the reflection stared back, he was just as certain he saw it wink.I have a child coming to my class whose family is from Ethiopia. I like to have books representing all the children in my class and their cultures. Do any of you have any recommendations about good quality books about Ethiopia or set in Ethiopia? The kids in my class are 4-5 years old, so ideally I would like books suited to that age group. Fiction and nonfiction are both fine. I also wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to books that could help me learn a bit more about the culture. Thanks in advance!. I have a child coming to my class whose family is from Ethiopia. I like to have books representing all the children in my class and their cultures. Do any of you have any recommendations about good quality books about Ethiopia or set in Ethiopia? Thanks in advance!. I've recently had a slew of unsatisfying, clich√© books and need some help finding a good one. I prefer a female lead but it's not required. I also prefer fantasy but I'm open to other genres. I don't mind a romance but if there is one, then I would like it to be one built over time on mutual respect and admiration and not just "that guy is so hot and perfect" insta-love nonsense. I am very interested in books written by nonamerican authors and am particularly interested in books that have lore based on African or Indian mythology. Thank you for the help!. Vishnal accepted a date from me and told me to meet him at 10:00 in the town square the next day. I go there and he's still in his room in his pajamas. He didn't leave until 18:00 and then he got mad at me for standing him up. This happened twice. Has anyone encountered this and is there any way to fix it?. My dominant hand is stuck in a splint for a few weeks. I usually play on my PS4 but that‚Äôs out since I can‚Äôt hold a controller right now. I have a laptop though and I would love some suggestions for some fun games that I could play with limited range of motion. Thanks in advance!. She's my mother. I love her but I also don't. She wasn't a very good mother and I ended up being more the mother of the household to the point that she got me flowers for mother's day. She was often emotional/verbally abusive to us and I spent a lot of my childhood shielding my siblings from her wrath. I went low contact with her in my mid-20s and we ended up just not talking at all. I hadn't actually talked to her for about two years prior to her death other than an occasional birthday or holiday text. Other than that, the only contact would be if I contacted her first or if she wanted something from me. She never called me just to see what I was up to or to just chat. My sister was closer to her and told me that mom talked about me all the time but she didn't care enough to pick up the phone. My sister kept talking about how she was taking steps to be better and was trying to be a good mother but she never tried for me. I'm sad and angry and relieved and regretful and I think I'm mourning the mother I didn't have more than the one I did have.One of my student (he‚Äôs four) just found out that he‚Äôs going to be a big brother and he is not pleased at all. He‚Äôs mentioned several times that he wants to give the baby away. I want to pick up a few books on the topic to help him process the changes that are coming. I appreciate the help!. I just finished reading Amish Vampires in Space. I swear it's a real book. It was also much better than I thought it would be. I don't know much about Amish culture but it looks like the author did his research and tried to be respectful. I found myself actually enjoying the plot. It was no literary masterpiece but I legitimately enjoyed the read. I was fascinated by the look at a possible future and it seemed pretty plausible. The author made an effort to make the vampires scientific. I am no scientist but it all seemed plausible to a reasonably intelligent, casual reader. I think my favorite part is how easy it would have been to make this rather ridiculous premise into a joke but the author took it seriously. So, I'm curious. Have you read any books that you were surprised that you enjoyed? Or one that you picked up as a joke?. I just finished the Winternight Trilogy by Katherine Arden. While I had mixed feelings on the series as a whole, I loved the Russian folklore and I would love to read more books with Russian influence. Thank you!. My husband is a sleep-talker. It doesn't happen extremely often, but it always makes me laugh when it does happen. So this morning, I was rolling over trying to get comfortable. Husband offered to move and I told him I was fine and to go back to sleep. He said, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm sleeping. Entering sleep mode‚Ä¶Hey everybody it‚Äôs Dream Husband just here to check in. How‚Äôs everybody doing? Everybody ok? Looks like you all know what you‚Äôre doing‚Ä¶DREAM HUSBAND OUT!‚Äù Husband was completely unaware of any of this.I was playing with one of the kids and she just stopped and said ‚ÄúMs. Talibob I love your hair. How many dollars do you want for it?‚Äù I‚Äôve been teaching for a solid decade and this is the first time I‚Äôve had a child try to buy my hair. üòÇ. I was just thinking about this story and I thought a few people might get a laugh out of it. I got myself my first ever boyfriend while I was in college. We were pretty serious right from the beginning. My dad lived in a different state and didn't get to meet my boyfriend (K) right away. Dad invited us up on summer break so we could spend some time together and so he could finally meet K. Dad is a pretty chill guy and K was charismatic and desperate to impress Dad, so they got along pretty well. At one point, we went out to eat at a cute little local diner that had decent food and awesome ice cream. After we got our food, K asked the waitress for steak sauce. My super chill dad went absolutely thunderous and the waitress went very pale. My step mom and I were both very confused at the sudden change in temperaments. Waitress grabbed K's shoulder and asked in a shaky voice, "What did you say?" K, now very confused, repeated his request for steak sauce. The waitress visibly relaxed and went to get some. Dad calmed down and I asked what happened. It turns out that K's southern drawl slurred his words a bit. Dad thought that K had asked the waitress for ***sexy talk!*** We finished our meal with no further trouble, but as luck would have it that same waitress also worked in the gas station we stopped at later. Stepmom asked her what she thought K had said and she confirmed that she also initially heard a request for sexy talk. K and I are now married and have been together for nearly 12 years. To this day, Dad still jokes about the time K asked the waitress for sexy talk and sends a bottle of A-1 in every package he sends us.I take a pretty early bus to work. I am almost always the only one at my stop. Like usual, I had my headphones in listening to music. This guy approached me and asked me when the bus was coming. I responded that it was coming in the next minute or two. He asked me if I was going to work, I responded yes and then put my headphones back in. I wasn't in the mood to chat with some random guy. He tried to get me to chat some more but I just ignored him. He got mad and stormed off muttering about 'mean bus stop girls' being rude. I had to laugh though. The bus came while he was having his little temper tantrum and he ended missing the bus.My niece is four years old and my sister is having a rough time getting her to go on the potty. She‚Äôs pretty good at pooping on the potty but just won‚Äôt pee. If you have any resources that I can suggest to her that might help, I would be very grateful.My husband and I take turns choosing movies to watch and it‚Äôs my turn. But I don‚Äôt know what I want to watch. What are some of your favorites and why? Maybe I‚Äôll find some inspiration.
    Friends had a Halloween party scheduled yesterday but messaged us all in the morning that they decided to cancel it and have a kickback instead bc of everything going on in the world. I missed the message and showed up as Barbie‚Ä¶..I mean it makes sense bc they didn‚Äôt wanna make a bunch of ‚Äúslasher‚Äù style treats and decorations. But like‚Ä¶ I felt like a lunatic where everyone else was dressed up in fall clothes and me in a hot pink dress.Has this happened to anyone else?. And what did you order?. Last month I went on a trip with some friends for a chill vacation. We stayed at an airbnb but the host required a $250 deposit via a ‚Äú3rd party API integration‚Äù (using Square) ‚Ä¶ I contacted airbnb and they said yeah that‚Äôs legit. So I paid it When we checked out, I missed one of the instructions to throw out all the trash into the bins outside (like a few steps away). So there was literally one trash can with some orange peels and stuff in the kitchen and I thought wow Airbnb is great because I heard they changed their policies to not have us do any chores on the way out! A week later, they didn‚Äôt return the initial deposit and charged us an additional $150 cleaning fee!!! For a trash can! And they said the place was ‚Äúexcessively dirty‚Äù with a picture of the trash can. I apologized for missing the instruction but I said $150 for some trash inside the trash can shouldn‚Äôt be $150.So the ‚Äúspecialized team‚Äù responded and agreed, so they said they‚Äôd waive the fee.A week later, I called about my initial $250 deposit as I never got it back. And the specialized team said ‚Äúoh yeah so we think you need to pay the cleaning fee after all. And the $250 deposit is out of our control because it‚Äôs a 3rd party integration‚Äù‚Ä¶ so the deposit is in some gray area. It‚Äôs been like 5 weeks since my stay and after this hassle I‚Äôm never using Airbnb again.If Donna is so much better than her allegedly abusive ex husband because he ‚Äúput his kids lives in danger‚Äù then why was it ok for her to be on drugs taking care of her kids, driving them places? She could have killed someone being high and driving! I really feel like the 71 year old judge needed to retire by now. This was in no way a fair judgement. Donna needed to go to jail and rot in there. Her children can visit and know what the consequences are of addiction too.It‚Äôs the first day of Ramadan, a holy month for Muslims. All my friends post positive messages and well wishes for the month to be spiritually cleansing‚Ä¶. But I‚Äôm so triggered by the random posts I see that say things like ‚ÄúI pray for my parents who raised me because I‚Äôll never be able to pay them back.‚ÄùI shouldn‚Äôt have been abused. I shouldn‚Äôt have been neglected emotionally and physically. Did they raise someone who was resilient? Yes. Do I have gratitude for my life and my upbringing? Also yes. I just wish I had a better childhood. I don‚Äôt even remember much of it. And I still catch myself not breathing randomly.I‚Äôm pretty new to this community and have found various threads talking about medicines and dietary changes that have helped people‚Äôs HS. What‚Äôs your treatment regimen? Could be medicine, dietary, or routine (like warm compresses x times a day)!. Anyone have issues with spironolactone and their period happening irregularly?I have pcos and normally my period doesn‚Äôt happen often (like once every 2-3 months). my doctor recommended spironolactone and metformin and now it‚Äôs spotting all the time :(Does it get better over time?. As a young child I had a lot of extended family rotating to our place in the US from my home country (Pakistan) where hygiene isn‚Äôt as important to them. Sometimes they had lice and I would end up getting it. My Nmother hated one of my cousins for no good reason and doubly so when I got lice for the 4th time in my life at age 9. So, to punish us both, she bought RAID bug spray and sprayed that in our hair instead of the pharmacy remedies for lice that ‚Äúwere expensive and did the same thing.‚Äù I remember being dizzy after a few installments of this over a week.
    Just looking for some case studies to read and learn. Hope everyone's Sunday is going well :). I recently just moved to Las Vegas, coming from the Midwest. Came here for a career advancement. My dad came with for the drive to help me move in. This morning I dropped him off at the airport. As we were saying goodbye he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you and I love you. Take care of yourself man‚Äù I started tearing up. I‚Äôve only heard that from my dad 3 times and first time he‚Äôs ever told me he‚Äôs proud of me. I ended up balling as I was driving back to my apartment. I have no idea why this made me emotional. I think just being a man you don‚Äôt get a chance to hear this kind of stuff.Maybe it‚Äôs my co workers and friends, they‚Äôll tell me they‚Äôre getting paid two days early from banks like Ally, SoFi, and more. To me, I don‚Äôt see any benefits to it. You‚Äôre still waiting 7-14 days to get paid, the days are just switched up.Edit: I‚Äôm talking about those advertisements that say ‚Äúget your paycheck 2 days early‚Äù.Moving to Las Vegas for a job opportunity. I don‚Äôt know many people out there besides co-workers. I‚Äôve always been around family my entire life. This will be the first time I will 100% be alone. Has anyone been in this situation? If so, how did you deal with the anxiety of moving that far?. Hey everyone, trying to figure out if going to school is worth it in my situation and sharing a story of my employment history of climbing the ladder. I currently have little over 3 years of casino experience 2.5 of it is marketing and other is security. August of 2020, I started off in security in a small casino in the Midwest. I made it a goal to learn who was who. I introduce myself to some people in the marketing department and managed to become friends with them. One day I asked to be a fly on the wall to understand their department. While doing that I decided to take a course on Udemy for Marketing and a course with Google ad. In February of 2021, I got word from the director himself that a Marketing Coordinator position will be opening up. March of 2021, I started in marketing in that same casino. I had a goal to prove my worth and understand the business as whole. Along the way, I managed to build a good relationship with a few people at our corporate which lead to me wanting to take a vacation to Las Vegas(June of 2023) to think about the idea if I moved down there. I ended up telling one of my colleagues that I will be in the area, he offered to show me around the office and meet the department. I ended up hitting it off with everyone and they were aware of my work. That same colleague gave me word that they are opening up a position. I ended up applying for the hell of it, and crushed the interview. August of 2023 I started at a good entry level position in Marketing at our corporate office in Las Vegas. Now I think about my next move and how high I can climb since I managed to make it this far. This brings me to the question, should I consider going back to school? I know my employer offers tuition pay(I think $5k a year or semester). Other part is me is think I should keep on building off network and experience. Not to mention, this is one of the biggest casino companies in the world and I'd like to stay in this industry. Thoughts and advice?. Any local run clubs? Casual or competitive. New to the area and would like to make some friends.
    I started low dose estrogen & progesterone about 2 weeks ago. I‚Äôve been bleeding for about five days now, which is annoying in itself, but holy shit my emotions are hugely out of control. I‚Äôm normally pretty even-keeled, mildly depressed is my standard emotional mode. Now I feel chaotic inside. Everything is wonderful or terrible and there‚Äôs no middle ground anymore. It‚Äôs bad enough that I‚Äôm questioning my decision to start the hormones. Does it level out again eventually?. Looking for a spot for a date where we‚Äôre not sitting across a table from each other like it‚Äôs an interview. Reasonable prices, good beer or cocktails, and something like sofas, loveseats or banquette seating. Downtown, west side, Northside, basically central location. Any recommendations?. Thank you! That gave me such a big smile to see another pumpkin there this year.It was our second date. We went to a movie and held hands. I‚Äôm 52 and I feel like a teenager, all blushing and giddy. Just wanted to tell someone. üòä. But some words should not be used as names. I kind of wish these two were related, but I encountered them years apart:VendettaandTyranny. It‚Äôs been 521 days. I finally made an appointment with the gyno to talk about the state of affairs down there. What do I wake up to this morning? Of course. Stupid uterus was hoarding.I tried to follow along on a 20-minute yoga for beginners video and completely failed. I can‚Äôt sit on my heels. I can‚Äôt do downward dog. I can‚Äôt do most of the things the video considered basic moves. This just breaks my heart; the years and years of neglect that have resulted in this pitiful state. Always putting work and partners and parents and chores and EVERYTHING else before taking care of myself. I can touch my toes and that‚Äôs about it. I just needed to share my shame and regret with folks who might understand.My partner is going to be starting chemotherapy and radiation therapy for a brain tumor, around the end of August through September. He‚Äôll be going for daily infusions and they‚Äôre telling him this will be a ‚Äúmilder‚Äù form of chemo, that he shouldn‚Äôt have a ton of side effects, but I‚Äôm taking that with a grain of salt. For those of you who‚Äôve been through this, either for yourself or a loved one, I‚Äôd like to know what I can do to help him be comfortable through this. Is there anything you wish you‚Äôd had available, had done differently, etc.? Tips for dealing with specific side effects? Any advice you‚Äôd give based on your experience is appreciated. Our emotional bond is very strong, and he has a therapist to work with on the impact having cancer has on his mental health. I know not to expect a lot from him physically, as I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be tired a lot, at the very least. He has plenty of freedom to indulge in hobbies, he isn‚Äôt employed so there‚Äôs no pressure in that regard. We‚Äôre actively discussing everything and I‚Äôve let him know he can ask for whatever he needs.I don‚Äôt mean like a crazy nostril hair. I mean a wild hair growing off the skin on my freakin‚Äô nose where nothing should be growing except my pores. Why is this happening?. Every time I watch the last episode of season 1 I get a little weepy. The contrast of the adults taking in the grim need against the moment of joy among the friends. The shot of Sister Michael not exactly smiling but definitely not sneering. And the most perfect song for the moment playing. Just brilliant and evocative.I‚Äôm excited for all these tasty beers waiting to be sipped. Heading to the afternoon session soon. Any Friday attendees have a favorite to recommend?. I‚Äôd love to get my car‚Äôs interior steam cleaned after some dog accidents. Anyone know of a good detail shop, preferably on the west side?. You know, the ones that advertise on podcasts and social media platforms a lot. The ones I‚Äôve looked into don‚Äôt take insurance, but I think I‚Äôd be ok with that. The convenience factor is what‚Äôs appealing to me right now. I feel like I need to get back into therapy to cope with some issues, but taking time out of work to get to a weekly appointment just isn‚Äôt feasible. If you have an experience to share, I‚Äôd love to hear it!. Most Indian restaurants I‚Äôve been to in the US will put a very small number of green peas in their rice. Like five peas in a huge dish of rice. That‚Äôs not enough to really add flavor or even color to the rice, so why do they bother?. I usually watch a classic horror movie on religious holidays, and The Exorcist has long been a favorite. I‚Äôve seen it well over a dozen times and there are aspects of it that I love, with a lot of weaknesses that I can accept. But on this viewing, for some reason I am completely hating Chris MacNeil. She‚Äôs really pretty awful. She‚Äôs verbally abusive to her servants and assistant, turning on the charm with her movie friends. She overindulges her daughter. As Regan gets sicker, Chris can‚Äôt hold it together for more than a couple minutes before lashing out at those trying to help her. Her constant screaming and hysterics are just terrible behavior and don‚Äôt help her daughter at all. I‚Äôm not sure why I never noticed that she‚Äôs a loathsome character before. I find the priests to be the ones I feel sympathy for in what they go through, far more than the other. Curious what others may think. And are there other movies you‚Äôve love for years that you suddenly have seen differently?. I received a hand-me-down Microsoft Surface running Windows 10, and thought I‚Äôd be able to play via an emulator. I‚Äôve tried Bluestacks 5 and LDPlayer 3.118, installed the Facebook app within the emulator and logged in, then installed MD. I normally play on an iPhone but I verified my cloud backup is with FB. When I try to active the cloud sync from MD in the emulator, it just keeps erroring out, message ‚ÄúWe had problems making a connection, so Cloud Saving is not enabled. Please try again later.‚Äù The game runs really slow in the emulator; is there any way to speed things up? I‚Äôve run Windows update after doing a factory reset on the tablet so it should be optimized. Any other ideas on how to get this working? Same problem occurs with both emulators I‚Äôve tried.Took the day off work and am heading out of town for a weekend at a spa. So of course, my period ‚Äî which has been absent for MONTHS ‚Äî decides this is the perfect weekend to resume operations in full force. Bled through my period panties in three hours. Stupid uterus was being a hoarder.I‚Äôve worked remotely for 14 of these years. My current boss I‚Äôve never met in person. I‚Äôm in a dead-end position of extreme overwork, my physical and mental health are suffering, and my requests for support get no response. How do you quit a job these days? Over the phone?Is it bad to say too much about why you want to leave? I‚Äôm owed ten days of PTO and don‚Äôt want to jeopardize getting them. HR can be tricksy so I want to be careful.I‚Äôd really like to surprise some coworkers who are working their butts off with me to deliver a project on a very tight schedule. I don‚Äôt know them well enough to know their home addresses, they‚Äôre in a different city than I am, and we‚Äôve all been working from our homes forever so I can‚Äôt send something to an office. Are there any sites where you can select and pay for a gift (I‚Äôm thinking coffee beans, baked goods, something like that) but provide only the recipient‚Äôs email address and the business will contact them for delivery details?. What at-home tool have you purchased and really like? I see lots of options on Amazon now. Has the tool been easy to use? Was the app easy to install and use? Curious if there‚Äôs a consensus on best products so far.On the Tomb 55 episode they keep referring to a book and saying it‚Äôll be in the show notes, but it isn‚Äôt, and I can‚Äôt figure out what they‚Äôre saying. The Cauldron? The Colbrun? Does anyone know what they‚Äôre talking about?.
    One night a while ago there was a full moon. One of my friends and I met up at a coffee shop to get tea and check out the moon via telescope. So we were checking out the moon in the coffee shop parking lot when a car rolled by. The guy rolled his window down to talk to us. We didn't think it was weird at all because of the special moon that night and we were using a telescope in the parking lot. We talked to him for a bit and let his son see the moon in the telescope. After that he asked us if we wanted perfume. He showed us a box of perfume bottles in his car. Initially thought that was a little odd but we brushed it off as him just trying to be nice.A week later, I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of my mosque. Suddenly this same guy rolls by in his car and tried to sell me the perfume again. He says he has a perfume business. Now I was a little weirded out. A couple weeks go by and I don't see him again. However, the other day I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of my Mosque again and this guy rolls by again. He tried to sell me perfume again and when I said no, he tried to sell me a blanket. Not sure what's going on...&#x200B;. So my coworker was drinking a specialty tea which smelled really good. So I asked her what kind of tea it was and she told me and asked if I wanted some. I told her sure and she's like okay I'll bring you some. And I was like no no I thought you had some, you don't have to get it.But the next day she brought me a packet. Then she was like I would make it for you but I don't want to do that because I don't want it to be weird. I'm like, it wasn't weird until right now when you said that. And then she said no no this place has a lot of drama and a lot of rumors. I was so confused I have no idea what's happening.Tea was good though.All is lost.I feel like one moment they're so advanced that you're using tele-kinesis then the next minute you're using a steering device that requires you to steer by shifting your weight around.

How do you know how much seasoning to add without weighing all the ingredients to calculate the correct proportion?.
    When I was little (10yo maybe) I learned how to do some pretty basic origami shapes so after lunch I was doing a bunch of them with napkins. Anyways, one looked like a kite of sorts and I loved that it created a little ‚Äúpocket‚Äù in the paper and I realized that it fit my mother‚Äôs wedding ring perfectly (she left it on the counter). I put the ring inside the folds of the paper and went away thinking nothing of it. When my mother started screaming looking for it I said ‚Äúoh yeah it‚Äôs in the folded napkin on the table‚Äù but‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt. Next day we asked the cleaning lady we had at the time and she threw it away thinking it was just a napkin. Since the trash day was the day she threw it away, by the time we found out it was already at the city‚Äôs dumping ground. The best part comes now: my mother wanted HER wedding ring back, and even though my father offered to have an exact look alike made she refused and WENT TO THE DUMPING GROUND (all covered up and with knee high boots lol) and looked around the whole neighborhood‚Äôs trash bags until she found ones that looked like the ones we were using at home, went through them and FOUND HER WEDDING RING. I just wanted to share because to this day I still can‚Äôt believe that she managed to find a little gold ring in the middle of literally the whole town‚Äôs trash.In this episode Blair asks Chuck to ‚Äúseduce and destroy‚Äù Vanessa (her words) and eventually says that if Chuck can do it, she‚Äôll you know‚Ä¶ do him.I don‚Äôt know how I never noticed this before but it‚Äôs LITERALLY the plot of Cruel Intentions (one of my favorite movies)! Just a fun little detail that I wanted to share.Have to start by saying that this is somewhat of an old story (his sister is 6yo by now). For the sake of the story let‚Äôs call my classmate Phill and me Anna (not real names). Anyways, I used to go to a private school and I had a PwD classmate (don‚Äôt know exactly what his disability was ‚Äòcause I never asked obviously, but it was a cognitive/learning disorder) so he had his own assistant teacher, would take different tests, sometimes get out of class to do specific activities and things like that. Because of that it was obviously harder for him to socialize even though no one was mean towards him or anything like that, but I was always kind of closest with him and he really liked me. We were just kids at this point (like 12yo) and his mother got pregnant so their parents told him that he could choose his baby sister‚Äôs name, and have in mind I didn‚Äôt know any of this. One day after school I was waiting for my mother to pick me up and his father got in and stopped to talk to me, then he said that they‚Äôd let Phill choose his sister‚Äôs name and that he chose ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù BECAUSE of me. I‚Äôm eighteen now and it‚Äôs still one of the things I feel most honored of in my life.I live in a country where a law trying to prohibit same sex marriage just passed in congress, mostly because of conservative christian politicians, and I (as a christian myself) just think it‚Äôs bullshit.I mean, as christians we should understand that God never wanted a dictatorship or a theocracy, it clearly says in the bible that we are not here to overthrow man‚Äôs justice and we should respond to authority figures and abide by the law. That said and with the mentality that not everyone is chosen by God and not everyone will have salvation, and also because I live in a secular state that means that dogmatic beliefs shouldn‚Äôt make their way into the whole country‚Äôs justice system. By literally and legally prohibiting people to live their lives just because you don‚Äôt agree with it, doesn‚Äôt that make you a bad christian? Shouldn‚Äôt we fight for everyone‚Äôs rights as citizens, and then have our own belief system ‚Äúimposed‚Äù (couldn‚Äôt find a better word) only within the community? God never wanted to be forced on anyone, that‚Äôs a blessing he gives only a few people on this world, so why is the majority of the christian community trying to forcefully include ideals like this on ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù while fully knowing that ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to be saved? Honestly questioning this and don‚Äôt it to become a fight so please be respectful, I have started this discussion in my congregation already and it didn‚Äôt go so well.This is gonna be a long post but here we go:I‚Äôm not team Jess but honestly I love him so much. In terms of who is the better person between Rory‚Äôs boyfriends he will always win but will never be the best BOYFRIEND (in my opinion). First of all, they have the worst timing ever. They were super compatible when they were young but that relationship just had way too many problems. When they first got together, Jess was too imature for Rory, meaning that he didn‚Äôt have a sense of future and she was really ‚Äúput together‚Äù in the Chilton era. Also they started by cheating on Dean and I mean I hate Dean but that‚Äôs no way to start a relationship. Young Rory also had no idea of how a functional relationship should be, she never had a good example at home, Dean was so toxic and overprotective and Jess was the complete opposite, I wanna say ‚Äúdisinterested‚Äù even though he loved her, but after overbearing Dean I understand that anything short of obsession seemed weird to her (like Jess not being with her 24/7 or never calling when he said he would). Lastly, Jess just leaving without telling her is ABSURD and no one ever makes him accountable for that, he could‚Äôve at least broke up with her properly. Then, Jess comes back when she is finally starting to move on and just springs an ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù at her face and proceeds to literally run away, I mean please. Rory not running away with him the night he visits her in her dorm room is one of the only good decisions she made in her Yale era, he wanted her to throw away her future like it was nothing and that made me really annoyed, he was so selfish in that moment. Then, when Jess finally sorts out his life, Rory is the one crashing down. I love the ‚ÄúwhYyy did you DRop out of YAle‚Äù monologue as much as the next girl, but in that moment the tables have turned and now it‚Äôs Rory who doesn‚Äôt deserve Jess. I can‚Äôt enfatize how much Rory has changed I mean she is NOT the same person she was when her and Jess were together and I just can‚Äôt see them being compatible anymore. The episode where Dean breaks up with her after the party her grandparents throw her by saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong here anymore, do I?‚Äù kind of sums up what I‚Äôm trying to say, they just don‚Äôt belong anymore (poor Jess didn‚Äôt need all the Rory drama in his ‚Äúnew and improved‚Äù life, he made his way to the top without losing his personality, and she did the complete opposite).Finally, the cherry on top of the cake is (in my opinion) one of the worst ever Rory decisions when she goes to visit Jess at his publishing company, kisses him (therefore cheating on yet another boyfriend), and goes away ‚Äòcause all she wanted was a petty sense of revenge against Logan. She knew Jess loved her or at the very least still had feelings for her and she straight up used him to try and save her current relationship like girl please get a grip. I felt so sorry for him in that moment. I‚Äôm not gonna get into the revival a lot because I just feel like they changed the character‚Äôs personality way too much and it doesn‚Äôt reflect in their ‚Äútrue selfs‚Äù or something (I‚Äôm a big hater of the revival lol). But seeing Jess still not over Rory made me so sad because the person he can‚Äôt get over is long gone, she isn‚Äôt that girl anymore and he never got a chance to truly see that because they didn‚Äôt interact over the years.Anyways, because of all that I just can‚Äôt see them realistically being a couple for all their life or getting married or anything and I feel that if they ever tried it would be just like Rory and Dean‚Äôs post affair relationship (they idealized each other so much over the years that when they got together it would be impossible to live up to all their expectations and they would end up breaking up). So, to all the team Jess people out there, and I‚Äôm honestly asking this, do you really think they would work as a couple? If so, why?. Basically what the title says, it‚Äôs a Brazilian movie where a black guy goes to medical school and he only has white classmates and it talks a lot about racism. The thing is that the main plot is about a lot of young black guys from the favela going missing and the police never finds their bodies so their family can be in peace. So the main character starts noticing that all the bodies he sees in med school (like in anatomy classes) are black and tries to track down their origins. In this he gets involved in a rabbit hole and realizes they are all unclaimed bodies (probably of the missing guys) and he even gets to identifying one of them by a photo the mothers are distributing around while looking for their sons. If I‚Äôm not mistaken he goes as far as to ‚Äústeal‚Äù this body so the family can have a proper funeral. It also envolves a lot of spirituality and religion, and I clearly remember the last scene being all the mothers of the missing people doing a funeral but only burying the one body the guy stole (‚Äòcause they never found the others).Basically what the title says, it‚Äôs a movie about this girl that moves out of her family farm or something like that and has to go to a new school. I don‚Äôt remember anything about the plot besides the fact that in the end she kinds of ‚Äústorms off‚Äù and just go away (probably romance problems) but in the end she has a change of heart or something and decides to go to the prom and the only way she can get there is by riding her horse I guess.It‚Äôs a guy on tiktok who has a lot of videos going to MAGA conventions all dressed up like them and starts interviewing people and asking questions about how we need to make america great again by *insert here any communist or leftist ideal* and they always agree with him showing that they have absolutely no ideia of what are the political views they defend. He also has a couple of pretty famous videos in an anti abortion manifestation in front of an abortion clinic where he has a speaker and keeps shouting things like ‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs takes women‚Äôs rights to decide what they do with their own bodies‚Äù and when people start getting mad and telling him to leave and calling the cops to get him out of there he starts shouting ‚Äúoh but I hate women, I‚Äôm supposed to be here‚Äù. He also does a bit where he cracks and egg and pours milk over his head and then throw some instant cake mix over his head and say ‚Äúlook I made cake!‚Äù (a genius). Anyways I just can‚Äôt remember his @ and really want to send some of his videos to some friends.I just started the series (still watching season 1) and opened this subreddit to see the posts and hopefully get some spoilers lol, then I saw multiple posts hating on Caroline and saying she‚Äôs selfish etcs. Does she change during the show or am I just not noticing her being terrible?. https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMjSuk78q/. Recently I read ‚ÄúA Very Nice Girl‚Äù by Imogen Crimp because of an amazon sale, never expected much of it and had never heard about it before. Imagine my surprise when it turns out to be the best book I‚Äôve read this year.It‚Äôs about a young opera singer who enters a relationship with an older man, the book explores how this relationship evolves but most importantly it explores the experience of being a woman in her 20s, what society expects of us and what we expect of ourselves. The whole book is written from her perspective and her internal dialogue is amazing. The writing style reminds me of Sally Rooney‚Äôs and also the main character reminds me a lot of Marianne from ‚ÄúNormal People‚Äù. I could not recommend this book more, especially if you are a woman.A movie about a city, more specifically a high school 'cause that's where almost everything went down. Anyways I don't remember much but if I'm not mistaken it was a halloween movie and the plot was basically this terror writer that had all of his characters become real. Then they start attacking the town and try to take over.From the characters I remember: a giant green insect (don't remember wich one exactly), a doll with kind of Chuck vibes (I think this one was the main one like the mastermind behind the whole "monsters trying to take over" attack), a lot of ramdom monsters and a human-like girl (this one was important because she actually helped the writer and the people from the town to fight the other monsters but in the end she also had to go back into the book because she was a fictional character all along).One thing that always bugged me is that they talk about Oak Creek (the place where Kira's mother was during World War II where she created the nogtisune etc...) and Kira's father says that they erased everything about the place and no one even knew it existed.But then in S3 EP23 when they are searching for Lydia and Void Stiles they pass through a gate that has "OAK CREEK" written in metal above it lol.Edit: grammar. So, I saw this movie a long time ago and can't find it anywhere.The movie is about a group of college supervisors (don't know if that's the right word) but anyways a bunch of young adults who supervise the college students. It's super fun and if I'm not mistaken there's a scene when they're distributing comdons for this safe sex iniciative and they started PINNING them to the wall with literal pins so they're making holes in the comdons and by the time they realize what they did a lot of people had already taken the condoms and they get all desperate.Basicaly what the title says lol. It's a movie about two best friends who are still virgins and the girl doesn't want to go to college a virgin so she asks her guy best friend to have sex with her. From what I remember that's basically the movie's entire plot, they do it and hete it and then they try again and again until they are practically each other booty call, but at one point one of them "break up" the hole friends with benefits thing anyways a lot of drama. Anyone know what movie is this?Edit: I think the main character was played by Lily Collins or someone that looks a little like her, if that helps.So, this is a little vague but there was an interview I saw on tiktok and have been trying to find it since. I'm pretty sure it was Joseph Morgan (Klaus in the show) but maybe it was a different actor so feel free to say about other people. Anyways, the interviewer asks the actor what's the best thing a fan has ever told him and his answer is something like "a fan once told me to drop my pants, that happened to be \*another actor name\* he's a big fan if mine". It's a long shot posting this here but if someone knows any interview remotely like this please comment.I'm from Brazil and breaking bad isn't avaiable in any of the streamings here so I was wondering if anyone in this sub knows a good site or drive link or basically anywhere I can watch the show with good quality.A movie I saw not long ago (I think it was a netflix original production) it's about two old guys that are best friends and neighbours. They lived a very monotonous life, always woke up and did the same things (saw the same tv show, ate dinner together at one of their houses, and played a game they invented). Now the game, it was important.They lived near a big road so they would come out to the road, and play the game. It was basically trowing a ball against a wall and try to make it get inside of a big trash can that was out there. They also invented a name to the game, and the name of the game was the name of the movie. And I just can't remember it lol.One of them was sick. He had this disease and was always going to doctor appointments with his friend. By the end of the movie his disease was terminal so he did eutanasia. I confess I wasn't even enjoying the movie and yet I cried in this scene. He sat in the kitchen floor with his best friend, took all of those pills and then just waited for death. After he died, his friend called 911 and did all of the process. The last scene of the movie is a mother and son moving into his best friend's old house and he talks to them normally etc etc and then he asks the boy if he would like to play *insert name of the game he invented with his best friend here* and the boys says that he would like that and thanks him.So, I started watching Dawson's Creek and abandoned it in season 1 but then a friend of mine who likes the show told me it gets better and gave some spoilers so I could look forward to something. I decided to keep watching after she told me that Joey and Pacey become a couple (they were the only characters I actually liked when I started watching the show lol). Now I'm halfway trough season 2 and nothing has happened yet and I'm too afraid to google it and end up getting a lot more spoilers than I intend to, so I came here to ask: when do they get together?. So, I have watched the show 2 times already but my last rewatch was like 2 years ago and really want to watch it again but I can't find any website, drive, telegram group or anything where I can watch it with good quality. Most drive links are 360p. I'm from brazil and the show is only avaiable in one streaming that I don't sign. If somebody knows anywhere I can watch it I would be really thankful, it can have subtitles or not, I really don't care about this.I'm trying to remember the name of this one movie and can't find it. It's an animation movie where this scientist guy makes a robot (if I'm not mistaken, his son died and then he made a robot that looked exactly like his son but I'm not sure). Also, the city they live in is a floating city, and underneath is just a big junkyard where poor people live. At some point the robot kid falls of the edge of the city and ends up in the big junkyard, there he meets a group of people and becomes friends with them, the only problem is: everyone there hates robots, they even have these big stadiums where they host robots fights (to death) and place bets on it. Since the robot kid is an exact copy of a human, nobody knows that he isn't in fact human. As the movie goes on he even fall in love with one of the people of his group in the junkyard but then they find out that he is a robot and I think at some point he's even put in one of these arenas where robots fight to death.Blair, Nate, Serena and Chuck are an amazing squad. I mean, they ARE totally toxic and problematic and everything but when things go south, they're always there for eachother. For example in S1 when Georgina gets back and Serena breaks up with Dan and nobody know what's happening and then she confides only to Blair, Nate and Chuck about how she "killed a guy" and they all have her back. Seriously, they're amazing. Also when Chuck kills Bart and they all help him and Blair to get married in a hurry so she isn't obligated to testify against him in a court of law. We can also see this in the flashbacks in the first episodes that show Nate, Blair and Serena during thanksgiving the year before.The guy who says "hey my name is Luke too we should start a club!" [Schmidt :)](https://youtu.be/axYDvcRANkA)Edit: it's S4 EP4. So, I'm 99% certain that there is an episode where Rory and Logan are in the pool house and he gets up shirtless and wrapped in a sheet. Maybe this never happened and I'm crazy or maybe it did but not exactly as I remember but the thing is that I have rewatched the show about a thousand times and have never seen that scene again. Anyone knows if I'm crazy or if it actually happened?. So, I'm trying to remember the name of a movie I watched a long time ago. The only scene I remember clearly is one of the first ones, it's a romance movie in New York and the main character (male) is buying a cigarette when a women who is in line after him says that the brand of the cigarette he is buying is crap and that this other brand is better, then they start a discussion about which brand is the better one and then they make a bet. They both go outside to see which cigarette lasts longer, and so is the "better". I also think (and everything from now on is mere supposition 'cause I might be thinking of other similar movies or whatever) that there was a scene on a party at her house when he thinks like "oooh I'm gonna declare myself" and when he gets there she is all cozy with another guy. Also, there was something about a book, she had like 60 copies of THE SAME BOOK 'cause when she was little her father or mother or whatever wrote a dedicatory to her in this book, and she lost it, since then she buys all of the copies she can find in second-hand bookstores hoping that one day she will find the one with the dedicatory. At one point I'm pretty sure that the male main character finds the book she wants.
    Hi all,Ten years ago, I worked with a girl. I had a crush on her from the moment I met her and as we became friends, I came to find that she is one of the kindest, sweetest human beings it has ever been my privilege to know.We have not worked together for about nine years, but we've always stayed in touch. We'd see each other once or twice a year (I'd usually take her out to dinner or for a drink for her birthday) and text a few times a year to update each other on our lives.Then Covid happened and we couldn't see each other. I kept the dinner tradition going by sending her dinner via Doordash, but obviously it wasn't the same as spending time with her in person.Now that things are back to "normal", her birthday rolled around and I told her I'd like to take her to dinner and see her in person for the first time in four years, which she agreed to. From my POV at least, it felt like we had a great time. We had some cocktails, split an appetizer, sampled each other's dishes and finished the night by splitting a dessert. All in all, we had dinner for about three hours.Afterward, I walked her to her car and she gave me a very tight hug that felt like it lingered past the normal amount of time. In fact, I was worried that I was holding it too long but when I started to disengage, she squeezed me tighter and it felt like she put her head on my shoulder. Afterward, she offered me a ride back to my car but I declined because I wanted to walk and sort of process things.All in all, to me it was a very pleasant night, but I didn't take it as anything more than seeing an old friend, but virtually all of my close friends are saying that it was 100% a date, that I am an idiot and that in particular, both the long hug and the offer of a ride were her giving me opportunities to kiss her and I missed both of them. I find this all very hard to believe as I'm not the most confident person, but my friends (both male and female) insist that in the selfish/instant gratification-obsessed times we're living in, stunning girls in their 30s with likely endless dating choices in Los Angeles where I live, do not keep in touch with someone for 10 years and choose to have intimate hours long dinner with them if they're not at least considering you romantically, they mostly they just ghost you.I would like to believe this is true, but I really have no idea. I never thought in a million years that she might be interested in me, as this woman is in my eyes a 10/10 in every possible way, but I will admit that things have changed quite a bit since the last time I'd seen her in person. We're now both in our 30s and I've gone from someone who was overweight to having abs, I've started dressing better and taking better care of my skin and hair etc, and I now work my dream job in one of the most exclusive industries in the world. I'm not rolling in it, per se, but when things are going well, I'm not too far from that.So guys, are my friends right? Am I a completely oblivious dumbass? (Believe me, it wouldn't be the first time).Thanks!.

Give us one more season, Clayton!. Hi,I was recently informed that my monthly payments under the SAVE plan will be $0. However, I was wondering if we're still allowed to make some form of payment if we want to, without it affecting our monthly rate? For example, if I still wanted to kick 100 dollars or so toward my loans every month (or whenever I have it), would that be okay?. Apparently, my skill is public speaking, particularly pitching/selling people on things. I'm a screenwriter, so I spend a lot of time working alone in silence, but in order to get people to buy your stuff, you have to do elaborate verbal presentations selling them on the idea. I despise doing this. It makes me sick to my stomach, but I've been told by veterans in my field that I am one of the best they've ever seen at it. This is my blessing and curse.What is your talent that you don't really like doing?. 351, actually. For context, I started last year at 230. I can't seem to find a total count online anywhere for the people in the video and it's hard to count it myself due to cuts and audio, but I think 351 puts me as doing more reps than anyone in the video, which to me personally feels like a huge achievement. Anyone else outperforming the videos?. The song ["Light My Fire"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoX6AKuYWL8) was released in 1967 on The Doors' eponymous debut album and hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July of that year. It's an iconic song that's been in regular radio rotation ever since. I've always thought of it as a sort of bittersweet song. To me it's kinda ethereal and seems kind of dirge-like with Morrison's deep vocals, its kinda plodding, jazzy drums and funeral-ish organ.However, I recently found out that in its initial album release, which is the version that basically every radio station has been playing since its debut, it was mixed incorrectly. Apparently, it was mixed correctly on the original 45 RPM single, but for whatever reason, the album mix supplanted that as the popularly-played version (perhaps due to the album-oriented nature of classic rock stations, or all subsequent re-releases originating from the album version of the track).Thus, it's likely that one of the most famous songs of all-time has actually never been properly heard as its creators intended by the vast majority of the world. In the mid-2000s, a BYU music professor noticed the discrepancy by comparing the recording to live versions performed by the band, the original sheet music and statements by the band members, which all noted that the song was intended to be nearly a half-step higher in the key of A than that of the popularly-heard version.After this was brought to the attention of The Doors' original audio engineer Bruce Botnick, the song was properly re-mixed for the 2007 40th anniversary re-release of The Doors debut album, essentially giving most of the world's listeners the opportunity to hear the song as it was originally intended for the very first time.The [speed-corrected version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkyLtmkujyo) is said to only be 3.5% faster than the well-known version but I find it astounding how radically it alters the mood of the track. When comparing the two, to me, Ray Manzarek's organ is much brighter and almost celebratory while Morrison's voice is much less mournful and more playful. But what I find most startling is the difference in John Densmore's drums. They go from plodding to urgent, seemingly pushing the pace and building to the song's finale. It's amazing what a difference it makes and it completely re-contextualizes the song to me, taking what I've always thought of as a forlorn song and turning it into a song about seizing the day.Anyway, thank you for reading this and if you're still here, please share an interesting fact about one of your niche interests that no one you know IRL would appreciate.Anyone heard anything? I drove by today and was shocked to see it seemingly boarded up and can't find any info online. That place was some of the best Mexican/Korean fusion I've ever eaten in my life and I really hope it's not gone for good.Seriously, what is your favorite kind of soup and why? What would you say while doing the Karen pot stirrers?Personally, I gotta say a good Minestrone improves any day. I just love how zesty it is.Dreya is such a try hard....and you guys are about the only people who might actually care, so thanks for being so awesome and allowing me to share this with someone.My previous best was 132 (matched multiple times in the last couple of months). Granted, I come off the bar usually after around 15 or so to catch my breath and then come back and do a few more before the time is up, but I still feel good about it.Still, I also recently tested myself on an off day and set PRs of 21 consecutive reverse grip chin-ups and 20 consecutive over hand pull-ups, so I'd say that like Mr. Daniel Haas I'm about as fit I've ever been in my life (sorry, wrong workout) and find myself daring to dream of some day hitting 150. I'm not sure it's possible for me personally, but I'm going to just keep pushing play.I just wanted to say happy trails to one of the GOATs, which apparently unexpectedly closed forever, recently.From what I can gather, they were in business for close to 40 years and as someone who grew up down the street, they've been a constant since I first achieved consciousness. My father recalls being incredibly excited as a kid when he rode his bike down Figueroa and first saw that strip mall being constructed.I will always remember the sweet lady who owned the place and the charming way they cut their burgers in half, as if they were meant to be shared. Growing up, my family didn't have much money, so the rare times we got breakfast from Tam's were always a treat. Delicious french toast, accompanied by reliable greasy spoon hash browns and scrambled eggs, served in a classic white styrofoam container with a packet of sugar water syrup. It didn't get much better than that.Until we meet again, Tam's.PS: I'm aware that there are a million Tam's in the LA area, but this was my Tam's and so I will mourn accordingly. Thank you for indulging me.Hi guys,My birthday is coming up and one of the things my family and I miss most from before the pandemic is KBBQ. I was wondering if anyone has any tips or suggestions for best recreating the experience at home?Money isn't really an issue, I'm willing to drive basically anywhere in the city to pick things up and we're all game to give it a shot in terms of cooking. Only limitation I can think of is that we probably wouldn't want to go through the effort of making all the sides, so if those can be acquired pre-made or what have you, that'd probably be best. We do very much like all the sides and I particularly love kimchi.So whether it be just straight up ordering from a place or suggesting somewhere I can pick up the various meats and sides, please lay your knowledge on me.Thank you!. https://imgur.com/wTt4SN7In 2015, a fire broke out at the shopping center near my house. Consumed in the flames was Monterey Donut, a much beloved donut shop run by the sweetest lady in the world. I had been going there since I was eight years old. The building was completely rebuilt as it was before the fire, complete with signage, but Monterey Donut never reopened. We would see the owner around town from time to time and tell her how much we missed her. She would say that she missed us too and invited us to visit her at her sister‚Äôs donut shop in Altadena, but it wasn‚Äôt the same. We mourned deeply. But Monterey Donut was a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies. Two days ago, a sign appeared in its window after six years of silence. Could it be? I found I was so excited that I could barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a donut-free man can feel. A donut-free man at a start of a long journey whose conclusion was uncertain. I hoped I could make it across the parking lot. I hoped to see my friends and taste their baked goods. I hoped the donuts were as true as they had been in my dreams. I hoped. And they were. I cleaned out what they had left, as their return has received an overwhelming response.If you‚Äôd like to support a local business with lovingly made, classic, no-frills donuts, visit Monterey Donut at 5930 Monterey Road, Los Angeles, CA 90042. Cash only.Growing up, K-RTH was a constant in my house but with the shifts in demographics and formats, I find it very sad that none of the "oldies" they played when I was growing up in the 90s are played anymore and are in fact hard to find on the radio, period. Just curious as to what songs come to mind when you think of the station back in the day?A few of mine:Unchained Melody - The Righteous BrothersYou've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' - The Righteous BrothersHold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me - Mel CarterSuspicious Minds - Elvis PresleyKind of a Drag - The BuckinghamsHow Can I Be Sure - The Young RascalsThese Eyes - The Guess WhoMy Girl - The TemptationsWhat Becomes Of the Broken Hearted - Jimmy RuffinReach Out I'll Be There - Four Tops. Hi,My 15 year old dog seems to be on her way out. Can anyone recommend an at-home euthanasia service that would come to Northeast LA? We can't bear the idea of her not being allowed to pass on in the comfort of her own home, so I'm looking for someone who could come to our house and ease her and us through this as professionally as possible.This is a pretty personal/private moment for us as a family. We're not the most social people, so we are not looking for bereavement services or any kind of counseling or spiritual experience (not to dunk on those, it's just not our thing). Just someone who will get in and out in the minimum amount of time, make sure that Violet is not afraid, doesn't suffer and then leave us with our old lady. Money is not really any object. Thank you for the help.Hi!I need faster Internet. I live in Highland Park and have ATT and it is and always has been dogshit. I get 3MBPS, apparently and my Internet cannot even handle a simple Zoom call without glitching out, which is a huge problem as I suddenly find myself in a work situation where I need to do constant Zoom calls. I've checked and naturally I am not eligible for ATT Fiber or Google Fiber. I've considered opening a separate Spectrum account purely for Internet but I've heard that Spectrum sucks ass too.Can anyone point me in the right direction as to what is the best Internet I can get in 90042? I am willing to pay through the nose because I absolutely have to have it for work.Hi all,My grandfather is 88 years old and suffers from dementia. He has good days and bad, but he is not very mobile though he can walk and even prior to the pandemic did not leave the house for anything short of a medical appointment by choice. So needless to say, being cooped up in a car for possibly several hours while awaiting vaccination is not really an option for him. I've heard various stories about people over certain ages being given priority at sites (also allegedly Kaiser?) for reasons like this but it is hard to separate the rumors from the truth. So I guess what I'm asking if is if anyone knows the best way to get my grandfather his vaccine with the minimum amount of fuss/time? Are the standard appointments operating smoothly now? Is there a best time of the day to go to get things over as quickly as possible?Thanks!. Hey all,Saw a video linked on Reddit a year or two ago, which was hosted on imgur. It was a bearded man in a small boat out in the middle of the ocean. He had a thick accent which seemed to me to be either Australian or New Zealander. Basically, the video was just him talking about mental health and how it's okay to ask for help. He may have even compared the mind to an engine, which on occasion requires a tune up by a trained professional. It was a very reassuring, soothing video and I'd love to watch it again. Was only a minute or two long and ended with the dude saying that things were gonna be okay.Thanks!. Just got to thinking about this. I don't think anything pisses me off more than a smaller than expected burrito. I'm aware of the Manuel's Special at Tepeyac, but I have never tried it and don't think I could finish it.

Will be pretty sad if they're gone.Putting aside what seems their obvious bias and Smoltz's yelling at clouds, I realized the other night that the reason I can't stand most modern announcers is that they constantly talk strategy. I understand that playoff baseball is partially geared toward people who otherwise might not watch a baseball game, so they feel like they have to explain everything to the viewer, but it just drives me crazy. I recently went on a binge of watching Vin videos and the one thing that Vin pretty much never did was talk strategy. He almost never told us what he thought the Dodgers should be doing (other than if something like a sacrifice bunt was about to happen). He left his opinion completely out of it and just told us what was actually happening and reacted to that. Smoltz and Buck just constantly flap their gums over the game, giving us their theories on what the next play should be and it is so grating. Same goes for Jessica Mendoza, Ron Darling and pretty much any national announcer. For example, virtually any time Hader was throwing in the bullpen, Buck and Smoltz would just go on and on about why you bring in Hader, how many innings he should or could go and about 5000 other factoids and theories, whereas Vin would simply say something like "and now Hader's up and throwing" and leave it at that. We are so lucky to have Joe Davis now, who seems to come from that Vin school of just telling us what is happening.You hear me, Dodgers? Do whatever it takes to get him to LA in time. We'll make a gofundme if we have to. Tell the organization, /u/joedavispxp and give me credit and some tickets. Just kidding, but seriously, get Juan Uribe on a plane.Hi everyone.As recently as Thursday morning, I was able to leisurely watch Netflix or Hulu on Chrome on my late 2013 Macbook Pro. I watched Bull Durham around 3AM that morning.Friday night/Saturday morning, Chrome suddenly would no longer play anything on either service. They still work in Safari, but not in Chrome. Here are screenshots of the error messages I received:https://imgur.com/hj0glVVhttps://imgur.com/Us0nKuyAnyway, I Googled around and saw that it seems to be a problem with the "WidevineCdm" component in Chrome, which is supposed to be easy to update via the Chrome://components page. So I've clicked it and tried updating, but nothing will happen. It simply remains looking like this, stating that the component has not been updated:https://imgur.com/yNC9W94I've cleared the browsing data and even done the reset to original settings but to no avail. I even uninstalled and reinstalled Chrome and it's made no difference at all. I have no idea what is going on and I'm completely at a loss. If any of you could help me, you would be Earth's greatest hero. Thank you.This is pretty random, but I thought I'd just throw it out there, so please forgive me if it's in the wrong place but it seems like a Los Angeles/Southern California thing. I have been eating at [Troy Burgers](https://www.yelp.com/biz/troy-burgers-los-angeles-2) on York Blvd in Highland Park for pretty much my entire life. For reference, I am currently 29 years old. It's a very reliable greasy spoon with a drive-thru, that in my opinion makes both a great burger and a great bean and cheese burrito. They are one of the only businesses on York Blvd that is not gentrified or hipster and they stay open until 1AM on weekdays and 2AM on weekends, serving both the nearby bar crowd but also hungry Occidental College students. The signage at the place is a [simple blue](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troy-burgers-los-angeles-2?select=CmWEfZJqCbuAthi7Js8c9Q) while the employees wear red [shirts](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troy-burgers-los-angeles-2?select=05Fyj85aph8E5VI1YmSHFg) emblazoned with a historical Spartan type logo. Whenever I eat there, I notice that my receipt has a different name on it, referring to the restaurant as [Troy's #8](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troy-burgers-los-angeles-2?select=v0jQYGW0cAAVYYR04xl4xQ), which piqued my curiosity about whether Troy(s) was at one point a larger chain.Some close friends of mine grew up in nearby El Sereno and as such, they had a [Troy's Burgers](https://www.yelp.com/biz/troys-burgers-los-angeles) down the street from them and we would occasionally grab a bite to eat there. As you can see, this Troy's embraces the apostrophe and indicates the possessive. They follow a similar historical aesthetic but to a much more extreme and awesome degree. Check out these [incredible cups](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troys-burgers-los-angeles?select=7xU1YtVis8Usc_4lotPQNw) and [the menu](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troys-burgers-los-angeles?select=t0132SXYh_JQGAPEt6mGzg) which seems to be probably not so legally using USC's iconography. There is no drive-thru at this Troy's, as it is located in a strip mall and the employees wear bright [blue shirts](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troys-burgers-los-angeles?select=Qz3cjj8faih6UyElbdiXAQ). Upon first glance it seems like these two restaurants are not related, but recent reconnaissance has revealed a [newish sign](https://i.imgur.com/rE6mu6w.png) that refers to this Troy's as both "the original" and "#10."Recently, I discovered that there is also a [Troy's Drive In #6](https://www.yelp.com/biz/troys-drive-in-6-glendale?osq=Troy) in Glendale. Upon investigating, it appears that this one is indeed related to the one in Highland Park, though with a slightly different name. The employees wear the same [red shirts](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troys-drive-in-6-glendale?select=coIrj4DPNA3MIKw15yRnrw) as my local place, it has a drive-thru, but [the signage](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troys-drive-in-6-glendale?select=9mNkNkJ0IUsWTekVq99rmw) is a bit different. So we've got three different Troy's with similar iconography, several variations on the name, and with similar menus but numbered 6, 8 and 10. Seems like a chain.Additionally, there is yet another [Troy's Burgers](https://www.yelp.com/biz/troys-burgers-san-pedro) in San Pedro. This one seems to have a bit more of a distinct personality, based on its Yelp page, but since I'm currently without transportation, I have not been able to visit it and see if it has any kind of numerical designation. This restaurant has its own special [logo](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troys-burgers-san-pedro?select=ilfoN9vZ8--He1hIlOwLCw) which had me ready to write it off as its own thing, but then I noticed through older photos that until a relatively recent remodel, its [sign](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troys-burgers-san-pedro?select=w1sMfrt3JLAa-iWZ9C1cOg) was a damn close replica of the one in my neighborhood, right down to the baby blue color. Also, Ethan Hawke apparently [filmed a movie](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/troys-burgers-san-pedro?select=pjkShi7tNR-zq5ZKYVMPNQ) there recently while wearing an employee uniform which looks to be a match with the uniforms at the Troy's in El Sereno, thus giving more credence to my theory that all of these are a chain, despite their differences.So now we've got four out of at least 10 possible Troy's. Enter [Troy Drive In No 1 aka Troy's #1 Burgers](https://www.yelp.com/biz/troy-drive-in-no-1-los-angeles?osq=Troy) in East LA. Again, based off the Yelp, this spot seems to skew more toward Mexican food with less of a focus on burgers. The [logo](https://i.imgur.com/mUO3IRZ.png) is completely different, but the numerical designation means I'm willing to consider this as part of the chain for now.With 5 out of the at least 10 Troy's accounted for, we take a quick look at an outlier. [Troy's Drive In AKA Troy's Burgers](https://www.yelp.com/biz/troys-drive-in-orange) which is our first Troy's that is outside of LA County, located in the OC. The food is very similar fare and it has been in business since 1977, but I don't think it is related.As I continued my pointless quest for fast food knowledge, I unexpectedly hit a stumbling block: the existence of [Troy's Burgers 10](https://www.yelp.com/biz/troys-burgers-10-la-puente) in La Puente. Again, this Troy's seems very distinct with its own style, but it openly professes to be #10. We've already established that the El Sereno Troy's is #10, so either someone mislabeled something or, and this is too much for me to comprehend, there was at one point an entirely different chain of Troy's Burgers in Southern California that also had at least 10 stores as well. I am broken. I guess I simply cannot solve the mystery of Troy's.Some questions for you all and if you read this far, wow.1. Does anyone know of any other Troy's that may have existed in the past and if so, where were they located and do you recall if they were numbered?2. Do you think these places are all related or is Troy's just somehow an extremely common burger joint name and or weird historical theme?3. Where can I acquire a life?In closing, I can't recommend the Troys in Highland Park enough. Good, greasy food for a decent price. Thank you for your time.Though if I'm being honest with myself, my favorite cheeseburger is actually at [Penny's Burgers](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pennys-burgers-los-angeles).EDIT: Further research has revealed an [Olympic Troy's Burgers #2](https://www.yelp.com/biz/olympic-troys-burgers-2-bell-gardens-2) in Bell Gardens, but the sign outside simply says [Troy's #2](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/olympic-troys-burgers-2-bell-gardens-2?select=ausEActcBDDXyAUDyVZ4gA) so perhaps another missing link. Additionally there's a [Troy's Donuts and Burgers](https://www.yelp.com/biz/troys-donuts-and-burgers-monrovia) in Duarte, but it seems unrelated.Also, don't get me started on Jim's Burgers. There's roughly 20 of those in LA County alone. I miss the one in Eagle Rock which used to be where The Oinkster is now.I just got home to find my entire neighborhood between Figueroa and the 110 Freeway being lit up like daytime by a giant light suspended on a pole very high up in the air. Does anyone know what this could be? It's like as powerful as the lights at Dodger Stadium. I thought it might be construction but I don't see any police around and maybe I'm being naive, but it doesn't seem legal for this to be up for filming purposes without warning anyone. It's almost 1AM here and the light is shining like a death ray right through my blinds and lighting up my entire bedroom. This seems absolutely unreasonable.
    Hello there,Quick questions. How does the faster swing speed perk and legendary affect the chainsaw these days? And is there still the bug that they attack faster in 1PP? I was absent for a few months and I have no idea if they worked on the Chainsaw which I have a Vampire/Faster Swing Speed/Light one of. Is it still viable to build my goon around it as Bloodied Melee?Thanks for reading.Hello there. I am from Germany. And as is for most Europeans, all I know about the USA is from TV and the news. I reject the common European belief that US-American culture is Guns, McDonalds and the Kardashians.When I travel abroad, I usually spend a lot of time in the restaurants, that are rarely frequented by tourists or in those that the locals recommend. I believe that food is one of the most important cultural aspects.Would anyone care to share a few recepies that are genuine North American? What do American moms and dads prepare for their children when they come home from school, what does a typical Southern family eat on Sunday? Anyone willing to share Granny's recipie with a stranger from Germany?I have American meassurements here, so don't worry about conversion to metric. I would appreciate everything. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Sweet Meals, Desserts, Drinks... whatever there is you say that is something typical American. I want to recreate and try.Thanks in advance!EDIT: Thank you all for participating and giving me recipes. I can't answer everyone unfortunately. My wife already threatened action if I don't put away my smartphone ;). I will try out those delicacies over the course of the next few weeks. Thank you all, again.EDIT:I'm overwhelmed. Thank you all for your input. It will take weeks until I have sorted all the suggestions. I will try them over the next weeks. The American BBQs will be difficult due to infrastructure in my home. But in summer I will try to get a setup. I'm looking forward to my culinary journey through the US!. Hello. I have returned to Planetside 2 after almost a decade.Although I like the game I suck ass at it (FPS in general) and it makes me irationally agressive.Maybe I just approach it the wrong way, and maybe an Outfit could help solve my issues with it.Who am I? A 30 years old, married dad. That means I neither have the required skill, reaction time, or time to play much and improve.I found a Level 5 VS character on Cobalt when I logged in so I stuck with it. Improved to Level 10 within the last three days by camping and repairing my favourite Sunderer of the day. Throwing ammo bags, spawning turrets and hunting cloaked puss- I mean infiltrators with a flashlighted pumpgun. That's all I do as of now.Is there any Outfit who could use my particular talents? I speak German and English. And I'm usually online around midnight GMT+2.Thanks for reading.EDIT: I would also switch faction and ditch the fancy looking cult in exchange for some camaraderie.I did it! I found out how to make the toxic WOWS-Community sufferable! I've been playing this game on and off since launch. I'm your average potatoe. Sometimes when my child and wife are asleep and I want to relax with a beer and a few games of boaty boat fun, then I'll start up that game. Once or twice a month for a few rounds. My max rank is VII with the IJN and I have a Win-rate of 47%. You can imagine the amount of abuse I get, when I perform like the potatoe that I am in my beloved Akatsuki. There are slurs of all kinds and the amount of 11 year old pencil-dicks who supposedly had intercourse with my mother is flabergasting! And now - now after 8 years of suffering the playerbase of this game, only now have I found out how to deactivate gamechat. *facepalm. I can't get over how amazing that song is. Lindemann's voice is one thing, but the text; every single line hits home so hard! It's scary how fast time is running, how fast my child grows, how I get older every day. So many things we will never see, feel or experience ever again... So many things I wanted to do but there is no time for it...I admit that Zeit sometimes sqeezes the tears out of me. I love the song!Please excuse my monologue, I just had to share my feelings with someone.Today it was my turn to wake up and take care of my two-year old son, while Mrs. Wife would sleep in a little. The night before we had a gaming evening with friends as we love board games. One of the games we played is called 'Secret-Hitler'. Of course we did not clean up after us and all the games were lying around on the table.Back to today. While I was making breakfast and didn't pay attention to my little copy for a split second, he slipped away on his quest to find anything he could destroy. I heard how he opened the game boxes and I said with all the wisdom I could muster at this early hour: "Son, leave the 'Hitler-game' alone!" He replied: "No! I want Hitler!"I knew instantly that I fucked up... I took the games somewhere safe all the while he was screaming and crying "I WANT HITLER!"He wouldn't stop to say that name and now I'm scared to go outside with him! And yes, we live in Germany where this kind of thing is taken a little more serious than in other countries...TL,DR: I'm afraid I'm raising a Ultra-Conservative.Hello there. I've seen way too many posts about noobs being kicked from Daily OPs, Pitt Expeditions, etc ... for being noobs.Since I think this is sort of rude and I am bored out of my mind I'd like to offer all you noobs, newbies, adult folks with real life and limited time and basically anyone who does not dare to touch endgame content a guided tour through whatever you please. While I am only lvl 244 myself, I can very comfortably solo everything so far with my melee build. So if you please you can get experience, explore and ask while I take care of the objectives. No one will be kicked for being unexperienced.Mic would not be required. If anyone is interested feel free to message me. I'll be online from 15:30 to approximately 22:00 GMT+1.EDIT: this specific offer is expired, since it's the Real Life time of the day now. If you are generally interested, feel free to send me a message and I'll make sure to contact you for the next round.
    Today my best friend called me, it‚Äôs her first time living alone/ without her parents, and she told me she was super embarrassed. She asked me how to cook rice. She said there were so many different ways that she googled, she just wanted the specific rice her dad made ‚Äúwith bay leaves and shit.‚Äù Then before I could make fun of her she quickly followed up with ‚Äúand you don‚Äôt know how to ride a bike so shut up and tell me what to do, then I‚Äôll get you on two wheels when I‚Äôm in town.‚Äù Lol it was a fair point I guess, so I called her dad pretending I was craving the heck out of his rice and he told me step by step what to do which I then reiterated to his daughter. It‚Äôs funny but I also thought he‚Äôd have been really happy if she just asked him herself. I‚Äôm also pretty stunned she didn‚Äôt at least learn that from him lol.Edit to add the recipe:2&1/2 cups of rice (basmati, but brown rice works too), washed and soaked in warm water for half an hour then strained. In a pan at med-high heat, add abt a tablespoon of ghee or oil, for about 5 mins & fry the spices (bay leaves, a stick of cinnamon, a couple pieces* of star anises) then add a thinly sliced onion, a handful of chilis (preferably the green ones but go crazy with the red ones if you want) and some curry leaves. Saut√© that until they‚Äôre soft and the onions have some golden color to them. Add the strained rice, fry until its dry or a little crisp, then add a can of coconut milk (14 oz can) and 400 ml of water or some kind of stock of your preference, salt to taste, and turn the heat high until it‚Äôs boiling then lower it to a simmer and close the lid. Cook until the liquid is completely absorbed and the rice is tender. Use a fork to fluff it.I played q30 this diamond rush and I think this is the first time a scene has stayed with me for so long. Like head empty just that scene. Leonard painting on MCs skin was the most intimate without being overtly sexual thing I‚Äôve read on this app (so far?). At first I didn‚Äôt care for him but now I wish he had more screen time. He kinda reminds me of my husband so either I‚Äôm biased or I‚Äôm projecting hahaha but Leo was my favorite LI by far in this book lol I miss him already ‚ù§Ô∏è wish we had a little special content book for it to tie up loose ends and such üò≠. Two years ago I had a really rough pregnancy. Every two weeks I was in the hospital and often, more than once by more than one person, I was told there was a slim chance I would make it, my baby would make it or both of us would make it. At the start of my third trimester, they started prepping me for every worse case scenario possible. It was honestly horrible. At 6 months my water tore a bit, but they were able to monitor it and keep me in the hospital for four weeks until I gave birth naturally to a beautiful and healthy baby boy.Anyways, during my time in the hospital, I was going absolutely crazy and insane (I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go outside or on other floors, only had one visitor allowed bc of Covid) and just stuck in my own head. If I wasnt crying, I was damn near close to it. Thinking I really wasn‚Äôt going to make it, I began writing letters to my son, one for every birthday. Some were short and some were long and I put a lot of my heart and soul into it but it was very obviously a ‚Äúbreak in case of death‚Äù type thing. No one‚Äôs has read them and since I‚Äôve sealed them in envelopes, they‚Äôve never been touched.My son is going to turn 2 next month and I was going through my closet to find the party supplies I stored from last year and found the letters as well. I don‚Äôt know what to do with them. My husband says I should let him have them when he‚Äôs older, but I feel like it would be a burden for him to know. Since I‚Äôm the only one who knows the contents, I feel like destroying them would make no difference to everyone else‚Ä¶. But I also feel like a piece of me would be destroyed too if I do that.I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm so conflicted over them. It was such a strange time, hard to believe it even happened and those letters are proof of it I guess.Edit: before I reply to all, I just wanted to say a quick thank you to everyone who responded, I‚Äôm reading all these kind words and tearing up. I will keep the letters safe.Edit 2: I‚Äôm so overwhelmed with all the responses and I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt get to you but I just want to say thank you for sharing your stories with me. I‚Äôm reading through all of them with tears in my eyes. Thank you all for your insights and convincing me to keep these letters. I wish you guys all the best, as you have for me and my son.This is probably a long shot but here goes nothing. A few years ago, I was on a short plane ride home, and this guy sitting next to me was reading this book. I was being nosy and kinda read a little with him and I was kinda surprised he was reading smut right next to me. Anyways I got home and decided to Google it but it‚Äôs been on the back burner for ages and for the life of me I cannot recall what the title was!I remember I thought the title was weird because it had something to do with baseball ‚Äî like a home run or something? Second base? Don‚Äôt know, but it was like [blank] and [baseball blank]. I think the cover was warm toned, sepia maybe, a backwards sofa or something obscuring a body but two legs are visible and crossed to the side of it. It was a thin book, probably less than 100 pages, erotic novella maybe. It‚Äôs old, maybe early 2000s? I can‚Äôt recall the description or much plot, but it seemed like a push and pull/ toxic relationship. And to be honest I think it had nothing to do with baseball besides the title reference. It‚Äôs been bugging me for days so any help is greatly appreciated!Edit: to say maybe the title had ‚Äúrookie‚Äù in it?EDIT: A SPORT AND A PASTIME BY JAMES SALTER!I could cry lol also I was totally off with it‚Äôs publication! 1967!. I‚Äôm so serious about the prompts lol like, I‚Äôm in no way voting for the ballroom gown when it says Pilates at the park ü•≤ lowkey would like a drop-down menu of the requirements just so I could see how well the user incorporated the item(s). Just finished my third read through. It‚Äôs honestly my comfort story but I always leave the last chapter with a void in my heart. I just miss all the characters, miss the humor and sometimes cringe, miss the relationship between characters, the quick wit and lack of dragged out plot lines. I don‚Äôt know this is probably my top 5 and it‚Äôs not numbers 2-5Are there any OIs similar to this one?. I was just thinking that it‚Äôd be kinda cool to have a miscellaneous section and just choose things according to the prompts. Like for example the ‚Äúreplace the lead singer‚Äù prompt ‚Äî maybe the option for a guitar would be fun. Or a bartender prompt with a shaker, dj for the night w head phones, yoga with a yoga mat ‚Äî hell, even the option for an umbrella would be fun. Just something a little different to keep players on the prompt and keep from getting too repetitive ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I was trying to explain to my cousin that we let my son dip whatever food he wants in ketchup because it‚Äôs like a stepping stone for him to try other foods. Stepping stone is not the word I was looking for and now it‚Äôs bugging me!. I used to get a 24 case whenever we did grocery shopping but I noticed that suddenly my boyfriend went from drinking one can a meal to like two or three. We both ended up deciding to quit cold turkey, him because he realized it was a problem and me for moral support. I thought I didn‚Äôt really care for soda, to be honest. Genuinely thought I could live with out it. Im starting to crave it so much. My boyfriend has opted on making these iced teas for meals and stuff, but I just take a bottle of water. As I sit and eat my meal I just can‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúdamn I wish I had a sprite.‚Äù We went to dinner a few weeks ago and I ordered a soft drink and holy shit it was the best drink of my life. I think about that drink so often lol. I don‚Äôt know when it started but it‚Äôs so funny to me how any slightly emotional thing can trigger it. I hold it in as much as I can because it‚Äôs a little embarrassing. The other day my mom was like ‚ÄúI never see you cry‚Ä¶huh.‚Äù And then I‚Äôm just there thinking I literally cry every day, multiple times. Just a weird thing that happens. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs a medical issue at this point lol.So I been through a nail art journey thinking if I put hard work and effort into doing my nails I wouldn‚Äôt want to bite them.I think I‚Äôve made it to a good length to be honest, but sometimes I‚Äôll find myself gnawing at my nails and I have to stop myself suddenly. I don‚Äôt know, any tips?. I don‚Äôt remember anything except maybe it was a group of kids going to a haunted house? But it felt like a school trip? I just remember a scene where they‚Äôre in a school bus and one guy is doing a card trick and asks the girl next to him to pick a card. After she does the cards go flying everywhere as if he was a klutz and she starts to laugh but then he points to the window and there‚Äôs a card behind her stuck to the window from outside and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúis that your card?‚Äù. Hey everyone, I‚Äôm looking for a good slasher /whodunnit novel. Something involving a good group dynamic because I‚Äôm a sucker for the power of friendship, and hopefully likable characters! Nothing too paranormal, but also not a very easily solved mystery. I already read the final girl support group by Grady hendrix, later by Stephen king and there‚Äôs someone inside your house by Stephanie Perkins. One Halloween, a frat did a haunted house party, hired actors, then went all out on costumes and makeup. Talking hyper realistic, piss inducing costumes. I knew who were beneath all the masks but it was still pretty creepy. Anyways I fucked the scary clown, in full costume in the bathroom. Honestly still think about it to this day because it was genuinely the most intense orgasm I ever had. I was terrified and horny lol. It was a little embarrassing leaving the bathroom covered in his fake blood and white makeup though.
    My 60 year old mom travelled from India to canada during winter. All her life she was in India where weather is always above 35c. And now she is experiencing -20c here in canada. As its extremely cold she started taking bath once in 3 days. When I ask her, she says she isn‚Äôt sweating and she isn‚Äôt feeling dirty. And moreover there is no physical work and we weren‚Äôt going out anywhere. Is it hygienic? Has Anyone does the same?. Many Indian families from generations don‚Äôt usually look up the expiry dates. I guess the term expiry date on food items has come out recently. Back in those days everything(like rice, pulses, spices) was sold out loosely(not in packets, Atleast in India) where expiry date is not known. How minimal the effect would be on eating the expired products?. My mom is a neat freak, she keeps everything clean at home. Doesnt matter what time of the day it is and how tired she is, she always keeps the house clean.

Being a tourist can I request for tax refund? If yes what's the process ?. In what cases I can use left < right and in what cases I can use left <= right ?? In what cases we put right = mid and in some right = mid -1 ?Same with left as well left = mid + 1 or left = mid ? And sometimes we return left, sometimes we return right ? Would be of great help if any of you helps me in understanding above points ?. Please recommend me the youtube channels/Youtubers who explains the DSA concepts using python?.
    
    On one of my previous posts I shared about how I bought my gf flowers. I did so not knowing it was the first time someone had ever bought her flowers and she ended up crying.After I posted that, I was inspired by one of the comments on that post to get my gf LEGO flowers. A couple of months ago my gf mentioned to me that she loved to build LEGO when she was a kid. When she mentioned that, I remember years ago when I was in an Oregon LEGO store, I saw a LEGO set that was basically a bouquet of flowers and thought, ‚Äúthat would be a sweet gift to give someone‚Äù.Fast forward years later on my GF‚Äôs bday‚Ä¶Before I dropped her back off to her place after we hung out, I told her something like, ‚ÄúI got you another gift. Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs flowers again. But before I give you these flowers, I wanted to let you know that I will love you until the last flower dies‚Äù.Then I pulled out a big yellow LEGO bag and she started crying again üòÇI pulled out the bouquet of LEGO flowers that I saw years ago in that LEGO store in Oregon and she realized what I meant when I said that I‚Äôd love her till the last flower dies.We hung out again this past week and she mentioned that she told her mom and dad what I did and her mom said, ‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs a keeper!‚ÄùHonestly, that made me so happy. Whenever my GF tells me about the positive feedback she gets from sharing stories of us with her friends, it always makes my day.But when she mentioned that her parents liked what I did, it felt really good. Idk.Basically the title. I was at the store yesterday picking up some groceries before I was headed to pick my gf up to hang out.I went past the flower aisle and thought, ‚Äúah, what the hell‚Äù and bought some flowers. The cashier who rung me up was like, ‚Äúflowers and poke bowls, ay?‚Äù and smiled.I went to pick up my girl and right when she got into my car I said, ‚Äúguess what?‚Äù Her: ‚ÄúWhat?‚ÄùMe: ‚ÄúChicken butt‚Äù *pulls out flower bouquet üíê *She ended up crying and I was laughing asking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù And that‚Äôs when she said that she never got flowers before in her life.Then it kinda made me sad for a bit tbh. I thought about this new generation and how fast-paced and cold we can be sometimes. I feel like every girl should get flowers from the ones they love. Especially ones they‚Äôre dating.We went home and hung out for the rest of the day. I didn‚Äôt own a vase so I just put it in a water jug. Fellas, buy flowers for ya girl. Ladies, buy‚Ä¶ whatever guys want for ya man (idk i‚Äôm bad at this .-.)Edit: Thank you all so much for all the love in the comments! I went to sleep last night right after I made this post and I woke up this morning with all these sweet stories and messages of your guy‚Äôs own. I absolutely love reading the comments and will read more when I get home.(Apologies to the mods, I initially had it as ‚Äújust chatting‚Äù in the flair but I realize yes, ‚Äúlife stories‚Äù is a much better flair. Thank you for changing it!). "Truly from the bottom of my heart... it's been an honor being a fan of this show along with you all. For some reason, this show managed to cultivate a fanbase that has been some of the most beautiful and open-minded group of people that I've seen. From all the theories, through all the thought-provoking discourse, to the shared laughter and raw emotions we've had through the beautiful moments we got to experience throughout the show, you've all been nothing but great company to enjoy this show with. No matter how near or far we were from each other, each episode made me feel like I was watching it with  ªohana (family) and it's been one of the most coolest feelings I've had in long while. It's truly been a blessing loving this show along with you all. I wish you all the most beautiful experience with this last episode and hope the love and inspiration you gain from this series uplifts you throughout the rest of your life. Me ke aloha pumehana, Golden Kaleo". It is currently 2:49 PM as I write this. Around 6 hours before Atlanta's series finale drops. Here is a (growing) list of theories that I've seen in the past that I wanted to document before we head into the last episode: 1. "**Atlanta is a simulation**" - This one I feel the most strongest for. From the Deja Vu thing that Darius experienced in the first ever Atlanta episode to the fact that this last episode is going to be a Darius centered episode confirms this theory even more. There's an interview with Zazie Beetz where she even talks about how Donald Glover spoke to her about this theory that we are all in a simulation (I'll try to find the link of that interview and post it here later) so the fact that Donald is even aware of simulation theory gives this Atlanta simulation theory more of a forefront thought than ever before. 2. "**Paper Boi dies**" - don't know why people are saying this tbh. but I've seen countless of theories that PB will die this last episode. Don't know if it'll happen or not, but it's there. So. 3. "**Van and Earn move to LA with Lottie**" - this one I hope happens. that S4E7 story was so amazing. To have that only be anything else will break my heart. Which actually leads me to... 4. "**Van and Earn split**" - Don't want this to happen but there's been theories going around that Van and Earn will have an amicable break up after realizing that the love they share for Lottie is not enough to keep them together :( What are your last minute finale theories? Feel free to add yours in before the episode airs.Mines is: ‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt ‚Äòkidnap‚Äô your own dad. I don‚Äôt have time to explain it to you right now, but the word *kid* is in it. So mathematically, it‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù. My previous romantic relationship was basically scored with music from Sade.Unfortunately our relationship didn‚Äôt end in the best way, but this episode made me remember all of those beautiful moments I got to experience with her.Through all the episodes of Atlanta, I couldn‚Äôt figure out which one was my favorite.This one will not only be my favorite episode of Atlanta, but my favorite episode of television forever. It was like it was made just for me.Thank you, Atlanta. You truly are a beautiful show. Thank you so much for letting me remember what it was like to truly love someone with all my heart.Me ke aloha~ Golden Kaleo. That way if they don‚Äôt want it or they are unable to receive it, you can at least enjoy it for yourself üëç. Might be big fish, let me check.Is it really all that it‚Äôs cracked up to be?. Alright folks, I need all hands on deck for this one.There‚Äôs this guy whom I met at one of my gigs. Fellow musician and videographer. Super sweet dude.He explained to me that he‚Äôs houseless at the moment but would like to help me out in recording, videotaping, and documenting my music shows for me.Told him I was down to have him at my shows, but I want to help him out as well.My current plan is to get a gym membership for him to at least give him access to shower and stuff.I don‚Äôt make much as a musician, but I make enough to be able to buy him food when he comes down to my gig, and also give him some money from the tips I make.The main problem I‚Äôm struggling with is that I have no place to have him sleep since the place I‚Äôm staying at doesn‚Äôt allow overnight guests, but if you guys have any good ideas on that part, please lmk. He‚Äôs currently bouncing around airBnB‚Äôs and doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôll be once that is over.Any bit of advice would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask questions in the comments if you need more info about the situation.(To the admins: I‚Äôm posting this anywhere I can, but please lmk if this violates any rules and I‚Äôll delete it immediately.)Thanks in advance.Alright folks, I need all hands on deck for this one.There‚Äôs this guy whom I met at one of my gigs.

    Hi my Husband and I are planning a trip to Maldives on the 3rd week of September next year. Prices don‚Äôt seem as crazy yet (looks like we can afford a couple of resorts with overwater villas) as it‚Äôs almost a year away and would like to take advantage of that. Our budget is around $4500-$5000 USD and hoping to stay for 5 nights (maybe more if we can without compromising on the resorts too much but also okay with 4 nights if great value for money)Nice to haves would be:Over water villas (direct water entrance is a bonus)All meals included (we don‚Äôt really drink alcohol)Transfers organised by hotelsGood range of water activities (we don‚Äôt dive)I‚Äôm after recommendations on which resorts to consider and especially what to look out for? Thank you. Does anyone know how to watch this Olympic qualifier game online on Wednesday? I‚Äôm in Australia and happy to pay for a reliable streaming service.Hi allSo my husband teaches at a Qld state school. He just graduated and He started working full time,on a contract Term 3 this year. His contract ends this term.Anyways question is, there‚Äôs just under 6 weeks time off at the end of the year until the start of the new school year. What‚Äôs his entitlement in terms of pay?We are thinking the first 2 weeks off is paid (as he worked full time in Term 4) and then another 2 weeks of annual leave (as he was working full time for half the school year). Meaning the last 2 weeks ish is likely unpaid?Does this sound right? Will it matter if his contract ends the end of the year and he doesn‚Äôt have a new one yet? One of the deputy principals said they‚Äôre going to give him a permanent full time role this term (but that hasn‚Äôt happened yet‚Ä¶)Sorry if the formatting is bad. I‚Äôm on mobile.This morning we‚Äôre having coffee together before work and this is when I remind him about sunscreen. He is a high school teacher and yesterday some kids asked him how old he was. When they found out he‚Äôs 30, they excitedly asked ‚Äúwhat is your skincare routine??‚Äù To which he replied he has a sunstick loI. I know sun stick isn‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs definitely better than nothing. They also asked him about his cleanser (i haven‚Äôt succeeded in getting him into a proper routine yet). And he just reiterated how important sunscreen is to protecting their skin. I just find it cute and it encourages me to keep reminding him and get him to exfoliate and moisturise with me. I convince him to do it with me about once a week but I‚Äôll be more diligent from now on!ETA: I remind him daily because I‚Äôm worried about melanoma but helping with skin care is definitely an added bonus!. Hi all. My Husband and I got married overseas, earlier this year.I‚Äôm hoping to get recommendation of where we could print our photos and framed. Looking something large like A0 for one or two of them. We also don‚Äôt really know anything about what ‚Äúlooks good‚Äù in terms of when choosing the quality of printing and framing so we‚Äôre happy to hear any tips and tricks if you have any. Preferably inner city/south side. Somewhere that can provide good value for money.Hi so I have domestic flights booked via our work travel system. I realised I might need to change the return flight later in the day. Our admin can just cancel and rebook easily without penalties apparently. But the thing is, I was successful in classic upgrade request and qantas has already deducted the 10k points. I was wondering if I need to cancel this upgrade first (not sure if possible) before asking the admin staff to change my flights. Has anyone experienced this before?. Does anyone else have dramas with streaming to your LG tv when using Optus sport?Using different apps (7plus and Disney+) works smoothly with our TVI gave in and paid for it full price so that we can watch the women‚Äôs World Cup but am now regretting it because of this. What a waste. So yesterday, I gave my SO a pixel tablet as a presentHe spent about 15 minutes setting it up. Didn‚Äôt transfer apps from his pixel 6 as he didn‚Äôt want to bloat it. All he did was log in to his google accountAfterwards he just left it sitting on its dockTonight, I linked him a movie trailer and he casted it from his Pixel 6 to the tablet. Great! Worked well. I was reading about it‚Äôs features and saw that you can instruct google when it‚Äôs in its dock even if my voice isn‚Äôt saved. I said ‚Äúokay google, play music‚ÄùIt started Spotify and played the song that was last played on Spotify on my iPhone 14 (not connected to wifi, just on 5g). The Spotify app on my iPhone showed that it is indeed connected to the tablet and playing my music. Was wondering how does this work as my iPhone wasn‚Äôt connected to the wifi nor did it have any previous connection to the tablet.Also, Spotify isnt installed in the tablet at all.ETA: my SO‚Äôs Spotify app on his pixel 6 showed that the song was NOT playing from his account. So am trying to book last minute trip to europe (anywhere) leaving Brisbane right few days after christmas, back 3rd week of January.I was wondering if you guys have any tips on which combination of airports in asia and europe would be good to check for reward seatsI might be trying the wrong combination of cities from asia to europe as Im often not getting anything at all (or i'm probably just really too late) * departure city: Brisbane* arrival city: europe, anywhere* travel dates: 27/12 back by 19/1* number of passengers: 2* number of points you have: 450k * your preferred travel classes: premium economy or business* your Qantas Frequent Flyer status: Bronze. I bought a car in QLD (financed, finishing up in 14 months) for my brother. Thought I‚Äôd help him out as I can get lower interest rates. He pays for the monthly repayments, rego and everything else related to it as he uses it 100% of the time. I have never driven or even been inside this car. Anyway, originally I got insurance for it and added his name and put the car address as his address though recently I told him to get it under his name so that if in the event that he had to make a claim, my ratings doesn‚Äôt get impacted. I am one of the listed drivers in the policy. I was wondering if there‚Äôs any implications to being properly covered for the car? Will he be able to make claims for it even if he‚Äôs not the owner?I have sent an email to the insurer (budget direct) but have yet to get a responseeta: I know title said I am not in the insurance but I am actually a listed driver. So I set my in game chat to friends only but I can still see opponents messages. Is this function not working for others as well?. Has anyone installed Japanese toilet seats in your home recently?&#x200B; Any recommendations on where to buy them? Hoping to see it in a brick and mortar store in Brisbane but looks like we might have to go the onlien route..Just more wondering if there are things you wish you knew before installing them, also did you hire an electrician first to add the power outlet then a plumber to install it? &#x200B;Thank you. Saw this on ozbargain for click frenzy. Only really using it while I travel for work, about a few nights a monthI'm after something that could ideally play age of empires 4 on max settings which I didn't think needs much. Open to other suggestions don't really want to spend more than $2k if I can get away with ithttps://www.hp.com/au-en/shop/victus-by-hp-laptop-16-e0138ax-4h285pa.html. Hi we are looking at replacing the carpet in our apartment's living area (5.1mx3.3m) to hardwood floors. I believe our body corporate requires some acoustic assessment and that the floors are glued instead of floatiing (don't really know much about this)Was wondering if anyone has done something similar and how much did it cost? We're in inner city Brisbane and would love some recommendations for contractors if you have any. Thanks. So when connecting my laptop to a cable our internet speed is at 250 Mbps but when it's using wifi (5ghz) and testing right next to the router it's closer to 130 Mbps. Unfortunately we can't run a cable directly to our office so we need to rely on wifi. Will getting a different one (open for suggestions, no issues with budget) help? We currently have a Netcom Gateway router which we got from our ISP (Aussie)Thank you. Hi so I just joined a new company and trying to set up QGIS myself. In my previous job I can open something like "QGIS xxx with Grass".I've been trying to install that in my pc and can't figure out how to do it. I've read around and tried to do the advanced install via the OSGeo4w network installer and installing the qgis-ltr under desktop but I don't think it's doing what I need to do.Basically I use qgis from time to time and just need to be able to edit a file in a geodatabase. I've read that I need grass to be able to do that in QGIS. I prefer editing things in QGIS instead of ArcGIS as it's so much faster for me.Hi I'm in my late 20s and currently my superannuation is with Hostplus with a balance of around $70k.I've recently moved to a government job and they've offered 2.75% bonus contribution if I use QSuper and salary sacrifice another 5%. Looking at ATO's super comparison tool, it looks like Hostplus performed better than QSuper. I understand that their comparison tool may not be the best tool to use but I was wondering, how would you go about deciding if it's better to consolidate or leave the Hostplus balance separately?. Hello!I am looking for monitor recommendations that is ultrawide and allows me to split it like two monitors **without having to install a software**. This is because I have a work laptop but don't have admin rights to it.I know you can just "snap" on each side but it's more to do with using Microsoft Teams and sharing screens which can be inefficient.I live in Australia and might not have the models that's recommended but if there's a general term for this feature when looking for at specs, that would be awesome.I'm also planning on using this for gaming and would be nice to have something that has at least 1440p and 100 hz.Hoping to find something within my budget of $1,000 AUD and 34" in size.Hi I'm thinking of getting an ultrawide monitor both for gaming and work purposes.Anyways is there one that can act as two monitors without having to install extra programs? I can't install extra software on my work laptop but it is really important that I use two monitors for work. we have Ultra wide ones in the office so I know how it can be inefficient so getting this feature is important.Outside of work, I would like it to be good for gaming as well.Hoping around the 34 inch size and budget is under $1k if that's possible.Thank you. Hi all, we've decided to get a second PC, around $2.5k to $3.5k range and this one is purely for gaming We came across these two1) https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/659405 (there are options for motherboard at no additional cost, which one?)2) https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/659857One is from Tech fast and sounded like there's not much wait time, while the second is from bpc Tech (where our first PC was from)Any significant difference between the two in terms of gaming? Thank you. Hi, I don't really know much about PCs and we've recently bought a new one and it seems louder than expected even if I had nothing running on it. I downloaded CPUId HWMonitor and was showing CPUFanIn at 1428 rpm and the other fans are at 924 RPM and 1301 RPM. GPU temp was at 44C, memory 50C and Hot Spot 54C. are these normal?I ran the HWinfo as per the guide but I don't really know how to interpret this. PC specs are here does the above information seem normal straight off the bat (no programs running yet)?

Hi so our puppy is due to be neutered soon and I was wondering if you guys could give some advice on how to prepare/what we should know/what we should and shouldn‚Äôt do to keep our pup safe and happy. What did you wish you knew and anything surprising that helped?Thanks. Hi thank you to everyone who previously helped me build a pc / those who recommended prebuiltWe ended up purchasing the prebuilt recommendation from BPC Tech (KrakenPower Macho RTX3080 Gaming Build V5). It should hopefully arrive next weekAnyway I would like to have this pc and my work laptop share my two monitors (Dell S2721H and S3221QS), keyboard, mouse and headsetI‚Äôve been reading about it and seems like I need a kvm switch but some has limitations like the resolution settings need to be the same from both laptop and desktop? Not sureAnyways I don‚Äôt want to spend too much. Is it possible to get something sub $200? Thanks. Hi we have never built a PC before but my fianc√© and I would like to experience it as it seems fun but also to transition from Console to PC gaming (like CSGo, Assassins Creed Odyssey, Dead by Daylight, Red Dead Redemption 2). We also need to be able to hook up our oculus quest 2 to Steam. We need it to do some GIS processing (handling 20 GB data sometimes) and to process drone videosWe have a $3k budget (we already have monitors, keyboard and mouse). We do need to get windows for it. If it makes a difference it‚Äôll live under an office desk on carpet. We prefer a case that has rgb lightsCan we get something decent with this price? Looked at OzBargain but doesn‚Äôt look like there are any active deals for 3080s (not sure if we need 3080). Thank you. Just finished watching the women‚Äôs finals in the olympics and saw that two women ended up with 64 pts and were ranked 3rd (4th. 4th, 4th) and 4th (1st, 8th, 8th). How was this ranked as 3rd and 4th?I understand how ties are broken in each discipline but not for the finalised ranking. Hi guys, I tried googling this but can‚Äôt find an answer. So we gave our pup pig ears and he chewed on it for an hour before he stopped. How do you store chewables like this? How long till it‚Äôs time to replace it? It feels like it‚Äôll be weeks before he finishes it. Is that fine?. In the past few months. I have read stories about people getting fake invoices from businesses they are dealing with. Seen people lose their home deposit because their solicitor‚Äôs IT system has been compromised and someone posed as the solicitor to issue bank details to pay their deposit. Anyway, I‚Äôm just thinking about our solicitor, I found them through googling and went for top rated one in my city. Made initial contact through their website and has since been talking to them only on email from the beginning. To be honest, nothing has really made me think that they seem dodgy so I‚Äôm just here asking a question to be cautious. Do people have any tips on how to ensure we‚Äôre sending our deposit to the correct entity? Our solicitors website doesn‚Äôt have their bank details (didn‚Äôt expect them to) so it‚Äôs not like we can just double check from there that we‚Äôre sending it to the correct account. We have the phone number of the solicitor on the email signature but what if that number is fake too? (I know I‚Äôm probably just being too paranoid - but I read that some scammers has the audacity to reply to verification steps like this)We‚Äôve recently received a notification to pay things like GST to the ATO for our new property (pretty sure this is legit though) so we want to be safe. I‚Äôve read correspondence from the developer and are offering PEXA for the deposit and our solicitor said we can use that. TLDR any tips to safely navigate sending significant amount of money electronically? Thanks!Edit: Thanks everyone, I have enough information to make sure our transactions are safe.Our mortgage broker arranged for our OTP apartment to go through valuation with suncorp this week. Does anyone know the turn around period for this?. My Fianc√© and I have more than 50% of the value of the property we are buying. We‚Äôll probably put 40% as deposit and 10% in an offset account for emergencies etc. Our savings has not gone up in the last 2 months due to travelling(haven‚Äôt done that in a year) and paying certain deposits for our wedding. We do tend to eat out a couple of times a week too. How much does this really matter to the banks? We are both working full time and are not on probation.Potentially our weekly mortgage is about 25% cheaper than our weekly rent.Fianc√© pointed it out to me recently lol and he's right! I haven't dreams about losing my teeth in a long time and definitely have had multiple dreams about losing 3 or 4 small diamonds from my halo and feeling defeated lol. My friends and I are playing games online and I have them on discord, on a voice chat. Even if the game we were playing has background music on almost full volume, they still are only able to hear my own voice and basically nothing else from my side?.
    My house has become the Halloween gathering place for people of all ages (which I love!). We don‚Äôt have kids of our own, but my brothers and my friends bring their kids over. Even my friends‚Äô parents come along. Some adults take their kids out trick or treating & some hang back at the house with us & pass out candy. After trick or treating is over, everyone just sort of hangs out and I have snacks and pizza. This year a few of the kids turned into teenagers and don‚Äôt want to trick or treat. I usually have treat buckets for all the kids that come over, but don‚Äôt know how the teens would feel about it now; they‚Äôre especially sensitive about being babied now üòè. I‚Äôd love some ideas on what I can do for them! TIA.. I have to tell _somebody_ this, because it‚Äôs been making my skin crawl since it happened. I was laying on the beach yesterday, at a nice resort in Aruba. I wasn‚Äôt fully asleep, but had my eyes closed, beach hat over my face, EarPods in my ears. I was listening to a book, so I couldn‚Äôt hear well, but felt someone near me and heard a muffled sound of someone speaking to me. I removed the hat from my face, and saw the drink waitress standing there. I hadn‚Äôt heard what she said, assumed she‚Äôd just asked if I wanted anything to drink, so I shook my head and said ‚Äúno thank you, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù She said, ‚Äúno - your nuts ‚Ä¶‚Äù I said ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù She said ‚Äúnuts **pointing to the ziploc bag of mixed nuts in my beach bag** ‚ÄúI like them, can I have them? Will you give me some?‚Äù At first I laughed, because I thought she was joking, but quickly realized she was serious & before I could stutter ‚Äúsure, help your ‚Ä¶‚Äù she had already grabbed the bag out of my beach bag and was examining the contents with her talon-like, nasty ass fingernails. She was like, ‚Äúouuuu you got the good stuff!‚Äù while picking up my mango slice then deciding she didn‚Äôt want it & dropping it back in the bag.I‚Äôm so mad at myself for not telling her to just take the whole bag. Lord knows I‚Äôll never touch it again after those acrylic claws were used to rifle through it. Every time I think about it, I get so sick to my stomach. I guess COVID, and other communicable diseases don‚Äôt exist in this lady‚Äôs world.Oh, and never mind the fact that a) I can‚Äôt believe she spotted them in my bag (a straw beach bag ‚Ä¶ not clear), and b) she had no problem disturbing me with a beach hat over my face - seemingly asleep. The whole thing was just baffling. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîEdit: The more I‚Äôm thinking about it, I think some of you are right in saying she might‚Äôve been trying to rob me. She fingered alllll the nuts in the bag, but she really only took about 3-4 of them. If she was desperately hungry, as some are making it seem, or terribly in need - she would‚Äôve eaten more, or asked to have the whole bag (not like she was bashful). The whole encounter was very strange, and now I think there was more to it.. Received this information today; thought I‚Äôd pass it along: This Saturday, October 21st is our monthly food pantry. Time is 9:30 til noon. Location is at THE DWELLING PLACE CHURCH, 8201 Angola Rd. If you are in need of food plan on coming. We service the following zip code ares: 43528 (Holland), 43504 (Berkey), 43568 (Swanton), 43542 (Monclova), 43571 (Whitehouse), 43537 (Maumee), 43515 (Delta), 43560 (Sylvania) and the following Toledo zip codes - 43617, 43615, 43614, 43613, 43612, 43609, 43607 and 43606.

Please be aware you may experience a wait time of up to possibly an hour or more, depending on the amount of people who need assistance.Another post refreshed this deeply repressed embarrassing memory in my mind today, and the cringe-wound feels fresh again, so I thought I‚Äôd share it with you all. We were staying in a luxury suite that had a personal room attendant who we met briefly when we arrived that afternoon. We were in a hurry to get out and explore, so we ditched our belongings in the room, and headed out to sightsee. When we returned late that evening, we were shocked to find that our luggage had been unpacked for us. Our toiletries were in the bathroom, neatly placed on his and hers trays; our clothes were hung, and shoes carefully lined ‚Ä¶ and then the kicker: MY LINGERIE WAS SPLAYED OUT ON THE BED, ANGLED TOWARD THE DOOR, WITH A TRAIL OF ROSE PETALS LEADING UP TO AND SURROUNDING IT - A PLATE OF CHOCOLATE STRAWBERRIES AND A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE NEARBY. I had a few pieces of lingerie in my bag, so this one had been *chosen*. And, the room attendant must‚Äôve not noticed, but it had (I‚Äôm rocking in fetal position as I write this) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ already been used.I. Was. Mortified. Needless to say, I could not look our male room attendant in the eye for the remainder of the stay. Tell me your embarrassing travel stories & let‚Äôs wallow in our secondhand embarrassment together.**Gabriel, not Gabrielle. Different hair?. This show is full of incredible song choices for certain scenes. My two absolute favorites are: 1) ‚ÄúRivers & Roads‚Äù During the scene where Cece admits to being in love with Schmidt. 2) Seinabo Sey‚Äôs ‚ÄúStill‚Äù when Cece is walking down the aisle. Tell me yours!Edit: I remembered one more! ‚ÄúI always knew‚Äù by the Vaccines. ‚ÄúBefore you say ‚Äòno,‚Äô don‚Äôt say ‚Äòno.‚Äô‚Äù. In the pre-Trunk or Treat days (or, back when there were fewer) the streets were chock-full of trick or treaters on Halloween night. But it seems like there are so many trunk or treats happening now, many kids/parents are over it & opting to stay home on Halloween. We had a lot of kids come by last night, but nowhere near as many as we used to get; with [TWENTY Trunk or Treats](https://imgur.com/a/1qCz1kD) happening in the 2 weeks before Halloween in just one town - who can blame them? It takes all the thrill out of Halloween being a kid‚Äôs only chance for an all-out candy grab.Edit: If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Trunk or Treat, see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/halloween/comments/yjsgps/unpopular_opinion_trunk_or_treats_are_taking_away/iupytnq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3).My dad used to install drive-thru displays. His job would take him several cities over - sometimes as far 8-hours away. He‚Äôd work through the night, so that the drive thru could reopen before the morning rush. And after he was done? He Always. Drove. Home. We‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúDad! How can you drive all that way in one day?! The company would pay for your hotel room!‚Äù And as serious, old-fashioned, and ‚Äúmanly‚Äù as he was, he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep without your mom.‚Äù In our youthful na√Øvet√©, we‚Äôd still shake our heads and tell him he‚Äôs nuts. As I got older, I was able to appreciate and admire my parents‚Äô love for each other. Thirty five years later, it fills my heart with happiness whenever my road-weary husband makes the absurd trek home because, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep without my wife.‚Äù May we all achieve the love we always admired.I‚Äôm not sure that this is the right sub, but I‚Äôm not sure what is. I need some help. Some friends of ours just lost their baby to hydrocephaly. He only lived hours. The parents were very grateful to the hospital, and so we want to donate books to the hospital wing that he was in. Since it‚Äôs a memory gift, I wanted to put a sticker in the back of each book, saying ‚Äúin loving memory of [baby‚Äôs name] ‚Ä¶‚Äù I‚Äôm a little apprehensive bcs I‚Äôm worried that any kid who gets one of these books, will read it, enjoy it, get to the last page, then think - am I going to die too? What are your thoughts? Thank you.‚Ä¶ simply to upvote my posts. Backstory: Sometimes, I post pictures of the dinner I made to a cooking sub. I was a little bummed when my dinners wouldn‚Äôt get any upvotes, and jokingly pretended to kick rocks the other day & told him about the lack of love my meals were getting.But then I started getting _one_ single upvote. I‚Äôd be like, ‚Äúhey, someone liked my food!‚Äù And he‚Äôd give me a ‚Äúyesssssss‚Äù with a high-five. Fast forward to today, I was logging onto Reddit on the laptop when a username I hadn‚Äôt seen before auto-filled the login box. My stomach sank and I was immediately triggered; in the past, stumbling on a secret username always led to devastating discoveries & failed relationships. Curious, I checked the acct history. The only activity? One upvote on every one of my food posts. He‚Äôs the best part of every day and always my biggest cheerleader. EDIT 2: thank you all so much for the kind words, upvotes, awards ‚Ä¶ and hunting down my food posts and upvoting them LOL! You all rock. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Edit: a word (because abbreviations apparently make people mean).What are your suggested stops? TIA!. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all I wanted to say. No, wait, also Lindsay is bat-shit crazy. Ok now I‚Äôm done.It was uncalled for; if she‚Äôs this disrespectful this early on - how‚Äôs she going to be in the future? Anddddd that woman-child needs to stop talking about having kids. She is not ready for a husband, let alone a child.Michael can‚Äôt finish a sentence, finish a thought, finish a breath without her abusive ass jumping all over him. How does this chick work with children? She‚Äôs never cracked a smile in her damn life. I can‚Äôt stand her face on my screen anymore.
    Sometimes I can barely look people in the eyes or string more than two words together. This particularly happens if I haven‚Äôt talked to anyone that day, I start out awkward and weird. Then it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm getting used to people and remember how to socialize. Sometimes I can even make lots of friends and be friendly and engaging. Is this the same way for you?. I remember finding Radiohead so dull growing up. I didn‚Äôt get it - too quiet and moody and strange. Now I‚Äôve listened to their music again and it‚Äôs like a balm for the soul. As if it heals something I didn‚Äôt know was broken. I just needed to be a couple decades older to get it. How bout you? You ever rediscovered music you once could not care for?.
    So, I am a woman, almost thirty, and recently I noticed that my hair is getting thiner and thiner. Is not really bald yet, but I can definitely see my scalp. I think I did it myself. I tend to play a lot with my hair, more precisely to pick my own hair, especially the little ones. I do it a lot when I am stressed, which is lately all the time. I feel awful, don't know if my hair is going to grow back again. I can't believe I got to this point.Any advice to restore my hair? Does anyone have the same tick?. So, I (F28) moved in a new country about 2 years ago. When I came here I didn't know the language, but now I am slowly getting there. I am doing a PhD, so I don't really have a workspace. I have a bf, we met here and are going to move together soon.I am a bit concerned because it's been awhile and I don't seem to be able to form new friendships or meet people. At university I have some people that I am friends with but we see each other very rarely, everyone is working remotely or is traveling all the time. Also, a lot of my colleagues are older than me so I don't relate so much to them. I did a theatre class, but the teacher who was my friend moved to another city. I also did a yoga class but everyone is older and not really there to make friends. 2 people that I contacted the most in uni moved away. I also made some friends in the house that I live in, but it didn't last so...I really don't know how to make friends. It seems everyone already have their own friends so there is no need for them to try to know me. The only people I connect with are new here, visiting students and they leave. Even if I join a class, I feel it's hard to make friends outside the class. Not speaking the language fluently also hinders my chances. Anyone has any advice? Or at least is it a common adult problem?. So, years back I became vegetarian, mostly after having a lot of talks with my vegan friend who is very militant about animals rights. I did see her arguments, and at a time it made sense becaming vegetarian, because a lot of our common friends were vegan/ vegetarians. So in a way it was that more convenient because when going out we would eat mostly at vegan places anyway. Still, it did feel like a sacrifice on my part, as having a barbecue was one of my bonding activities with my dad. It is the time we stay together, share a drink and talk about life. Fast forward a few years, I moved to another country and being vegetarian was becoming a burden. I know vegans don't accept these excuses, and I understand, but for me it was difficult to maintain this lifestyle. I went from having virtually all my close friends vegans to being the only vegetarian in the room. When going out I couldn't enjoy any of the local food, and only eat potatoes and eggs, because traditional restaurants here simply don't have vegetarian options. It was hard enough to make friends and √≠ntegrate into the new country and the new culture, without this additional weirdness of my diet. The idea that I was always a burden for people, that they had to give up going to a restaurant they liked because they don't have food for me started to feel really bad for me. I also really wanted to learn about my new country and to experience the culture, and a big part of that is well, food. What I think was the nail in the coffin was my new bf. I felt in love hard. And before anyone thinks differently, he never pushed me to give up being vegetarian. He cooked dinners for me, all vegetarian, but we couldn't share food a lot of times. And this was an issue for me . I wanted to cook for him, delicious dishes from my country. I felt this way is how he can be for a bit part of my culture and learn more about who I am. Actually, the last straw was missing home, my family. When I visited my family, I missed them and wanted to be able to again share a meal, and share those special moments with my dad. So, I finally did it, after a year. I quit being vegetarian.I never regret it. I feel happy and my life is easier. I like that I was vegetarian because it pushed me to learn to cook a lot of new things, but I wouldn't go back. My problem: I still haven't told my vegan friend!!! I feel so guilty, I know she would be hurt, devastated if she knew the truth. She is very sensitive about these issues and will feel horrible, hopeless because a lot of what shes doing with her life is promoting veganism. I am afraid to tell her, not because I think she will stop being my friend but because I don't want to cause any pain. I don't want her to feel like I don't understand or I don't care. And I don't want to look like a monster in her eyes. But I don't want to go back, I am happy with my meals and sharing food with my loved ones, enjoying going out and not feeling like I always get the worse deal when paying at a restaurant for an underwhelming and expensive dish. But the longer it takes for me to tell her, the more awful I feel.Sorry for the long text. Don't know what to do...any advice?. I, (28F) am going to move in with my bf (30M), for the first time. It is a big step and I am a bit nervous about it, but I also feel it's time and we are ready. We've been together 2 years and I am very confident in our bond. Still, moving in will change a lot of things. What advice would you have liked to receive before moving in? What should I be worried about?Tldr: I'm looking for advice for a couple first moving in together. I (28 f) come from a culture in which we say things directly, my bf (30m) on the other had comes from a country in which they are not prone to do such thing, but people are expected to read between the lines. *For example, if I ask someone if they want cake and they say no, I take the no and that's it. But in my bf culture you are expected to say no a few times to be polite and then accept. For me this feels, on the contrary, impolite. This sometimes makes it hard to communicate.TL,DR How do you guys deal with cultural differences in relationships?. I am so excited and don't know what to do with myself. I n 2 hours I go to see this beautiful apartment, that has everything on my list. It would be the first time me and my bf move in together! Can't wait and I am so afraid if the agent says someone else already has reserved it before us. Ahh, it will be so heartbreaking if it turns out to not be the one. I am tired of looking, everything is so damn expensive and shitty, I just can't look anymore. Guys, wish me luck!Update: we got the apartment!!!! I am so incredibly happy! Thank you all for the support!. So, I (28F) am in a relationship with my bf ( 29M) for 2 years. We are both at the beginning of our careers, so starting a family will not be in the cards I would say for the next few years. Still, I always wanted to have kids, and I already feel the pressure of time. Yet, whenever I bring up the subject ( like, mentioning we would need a big house for kids), he says automatically ah, no no, not kids. Once or twice I did put the subject more clearly in discussion, since we are already talking about marriage and stuff. I said that I know for a fact that I will always want kids, and that I am afraid I will waste time if in 5 years I realise he doesn't, it would be too late for me to find someone else to father my children. His answer didn't really clarify me: he said that he sometimes things about having kids, but also that kids are a big financial burden. Than he started talking about our situation, in a very practical manner ( we are both immigrants, have nothing on our name, no support system, who is going to help us). I agree with this, and I do feel the instability of our situation. Than he said that he constantly changes and matures and he can't say it now that he wants kids but he might in the future. He said I am worring about stuff in the wrong order ( like first let's figure out our careers and stuff like that) , and we can talk about it down the line. He sometimes does mention stuff that makes me think he does think about having kids ( like what would you name the kids, or being worried that he might be infertile) but than when I say something about it he goes immediately to no, no kids.Also, it would not be unlike him to say he doesn't want something only for later to be on board. For example one day he was arguing how he doesn't want to move in together, only later to send me a link to a property, and to start looking for places with me, very enthusiastically.So, how do I know if I am loosing my time?And, does it seem like he cannot think of having kids because of the situation we are in, or he will not want kids? TL/DR: My boyfriend say he doesn't want kids but also he doesn't seem like a person who is against having kids.Thanks. So, I (28F) am in a relationship with my bf ( 29M) for 2 years.

What should I do!?Thanks. Ol√°! Eu sou uma estudante de doutoramento, que est√° aprender portugu√™s mas j√° n√£o tenho um n√≠vel mais elevado da l√≠ngua. Queria fazer algumas atividades tipo artes, esporte ou outras coisas divertidas onde eu posso encontrar faladores de portugu√™s e onde o meu n√≠vel n√£o fica o impedimento.Qualquer recomenda√ß√£o? N√£o queria atividades para estudantes, eu excedi um pouco est√° parte da vida :)))). I am a woman that enjoys sex a lot. I am 28, but only had 2 long term partners. The problem is that ever since entering the second relationship 2 years ago it seems I am always at risk of urinary infection. We do a lot of sex, that much is true, but we take all the preventive measures necessary: wash, pee after, use lube etc. I was even on long term antibiotics for 6 months but sure enough after I finish the treatment the infections start appearing again!! I am to embarrassed to tell my doctor that I still have the same stupid problem, I feel so bad because I don't know what I am doing wrong and why this keep happening to me. This problem is starting to affect my enjoyment of sex, as is hard to be in the moment without thinking that I might get again an infection.Please, does anyone have any advice?. I am probably in one. We do not call it that, because I am just disgusted with the term. I wish this term never existed. How do you introduce that person that becomes f*cking significant in your life? He is the friend that I'm doing? It reduces everything to sex, when is suppose to be much more. How it can be a *friendship* when all the things you are doing are all the things that you don't do with your friends, that you reserve only for your SO? ( kissing, holding hands, touching, dating, sex etc). And aren't all relationship suppose to be based on friendships? Who is dating someone that does not consider their partner their friend? Is the first requirement in any relationship. I guess I just don't understand the difference between dating and Fwb, and it's messing with my mind because now I am second guessing any potential romantic interaction. If it's so much like a fwb, what makes a relationship, well, a relationship after all? Especially when so many relationships are so less happy and commited and emotionally involved. For me this term manages to cheapen both the concept of friendship and of relationship. So I hate it, I wish this concept never existed, and I don't want in my life to be stuck in this kind of situation. If there was another term, that can just mean we are casual dating, or we are dating but not fully committed or something like that. But there isn't, just this mostrosity of a term, fwb.I am probably in one. We do not call it that, because I am just disgusted with the term. I wish this term never existed.

Anything I wanted in a partner. Always supportive, and encouraging and understands me so well. Yet, after 8 months of relationship I had to let him go, because he was not healed from a past relationship and couldn't give me what I needed. He couldn't call me his gf, although he acted in any other way like my bf. I know is the healthiest thing to do, I know by staying I would only start resenting him, and then he would start resenting me. So I chose against all my impulses to break up. But we never fought, I don't have anything against him, I can't blame him for anything because he was so honest from the very start. He could have lie to me, he could have lead me on, but he never did. He treated me with so much respect and care. I told him my reasons, he agreed that I should do what is best for me and I should have my needs met and he is sorry he is not in the place to give me the things I need right now.Now, because I have no resentment, because we only broke up because he wasn't healed, I find it soo sooo hard to forget him. It feels so unfinished. How do I move on, when I know my favourite person in the world is living in the same city as me, wants me in his life but just can't move on. Is just not in the same place emotionally like me. God is so hard, I want to move on, but I'm afraid I will remain hung up on him. Because no matter who I will date, I will always have him on the back of my mind. Is so hard, it is breaking me.Tldr: I broke up with a guy I love, how will I move on when we never fought.

Unfortunately he has unresolved issues from a previous relationship, and could not call me his gf. I love him immensely and thought I could never just leave no matter what. He had a grip on my heart. But today I set myself free. It is harder than I thought it would be, and I know the pain will be here to stay for awhile. I really think is for the best, I hold on as much as I could but it's starting to eat at my self esteem and mental space. I hope he won't sufferer, I hope he'll get better. But it's not up to me, in fact in never was. It sucks, and i'm going to miss that idiot. My idiot, whom I still love so much.TL;DR:I broke up with the guy I am in love, has unresolved issues.

He says he wants me in his life, but cannot call me his girlfriend.

I love him very much and want to be there for him so he can heal and I told him I can wait and take things slow so he can heal in his own time. But at times is really hard, because I want him to acknowledge me, I want to be his gf. I don't know if I should stay, hoping he will move on or I should just forget about this dream of being together. I like him so much, we are so fit together, I have hardly connected with someone at such a deep level, but yeah, it's hard being in this situation. What do you guys think I should do?.

Tldr: I am in a relationship with someone who cannot move on from a previous relationship, cannot call me gf. I ( 26F) have been in a relationship with this wonderful broken man (28M). He cannot move on from a past relationships, is still hang up on that girl, even though that relationship ended 2 years ago. He says he wants me in his life, but cannot call me his girlfriend. When I say we are in a relationship, I mean all the aspects of relationship, spending all free time together, going on dates, sleeping together, cooking, talking very personal intimate stuff, supporting each other and overall a great relationship, except when it comes to him calling me his girlfriend, because he still hope to get his ex back, although he agrees that is impossible, but cannot overpass that thought. I love him very much and want to be there for him so he can heal and I told him I can wait and take things slow so he can heal in his own time. But at times is really hard, because I want him to acknowledge me, I want to be his gf. I don't know if I should stay, hoping he will move on or I should just forget about this dream of being together. I like him so much, we are so fit together, I have hardly connected with someone at such a deep level, but yeah, it's hard being in this situation. What do you guys think I should do?. So I am in a 9 month relationship with a guy I am truly in love. We are so good together and I hold him deeply in my heart. Yet, he is still not moved on from a long term past relationship, and probably won't heal for a very long time. I knew all this from the beginning, and I tried to fight falling in love but I couldn't help it. Although we are together, he cannot fully open his heart and every time he realise that he allowed himself to get to close to me he pulls back. I told him I understand he needs time and I am planning to wait and take things slow, hoping he will get better. The thing is, in my past relationships I have never been with someone that has so much compassion and shows so much care for me. Sad, I know. And also I am a foolish romantic who believes love heals. I hope I will not be proven wrong. So, please don't say I deserve better and is not good for me. I know the terms of my situation and is not ideal. But is my choice to stick around and see if it goes anywhere, because I really hope it does. And if it doesn't I would be just as heartbroken today as I would be tomorrow. Plus, I wish I could just say, what a pig he wants me but he can't commit, what an asshole he is. But I can't say that, because I know if he could do it, he would be past his trauma. But he is not, and who I am to judge. We are all messed up in a way or another. And after all, it is my choice, even though it hurts sometimes. What I am wondering, me sticking around would it help him or is an impediment in his growth because he doesn't need to confront his messed up heart? Are there any chances he will actually get better and be mine? Please tell me your experiences with this kind of situation, especially if you are the person who had a hard time moving on, or the person who sticked around.Pretty much the question asked above. I'm seeing a guy who wants to be "friends", but it feels more like a relationship. He seems confused about what he wants. I think he is afraid of getting into a relationship and says he feels pressured, but his actions show a different story. So, how is a fwb different than a relationship?Later edit:I do want a relationship eventually, and don't want to pressure him in any way. Is just, he seems oblivious to the fact that we are already in a relationship. We cook together, go on dates, talk about random and intimate stuff. Also, the reason he doesn't want to be in a relationship now is that he says is still suffering from a previous relationship.So the story goes like this. I met a guy and we seem a perfect match. He seems really into me, and acts as if we are together. But he says he doesn't want a relationship because he still suffers from a previous one. I would normally be fine, but I just can't let go. Because while he says we are friends, he acts like we are best lovers and it's confusing me. And I don't want to say anything so he doesn't stop being tender and nice and caring to me. What should I say? I already agreed we will have this thing for a short while, but the truth is I am not fine with it. I want us to be together. I cannot even imagine how painful will it be to just walk away. I don't want it to end. What can I do?. God I feel like I'm in highschool. So I (F, 26) have only been in one straight passing relationship. I've had my almost moments with girls but up until now never went...all the way. The first and longest girl crush was...well not into girls, and the second girl I almost had something going on hooked up with a dude in the end. Anyway, I would really like to date girls. But I don't have the smallest clue how to figure out who are not, well, straight, and then how do I proceed... I find it easier to date boys because I already know all the social norms and expectations, but I am so ...green in girl-relations department. Please, any advice? Or at least does anyone have the same problems so we can vent together? :))). Just the title. Is there any unwritten rule as a book reviewer? I had my review published in a journal and I was wondering if I should let the author know about my review.I was sure that the fact they were the last of humanity was not true...but I thought that it will end with the same line, this time being true. When the rambling plot started I was sure this was the endgame, making the first initial lie true, meaning that the last remaining humans will build a stronghold and they would have to survive in a world were the humanity was really on the brick of extinction.I kinda hope the new fanon will go in that direction, it would be awesome. Hello adoptees...I am someone who plans in the future to adopt. I am a child of divorce and growing up I was adopted by my step dad, who is and always was an amazing parent, accepting both me and my brother as his own ever since the beginning. So, since I know from my own experience that family doesn't end in blood, I decided to adopt. I just want to care for someone as much as dad cared for me even when he didn't have to.I know adoption is a traumatic experience and I want to prepare, to be able to be and give my best. Is anything you would want an adopted parent to know? Do you have any books recomandations ? Any help is much appreciated.After the finale, I was so upset with the ending that I left every subreddit related to AoT to heal after what was a huge pain and disappointment. Yet, every few weeks I check on titanfolk, and every time I arrive right after something big and unexpected just happened ( like extra pages on the finale and now the fanon finale, which got me really excited). I really believed I will not touch AoT anytime soon because it was so hard to recover from that horrible finale, but it's seems I am still drown to it. And also, every time I check on titanfolk you guys make me laugh so hard with your memes and jokes. What I want to say is that I kinda missed this community, even though I don't know if I will be able to see my beloved show the same way ever again.First of all, I want to say that it is not my intention in this post to invalidate or disrespect anyone's sexual Identity. I just realize that I have some internalised biases and I want to better educate myself. I identify as bisexual and I want to understand why some people identify as pansexual, what does it mean for you, and how you understand the difference between the two (bi &pan). Whenever I try to learn this ( from yt videos or comments) I came across two things that doesn't sit well with me: that people who identify as pan say that bi means being attracted to two or more genders - and I find this definition coming from a misunderstanding of the meaning of bi in bisexual ( it does not come from bi as in two genders, but as in both homosexual- attraction to same gender, and heterosexual -atraction of different gender). So as I understand bi means being attracted to all genders, because both same and different gender covers any type of gender. Second, when people say bi does not include trans or nb people that again seems to me that comes from either a misunderstanding or internalised biphobia ( by this I mean people have a negative connotation of bisexuality ) I also came across the difference between bi and pan as being divided between more and all genders - but I don't understand what does it mean ( it seems to me that again this difference seems to suggest that bi does not include attraction to NB please, which I really don't think is the case) Lastly I saw the difference being drawn from how genders affects attraction. Here again I don't understand and an insight into what it means for pan people would help. I really want to understand what this difference is meaningful for you pan people, because I want to be supportive but I realized that right know I have reservations that shouldn't be there because I don't understand your personal experience. I hope I did not offended anyone and if I did I am sorry. I don't mean to discredit any identity and I believe anyone is capable of knowing what their identity is. I just want to have more clarity and challenge some feelings that I realize I have and would like to change.I am in the face of an impossible decision. So, I have the opportunity to enter in a large project as a research assistant. The salary they offer me is quite low, but at least is more than I make now which is nothing. I want to apply for a scholarship, but if I get it, in November, there is a condition that I cannot hold any other position, including that of research assistant. The scholarship is much consistent but only starts in November and I have no guaranty that I can get it. Now, if I get the scholarship I cannot accept it because a very close friend guaranteed for my participation in the research project (for context, they had another research assistant that droped out, so they said is crucial I can take this commitment for the whole 3 years.) Also, the projects lasts 3years, but my PhD take 4 years.So this is my impossible situation: do I give up on the scholarship or give up now on the research assistant position? It is so frustrating that I have such a choice to make, I don't know what to do. I am afraid that if I give up on this position of research assistant I risk of be left with nothing and I would have to give up the PhD. But also the research assistant position is low pay and a lot of work. Yet, being part in such a large project gives me the opportunity to gain experience in research and do some networking for future opportunities.I am already exhausted mentally from the precarious condition I live in and from all the uncertainty. I don't understand why, why is so hard.So, I don't know where to start...first of all, my bf and I have been together for 6 years now. He is my first relationship and I am the longest one of his. We are still together. I was watching a video today about abuse, and I realise that at the beginig of our relationship I was very abusive, emotionally, I mean I would make him feel bad about himself, and critisize intensively, and made him feel awfull for who he was and what he liked...I was very manipulative and would coused fights and then expect him to confort me...I would smetimes act violent...I feel awful, and I know he felt for a long time tooI once asked him why he is sometimes so distant, and he said that he loves me but doesnt like me very much...and upon discussing more, he said that at the beginning of our relationship I made him feel very small and insecureThe think is, I didnt realise it but alot of the times I was acting just like my mother would, like she used to make me feel so bad that I would start harming myself, she would always threaten to give me away when I wouldn't behave...and now I realise that I've done the same to someone and I dont understand why? How could I have done this?The last few years, our relationship got better, we would not get into fights and I stoped my behaviour of making him feel less...I still have some issues to work on, I still sometimes get into this rage, and I dont know how to not...But the thing is, my abuse doesnt go away, I still did what I did...how do I fix this, what do I do? I am very sorry for causing him pain.So I am a master student and I can only write by hand first, and only after I would transcribe everything on my laptop. This is very annoying and is getting pretty difficult to keep up with the work for the university. I can stay for half an hour to look at the word document in front of me and barely squeeze a phrase, meanwhile, with a pen in my hand I can fill pages in just minutes. Also, the more calligraphic I am able to write with my pen, the better I seem to write. Is this like a condition? Does anyone else have it? What should I do?. Hello, so I am a master student and I would like to start a phd next year. The problem is, I think I waited too long to make this decision and it seems that the admission period is over. I still have to write my application, and would probably be ready by the beginning of March. Will I have any chance of finding a phd? Please do you know when are the deadlines for applying to a phd in Europe? And any advice on how to apply? &#x200B;Thanks!. Hello, so I am studying a Master degree in Sociology and would like very much to start a Phd programme after. I am also working full time because I cannot support myself otherwise. I always had good grades, and the last semester I finished with great results, but I have to say that it was a real struggle. I would work and then come home and start writing and reading with no free time. I am constantly tired and overworked.I dont know how much I can keep it this way. I go to work, I go to class and I study, still I fill miles behind all of my peers. Only thinking how much time they have for studying, I feel that I have no chance. Do you guys think I have a chance to start a Phd? Have anyone experience this - working and studying- and succeed? And do you have any tips?.
    It seems like most places that sell burgers boast about the patties being thick. I‚Äôm assuming this must be what most people like since they do it. And I guess it technically is more value for your money.But something about thinner patties just tastes a bit better to me. Like the ratio of the meat to the other ingredients is just a bit better when the patty is thinner. When you get the patties that are like hockey puck-thickness it almost feels like you take bites that are all toppings, and then other bites that are just bland meat by itself. I mean I wouldn‚Äôt turn down a burger with a thick patty, and at nicer restaurants where the entire burger is big, the bigger patty is fine because it‚Äôs proportional. But i think most burgers I eat, I just wish it was a bit thinner.My dog is an 8 year old pitbull/shar pei mix, around 45 lbs, and has never really gotten along with other dogs very well. But typically as long as there‚Äôs a fence between them she does ok, she‚Äôll either pay them no mind or play the ‚Äúrun along the fence back and forth‚Äù game. It‚Äôs just if there‚Äôs no fence or anything I always keep her tightly leashed because I know she won‚Äôt do well otherwise.I recently moved to a new city for a job and bought a new house. The new house has a fenced in front and back yard, and the back yard is like 90% wood privacy fence except for a small gap that‚Äôs chain link. The neighbor on my right also has a female pitbull that‚Äôs 7 years old and they don‚Äôt get along at all. The first time they interacted I had mine on the leash so I didn‚Äôt even let her get close enough to the fence because they were growling and showing teeth at each other.Just now, I got home from work and let mine out into the back yard. I knew the neighbors dog was also outside but I figured I‚Äôd keep an eye on it and grab mine before they got too wound up. Mine was pretty calm when I first let her out but once they saw each other it was like go time, they went straight for the chain link part of the fence and went crazy. Mine has a couple little spots bleeding a little bit on the bottom of her jaw but I think it‚Äôs just light scratches from the fence, I don‚Äôt think they actually got to each other.The neighbors on the left side also have a pitbull and that one and my dog seemed to get along fine, mine sees him on the other side of the fence and just pays him no mind. So I know it‚Äôs possible.Eventually I‚Äôll probably just finish off the last few feet of fence so it‚Äôs privacy all around but it will be a little while before I have money for that. So does anyone have advice in the meantime? Obviously I plan on keeping them separated but I‚Äôd like for mine to just relax and not pay attention to the other one in case the neighbor lets her out while mine is already out. the neighbor seems like a nice enough guy, he was controlling his dog and calming her down too, but he‚Äôs really old and doesn‚Äôt move around too well. and honestly it‚Äôs just really hard to understand him when he talks sometimes, I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs all there mentally. So it might be hard to do any kind of group walks or training sessions.I‚Äôve been having quite a few job interviews lately. I‚Äôve had plenty of jobs before, but all of the ones I actually had to interview for were entry level jobs that seemed like they would‚Äôve hired anyone who showed up on time and wore a clean shirt anyways. Now I‚Äôm applying to more white collar, higher paying jobs, and all the interviews I‚Äôve had seemed like they went well overall, but maybe could‚Äôve been better. I have relevant work experience to the jobs I‚Äôm applying for because of my current job, but I never had to interview for my current job because I‚Äôm technically an independent contractor. There‚Äôs been a few times I‚Äôve gotten asked that ‚Äúwhat is your biggest weakness‚Äù question and I really didn‚Äôt have a good answer and just kind of stumbled through that one. Today I got asked that in an interview and figured I‚Äôd just be honest and say sometimes when I‚Äôm in unfamiliar situations I miss small details, but I recognize that about myself and do things to account for that. But I‚Äôm not sure if that was actually a good answer or if admitting that just hurt my chances.Sorry in advance if this post gets long, I'm just trying to explain why I'm conflicted and I'd like to hear from people with different life experiences. So I really appreciate anyone who reads it and responds at all.Basically my current situation is that I‚Äôm 28, no kids, no significant other, and I live in a small to mid-sized midwestern city. Got my bachelors degree in 2020 and started working/training for my current job immediately after that. I got fully certified to do this career on my own back in March, and it really used to be a great career that paid pretty well and was relatively low stress. So I thought I was on a great path. But right around the time I became fully certified, Fannie Mae changed some policies and the fed kept raising interest rates which slowed the real estate market down a ton, and in turn slowed my job down to pretty much nothing. I signed up for several dozen different companies that were supposed to send me work, and for 2 months I got absolutely none. So I pretty much figured this just wasn‚Äôt going to be a viable career anymore and I started applying to jobs before savings ran out, with no real preference towards location, I‚Äôd be willing to move anywhere for the right opportunity. Fast forward to the past 3 or 4 weeks, things have started to pick up a ton at my current job. I‚Äôve actually been starting to get consistent orders coming in and my coworkers are also doing a lot better. With that being said, I‚Äôd like to see a bit more work and for it to last a bit longer before I feel confident in this career long term again. But it definitely is starting to look a lot brighter.But there's also still all these jobs I applied for when I wasn't getting any work. Among others, I have a zoom interview tomorrow morning for a government job in Atlanta. The salary is quite a bit more than I make now, but also quite a bit less than my coworkers who trained me made a couple years ago when the real estate market was more active. So in that aspect it feels like a bit of a gamble. But there's also the personal aspect of it.If I move anywhere I think Atlanta would be one of my top choices, I've been there before and I liked it and I already know some people there, so I don't think I would have too hard of a time making friends. But I also like where I live now quite a bit to be honest. It has it's downsides sure, but I have a house with cheap rent and a yard for my dog in a great location and I feel like I've really settled in here the past few years. I've got some places that I like hanging out at and a few good friends who I would miss. It's nice to walk into the bar around the corner from your house and people know you and are happy to see you. But on the other hand, I've lived in this small/medium sized city for most of my life, and the only other city I lived in was just another similar sized city like an hour away. And part of me thinks it would be really good to get out into a bigger city and see some more of the world. I've always talked about how "oh maybe in a few years I'll move to this place or that place" but I've never really came close to actually doing it, and it seems like there's no better time to actually do it than if I get a good job offer. I guess what I'm conflicted about is that I like where I live now and I know the grass isn't always greener on the other side, but I also know you only get one life and I dont want to be 70 years old thinking "what if I moved away and did more cool stuff when I was younger". And then I also have to consider that in my current position, my job might either go back to being a great job in a few years or it might end up not existing at all, it really depends on economic policy changes... and if I take a similar government job I might not have as high of a potential income but I know I'll have some stability. So if anyone has a similar experience moving across the country, any advice about doing it or why I should/shouldn't do it I'm all ears. or any input about the job situation. I didn't really want to go into too much detail about the job and dox myself (even more than i already have) but I hope it's understandable.So I made a beat last night, just a simple beat with some drums/sample/bass and a few track mutes at different parts. The very last thing I did last night was export the file and I‚Äôm listening to both versions to compare now, so I know I‚Äôm not just misremembering it.I opened up the same project today cause I was thinking about messing with it some more, and one of the sequences sounds way different. There‚Äôs a bridge sequence in the middle that sounds like there‚Äôs a bunch of extra track mutes and the sample sounds pitched up a little bit from the original version for a brief second. I looked through the programs and everything and I can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs causing it. Honestly I kind of like how the different version sounds so I‚Äôm not exactly mad but I really feel like I should know how it changed overnight and how to prevent that if I don‚Äôt want it to happen. Any help is appreciated.I‚Äôm 28 years old and live in Michigan. I would be open to moving pretty much anywhere. I have a bachelors degree for communications and professional writing, and I‚Äôm a state certified residential appraiser. I really only got that degree because I already had a bunch of credits that went towards it when I went back to school and I just needed any bachelors degree to get certified. And at the time being an appraiser was a really stable and good job. I went to college straight after high school, dropped out and worked in warehouses and distribution centers for a few years to pay bills, decided that really wasn‚Äôt a long term career and I couldn‚Äôt keep breaking my back throwing heavy stuff around for companies that didn‚Äôt care about me at all forever. So I went back to school and got my degree. My dad is also a real estate appraiser and I trained under him for a few years and got fully certified to do it on my own a few months ago. The problem is he‚Äôs about to retire and I think the real estate appraisal industry is pretty much dead. Like, I could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt even think it will be a job that exists in a few years. And none of us saw this coming so soon. If I had made the decision to go back to school and did everything a year or two earlier, I would‚Äôve been getting at least a few orders from appraisal management companies every week and doing great while the real estate market was hot during the pandemic. Now, I‚Äôve been fully certified for 2 months, I‚Äôve signed up to get orders from all of the major companies and dozens of smaller ones, and I haven‚Äôt gotten a single order. I‚Äôve gotten 2 quote requests and offered to do them for the bare minimum amount I could do without losing money myself and they still gave the orders to someone else. I think because of the fed interest rate hikes and Fannie Mae changing lending policies to phase us out this just isn‚Äôt a career anymore and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I wasted about 6 years of my life to get to the position I‚Äôm in now and the powers that be essentially eliminated my job overnight. Right now I‚Äôm trying to become a tax assessor for a city or township, and I‚Äôve had a few interviews that honestly seemed like they went really well, but I haven‚Äôt heard back from them. I had an interview to become an underwriter for a large mortgage company, and they offered me the job, but they said I would have to give up my appraisal license because it would be a conflict of interest, and the pay is so little I wouldn‚Äôt be able to support myself without doing appraisal work on the side. So I really don‚Äôt want to take that job but they said I could think it over for a few days and call them back if I wanted it.My only other work experience outside of cashier jobs/pizza delivery while I was in school is at warehouses and distribution centers. Those pay decent enough to make ends meet but unless you end up in upper management they don‚Äôt pay enough to really build a good life for yourself and support a family long term. So I really don‚Äôt want to just accept that I wasted most of my 20s and start applying to warehouses again either. Does anybody have any advice about where to look for another appraisal job or how to find some kind of work in real estate?. My dog got sprayed by a skunk last Thursday, so it‚Äôs been a little over a week. I got the smell pretty much out of my house completely, none of my clothes or anything still smell, I‚Äôve been able to go to work and go places and ask people and they can‚Äôt smell it. And the smell is like 90% off the dog. I can put my nose right up to most of her fur and it smells normal.But I just can‚Äôt get the smell off of her chest. It‚Äôs not super strong to the point where the house stinks or anything but it‚Äôs enough to notice if you‚Äôre really close to her, and it‚Äôs only on her chest. I have a standup shower with the kind of shower head you can hold, but the hose isn‚Äôt long enough to get under her and spray her chest. And I can‚Äôt exactly force her to lay down on her back in the shower. Ive tried diluting vinegar in a spray bottle and spraying that on her chest and that just seems to make her smell like vinegar for a while until it wears off. Does anybody have any recommendations for getting rid of that last hint of the smell or am I stuck just waiting for it to wear off?. Sorry if this is a dumb question, I‚Äôm just genuinely curious, and I see people talk about how cheap ounces and stuff are so bad on here all the time. I‚Äôve been smoking for 15 years, but honestly I‚Äôve just never cared to get into all the science and chemistry behind the plant. I guess what I want to know is, what exactly makes the cheap pre ground ounces or small buds so bad? I‚Äôve bought them here and there over the years when I was trying to save a few bucks and it still seemed to smoke decently. I could understand why people wouldn‚Äôt want to buy straight up powdery shake but I guess I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm missing with some of the pre-ground stuff. I know people say the shake ounces are what they sweep off the floor at the facility but it‚Äôs not like food where that‚Äôs a sanitary issue afaik.And a lot of times I‚Äôll see where they have an ounce of normal sized buds of a given strain for $200 and then an ounce of small buds of the same strain is $100. But they seem to be about the same quality when I smoke them. And the buds aren‚Äôt even THAT small half the time, to me it just looks like what I would‚Äôve gotten years ago before it was legal. And whether it‚Äôs a big bud or a small bud it looks and smokes the same after I grind it up anyways.So is it like a chemistry thing inside the plant where bigger buds are supposed to be better? Or do people just value the size of the buds that much more for some reason?. I started making beats around 10 years ago, when I first started I just used an akai midi controller in Logic Pro x. After a few years I bought a used maschine mk1. Used it for a while, liked it, but then I just got kind of busy with college/work and I fell out of it. Lately I‚Äôve been getting into making beats again but since I got a used mk1 so long ago I still have the really old, really limited maschine 1.8 software. And there‚Äôs stuff I want to be able to do that looks a lot easier on newer versions of mpc or maschine. And the hardware itself is pretty tired at this point. So I think by the time I upgrade the software (if the mk1 is even still compatible) and repair the hardware it would cost half as much as just buying a used mpc one, and from my understanding akai isn‚Äôt all weird about the software registration like NI is. The other option is spending a bit more on a new mk3.I like the maschine workflow but I‚Äôm not exactly married to it at all, so I‚Äôm curious for anybody else who‚Äôs used both, how difficult is switching over and what‚Äôs the process of loading in samples on the mpc one like? If you have something like a drum kit from the Internet can you tag it show it shows up with all your other drum kits or have it as a folder? I‚Äôm leaning towards the mpc one just because it seems a bit more versatile and capable and affordable on the used market but I‚Äôm curious what people with firsthand experience think.I have a purple #8 authentic Kobe Mitchell and ness jersey that I‚Äôve had for a few years, new with tags no flaws. It‚Äôs size 40 (m) and just doesn‚Äôt fit me. Im looking to trade it for another Kobe authentic in a size 44 or 48.So I just finished up kiwami 1 after beating 0 last month. I didn‚Äôt exactly rush through it but I definitely wasn‚Äôt going for 100% completion or anything either, I did a decent amount of side quests but I really just did what I felt like doing most of the time. I plan on playing all of the games in order and then probably revisiting my favorite ones to do some more of the extra stuff.But I somehow missed out on a bunch of the majima everywhere stuff. Before I started the game my friends who already played it gave me the impression that he literally pops up everywhere constantly, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I only fought him 4 or 5 times. I did the obvious one at the beginning of the game, the one where he‚Äôs a cop in front of millennium tower early on, the one where he‚Äôs a bartender, the batting cages one, and then the one in shangri-la which I don‚Äôt think even counted for the majima everywhere stats. When I was playing the last chapter I noticed a message saying to meet him at shine which he must‚Äôve sent earlier and I never noticed, but going to shine at that point in the game just triggered the main story events. So I‚Äôm kind of curious can I still go back and do those fights in premium adventure? Did I miss out on any meaningful story stuff or just the dragon stance skill tree?. Sorry if this is a question that gets asked a lot, I‚Äôve browsed this sub for a few days and haven‚Äôt seen it. I‚Äôve played madden ultimate team a ton over the years, I really just don‚Äôt like the gameplay after the recent patches and I‚Äôm burnt out and want another sports game. The mlb the show beta was really unimpressive to me. I used to like 2k a lot but I haven‚Äôt really been ‚Äúinto it‚Äù since like 17. I kinda want to try it out since it‚Äôs on sale and I haven‚Äôt played it on ps5 yet. But I have zero interest in mycareer or playing against the computer so I‚Äôm just curious about if the digital deluxe stuff and a few days of grinding would be enough to get a usable team, and if the gameplay is decent at all this year. I heard they changed quite a bit but all the reviews on YouTube are old and don‚Äôt really talk about myteam anyways.I never see anyone talk about it but it happens to me once every few games where I‚Äôll be at the calling screen and it‚Äôll glitch out like it thinks I‚Äôm holding down one direction and it just cycles through all the formations or all the plays super fast so I can‚Äôt pick one. The only way to make it stop that I‚Äôve found is pausing the game and unpausing it but sometimes it happens twice in the same half and then there‚Äôs just nothing you can do. Sometimes it stops after a few timeouts and delay of game penalties but it usually doesn‚Äôt and then you‚Äôre stuck just taking the L.And I know it‚Äôs not just my controller or my internet connection or anything because this has been happening to me since madden 20 at least and Ive upgraded entire console generations and moved to a different city since then and it still does it. But I never see it happen to anyone who streams the game.I want to say it happens to my opponents once in a while too because I‚Äôll see them randomly pause the game and unpause it really fast and go back to playing, so why does no one talk about this? I know EA is trash when it comes to fixing stuff like this but it‚Äôs literally game breaking and pretty much guarantees a loss if it happens twice in the same half. It seems insane to have something like this in the game for multiple years across multiple generations of consoles.I used to love that show but hardly anyone I know ever has any idea what I‚Äôm talking about even though there was 4 seasons of it on espn. Once in a while I still go back and watch the old episodes on YouTube. Anyone know if some of those guys still play or stream madden or what they‚Äôre up to now?. I‚Äôm so tired of hearing these dudes that scream after every play or play music into their mic the entire game.I think they stopped doing it back when kaz was still on the show but if they‚Äôre gonna have guests on every other episode it would be funny as hell to hear the guests flagrant thoughts. And mark/chifty would probably have some good funny ones.I bought a used maschine several years ago, when I first bought it the person who I got it from just sent me their NI email and password so I could install the software on my computer. I haven‚Äôt used it in a couple years but I‚Äôve been getting back into it, I recently installed the software on a new computer but it‚Äôs the old 1.x software. I‚Äôd like to update but I‚Äôd rather just get it under my own account, so will I be able to transfer the license with just the old username/password/serial number or would I need to contact that person? Thanks. According to the announcers Derwin James says he plays madden constantly and they‚Äôre on ps4, wonder if any of us have played him lol. Derwin is up 35-9 in the second quarter (it‚Äôs on fs1). Both are fully powered up with brawler and run stuff chemI have a lions theme team, I used to run Suh at RE and Snacks at DT but I just bought trey flowers heavyweight and powered him up all the way. Suh actually played DT for the lions (but they played 4-3 back then) but his overall goes way down when I move him to dt. Just looking at their stats though it seems like Suh would be better unless I‚Äôm missing something.So pretty much a few times every game while I‚Äôm at the play call screen, it will randomly act like I‚Äôm holding up/down or left/right and just constantly cycle through everything really fast. I know it‚Äôs not my controller because if I just pause the game and unpause it the problem stops, and it never happens during plays or when I play any other games. It‚Äôs not that big of a deal because pausing it fixes it but it‚Äôs annoying and in online games there‚Äôs a limit to how many times you can pause. Does this happen to anyone else and does anyone know what causes it or how to prevent it?. I run into this all the time, people are able to throw into double or triple coverage but they always get that diving catch animation so you can‚Äôt click on and make a play. I play people who get that animation so often it must be how they‚Äôre throwing the pass that triggers it not just madden randomness.Don‚Äôt remember if they said if it was just for regular season wins or not.I took a few hours today and finally finished completing the 95 pat tillman so I put abilities on him and exchanged my Derwin James for Devin white to replace Avery Williamson. Right now I have abilities on Calvin Johnson, Tillman and Deion. I feel like Deion has gotten some crazy picks for me since I got him but everybody says two or three enforcers is the way to go. And I feel like the downside of having a corner activated is people can just not throw at him.So I have the unopened gauntlet pack and the upgrade token to get whoever I take up to 92, I can‚Äôt decide between Derwin James and Devin White.Right now I have the 93 Uk Jordan poyer at SS, and my mlbs are 93 shazier and 92 Wagner.I‚Äôm also like halfway to a lions theme team so I‚Äôm thinking about replacing shazier with Devin white then do the exchange for Herman Moore. Or I could get Derwin, sell poyer and then I would have enough coins for another good player. But I‚Äôm not sure what would actually be a bigger difference for my team.I run mostly 3-4 and right now I have 84 telvin smith and 85 superstar Anthony Barr as outside linebackers. I have the 86 Lawrence Taylor but I mostly use him as a pass rusher. I also have 93 Bobby Wagner and 88 shazier as my middle linebackers so I‚Äôm solid there. (I have run stuff on my whole defense)I‚Äôve gotten higher overall OLBs before and I ended up selling them because smith and Barr both do pretty well in pass coverage for me. I use them in pass coverage a lot and smith has 69 man 73 zone and bar has 59 man 68 zone so I don‚Äôt know if I want to get anyone really worse than that or if it will really matter.No real specific price range but I‚Äôd like to go for less than 300k if possible. I‚Äôm curious what people consider good players. (In head to head seasons). I‚Äôve gotten tired of ultimate team because the competitive meta is just broken and I‚Äôm not going to spend so much money to have a usable team. I feel like head to head with regular teams fixes a lot of that but the game doesn‚Äôt really give you any incentives to play it and no one talks about playing it from what I‚Äôve seen.Or did they just raise the price for no reason?. When I go to ‚Äúcompare stats‚Äù from the online head to head menu nothing loads and it‚Äôs just a blank page every time.
    I've been an avid gamer since childhood. I've been playing games when I was single, when I got married, when I had my child and as he is growing up. It's the one hobby that I kept with me while adulting.As I have progressively less and less free time to play, I realised I found myself enjoying buying games more than playing. It's almost like gaming has become less playing and more 'buying the games I *want* to play (that I may or may not have time for) at the cheapest price' lol. They say kids are dumb, but I'm learning so much about life just from seeing how my six year old goes on about his life, which I think all adults should take onboard. Here are some of my favourite lessons from him:* Keep trying until you can finally pull it off. Your parents told you off for repeating something that you've failed 5-6 times? Got a bruise from trying that sick move all your friends are doing? Just keep trying. Again and again. You'll eventually succeed.* Live in the moment. If something happy happened, enjoy that feeling. Celebrate it. Don't dwell on past sadness or bitterness. Every day is a new day. Every hour is a new hour.* Don't judge others by their appearance. Judge them for their actions and how they treat you. Unless they have wronged you, everyone can be your friend. Share good things with them. Share your lollies! Even if they don't want whatever it is that was offered, they'll still feel happy for being offered.* Forgive quickly.* Don't be afraid to speak with strangers. Smile at them a lot. The fuzziness from receiving a smile is contagious.The bittersweet fact is that I once knew all these things myself when I was a kid, but I realised that I had forgotten it all while growing up and facing the harsh realities of adulting.I saw that Fallout 76 is on sale on Steam for 80% off, for $10 AUD, so I'm kinda tempted to snag it. What's the current state of the game like? Is it a much better game than what it was when it first came out?Edit: Lots of comments are endorsing this game at its current state for its price on sale, so I've decided to grab it :) Thanks everyone for chipping in your views! ‚ô° See you all in the Wasteland. I just finished Pillars of Eternity 2 and my opinion on the gods kept changing through my playthrough.At first it made sense that they would be so singularly focused on their domain. After all, their existence was based on the souls of their worshippers who worshipped them for their domain.But then throughout the course of Pillars of Eternity 2, I became rather disappointed with them all. They were so flat and one-sided in their pursuit of their own goals that they almost felt like... children; complaining, whining and scheming of things they wanted. They really did not feel like the ever-powerful, omnipotent greater beings that deserved to be worshipped.Then my opinion changed again towards the end of the game when I realised that that's exactly how I think the devs wanted them to be portrayed; worshipped as powerful beings to regular citizens who didn't know their true identities, but flawed to us as the Watcher who knew so much more about them. I thought that was quite clever.What was your opinion about the gods throughout the games?. I have a lot of trans girl friends. We play a lot of games together and hang out on calls sometimes.I dunno if this is me being a 90s kid but I sometimes say 'dude!' as like an exclamatory thing. Like, if someone mentions... uhhh, cabbage, I'd say "dude, I hate cabbages!'And I sometimes use 'guys' as a gender neutral term when there's a mix of genders in the group I'm addressing.I myself don‚Äôt mind it. Obviously neither of these are *intended* to imply the gender of the person I'm addressing, and I'm 100 percent certain people know that.So the question is, does it still annoy you? To hear a gendered term used in such a way?EDIT: The wise Council has spoken. Don't use it because some girls do mind it, even if they won't mind it enough to voice it sometimes.\*\*\* Spoiler for the main quest!Which faction did you end up choosing as your ally for sailing to Ukaizo? Just curious about people's reasoning :)I went with the Huana. Not so much because I resonate with their culture or ideology, more that I felt like Ukaizo was once their capital and I feel like they had the most right to its claim.Sucks that Maia and Pallegina both leave the party for it though :(. I've been with my partner for 10+ years and I have to say, her best moments are when she tries to stir up trouble lol.Sure, she's cute when she tries to be romantic, and she's very comforting and dependable when she takes care of me, but the times when she tries to get under my skin in good humour are sometimes the most memorable bits.Like when she keeps prodding and poking my cheek with a smile for like a minute until she gets a reaction out of me. The times when she bursts through the bathroom door with a :D face when she knows I'm inside using the loo lol.She's very polite and friendly in front of others and never acts like that except to me, her sisters and her parents. I think that makes it especially more special lol.I used to not think much about it because I have no problem passing with my voice, but the more I think about it, the more I feel like I should treat it like an honour. Like she has this little safe space in her sand castle, but has made a little space just big enough to let me in.It‚Äôs not like others aren‚Äôt interested in hearing her voice. There‚Äôs this guy online we‚Äôre both friends with who has a pretty big crush on her, and says he‚Äôs ready to nut the moment he hears her voice xDBut she refuses to speak with him, saying she‚Äôs not ready. When I ask her why she‚Äôs fine with voicing with me, she says it‚Äôs because having me around for her to use her voice validates her transgender. Like an outlet for her to be able to express her gender identity.I‚Äôm certain one day she‚Äôll be as free as a bird when it comes to using her voice to speak with people. Until then, I‚Äôll cherish this little space she has made for me in her sand castle :). I used to tutor English in cafes. One morning I was there much earlier than my student so I was waiting, sipping my coffee.There were two guys at the next table. They looked to be in their 20s? They looked fairly young. It was mostly one guy talking. He was telling his friend how he ended up on a date with this single mum somehow who was older than him, and that her kid came to the date which he was very annoyed about.At the end though (think they went to a museum or something), he bought the kid an ice cream and the kid said he had the best day of his life and asked his mum if they could hang out again.The guy was explaining how that filled him with, like, a sense of purpose... And even his boring job didn't seem so boring anymore after that.And then my student arrived and I had to stop eavesdropping lol.I dunno... This was a while ago but I think about this story a lot.Edit: Sorry, I made that so wordy at first.There's no stress about winning or losing. Not like League or Valorant where you're worried about flaming, toxic enemies and even worse teammates. It's just you and the boys (and occasionally girls) having fun.There's no sweating over grinding for xp for seasonal rewards before it's over, and instead of cussing at your teammates for sucking and dying, you go to their rescue like an angel to revive them off the ground. They thank you. Call you a legend. Or wiggle left and right like a puppy in thanks because they don't have a mic. You feel all fluffy inside. It's all good fun, I really like it :)Until some asshat starts throwing sexist slurs at me but whatever lol. That hasn't ruined my experience.Can they not leave? Is everywhere in Sanctuary just as miserable? Even across the Twin Seas? Or down south in Kurast and Viz-jun where we currently can't visit in Diablo 4?If you're an NPC, seems like your choices are you freeze to death in some frost peaks, die from a heatstroke in the desert, or live under permanent UK weather where it's always raining and your feet are 5 inches deep in mud every single day.And if you survive the environment, it seems like everything else wants to kill you. Bandits. Cannibals. Demons. Undeads. Religious fanatics. The freaking wildlife and even a freaking wall lol.And if you survive ***all*** that, there's poverty, hunger, famine, disease, lack of medicine, destitution everywhere @.@I don't think I've seen a single spot of happiness in this place.Meanwhile there's my overprivileged druid with more than 4 million gold in my pocket lol. So now I have to count inequity as another misery factor.When I hear guys thanking each other on the voice comm for the heals, the revives, ammo drops etc, it's just so adorable ‚ô° I've heard all kinds of variations of "thanks bro". Some are pretty flirty and funny lines xDUsually in other games that use voice comm like Valorant, OW2, CoD MW2, I'm used to the boys only using comms to tell the world how massive their schlong is and how tiny everyone else's balls are, just because they have, like, 0.2 KDA more or something. Usually I stay quiet in those games.But there seems to be a lot more wholesomeness in this game. And a more casual vibe. It's definitely making me wanna play it more than the others.Edit: And the left right wiggle that voiceless players have adopted as a universal 'thank you' is so cute lol. Makes me wanna pet them.I just noticed that MW2 2022 is on sale and thinking about buying it.Is the multiplayer pretty active? Is it pretty easy to get into and find a match?I'll be playing from Australia if that changes anything.
    what brand of water tastes the best to you?. It had been a while since I had taken the bus in London, but I had walked more than I usually would be comfortable doing in a day because of an orientation activity, so I took the bus for a short ride to the train station to catch the train.Some context, I am disabled. I have an invisible disability, as I have End stage renal failure and on nighttime dialysis. I get fatigued easily and even more so when carrying heavy stuff. Of course, I don‚Äôt look like it. I‚Äôm a university age student and look as young and fit as any other.So I board the bus and there are two seats empty near the front, both on the aisle, one is marked clearly disabled, one isn‚Äôt. So to avoid being seen as an asshole I chose the one that isn‚Äôt. Except on this side there happens to be a young mother with a buggy and a young child in it. I didn‚Äôt notice at first, but shortly after I sat down, an older woman (of course it‚Äôs always an older person) in row behind me kept tapping my shoulder.I was quite confused at first and didn‚Äôt know what she meant, but she kept gesturing to the woman with the child and said she might want to sit. So I reluctantly looked up and feeling pressured, offered my seat. Fortunately she didn‚Äôt want to sit anyways.Now I don‚Äôt know, but I came out of all of this with quite a sour taste in my mouth. Of course the old lady wanted to be considerate of the woman with the baby, but she had chosen not to take a seat for multiple stops until that point. And she had no way of knowing I was disabled myself. But I just felt like there was no winning in this scenario. No matter where I sit I am going to feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to just because I have an invisible illness. What if I moved across to the disabled seat? Would I have gotten rude stares? If there was no other seat left and I was truly exhausted would I have been continuously pressured to give up my seat?I don‚Äôt know, all of this just puts me off even further of taking public transport.I have my driving test tomorrow morning, I know to stay calm and carry on even if I make a mistake, but any tips on little tricks to do that while i‚Äôm driving lmao? How do I stop my brain from going into overdrive and overthinking when I notice I‚Äôve made a mistake?. Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a young PD patient that has always struggled with my weight. I am extremely petite and very underweight. I was recently thinking about using some kind of app on my phone that I can easily keep track of the foods I eat and possibly more accurate calculate and keep track of the calories, nutrition that is in my diet. I am just a bit unsure about this because a lot of the apps on the market are aimed for people for weight loss, and usually perpetuate a negative mindset of calorie restriction. My goal is to keep better track of the foods I am eating and I want to make sure I am actually consuming enough calories/fats/nutrients for a balanced healthy diet that can help me gain weight. I eat pretty clean, I rarely eat out, I eat almost no processed foods and try to make everything at home. So if an app can help me calculate eg, the calories of the English muffins that I make myself at home that would be a plus.Thanks again for reading my long posts and do let me know if you have used any of these apps before!. I don't know what happened but after moving my sims 3 game just won't start up. I have tried EVERYTHING, including uninstalling and reinstalling (I have done it more than 5 times probably) but every time I launch the game it just goes to a black screen and then jump back out into my desktop, it won't even reach the menu. I have tried using the sims 3 launcher and a window pops up sayingAn error has occurred in the script on this pageLine 622 Char 4 Error: unable to get property length of undefined or null reference Code 0 Url: [https://launcherapi.thesims3.com/launcher/home.html?launcherLocale=en\_US&launcherCountry=IN&var=loggedOut](https://launcherapi.thesims3.com/launcher/home.html?launcherLocale=en_US&launcherCountry=IN&var=loggedOut)Do you want to continue running scripts on this page?&#x200B;PLEASE HELP ME I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING I AM DESPERATE! JUST TO EVEN SEE THE MENU AGAIN.my friends and i have struggled for years to get this specific friend a perfect gift. so i wonder if reddit can help. for clarification purposes, i‚Äôll call her mary in this thread.Mary was born into an upper middle class family. her father owns a business. they‚Äôre not exactly struggling and don‚Äôt exactly need any common ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù or ‚Äúhousehold novelty‚Äù objects. they would prefer to buy it themselves.Mary doesn‚Äôt have a specific interest. she‚Äôs not too into anything at all, really. she plays badminton, does a bit of art, but anything relating to those she doesn‚Äôt like. (for arts she prefers to do it herself)basically, i can‚Äôt buy her anything because she‚Äôs not interested in anything that‚Äôs special and novelty, but i also can‚Äôt buy her practical items because she has everything she needs.and i can‚Äôt make something handcrafted because she‚Äôs not the sentimental type, plus i myself hate arts and crafts.what do i do?. [Life goes on in Hong Kong](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/world/asia/is-hong-kong-safe.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)I resonated with this article.this one was too good not to share.I was on second gen, and the kid had a lot of money from inheritance. He grew up in chicago, went to college and got a job as a stockbroker. He had a hookup but ended up really hitting it off with this girl, alexa. soon they got married and had two kids, a boy and a girl. he got bored(well, me.) in his marriage and cheated multiple times. also, out of jealousy also killed his other exe‚Äôs husband. got sent to prison and alexa left him. of course, he was cunning and escaped prison. miraculously, he emigrated to italy legally and started a new life. he was still pretty damn depressed after alexa. he got another job and carried on, but it was before long that he got back on good terms with alexa.so guess what i made him do next? go back to chicago, get arrested, escape, and get back together with alexa. however, she was married at the time, so of course we conveniently got rid of him. he gets sent back to prison, but escaped again, and gets back together with alexa. him, alexa, their two children move to italy (miraculously still approves) and live out their lives rich as hell.man i love bitlife.okay, this is more of a question than a post, but here we go.so as far as i know, i have a pretty consistent family tree with to the best of my knowledge 100% east asian (more specifically, chinese) heritage. and as seen in most east asians, they have very straight hair. and when i was a kid growing up, that was the case for me too. i specifically had very thin and straight hair. i had always wished for thicker hair as i couldn't do any hairstyles with my almost non-existent layer(singular :( ) of hair. as soon as i reached puberty though, my hair got dramatically thicker. i figured that it was probably because of the hormones affecting hair growth, and you know, my mom had pretty thick hair for as long as i remember, so it makes a lot of sense.but the thing is, my hair not only started to grow more layers, it also started to show curls pretty frequently. i had never expected this as i was sort of a late bloomer and thought id be stuck with my sickly thin, straight hair. now, even when i had hair that was growing pretty long, it would still maintain its curly waves especially when its tangled. now, i know this is probably just a part of my genes, as my dad has said that he had a thick head of curly hair in his youth too before he lost most (sorry, dad) but i'm just interested, what exactly does this say about my heritage (if it does, because i have never seen another person of chinese heritage with thick and curly/wavy hair)all in all, its not a bad thing. just something im curious about. and hey, i guess my wish of getting curly hair sort of came true! :).
    Rewatching the Harry Potter series at the moment, and got to the point where The Weird Sisters (which is basically part Radiohead and part Pulp) played a rock song called "Do The Hippogriff".Obviously, the song they played was a hit that people knew already, but how does notoriety get around about music? Afaik, recordings and videos aren't a thing in the wizarding world, except for the gramaphone that we see from time to time, so do wizard musicians operate on vinyls, do they simultaneously work in the muggle and wizard world, or was there a magical version of Napster or a Walkman for the time period?As a musician myself, I'm just very interested in if there's any explanation into how music works in the hpverse.I am looking for one thing and one thing only. And that is the slickest, the sexiest, the most satisfying combat. I could not care about story, I could not care about graphics. All I care about is entering that flow state that these video games put you in. Ghostrunner is the main example here, as that is my favourite game OAT based on pure gameplay. I have never felt more badass.A developer that does this really well is devolver digital. When you look at My Friend Pedro, Enter The Gungeon, Hotline Miami, they all have that sort of flow to them that is just a billion things happening at once, and you're just going without stopping.Another aspect of this is momentum. In Ghostrunner, and some other games that I really enjoy, you can learn to pick up speed to the point where you feel like you're breaking the game with it. Think of Lucio in Overwatch, how if you just lightly hit a surface while wallriding, that will give you a speedboost, and if you're good enough, you can nearly zip across the map.If you're playing as a glass cannon, then that's a big plus.Was going on a date with a girl yesterday, and since we were headed for it after our college classes, we kinda hung around for a little bit before going off. We were sitting together in our lecture and I kept catching one of my mates glancing over at us every once in a while. And whenever I made eye contact with him, he'd kinda look away like he wasn't really watching us.Afterwards he followed us out, and we were chatting with a group of friends. After a wee convo for a few minutes, most of the people we were talking with started to filter out. But not him. He stuck around a little bit, and kept trying to chat with her. Eventually he asked her what she's up to now, and she was like "uhhh..." looking over at me, so I had to tell him that we were going for a walk and maybe lunch.When I tell you that I saw the light drain from this man's eyes... literally I saw his mood drop from 100 to 0 faster than a speeding car into a wall. He instantly just had that slight quaver in his voice of trying to keep a poker face, yet doing a really bad job of it, and I could tell he was dying on the inside.Don't get me wrong, I do feel quite bad for him, since I have been in that position a couple of times myself. But, at the same time, I felt like a total fucking chad. I hate using that type of term, since I find that whole sort of "alpha male" ideals completely ridiculous and asinine, but it's true. That feeling of "yeah mate, she finds ME sexy." was like a drug.Date went well, all things considered. She's a great person. We had the whole "we should do this again sometime" type of thing. And tomorrow, I'm gonna make plans with her for another one. But man... it was a weird feeling of knowing that he most likely sees me as a "douchebag bro" now, even though I most definitely am not.Heading out on a little date with a girl on Monday. I've never really been on one before, so I have no clue what to do, or where to take her. Doesn't help that this woman is obscenely attractive, and brilliant craic, so I'm quite nervous about it. Was wondering if you lot had some good ideas for places to go. It needs to be in the city centre, for the record, since we're meeting up there. Preferably would be something to do with music, since we're both musicians, but if you guys just know a place that makes a really nice coffee and lunch, then that works too.I don't know what it is, but I just love riding around in souped up shitty cars over rocking in some stock supercar. There's something about the way it feels that is just way more satisfying than a Regerra or a Huayra.So I'm asking you guys, any of you bust out a 400+ punchbuggy for the laughs? And which one is your favourite? Mine is a Porsche 911 Carrera. I put the Irish flag on it and I think that gave it superpowers because of how obscenely nippy it is.New player here. Just downloaded the game and am getting through most of it easily. I'd be doing much better than I am, if not for this one problem.Sometimes I press the button to change the colour from yellow to blue, and it just doesn't happen. It's definitely not the controller, since there's an audio cue from the game that says I've changed colours, but I'm still on the same one I originally was. It has cost me so many FC's at this point that it's beyond a joke. Is this just a glitch in the game, or the something that the devs threw in to be sadistic? (If it's the latter, it shouldn't be a thing, as it's completely unfair on the gamer in a way that isn't satisfying in any way). There's a girl in my college course, and she's literally so much my type it's not even funny. Incredible singer (this makes me attracted to you, and I go to music college), funny, super sweet and stupidly attractive. She moved here from Ukraine after the war started, and we've been hanging out a fair amount.I think she has made attempts to flirt at me, plus I get the vibes that she's attracted to me, based on how she's been seeking me out to talk to me, be near me, hang out with me. And to be clear, I have no problem with that.However, I am having an obscene amount of trouble flirting back. Last week she came into the room I was warming up to sing in and we had a whole conversation for the 30 minutes before class started where I got to know her. She had me dance with her on Tuesday while someone was singing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" (I go to a music college), and I had no moves. None. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Zero. Yesterday, she said that she can't speak English that well, and that maybe I should teach her. My response "Haha... yeah... to be fair, I can barely speak English, too, so you're doing fine." Along with a myriad of other things that I'm probably gonna facepalm over in the shower about 3 years from now.I am fucking this up in real time and I don't know what to do. I feel like the most awkward strange teenager when talking to her. I wrote an entire song about her because I couldn't sleep since I was thinking about her. Worst part is that song is a genuine tune and I won't be able to share it since it's obviously about her, and I am not emotionally vulnerable enough to do something like that.I keep getting demolished by people who just spam this one move and I have no idea how to counter it outside of parrying or anticipating the square and praying that I'm right. There surely has to be a counter here that I'm missing, since guardbreaks counter dodges, the start of heavies, everything. And you can't even switch it up, and block a guardbreak if you're midway through throwing an attack. I'm lost.Today, my mum (53) asked me (19) if I could lend her ‚Ç¨20 to buy fabric softener. I didn't have ‚Ç¨20 on me, so I gave her my card and she went and got it. When checking my balance, I noticed that she actually made 2 payments with my card. 1 that was about 3 euro, and another that was 17. I asked her what she bought with it. She said she bought some fabric softener and cigarettes (for context, she's an addict for cigarettes, but doesn't want to admit it).I was angry at her for buying cigarettes without telling me that she was, and just flat-out duping me, but she said that I don't have any right to tell her how to spend the money that I've lent her. Regardless, I'm angry because she knows how I feel about her and cigarettes, and that I don't want to be an enabler for her, since I refuse to buy her cigarettes when I go to the shops.She still says that because she asked for ‚Ç¨20, and because she's going to pay me back in a couple of days, I shouldn't be complaining.So, am I the asshole?. I run a lot of custom lobbies with my friends, which gives me low rep (Rep 4) but relatively high skill.Started running some 1v1s against randomers and even though I started off demolishing them, it quickly got to a point where I was playing against people who were still low rep (like 1-5 overall, not just on that hero), but stupidly good, knowing all the mixups, feints, combos etc. even though it was their first time playing them in an actual online matchup.I was just wondering if the game has a known problem with smurfs, or if the game masks the rep of the other person, or something like that. Just curious.I can understand that a lot of it might be custom lobbies, but I'd say it's highly unlikely that every single person I've come across is just running customs.Doing a project in college on the Supremes, and a couple of other soul/motown artists, and my dad mentioned that he was actually in a music video (except they didn't call them videos back then) shot in France in 1964. He was selling newspapers, and he was asked by their manager if they could film. In the video, they go in and buy a paper, or something along those lines.I think it would be a really cool thing to bring in for the project, so I'm trying to dig around for it, but I can't find it anywhere. If anyone has any idea about where I could find it, if there's a video archive, or something along those lines, it would be greatly appreciated. It most likely would have been on French television.Playing through MyRise at the moment, and The Lock just quit Evolution, after clashing with Randy every time and doing the stupid thing of trying to 1v3 the Hurt Business. Is it just me, or was The Lock the one who was out of line in the faction? Especially after quitting like a child after Randy said that maybe Gabe is the one who's going to be the world beater, and not The Lock. I would have liked to see Lock putting his head down, grinding, and working his way back into favour with Orton and earning the IC title.And then there's the complete lack of respect for Randy. Why the hell would Lock join Evolution to learn under his tutelage if he's going to try and push back against him at every turn? I don't know, maybe it's just me, but it was frustrating to see The Lock make all of the choices that I wouldn't have done.Hopefully things clear up in the future, because I've heard really good things about this storyline, but for now, I think The Lock is the heel here, not Randy.Update: Lock has just attacked Shawn Michaels. He's a dick. Someone tell me if I'm a bootlicker because I feel like I'm going insane.All I've ever seen is people talking about how Cody vs Reigns is the match for the story at WMXL, but can't happen because Rock vs Reigns has to happen, since that is extreme levels of money.But why don't they just make it a triple threat match? First off, triple threat main events at WM are always a banger. Second of all, I don't think Roman has ever retained in a multi-man match. Third of all, it knocks out 2 money fights with one stone, and allows Rock, who might be rusty with his wrestling, to still put on a good match by being carried by Roman and Cody.Hell, if we're insane, we can even throw in someone like LA Knight, Chad Gable, or Sami Zayn as a dark horse to win the whole thing and make it a Fatal 4 Way.Even looking into the future, would a bloodline fatal 4 way be money, with Jey, Jimmy, Solo and Roman competing, and maybe even Rock if you want to overbook it. Or you could even do something along the lines of a 6-man tag. Rock, Jey and Jimmy on one side. Roman, Solo and someone else on the other side. I mean, the possibilities are endless, but it seems like any match that has more than 2 people/teams never happen anymore.But a look of shock dawned upon your face once you realized that they were all ordering cappucinos. I've been running and possibly OTPing Illari a lot recently and one thing I've noticed is that my aim on her is much stronger than my aim on other characters. Take my main before Illari, which was Ashe. I had a consistent 50% weapon accuracy with her, with about 15% crit. Or if you look at Cassidy, which is closer to Illari in weapon, but was even lower (40% acc, 5% crit). But now I look at Illari, where I'm averaging accuracy in the 65% range, going even as high as 80%-85% on multiple occasions, with a crit accuracy that I don't know, but feels higher than any other hero that I've used. Is there any reason to this? Is it because her shot has some time where it's still around and the opponent can walk into it? Is it because the charge makes me hold my shot a bit more? Is it just because I seld my soul to a succubus to become Big Boss Pine on Illari? Help me out here.On console btw.I dropped probably one of the best bits of trash talk I think I've ever come up with today. Me and the homies were playing For Honor, and I managed to basically come back from being low health into dominating a fight, because I knew what my friend's (we'll call him Geoff) moves were going to be. One of my other friends mentioned that I could have lost that fight, and I said "nah, I had him read like a book." Geoff was like "Eh, no you fucking didn't. The match was close." And I was like "Yeah, sure I did, watch. Chapter 1: Geoff is my bitch."I understand that when it's written out like that, it doesn't have the same weight as when it's spoken, but since it was so off the cuff, made evreyone laugh for like a minute straight, I was just happy. I love a bit of banter, even when I'm on the receiving end of it, but this was one of the times where I came out on top.I'm not talking about who can put on a match, I'm talking if wrestling was still real to me, dammit, then who would people be looking at as the Tom Brady, as the Leo Messi, as the Tiger Woods? I'd probably bet on Cena, since Super Cena was pretty insane. But Hulk Hogan won a lot, Shawn Michaels won a lot, Brock Lesnar is a freaking monster. What's your take? If you want, you can put in the best version of a wrestler, as well.Yk when you're having a wee stroll down Grafton St. There's the fucker with the knives on a unicycle that's way too tall. There's the Dice Man, if you're an oldie. There's the 50th dude singing Dermot Kennedy with his Instagram and a QR Code somehow drawn onto cardboard. Was just wondering if people ever stop and actually have one that they like to pay attention to, and have seen multiple times. I know I have one. I've bumped into her a few times in non-busking settings and she still doesn't remember me.On top of that, I'll also give you a reason to listen to the song you selected. Kinda bored, and music is the way that I like to connect with people, so this should be fun! If you want, send me some music you've been listening to, too. I'm sure it slaps.Bottom text.New player here. Been playing about a week and something I noticed is that when I'm shooting, I'll sometimes have a bar that is literally perfect. There is literally no space for the white to go. Still, my shot isn't classed as excellent and it'll hit the rim. I've had shots that aren't as close to the top be excellent, so I don't understand why that doesn't work. Is it just one of those "go fuck yourself" things? Is the bar not fully accurate?. You guys keep showing up as a recommended subreddit and I have no idea why. All I know is OneyPlays did the animation for Tenacious D. My curiosity has finally gotten the better of me and I want to know who in god's name is Oneyplays and what does this sub have to do with them.I got 2k23 from PS Plus and chose to be drafted for the Bulls in MyCareer, as I have a Chicago Bulls t-shirt in my wardrobe and because Sirius is an absolute tune. I want to get to know this squad better and know the history of the club, so does anyone have any videos/articles/knowledge that go over what this club was and is? Thanks a mil, lads.Downloaded Nba2k the other day, and it's been extremely fun. Was wondering if there are any places where I can play irl. Doesn't have to be 5v5, 3v3 halfcourt is good as well. "You never know if someone likes you until you try and find out."I've always been pretty shy at social events when it comes to girls. I never really assumed that people would like me, despite considering myself to be attractive, because I didn't want to make advances on a girl who wasn't into me.But today, that all changed. I just thought to myself "you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Remember what happened to Nate and Jade. He had to come out of his shell for her." So I tried it on this one girl. Chatted to her most of the night, and near the end, we made out. We were dancing together, and I moved a bit closer to her, she moved closer to me, I had my hands around her hips, and then she grabbed my neck and pulled me in for a kiss. We made out. And then we did it again. Now, she was also kissing other girls and boys, so there wasn't any love in it, but it still happened. I made out with a girl for the first time. I was ecstatic. So ecstatic, in fact, that I went to the dance floor again, and within 3 minutes, kissed another girl. There was a whole group of girls who let me dance into their circle, I basically was able to choose who I wanted to kiss, so I moved to her, had my hands around her hips, she moved her head up, and then I made out with her, while the rest of the girls CHEERED.Gonna post on r/roastme tomorrow morning so my big head can fit through my bedroom door in the morning,, but that was the biggest ego boost I've ever received.The reason why I'm saying this is that I genuinely think this show has changed my life. I've gone out so many times, but never pulled, because I've always been nervous about being a guy who betrays a woman by making her think he's genuinely interested in her personality and actually just wants a snog, but today I did not care about all that, and I did it.Thank you, Ted. And thank you, Jade, for showing me how to get girls.I've gotten the traditional skin fade all of my life. Getting my hair cut tomorrow and I really want to try something new with my hair. Was wondering if anyone had any ideas of hairstyles I could get?.
    I have been to a lot of cities in Europe and a few in Asia but never have i felt so scammed by everything. Not only is everything triple the price as anywhere else but the quality just feels underwhelming. Places are loud and crowded. The only thing i genuinely enjoyed was the beautiful skyline. This is the first time i felt like i might not want to return to a city.After watching five seasons, i feel that all this experiment manages to prove is that you don‚Äôt need to see someone to connect with them. You can bond with many people or find common ground without meeting them physically. Specially when the interaction is based on exchanging stories, being vulnerable and asking deep questions. We all knew this already. However to actually say yes or commit to marriage, you need more - clarity, attraction, compatibility, shared values, similar goals, etc.Love is not blind. Love is thoughtful, considerate and deliberate. It‚Äôs entertaining but it‚Äôs not saying anything new about love.
    I see this all the time at my job, retail, they literally have their phone in a holster on their hip. I have only one question: Why?. For context, I'm a guy. There I was, buying me a 24oz of modelo, and then of course when I have to show my ID the cute cashier came up and said my hair was beautiful. It's long, down to the middle of my back, i honestly don't think it's all that good looking tbh. It has literally been so long since anyone has complemented me on anything let alone my hair. I'm literally beaming right now. She made my entire year with just a few words. Hopefully I'll see her again tomorrow since we work together.You often hear them say things like: the heart of man is wicked, or mans heart is so wicked that we can't fathom it. It's such a harmful statement, honestly. To believe that everyone is evil and that we are sinful by nature. What they call sin is human nature, and so Christians never feel like they are Christian enough, so they keep coming back to church, keep tithing, but they'll never be good enough.My suspicion is that it's wired wrong because even when I press the button for cherry pepsi, it gives me mtn dew. Today, I tried to fix it by pressing the button for mtn dew, hoping for cherry pepsi, and guess what, it gave me mtn dew. Sounds like something straight out of office space.As the title says, I work 9am-6pm at Walmart, my only days off are Tuesdays and Wednesdays.So, there I was scrolling through instagram reels when I come across a Islamic family from Toronto, the woman is a fundie who covers herself head to toe. I find this disgusting. She is a knowing slave. She can't even shake a man's hand, or eat normally because she has a face covering.Religion is control, and islam is the most controlling.So, I work at Walmart, online grocery pickup, and my favorite thing is this: When a beautiful woman rolls down her window and flashes me a bright smile. And she's really nice and we have this sort of intimacy between strangers. I know she's just being nice, but it's great to see anyway. Especially after a long day. Generally our customers are very friendly anyway but after 3 years of being a shut in it's nice to be nice to.Think of it like this: On one end you have what I like to call the "The Toe Dippers", a swimming pool reference. They really only act Godly on Sunday and on Monday, God only knows. Hehe. In the middle you have the "why I oughta's" they want to do violence but are and always will be cowardly. Left of center are the good Christians, they drink starbucks, eat chic fil a, and are generally üëå. Right of center are the ones that are ready to kill with just a little encouragement. The far end is basically a palatable nazi rally. And it's this group that will fly planes into buildings, call in bomb threats to schools, honor kill women, beat them. And are generally subhuman, as they act antithetical to the collective human good. The closer they follow the written word of the Bible, or Quran, Tanakh, the more dangerous they are. Therefore we can interpret the written word as inherently dangerous to our livelihoods, and the only thing keeping us safe is the inherent moral goodness of Man. In closing, when confronted by a religious person who engages you in conversation, decide where to place them on this spectrum and then plan your responses accordingly. If they be a fundie, do not placate, or treat them as a child, instead treat them with the same disdain you would treat a fly buzzing around your head. Of course don't commit a crime, but don't shy away from defending your beliefs with the same zeal and malice as they do.Heard this phrase recently and I just genuinely can't wrap my head around what it could mean.I didn't know hunger until I met her, now I know I was starving. Everyone else had someone, but not I. I didn't even have myself. When she gave me a drop of love, I thought it was an ocean. Poisonous plants, Poisonous woman. Nothing but a weed that took over my garden. I hate you, still, and I think I always will. And I hate that I can't just blame you. I was the Dying man in need of water, but she only had a drop to give. Babies breath on her wrist, and now I don't like flowers. I burn every one I see. https://reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/8gGpP3iluQ https://reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/rJjGd3js33. RIP Pete's dad. Seriously. I couldn't imagine losing my dad on 9/11, because it'd be really hard to find him in amongst all that blood and bones and debris.I keep hiding the posts or whatever but they keep coming back, and it's not the regular Christians either, that get starbucks and eat chic fil a, it's the real nutty ones. I don't engage in that content nor do I seek it out, what could be causing this influx of Christian nuttery?. Lam kor- wan murdered 4 women and then had sex with their dead bodies. When asked why he killed 4 women, he said, 'because the other 3 kept giving me the cold shoulder.'. Am I adulting good? My situation is on the up and up, so I haven't had the need to abuse drugs and alcohol lately. And when I felt the need I resisted.Enter: me watching a cute baby monke doing cute baby monke things. I then go to the comments and alls I see is comment after comment about wanting the lil man to be free. He's clearly safer there than in the wild. I swear some people are just naive.Ok, so, when I was a kid in the early 2000s, in the US, there were these carbonated fruit punch drinks, that came in little bottles. I can't remember the name and I want to know if they've been discontinued.He was discussing the 2A, because that's all these people have to prove their masculinity. He qouted this passage. "If a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguilt for him, but if the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for him. He shall surely pay. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft." How can someone read this and think 'Yeah, I want to follow this religion.' I mean seriously. Btw, he conveniently left out that last part about being sold.How many of you can look back upon your life and find a moment in which religion, whether it be the Christian, the Muslim, the Jew, the Catholic, the Evangelical, or whatever other names they come up with to call their posion, how many of you can look back and point out when these religions harmed you significantly, or effected your life? Most of you, I'm sure. It's not hate speech if the subject of your speech is against your existence.I'm not someone who goes out of their way to watch disturbing movies, but I took a gamble on this one after seeing a comment about it here on the sub. All I have to say is Woah. Just woah. It's disturbing all the way through. One of the only movies that has genuinely unnerved me. It's free on Tubi, I recommend it. Especially if you like slower movies.My wife and I have been trying to spice up our sex life, so she bought a dildo. It's not as big as mine but she says it's great for anal. It's black and about 6'5 200 pounds. Names Tyrone, nice fella. A little rough though.It's the only job around me that pays good, at $18+ an hour. But I'm not willing to hide my tattoo or cut my long hair, I'm a guy. Any advice?. I(23m) cook, it's about the only thing I can do well. If I have the recipe and the ingredients I can cook it. But I'm just one man. My "help" is my mom and dad, both can adequately cook, my mom is better than my dad. But it seems like when I need to cook something they lose all common sense, especially my dad. I have to repeat myself several times, raise my voice just for something to get done the way I want. Then my mom gets mad as if she doesn't do the exact same fucking thing when she cooks. It's like they make things intentionally difficult. The simple task of getting me more flour is suddenly a difficult task that takes 30 seconds. I like things done a certain way because my way 98% of the time is the best way to do that task. And then of course my dad acts surprised when my way actually works, as if I didn't know what I was doing. And when I ask my dad to help me clean up after dinner he turns it into a big argument 'why can't you do it'. It's just unbelievably frustrating dealing with them sometimes.I have noticed something recently. The people you want to last the longest, the ones you cherish, they're never here long enough. You always want 4 more years. What I wouldn‚Äôt give for 4 more years of norm macdonald, bob saget, robin williams. The people that should die, and make no mistake there are people in this world that should die, why is that they seem to last the longest?God must think of himself as a comedian, too bad his jokes fucking suck.This would be one of those intentionally bad jokes he would say and then he would look at the guest and try to get them to laugh.
    Alright so I'm in my mid 20s, just finished college and I'm starting to work full time. I don't have my life figured out in any way at all. I honestly feel completely lost. I'm doing my thing, that's allright, but I don't "feel like an adult". I guess that comes with time and experience? A lot of my friends (about the same age group, so early to mid 20s) are getting married, having kids and doing all of that "adult" stuff. I honestly can't see myself getting married within the next 10 years. Doesn't help that I recently got out if a serious relationship haha. I guess, I'll be the cool single friend who's gonna travel or whatever, idk. I just feel like I'm doing something wrong maybe? Maybe I'm just not ready to be an adult? I don't know, if feels weird living a completely different life compared to your friend group. Has anyone experienced something similar?. Hi guys. So I've been mentally out of TSCC for about a year now. I've always wondered how other people felt when they feel "the spirit". How would you explain that feeling of there even was one? How do you explain it? I've been thinking about that a lot lately.For me I realized that it felt a lot like anxiety. Like really bad anxiety at times. I remember sitting in testimony meetings and getting this feeling that I should get up and say something even though I had nothing to say. It felt like I was expected to do so. I'm thinking it was just social conditioning and underlying pressure that made me feel this way. If I didn't do what I was supposed to do I must be a miserable human being, not worthy or whatever and therefore I felt anxious. What kind of experiences and explanations do you have? I'd love to hear some other perspectives. Also if anyone has a more scientific insight into the psychology behind this I'd be very interested in that.. Hey guys, so I've never posted here with this account but I forgot the password on my other one. I just hope noone finds me here. Anyways as it says in the title I'm getting that "blessing" towmorrow and I was wondering if you can think of anything I could do to expose it. Maybe something you missed the chance on. I'm trying to record it if that works. Maybe I'm just being stupid, who knows...Thanks for any suggestionsEdit: Oh and guys if you have any predictions let me know! Are there things that tend to make their way into a lot of these blessings?. I've had a few good months now. I actually felt okay with were I'm at in my life, I felt like I was happy, I felt "normal", or at least what I think normal would be for a mentally healthy person. I was motivated to change my life for the better, I was talking to people, getting out of the house and so on. I thought I had gotten better. I thought I had put the depression behind me and was ready to move on. It is really scary how it all can change so quickly. Now I'm sitting in my room again feeling like absolute shit, ashamed of beeing alive. My one really good friend that I had doesn't want to talk to me anymore, let alone hang out with me. I don't have anyone anymore. I feel like it's all my fault but I don't know what I did wrong. I regret every single choice I made the past few months trying to change something, it just doesn't make sense. Why even try anymore? I am certainly not okay anymore. But all I want is to be okay again. I'm so incredible lonely, I've decided to post here... maybe someone will read it. I'm probably not even making sense right now so I'm sorry for that. I just don't want to go down that hole again. Will it ever get better? I really don't know. I want to cry and let it all out, but I can't. Thanks for reading.Last time I cried was about a year ago. I often sit in my room and just want to cry about my miserable life, and get at least some form of relief that way. But it doesn't work. I just sit here feeling like the useless piece of shit I am. I can't even cry. ffs. So basically I don't get invited to go anywhere often at all. But when I'm invited somewhere or even if there is some kind of social event I could attend to I get incredibly fucking anxious about it and don't go to participate. And I fucking hate it. It is so horrible. This has destroyes my social life completely, I don't have any social skills and because I never practise them I will never improve them either. I fucking hate myself for being like that. Everyone says, and I even think to myself, it can't be that hard, right? Hell no, it's the hardest thing in my life to build up the energy to attend social events. And then I panick and cancel last minute or don't even go. People hate me for that, they think I'm unreliable or I don't want to be around them. But that's not the case... I wish I could just tell them that. Or better just be normal. Sorry for the rant, thanks for reading.I'm sure there is someone out there whoes birthday is today. And as I'm forgotten as well, I just want to wish you a happy birthday! I know how it feels, I know the pain. And even if it's not your birthday today just know that you're an awesome human being and I wish you all the best for today. <3 :). Hey guys, how are y'all doing today? It's my birthday today and as expected no one remembered it. But I don't even care. I have no one in my life, but I don't care. I don't feel anything. Literally nothing. I'm so incredibly alone, I even forgot how it feels like to have friends, how it feels like to be loved, how it feels like to be happy. I should be happy today, at least that what everyone is expecting me to be, but I'm just wasting time on the internet as usual and being emotional numb. I just want to feel something again ffs. :(. I don't know how to say it but I kinda want to be depressed. As in if I have a good day or something I want that numbness back that depression gives me. I don't know how to explain it properly... I think there is some comforting aspect to it. It's like I don't even know who I am when I'm not depressed. It's like depression is part of me, something that defines me. And when I get better, I loose that part of me. And then I want it back.I don't even know if I'm making any sense at all.So an old friend who I didn't talk to for at least two years just texted me asking if I was ok. Completely out of the blue. We started talking a bit and she somehow knew that I wasn't really doing okay. She offered to talk about it and I agreed. I told her everything. She was really understanding and supportive, something I have never experienced so far concerning my depression. Maybe I should add that I never talked about it before with anyone. Anyways I felt better afterwards, but now I start panicking. I think I overshared. I am terrified by the tought that she knows all these things about me now. It's the first time for me sharing this with someone other than random poeple from the internet, so I don't know if this is normal or not? I am really freaking out now.. I don't even know where to start. Okay so I'm just going to try to explain my situation. So, I've has a quite bad episode of depression about half a year ago. But it has gotten better. Way better. To the point where I was actually somehow enjoying life again. I made new friends and everything. It‚Äôs not that much but I felt okay again. However it looks like my life is going down the drain again. Everyone, literally everyone stopped talking to me in the past three weeks. People I thought I could trust, people I thought were my friends. They all just stopped out of the blue, no more replies to my texts, no one wants to hang out anymore. I don‚Äôt know why. I can‚Äôt explain it. I didn‚Äôt do anything bad, didn‚Äôt offend anyone, at least not intentionally. I tried to reach out again, I tried to contact them, without success. I‚Äôm so fucking lonely‚Ä¶ again. For a few months I thought I had made it, I thought I could live a somewhat normal life or whatever‚Ä¶ But guess what? I‚Äôm still a fucking looser that no one can be bothered to even talk to. The worst thing is, I still see everyone hanging out together, going to parties and shit, posting about it on social media. I feel forgotten. I feel alone. I feel hopeless, worthless and miserable. Maybe I‚Äôm just overreacting or something‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt even know if whatever I just typed makes any sense at all. Anyways thanks for reading and sorry for rambling..
    Hi, 33F here. Been single for a few months and recently joined Tinder, more so just to dip my feet in the water and see what‚Äôs out there. So far, been on 3 dates, all with different guys. Forgot how annoying it is to meet people and just have zero chemistry in person. Can‚Äôt help but think maybe it would be easier if dating were like the Hang the DJ episode of Black Mirror where you‚Äôre just ‚Äúassigned‚Äù your person? Am I overthinking by wondering if ‚Äúmy person‚Äù isn‚Äôt even within my general vicinity, let alone this state or this country?! üíÄAnyone else overanalyze and think about this shit? About to morph into a plant at this point. Seems easier. ü´†ü™¥.
    I had this friend that I met on a dating app almost 2 years ago (we are both women). I wasn't interested in them romantically after we met irl, and I was honest about it. I told them, and they said that was completely fine and they would love to be friends. our friendship started out strong. we talked a lot, and at one point we were pretty close. they ended up meeting their current partner. imo, their relationship was iffy to begin with. they were almost 30, and their partner was freshly 20, has never kissed anyone, dated anyone, never even been in a relationship. a few weeks later, and they made plans to move states and live together. cut to a few months, they're living together and married, theres been a lot of drama between them and their partners family. after they started dating their partner, our dynamic completely changed. to clarify: I don't think any of this is the partners fault. they stopped talking to me as much. they would message me and tell me I was their "best friend", but they would only message me to talk about them selves, vent about things, or say " oh, man, I only need $15 for weed...I hope one of my friends helps me out.. man... I really need money for weed.. I don't know how I'm gonna pay the bills.. I just need $15... hopefully a friend will give it to me.."I would try and talk about myself, considering they always started the conversation with "hey! I miss you, how are you?!" but anything I would say about myself, they would respond in two words, or just leave me on read. and regardless of if I was left on read, or two worded, you could guarantee the next thing they said would be about themselves. they would also hit me up every now and again and say we needed to hang out, I'm their best friend and they wanna see me, they miss me, etc. when I said that sounded fun, the catch was always "yeah, me and [partner] saw this place near you we wanna go to, I figured we could stay at your place! you can go with us if you want" uh, no?? you don't want to hang out, you want a free place to stay and free weed to smoke. this also wasn't the type of friend you could just talk to. everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, would be a post on Facebook with full details. they were always involved in some kinda drama, and you couldn't say anything without being them blasting a million overly personal posts. and everything was always everyone else's fault. I was burnt out, and I decided to block them on 3 different social media's of mine at the time. a few months later, they tried reaching out to me on a social media profile I don't even use anymore. I only found out from email notifications. I blocked them on there. recently, they're trying to reach me through my phone number, which I didn't even know they had. I don't understand why they're being so persistent?? I block them on one thing, and they keep finding me on others. personally, if someone blocked me just ONCE I would leave them alone. it's just been frustrating!. I signed up for pixton in 2010 and used it up to 2016. it was a peak moment in my adolescence. I enjoyed making art with the comic props, and I made a lot of really good friends. that site was also full of drama lmaoit was a huge part of my life, and I remember there being SO many users, but I can never seem to find anyone else who remembers the sites existence!. I have to say this arc really changed my opinion on Reid. I've always liked Spencer, but I never felt emotionally connected to him like I did some of the other characters. but I feel like while he was in prison there was a deeper side of him that wasn't just "I'm smart and socially awkward" and it was really really refreshing to see, both personality and episode wise. but it's made me really like him a lot more tbh also it might just be where I like shows like lock up and 60 days in, but I loooved seeing a continuous plot inside of a prison. it was a nice break from the same episode formula we usually get :). (25f) I have a lot of issues with both chronic pain, and mental health. sometimes I get really overwhelmed, and I'll either shut down, or meltdown. it's really exhausting, and it drains me. I've tried so many different types of meds, both psych and pain. but nothing has helped me like marijuana, it's been a life saver for me. my boyfriend (23) isn't a smoker, he's pretty straight edge other than a drink every now and again. I roll my own joints 99% of the time, but there's times where I'm hurting too badly; or I'm in a really bad spot mentally and can't do anything other than dissociate. when I'm having a day like that, he'll grab my smoke, grind up, and roll a joint for me. he'll say "here, I can tell you're about to have a meltdown. maybe you should smoke, it might make you feel better" or "I'm sorry you're hurting, go sit down and rest, and if you want me to I'll roll one for you to smoke. it'll help with some of your pain hopefully".I've always found it really sweet and wholesome and I appreciate him so much. I'll start. when I wash my hands at home, instead of drying them on a towel, I just grab onto my shirt where my boobs are to dry them cause I think the left over hand print on my tiddies is funny lol. okay, I just finished both parts of the season 12 finale, and I am absolutely blown away and wanna talk about it. I think this has been my favorite finale so far, and the show hasn't kept me that on the edge of my seat since I first started it. especially with the return of Cat Adams, I always thought she was a really fascinating unsub and I feel like I would enjoy watching her character even outside of a Criminal Minds episode. I didn't really care too much about the plot with Lindsay/Carol, but that may be just because I never cared too much for her origin episode. I also couldn't get behind he plotline of her and Cat being lovers; to me, it just seemed so random and out of nowhere. and the joy on Penelope's face when she saw Morgan was absolutely priceless! I loved that little waddle he did when he was talking about his son walking. I was so happy for her that she got to see him again, especially after all of the stress she was going through during the end of Spencer's incarceration. I've got tons of other opinions, like the death of Walker, the crash, etc. but I definitely need to let things sit in my brain for the night lol but I was just excited and wanted to hear what other people thought when they watched it! :). for months I've been obsessed with creating my own ideas for episodes and I've even created two agents to eventually fit into the story line. I feel like I've got seasons worth of material in my head lol I was just curious if anyone else does the same thing!.
    We were doing an activity in my public speaking class where we would read a neutral sentence with a different emotion each time. like "Can you meet me at my office for lunch later." The activity was fine, emphasizing how much your tone and intonation changes your message. But when I was supposed to read something in a hostile or angry tone, I sort of backed off from it. I've struggled with very intense anger issues my entire life, and have only recently gone for a few months without it coming up. My professor seemed to notice that I was more neutral/ambivalent and just made some comments like "I could never imagine you angry anyways." and some others I don't care to repeat because frankly, they were a little hurtful to me, but I don't think they intended them to be. In the moment I thought that maybe I should be happy they felt that I was a safe, stable person but the way they characterized how they thought I'd get angry made me feel so miserable. I'm debating just going home for the day.>>**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.** This PC will mostly be for mid-end pc gaming, ff14, some WoW, league.Doesn't need to be uber powerful, just reliable and built to last. >**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**1k. Hopefully a little less, but yeah. >**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** Very soon, as my current PC is showing signs of breaking completely soon. >**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?A tower, and windows, unless there is an agreed upon better alternative >**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** Currently the microcenter near me is closed, but I am hoping they will reopen (to limited capacity) soon. >**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**I am very unsure as how to gauge whether or not a part from my old PC would be reusable. I would need guidance on this, but there are certain parts, (maybe even the tower included) that could be repurposed. again, would need close guidance with this one as I have 0 experience in it. >**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** Absolutely not interested in overclocking in any way shape or form >**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)** My only requirement would be an SSD. I currently have around 900~gb of storage, so If I could get a similar amount I would be happy. >**What type of network connectivity do you need? (Wired and/or WiFi) If WiFi is needed and you would like to find the fastest match for your wireless router, please list any specifics.** I am using a wifi USB stick, will probably switch to ethernet when I move to campus in the fall >**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?** can be as ugly as sin, as long as it works properly. >**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?** Will most likely need one, but open to suggestions. preferably just windows personal or whatever is cheapest. >**Extra info or particulars:**Above anything I want the pc to be very very stable. It doesn't have to smash 4k games at 120 fps, far from that. I would very much appreciate and be eternally grateful for guidance on how to evaluate whether or not to reuse certain parts, as I am fairly certain it is one major component of my old computer failing.So I'm rank 9. I dont think I belong there but I'm there. every single game I've played today has been some variation of SWF deathsquads or septic tier toxic players. I want to learn, I want to get better, but I can feel the stress manifesting in everything I do. I'm at the point of giving up mid match when I know it's hopeless. and my reward is people tearing me apart for not dancing like a monkey and giving them more points only to spam tbags at the gate.What do you do when a game is hopeless? I'm considering just quitting. Its just not fun at all.So i've personally only been let down by one thing about the rework, that being that the beloved flip is gone. A lot of people share my sentiment on this I think, and I was wondering if we were to hypothetically get it back, do you think voli would need to lose something? obviously we wont know how good he is until we have more data, but from a theory perspective, would having the flip break him?Some people are saying it would be anti synergetic almost with his new E, but I think smart placement of it with q flip could make it even better, almost like singed in a way. I would love to hear your own thoughts!. Today has been pretty rough roulette wise.Ramuh ex, (somehow cleared) and orbonne(2 wipes to ya boy cid)so, I figure trial roulette would be nice and easy, in and out. instant queue, but its 5 minutes in progress. probably chrysalis or something. But of course, its her. 5% echo, so I joined right after a wipe. at this point I had tank stance on because I hadnt toggled it off. queue our friend the paladin, the most bizarre mess of a player I have ever encountered. pld: "We have two tanks?" me(war) "yeah?"at this point I start to realize why the other tank left. I toggle my stance off. pld instantly pulls with a provoke. whatever, they can have mt. I could care less. about half the party takes a vuln from the first stack because the healer wasnt standing in a puddle. Time for adds. slap on stance, pick up pease and realize puck is gunning it for the SCH. wheres the PLD? voking mustardseed, who happens to not follow a standard aggro table. Ok, its normal mode. I'll just take both. I voke puck. After taking both tbs, I realize the PLD is now spamming SHIELD. THROW. on peaseblossom. nothing else. they get aggro right about the time pease is dead. 48 on the meter. time for big adds, though anyone could see this was a wipe honestly. dnc asks the blm to lb, and the blm lbs directly on mustard. whatever, its nm titania. wipe.pld "DAMMIT TANK DO YOUR FUCKING JOB"war "??????"war "you almost let puck murder the SCH"pld "lol"And he pulls again. this time, he vokes pease and starts hitting puck. I shirk him. he dies to double tb, not using a single cd. we make it through big adds, so basically home free. he pops hallowed after standing in the bramble patches. (right after voking the boss of course)was this an elaborate psyop? do people actually play the whole game having 0 awareness of how it works? you decide. Ive decided im taking the penalty when I get titania.I've been enjoying the dlc so far, was very excited to play on the new map for the first time. I noticed as I moved around the map that I seemed to be having connection problems. I shrugged it off and started working on a gen because I had brought a cake, and the killer brought streamers. was ready for a fun, long game. Anyways, the moment I started working on the generator I could tell something was wrong. Animations locked up, progress didn't happen. I hit a few skillchecks despite it just thinking it was heavy lag. after being stuck for about a minute, the entire screen faded to black. stumbling about in the dark for a moment, I tested to see if I was still connected. picking up and putting down my toolbox confirmed that yes, I was still in the game. after rotating my camera in several directions, I noticed that when I moved it a certain way spots of light would appear. after a little trial and error, I popped out back into the game.Sorta?Many apologies to my team who played an amazing game while I was gone. I hope you can forgive me for not being able to find a way back into the map other than the exit gates :(. I am scared that this is reportable/bannable, I want to make it public because I have no idea why or how it happened. thank you for reading, enjoy the album.&#x200B;Imgur album of the experience: [https://imgur.com/a/T8TCZbO](https://imgur.com/a/T8TCZbO). AATN:FFXIV DEVELOPMENT! the commendation system is a joke!i'll try keeping this to a minimum! the commendation system is exactly what i said a joke.im so sick and tired of giving people one because they i felt deserved it yet i get none its total "BULL" the whole commendation system needs a major overhaul because currently it's a one way street if i give one i should receive 1 .you can disagree all you like but fact are facts and before telling me any reason defending it dont bother i been on ffxiv for almost 4 years and guess how many commendations i received vs what i gave i just got 107 so sad ill never get the higher rewards with a crooked system like this when i give i should receive period its a unfair system and it "MUST STOP". Except, it wasn't even in draft pick.(wow)I didn't try to dodge, and I had no idea what to do.When my game was accepted, I couldn't see anything or click on anything.(completely blank)after about the average champ select time, I was kicked back to lobby and given a time penalty.Has anyone else experienced this? this is the first time it's happened, but it's really frustrating and I hope it's not affecting more people.. Recently, I played a conquest on my main account. (level thirty, this was not a low level game.)Everyone chose roles, and we were off. It was three solo players ( me and two others) and two clanmates. I have no qualms against clans, or friend groups. However; when the game started, an unfortunate chain of events caused our Poseidon to die very early. The other solo players, I know realized, were speaking Portuguese. Poseidon began flaming them with racist slurs, and refused to play with them. Bakasura, the other clan mate, simply egged him on and refused to take a stand against the things Poseidon was saying. I simply remained silent, and listened, not wanting to intervene. (I dislike conflict and confrontation.) Eventually, Poseidon died several more times on purpose, and left, Bakasura following suit. In the end, we managed to hold on longer then I expected, but I was left very disturbed. We, as a community, should accept that Smite is worldwide now. Sure; they may have their own servers, but to be blunt, I wouldn't sign up with level-up for jack squat. I want to thank the two players who stuck with me in that game.(match details) http://imgur.com/EZ5AP3kTl;dr Don't be racist, please. You being in a clan with some friends entitles you to nothing.Even if people don't speak your language, it's not hard to detect malicious intent.. Was in a normal conquest; playing scylla, doing fairly well. I was pushing a wave, and was suddenly disconnected.Back in menu, no deserter.It's like the game never existed. I have no record of the game.What happened?.
    Literally at all. I‚Äôve tried everything except alcohol. I have been prescribed sleep meds. AMA about anything to pass time until I can try again!. Between Benjamin Darling‚Äôs Malaga and the √âlan School, Robert isn‚Äôt doing wonders for Maine‚Äôs international rapport. Seems we‚Äôve deserved it though.On my umpteenth rewatch and this line still makes me laugh.Folks here tend to be pretty good with history and sociology - it‚Äôs why we listen. But the Mengele episodes are perhaps the best reminder in the show‚Äôs history of how viscerally real people suffer under the bastards Robert covers.And we also have Matt Lieb‚Äôs soundboard effects, which are important as well.I‚Äôm recently a less talented member of an orchestra. Been a pianist for almost 30 years, practicing extensively on my little island. Right now I‚Äôm sobbing over the music I‚Äôll be performing - both because it‚Äôs so incredibly beautiful and because I know it‚Äôs okay if I suck, because it‚Äôs already been perfectly performed. What songs or artists have brought you to tears?. I‚Äôll try to cite sources when possible but mostly will be pulling from my library. I just returned home from travelling and want to see how many I can remember after a mind-numbingly dull trip.I‚Äôm solid with history mostly, but feel free to give me a challenge!Inspired by a recent comment I left. Fair warning some may be repeated, but it‚Äôs a long list and they‚Äôre worth repeating.I‚Äôll be typing and posting quickly as is my frenetic style, so please excuse any typos or minor correction edits.I build custom typewriters and write books on just about anything. Out here, I have an enormous library and a massive photograph to stare at, but as an extrovert this lifestyle is proving to be a challenge.What are all you fine folks up to? What makes you happy? What do you want to do with your life? What‚Äôs your philosophy? Play any good games lately? Thoughts on Owen Wilson? Remind me what it‚Äôs like to be around human beings.Now he‚Äôs my Czech mate.Like the serial killer. We were acquaintances growing up - she would have been born around the time of Ted Bundy‚Äôs execution. When asked about the name, her parents said it was short for Bundle of Joy.No real winning with that question.>**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**I have a laptop for work so this will be strictly a gaming rig. I plan on playing plenty of Just Cause 3, as well as GTA V, Borderlands, Far Cry, Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, and other similarly intensive games, ideally at max or near max settings.

I've learned to live without HBO or poutine but I'm having some serious Queen Helene withdrawal. I've found it online but nowhere ships from Ireland and the postage is outrageous - we're talking three, four times the cost of the order and it's not an expense I can justify right now.My primary question: Does anyone know of somewhere over here I can get modestly priced green goo goodness? Failing that, what similar masque products have you had luck with? I have very oily skin prone to breakout, with large pores to boot.Thank you guys for your help! I owe two years of clear skin to this sub.We're a mid-size group looking to have a great night on the town without breaking the bank. What's going down tonight in Burlington? Thanks folks!.
    Edit: thank you everyone for the overwhelming support, I understand that she might not share my feelings and I might've lost her, but I had to do it, I had to tell her how much she means to me, it was eating me from the inside that I couldn't be more close to her, couldn't take more care of her. So I've (22m) like my best friend (23f) for the last 6 7 months, and about a month ago I finally confessed. I've known her for the better part of about 2 years now, she's been a constant support all this time, she helped me land my first real job, she listens, and she's the one and only person that I think understands me.I don't tell people much, even my inner circle, but she see's through me. I'm an overly sensitive person, and she's always helped control my emotions.Well there's my ambitious nature too, I've recently transformed into this really ambitious person, I've been making strides in my professional life as well as academic, it feels like I can achieve anything.All my life I've been a coward, this time I wasn't ready to live with the regret to not have told her how I felt, so I told her about a month ago that I have feelings for her, and she ghosted me instantly, I told her I couldn't stay stuck and if she wanted to end it then I'd respect that, still no response, so I decided to end it, when I said goodbye she texted me to shut up and said give me some time.So it's been a month and still nothing, yes I am sad sometimes but I don't know, I feel relieved, I know for a fact that we will talk again but I don't feel anything about it, yes I like her, and I want her to be by my side for the real big events in my life.I miss her, yes, but she needs space, I understand. I don't know what I'm expecting.. So I'll be starting my final year at university in a couple of weeks, and I need to propose a project, my university has some weird rules which basically require me to take on a project based on AI/ML, I am also a web developer at a small company, but I don't know much about AI/Ml. I had some ideas that I proposed to my supervisor like * industry specific chatbot using openAI* protest and event prediction using sentiment analysis* aircraft identification and targeting system (I know this is dumb) My supervisor basically didn't really like the any of my own ideas, but he emailed me a kaggle competition (blunt trauma detection from ct scans). It'd be of huge help if someone could give me some ideas. and fyi out project evaluation committees insist on training your own model..
    My boyfriend was heating up some leftover pasta sauce and he put on some water to boil pasta, but then he couldn't find the pasta. I told him I cooked all pasta we had yesterday but that there was some left over in the freezer. He put that in the microwave but then he had a pot with water left over that was already halfway to boiling, so I asked him to make some tea with it. After a while he held up a box with tea bags that was still unopened, and asked if I wanted that flavour. I said sure, without seeing what flavour it was, only that it wasn't anything we usually had. So then we were having our leftover pasta for lunch with the tea and I commented on the flavour tasting a bit like very weak bouillon. He agreed. After drinking it some more I came to the realisation I actually really disliked this tea and asked him what flavour it was. Then he realized he had already salted the water for making pasta before using it for tea, and we had a good laugh about it! Have you had some accidentally weird food or drink lately?. Hi all, I've been asked by my boss to play a fun piece during an intermal congres of the company I work for. 5-7 minutes. There is a mediocre pianist who could accompany me if needed. Does anyone have any ideas? It would be really appreciated!. General rules or personal opinions appreciated!. Clarification: is there any reason someone that grew up in Europe would use chopsticks while eating noodles for example other than that it seems more authentic?. What are your favorite operas with a modern or a still relevant take away message in them?. Hi all, I'm looking for a study spot near Utrecht Centraal (so not the Uithof), where it is possible to talk quietly with my study partner (so not the University Library). Does anyone know something?. A women came up to me at a train station and asked if I could call someone for her to pick her up or something, with my phone on speaker. I did it, and the number was from my country but they talked in a language I didn't know, so I don't know what they talked about. Can there be bad consequences for me now?. I'm following a five day beginner course on it, and I don't know if I should go through with it, or learn a different language.Who was at the show yesterday in Utrecht? What did you think? I was in the orchestra :).
    There‚Äôs always two kinds of people in these subs: people giving thoughtful, elaborate answers and people writing a five word condescending sentence. Why are you even in an advice sub if all you‚Äôre gonna say is ‚ÄúJust move on‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù? Literally you are not even contributing to the sub in any way. It feels like these people are only joining those subs to be condescending to people asking for help. Asking for help is literally the whole point of these subreddits yet they comment like OP is stupid and should already know what to do/think. Just leave the sub if you‚Äôre gonna be like that ffs.Pisses me off to no end. Especially when they don‚Äôt even ask or even bother being polite and they just write something like ‚Äújoin the meeting asap‚Äù. If my presence was that important you could‚Äôve invited me formally before. I got stuff to do. It just screams ‚Äúmy time is more important than yours‚Äù. I know it can backfire but I usually pretend I‚Äôm afk and ask them to brief me later. I find that most people at the office who need me asap for some kind of emergency are never actually in an emergency and could manage without me but it‚Äôs much easier to get someone to hold their hand and do it for them. Annoys me to no end.That‚Äôs it really. I‚Äôm a 26 years old girl, I have friends, I get along with my coworkers and with my classmates, my dad came back into my life and has been very present and supportive. Yet I feel so incredibly lonely. I live alone with my two cats, I go shopping alone, I go to coffee shops alone. I go on dates but they‚Äôre never conclusive. I feel so empty inside. I‚Äôm on antidepressants and seeing a psychologist regularly and although I don‚Äôt feel like dying anymore I just feel numb. I daydream about companionship all the time, I‚Äôm craving a connection with someone so bad but it feels like the other people around me live in another dimension. I have a government job, multiple degrees, I invest in real estate but I still feel like I‚Äôm not living life at all. Everything is so dull. I don‚Äôt wanna die but I wouldn‚Äôt care if I died tomorrow. I‚Äôm probably gonna go on a walk alone when I leave this coffee shop. I keep buying cigarettes even tho they taste like shit and make me sick because they comfort me in a weird way.Funnily enough this only happens in relationship subs, which I know are the worst but sometimes I really just use them to vent. Sometimes I‚Äôll talk about a crush I have or a guy I‚Äôm seeing and it‚Äôs absolutely wild that some people will literally diagnose me with a personality disorder just for having emotions. This random person messaged me after I made a post about how I drunk texted my ex and they were like ‚Äújudging by your post history you talk about this guy a lot and you have OCD so I think you may have obsessive love disorder‚Äù. Yeah dude, talking/thinking about someone you like often is called having a crush. Jesus fucking Christ. I looked up this supposed obsessive love disorder and not only is it not officially recognized but it also involves uncontrollable obsessive thoughts, intense jealousy and a desire to control the other person. How the hell did you gather all that from me texting an ex? What the hell did you look at my post history for?I do actually have OCD and when random strangers tell me I may have some disorder I start to look it up compulsively and get really anxious thinking I might have it. I wish people would fucking stop. I‚Äôm seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and you would think they‚Äôre a lot more knowledgeable than the folks on here who are quick at telling everyone they‚Äôre crazy in one way or another.I quit weed almost 5 months ago and I‚Äôm really proud of myself. I was a heavy smoker for 6 years and I had gotten such a high tolerance it hardly did anything to me anymore so I started getting into heavier drugs and decided to quit right away cause I didn‚Äôt wanna go there. Being sober is great, I feel rested and focused and I finally have dreams after years of smoking every night. I do miss it sometimes but I do not miss the sleepiness and brain fog. I never thought I would make it that far without smoking, I don‚Äôt plan on smoking ever again because I know I have no self control when it comes to drugs. Right now I‚Äôm just focusing on work and uni and I‚Äôm enjoying all the extra money I save now that I‚Äôm sober. :). Title pretty much says it all. I'm flabbergasted. I met this guy a few months ago and we really clicked and we were both looking for something serious so I thought after a few months of dating we would officially be in a relationship but he just texted me to tell me he met another girl over the weekend (1-2 days ago) and he ‚Äúwanted to see where it would go‚Äù and just wanted to be friends with me. Is it just me or is that fucked up? I mean I appreciate the honesty but how do you dump someone you've been dating for months for someone you just met literally 48 hours ago? I don't know how to react. I just feel shocked and sad. I was just starting to develop feelings for him.A few years ago I went to visit my friend in the US and we went to Chick-fil-a. I asked for a small pepsi with my food and they gave me a huge cup, I wanted to go back thinking they had given me a large by mistake but my friend said it was indeed a small sized drink. It was larger than the large drinks we have in my country. I was dumbfounded. I can‚Äôt even imagine what an actual large drink looks like. Why are the cups so freaking big?. I have OCD so I decided it would be a good idea to join the sub. I understand ocd is hard to control and some phobias can feel silly but hearing about everyone‚Äôs phobias and obsessions is driving me crazy. ‚ÄúScared I got chlamydia from walking past someone outside‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I a terrible person if I wear the same shirt twice‚Äù ‚ÄúI have debilitating ocd but I don‚Äôt wanna see a doctor because I‚Äôm scared antidepressants have LSD in them‚ÄùAgain I have ocd myself so I understand people have absolutely no control over their phobias but almost everyone there just wants to get reassurance from strangers without ever seeking treatment from an actual health professional. I know I‚Äôll probably get dragged for this but whatever. I do empathize with them but I‚Äôm tired of watching people dig themselves into a deeper hole without actually treating their illness.Let me start off by saying that I absolutely did not do this through hustling and ditching avocado toast or whatever. My first major investment in life was in my education and I was lucky enough to get a job that pays well and to find an apartment that‚Äôs pretty cheap. I saved up just enough for a down payment and my dad is paying a third of the price of the building, I borrowed the rest from the bank. It‚Äôs just a small building on the countryside with 2 tenants; basically the goal is to rent it out and get my credit score up so that I can get a better loan for an actual house for myself in the future. The housing market in Canada is absolutely insane so it‚Äôs a solution my dad and I came up with so I don‚Äôt have to get married to a business tycoon just in order to have my own home. The whole process is kinda scary but I‚Äôm proud of myself for going through with it. I‚Äôm officially a landlady now I guess lol.I‚Äôm sitting at a fancy cafe in downtown Quebec City, imagine a nice place with wooden tables, plants hanging everywhere, dim lighting and jazz music playing. This really loud girl comes in and walks up to the barista and I overheard the whole thingBarista: HelloGirl: you guys got iced coffee?Barista: yesGirl: what flavor?Barista: well we‚Äôve got iced lattes‚Ä¶Girl: no I want an iced coffeeBarista: ‚Ä¶Girl: what flavors do you have?Barista: coffee flavorGirl: cause I work at McDonald‚Äôs and we got a bunch of different flavors thereBarista: well I can just put sugar and maple syrup in itGirl: ok greatBarista: /makes coffee and hands it to her/Girl: this is really good what did you put in it?Barista: a lot of sugarThen the girl says thanks and walks out. Idk why I found the whole interaction really funny.I‚Äôve been taking Zoloft for over a year now for my ocd, but I had to stop for two months and just started taking it again a month ago. I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has these side effects but I‚Äôm sweating so much all the time it‚Äôs ridiculous. I can literally feel the sweat dripping down my face and arms and just everywhere, it‚Äôs awful, I‚Äôm constantly drenched even tho it‚Äôs not even hot outside. To top it all off I also have been so bloated and farting constantly like some kind of swamp creature. My farts smell so freaking disgusting you guys. My room smells like a rotten egg sandwich. I‚Äôm sorry for the details but I just wanna know that I‚Äôm not alone in this, I feel so dirty because of the godawful smell. Damn you Zoloft.Literally wtf. I‚Äôm not French actually I never set foot in Europe in my life but French is my first language. Anyway I saw a post on instagram about how DocMartens were outdated and I commented (in English) but because my username is French, this girl started telling me my opinion didn‚Äôt matter cause I speak French and ‚Äúno one cares what French speakers have to say‚Äù. She was very serious too, she wouldn‚Äôt let it go so I had to block her. I get that some people don‚Äôt like France and French people but it‚Äôs like they completely forget France had colonies too, judging French speakers around the world because they have some kind of distant historical affiliation with France is just plain stupid.It's actually a really funny story, I had meetings all morning plus one this afternoon and there were about 5 of us in it, one of them being my boss. The meeting starts and after a few minutes I say something and out of the blue everyone starts laughing. I didn't say anything funny tho so I'm just ignoring them and I continue talking and all of a sudden my coworker goes ‚Äúwhat the hell?‚Äù and everyone is laughing even harder. So I start asking ‚Äúwhat's going on?‚Äù and at that point my boss is laughing so hard she's crying, everyone is just laughing their asses off every time I talk for some reason and I'm like, wtf. At one point one of my coworkers manages to stop laughing to tell me that something's wrong and I should quit the meeting and come back.So I do that, I close Teams and then come back to the meeting and everyone is still laughing uncontrollably. So I ask again what happened and apparently, my mic was acting up and there was so much distortion that I sounded like a chipmunk. Apparently every time I talked I sounded like I had just inhaled a shit load of helium. They all couldn't stop laughing and it honestly made my day lmao, first time this ever happened to me and I'm kinda sad I didn't get to hear it myself. Check your microphones yall.I‚Äôll start. I cut off my mother after she supposedly disowned me only to keep messaging me randomly every few months to complain about her life. She‚Äôs very narcissistic and she‚Äôs also bipolar and believes she was chosen by God to save humanity or whatever. Recently I realized she never cared about me or ever wanted to know what I was up to, all she ever cared about was what I brought to her life and how I made her look. My life has been so completely stress free since I stopped talking to her, I don‚Äôt think I ever will again.Pretty anxious about this so I would like some advice. I absolutely do not like my current field so I decided to go back to school part time to finish my master's degree, so basically I'll continue working full time while taking one or two classes per semester. The only problem is that due to my terms of employment, I have to work 35 hours a week anywhere from 6:30am to 6pm so my hours are pretty much up to me, but I'm scared that if I take 2 classes I won't be able to do all my work hours for the week. On top of all this I have to do a mandatory unpaid internship in order to graduate and I know I won't be able to keep my job if I have to do this internship as my boss won't let me work part time.So all of this is making me wonder if I should just quit my job and take student loans instead of the whole hassle of having to both study and negotiate my work hours with my boss. It's causing me a lot of stress and I'm not sure what to do. I dropped out last semester for that reason but I'm at a point where I just don't like my job and I don't want it to get in the way of me studying a subject I actually like. I was even considering quitting and taking a part time job somewhere, even if I get paid a lot less I might be able to focus on my degree. I'm really not sure what to do.It happened a while ago but I still think about it sometimes. A couple months ago I was seeing this guy and things went really really fast. It all happened in the span of 2-3 weeks. We would spend everyday together and he would share a lot of personal things with me, mostly related to his trauma. He had had a difficult life and would talk about it a lot and I felt very compassionate so I was always willing to listen. The thing is, he never seemed to be curious about my life and when I talked about myself he would immediately bring the topic back to him. He was a sweet guy but he was struggling a lot emotionally and would cry in front of me often in the span of those few weeks.At one point we had a fight because I was growing attached to him after spending everyday together and he found it weird that I liked him and called me ‚Äútoo intense‚Äù and blocked me. All I did was like him really, it's not like I told him I loved him and wanted to marry him, he just figured out that I was starting to have feelings for him and found it to be too much.To this day it still makes me sad that he called me too intense when he was the one trauma dumping and sharing everything with me, everyday. He was the one always reaching out to see me too, we met through tinder and he wanted to see me the same day we matched even tho we had only been talking for like 30 minutes. I know I can be intense emotionally in the sense that I care about people and I'm comfortable sharing how I feel, but I never thought of myself as ‚Äútoo intense‚Äù. I talked about it with my friend and she said he was probably projecting considering the fact that he was the one who had shared all his trauma with me the second we met. He also would do this thing where he would text me all the time, compliment me a lot and make me feel special then the next day he'd completely ignore me or straight up insult me.I'm still not sure what to make of it honestly. Things had never gone that fast with a guy before so it's not a usual thing for me to throw myself at someone but I grew to like him after spending so much time with him in such a short span and then he made me feel bad for it. Do you think it's a bad thing to be ‚Äúintense‚Äù? Have you ever had someone call you that? It kinda hurts and it's still stuck in my mind.tl;dr Guy I was seeing trauma dumped from the second we met and called me ‚Äútoo intense‚Äù for liking him. A little background info. A couple years ago I finished my bachelor's degree and did a certification in archive management in order to be accepted for a master's in museology. I started by master's but had to quit because I got a new job in archive management that didn't let me work part time.Long story short, I realized I didn't like archive management (it's not what I wanted to do to begin with, I just had to get my certification for my master's) and I don't like my job very much. Because of this, I decided to finish my master's and my boss has agreed to let me take classes as long as I make up for the missed work with overtime. Not a problem for me.The only problem is that in order to graduate, I have to do a mandatory unpaid internship. The internship wouldn't be until next summer. At best I would lose one day of work, at worst I would lose five, it's hard to tell right now since I haven't properly started planning for it yet. The thing is I know that my boss wouldn't let me take a leave of absence for my internship and wouldn't let me take a few days off for it either.I have a bit of money saved up for a house but if push comes to shove, I'm thinking I might have to use it for my internship if I'm not able to work at the same time. I absolutely have to do this internship if I wanna get my degree. Do you think it's a risk worth taking to quit my full time, permanent government job for an internship where there's no guarantee I'll be hired afterwards? It sounds like a leap of faith to me but I'm not sure what else to do.I recently went back to school to finish my master's degree and in order to graduate, I have to do an internship which would take up about 18h a week. It's a mandatory internship, meaning I have to do it if I want to get my diploma.The thing is, I already have a full time permanent job and I'm not sure how I can convince my boss to let me take two days off during the week to go do my internship. Have any of you been in similar situations? I'm worried I'll have to quit my job altogether just to do this internship. I emailed my school to know if I could do the internship on nights/weekends but I'm still waiting for a response and I think it might be pretty unlikely. If any of you have ever been in similar situations I'd really like to hear how it turned out for you at work. Thanks!. I have a full time government job right now that didn‚Äôt let me work part time so I had to quit my masters degree last winter. After having been at my job for almost a year I realized that not only did I not like it, but every job in my current field is gonna be exactly the same and it was really dragging me down.I made a pretty serious decision today and decided to go back, I signed up for one class (the most I can do in my current situation) and decided to talk to my boss about possibly working part time in the future. Considering everyone in our team quit and there‚Äôs only two of us left, I‚Äôm hoping she‚Äôll be open to considering it. For those of you who have gone back to school with a full time job, how did it work out for you? This program is really the one thing I wanna do with my life and I realized I can‚Äôt keep on being unhappy just for the sake of a paycheck. I feel nervous but excited about the future, I‚Äôm just hoping I won‚Äôt have to quit my job because of it.A couple years ago I had really bad self esteem and did some stupid things. I came from a place of neglect and abuse and I was seeking affection so badly that I would humiliate myself and belittle myself in front of others, whether knowingly or subconsciously.One example I can give is a few years ago, I was seeing a guy I really really liked, it had lasted a few months and it was supposed to be casual but I was way more into him than I should have been. He was a foreign exchange student and on the last day that I saw him, he was supposed to move back to France within the next few days. I had a key to his apartment and when I slept over that night he just told me I could leave whenever I woke up as he had to go to work early in the morning. I ended up staying in his bed literally all day until he came home from work so I would have one last chance to see him before he left forever. It was really desperate on my part and I still have a hard time forgiving myself over it.Another example I have is a few months ago I started dating this guy and was really into him and it didn't work out, we had a fight over something stupid and he blocked me everywhere and I was left with no closure. I was really upset and needed to express my feelings about it and since I'm a musician I decided to write songs about my feelings. After a few months, I became sorta friends with him again and told him about the songs and he never listened to them, he didn't even seem to give a shit, I felt so freaking dumb having written them I almost deleted them from Spotify.Basically I feel really bad about how desperate I was and how I humiliated myself to make people like me. I feel really stupid and ashamed. I never really hurt those people in the process but I hurt myself. I'm seeing a psychologist currently who's helping me sort out my thoughts and feelings but I haven't told him everything cause I feel too much shame around it. Do you have any advice on how to learn from these experiences and forgive myself? It seems like all I do is ruminate and feel ashamed. I honestly wish I could just move on and stop humiliating myself in the future. I just wanna stop coming off as the weird desperate girl who keeps crawling back begging people to like me.I used to like my job but my sentiment towards it has soured in the past few weeks. I work for our local government on a billion dollar project and everything is fast paced and chaotic, everyone is busy and stressed out and it‚Äôs starting to get to me. I write procedures that no one reads and my work heavily depends on people handling their documentation properly, which they don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve had coworkers in other departments straight up telling me they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt be bothered‚Äù with doing their part, which means my workload is tripling. All I do is answer emails and enter metadata and answer calls from people asking me things they would know if they read the procedures. My boss is assigning tasks to me and only me (two thirds of our team quit since I started so I‚Äôm pretty much the only person who can do those tasks) and they seem so useless and insignificant to me. I feel uninterested in everything and I cannot for the hell of me bring myself to focus during meetings. Last week I broke down into tears at my cubicle. When my coworkers talk to me I get so unreasonably angry (I don‚Äôt show it or tell them cause they did nothing wrong, I‚Äôm just incredibly irritated for no reason). Every time I get a new email I literally feel like screaming. I‚Äôm so exhausted at work and after work that all I can really do is work then sleep immediately after, I‚Äôll take a nap at 4 if I have to. My life is basically just work cause I‚Äôm too exhausted to do anything else. I‚Äôm not sure what to do or if I should tell my boss, I know I‚Äôve been procrastinating and slacking off and it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm lazy I‚Äôm just literally drained both physically and mentally.I know the obvious answer is ‚Äúmake new friends‚Äù but it‚Äôs much easier said than done especially when I‚Äôm approaching my 30s and work remotely‚Ä¶ I have friends who I used to hang out with every week but lately they just seem bored with me. Every time I wanna make plans with them they turn me down and go out with other people. Now they can have their own friends of course but it kind of sucks cause I feel like I‚Äôm chasing after them to make plans. I quit drugs recently and I‚Äôm recovering from addiction, on top of not being a heavy drinker (when I go out with them I usually have a drink or two then get home by midnight) but my friends like to party a lot and I fear this is why they‚Äôve stopped talking to me. They don‚Äôt just shut down my plans, they just don‚Äôt talk to me altogether, the texts have stopped and our group conversation is basically just me talking to myself with the occasional ‚ÄúSorry I already have plans‚Äù from them. Is there any way to make friends outside of work/school? I finished school and as I said I mostly work remotely and all my coworkers are much older than me. Any advice is welcomed, thanks. Not sure if the title makes sense but for example, ever since I was a kid I associated the number 2 with the color yellow or 8 with green, stuff like that. When I was younger I also thought the alphabet had a ‚Äúsmell‚Äù, I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it. I feel like there‚Äôs probably a word for it in psychology but I‚Äôm not sure.Basically every post goes along the lines of ‚Äúim 15 and my life is going nowhere‚Äù or ‚Äúi hate myself im ugly im a virgin im ruining my life im addicted to masturbating also im 350lbs don‚Äôt work out have acne what can i do‚Äù or ‚Äúim a 17 year old male who just started nofap how can i stop watching porn and get women‚ÄùMost of the posts aren‚Äôt even about self improvement they‚Äôre mostly just a pity party from people seeking reassurance. I feel sorry for all the very young people feeling like failures but that sub is basically turning into r/ vent but for horny teenagers. Had to unsub cause if I read the word nofap one more time I‚Äôm going to lose it.I had a previous account with 45k karma that I deleted a while back cause I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I decided to come back casually to kill time but even that isn‚Äôt working. A vast majority of redditors are just really mean and assume the worst in people. 99% of the time when you make a post asking for advice or reassurance people will do everything in their power to make you feel worse. They‚Äôll twist your words and only understand what they want to understand, and 100% of the time it‚Äôs something that puts you under a bad light and that makes them look like a saint. It‚Äôs like you can never be a human being in their eyes, everything you do is a mistake and you‚Äôre always a piece of shit no matter what. Even when I spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to word things accurately in order to be clearly understood there‚Äôs always someone who‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúSo basically you did [something I never said I did] and expected [something I never said] and now you complain (I‚Äôm not complaining), you‚Äôre an asshole and you should [unsolicited advice that makes it sound like I‚Äôm a clueless little goblin]‚Äù.I made a post about how I broke down into tears at work after I was recovering from a drug relapse and an argument with a friend and someone commented something that made me feel like absolute garbage. How in the fuck do you read a post about someone crying and struggling and the first thing you do is patronize and criticize them? How does their brain even get there?Most people here make the Reddit experience miserable and I wish they would collectively find happiness so that other people could live without the constant bullying. I feel bad for the young people here cause it‚Äôs basically the perfect place for cyberbullying.This sub is a good place to ask questions about OCD and tips for recovery but I see a lot of posts from people explaining their obsessions and fake memories in detail and trying to get people to tell them if those memories/obsessions could be real and what it means for them.Seeking reassurance is a compulsion that people with OCD should absolutely not engage in, it‚Äôll bring some momentary relief only to make the doubt and anxiety even worse in the long run. OCD is all about tolerating doubt and reassurance seeking is done to eliminate the doubt, which is very detrimental to people with OCD. Please just keep in mind this isn‚Äôt a place for reassurance seeking and detailed descriptions of your obsessions and fears can be triggering for a lot of people here. Just wanted to vent a little because the amount of posts like this makes me wanna leave this sub sometimes and I wish this would be a safe space for everyone with OCD.Decided to use again after two months just to see if it would trigger my addiction. Stupid I know, it‚Äôs like I just wanted to test myself. I regretted it instantly and now I feel like complete garbage, I don‚Äôt think I can set foot in a na meeting ever again. The fact that I have to start all over again after two months clean makes me feel ashamed and really depressed. I absolutely don‚Äôt wanna use again and that slip up just confirmed that but I don‚Äôt think I have it in me to restart the whole recovery process and set my counter back to zero. I was really proud of making it to two months and I ruined it.My OCD leans more towards obsessions than actual compulsions, although I do tend to ruminate a lot. I noticed that I obsess about people quite often, more than a normal person would. It‚Äôs gotten pretty out of hand. I briefly dated a guy back in March and I still think about him everyday, I‚Äôm literally embarrassed by it, it‚Äôs like I have no control over my thoughts whatsoever. I feel crazy because of it. I talk about him to my psychologist almost every week and I cry every single time. I get that it‚Äôs normal to be sad over certain situations but surely thinking about someone every single day for months when you dated them for a few weeks is not normal behavior. I keep reliving the memories I have with him and I‚Äôm trying really hard not to as it just makes me feel worse but it‚Äôs difficult. This also happened a few years ago when I dated a guy for a few months and it didn‚Äôt work out, I literally thought about him everyday for over a year, even when I got in a serious relationship with someone else I was still thinking about him. My brain is just out of control. I just know it‚Äôs my OCD because when I‚Äôm not obsessing about people, I‚Äôm obsessing about distressing concepts like harm OCD and whatnot. My brain just switches to either one or the other. If you have any advice please help me, I‚Äôm at my wits end.I know it's none of my business but I can't help getting annoyed when I look at my friends' spending habits. They're all in their late 20s and either work minimum wage jobs or have no jobs at all and I see them spend their money everyday on dumb things. One of my friends, Erica (fake name) earns minimum wage and rents a huge apartment where she lives alone and that she can't afford and she always complains about it even tho she's spending money on fancy decorations, fancy drinks and on ordering clothes online. She's not as bad as my other friend tho, let's call her Ashley, who's literally unemployed at the moment and confessed to me that she emptied out everything she had in her savings account all the while posting ig stories of herself in clubs and bars *every* single day. She's almost 30 and she never learned how to cook so all her money goes into takeout as well. It's like my friends will just complain to me about not having money while ordering espresso martinis and wearing $300 worth of clothes.I guess what annoys me the most in all this is that both of them have a support system and can rely on their parents financially so they don't really worry about going bankrupt. I don't really have a family myself (mom is bipolar and disowned me and my dad is just not in the picture), so I was always really anxious about money since I was a teenager and learned to save as much as I could. It doesn't mean I won't go out for drinks or order takeout once in a while but I won't empty my savings for it. I love my friends, they're great people but I'm annoyed at the way they live their life like they're still 17 and like mom and dad will come to their rescue if they blow all their money and can't afford rent, like it's a ‚Äúwhoopsie‚Äù situation and not a ‚ÄúI'm almost 30 and don't know how to plan my own finances‚Äù situation.Honestly the real reason I'm annoyed is because it feels like we come from two different worlds. I had to put myself in university out of my own pocket and went through a great deal of anxiety so I could graduate and secure a good job since I have nothing else going for me, I even had to starve myself for a while since even before disowning me my mother never gave me a single cent (in fact it was her who owed me money), meanwhile my friends barely made it out of college despite having an entire support system to help them and they spend recklessly like there's no tomorrow. It's not even that they're rich either, they're mostly middle class but their attitude around money gets on my nerves. Just wanted to vent I guess.I noticed it especially with Soundcloud rappers, one good example would be Brennan Savage's song ‚ÄúDemolition‚Äù where he reused the guitar from My Chemical Romance's ‚ÄúDemolition Lovers‚Äù. Even the song title is basically the same. Most of these music producers/rappers aren't super famous so unless they're already wealthy I doubt they can just buy the rights to these other really famous songs. So how does it work?. I graduated uni a while ago and got a permanent government job that pays well. I‚Äôm a records technician so my job is to classify people‚Äôs documents, fill out metadata, etc. The job has advantages and pays well but I really can‚Äôt bring myself to care about it. I do everything I can to help my coworkers and do all the stuff I‚Äôm asked to do by my supervisor but she expects me to go above and beyond and to give myself work by finding things to do and I really can‚Äôt bring myself to give a shit. Most of that ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù stuff involves making PowerPoints and writing procedures that no one is ever going to read so I feel like it‚Äôs mostly a waste of time. My supervisor is new and she‚Äôs very nice but she‚Äôs really project driven as opposed to my old supervisor so she‚Äôs giving us work and deadlines and I cannot for the hell of me bring myself to do more than the acceptable minimum. I studied archive management to begin with and I‚Äôm really much more passionate about historical documents, I really can‚Äôt bring myself to care about excel sheets and word documents. I‚Äôm looking at job offers everyday for archivists but there isn‚Äôt really that many openings so I‚Äôm stuck being a technician for online documents which I hate. Most of the time when I‚Äôm working remotely I‚Äôm just working on personal projects unless I have meetings or specific tasks to do. I feel some guilt about it but I physically can‚Äôt find the strength to make a PowerPoint or whatever just for the sake of doing something work related when it‚Äôll be useful to absolutely no one. On top of all this, everyone dresses very formally and the environment is very bureaucratic and I honestly feel like I don‚Äôt fit in. If you have any advice on how to feel more involved in my work I would really appreciate it.For context, I‚Äôm a music producer and a while ago a famous producer followed me and asked to do a collab with me. I was super excited about it but then nothing came out of it and he stopped responding to my messages, although he‚Äôd reply to my stories from time to time. I thought we were on friendly terms since we‚Äôd sometimes joke around and stuff but then today I saw that he unfollowed me for some reason. I feel pretty bummed out, he‚Äôs an artist I look up to so I kinda feel like shit about it. I‚Äôm not sure what prompted it and I kinda wanna ask him but I know it‚Äôll make me sound desperate so it‚Äôs probably not the way to go, but I‚Äôm just really wondering. How do I stop caring when stuff like this happens? Social media is so dumb I feel like it makes people worry about the stupidest stuff, but it just sucks when someone you look up to who has almost half a million subscribers on Spotify just drops you out of the blue. Just a few weeks ago he‚Äôd send me selfies and joke around with me so it‚Äôs all really strange to me and it kinda hurts not gonna lie.I have a friend I met a few months ago who‚Äôs really nice and outgoing. The thing tho is that she‚Äôs literally friends with everyone. I mean, everywhere we go, she knows someone working there, she knows random people on the street, she‚Äôs basically friends with the entire city. Good for her honestly but it makes me wonder if I‚Äôm even actually a real friend to her or if I‚Äôm just a part of her collection. Every single time, and I mean every single time she hangs out with someone she makes an instagram story about it, it‚Äôs like she can‚Äôt hang out with anyone without taking a selfie to prove the world she has friends. It honestly makes me feel like she doesn‚Äôt even care about me specifically unless she can put me in a post. Sometimes I feel like shit cause I don‚Äôt have that many friends and when I try to hang out with her she never can cause she‚Äôs always hanging out with someone else. Then when I do see her it‚Äôs because our mutual friend agreed to see me and she tagged along and she‚Äôll go ‚Äúomg Nervous Citrus long time no see I missed yooouuuu‚Äù as if I haven‚Äôt been trying to hang out with her for ages. Anyway when I met her she had just started dating this guy, let‚Äôs call him Tom. Tom was super cool and a really funny dude and he was a very genuine person, he told me many times that he really appreciated me as a friend and that he believed in my dreams (which is really sweet considering we weren‚Äôt that close and my own friend never said that to me). My friend would drag him basically everywhere so Tom was just a part of our friend group, they were very into each other so they spent everyday together. So I went on vacation for a few days and when I got back I learned my friend had broken up with Tom, when I messaged her about it she didn‚Äôt reply so I messaged Tom instead and he told me she‚Äôd broken up with him by text and he was really hurt and stuff. Later on when I managed to talk to my friend I asked how she felt about the breakup and she was basically like ‚Äúgreat honestly I don‚Äôt really care haha‚Äù. I feel so freaking bad for Tom cause I feel like she just used him to fill up a void since now she‚Äôs back to posting stories with every living person in our city now. I know I should be happy that she has many friends and boyfriends and whatnot but it feels like codependency and it makes me wonder about our friendship. You cannot genuinely be friends with that many people without a certain level of superficiality. I‚Äôm just wondering where I stand in all this and I‚Äôm not ok with her using people like Tom just to fill a void and drop them by text when it‚Äôs not convenient anymore. I know the obvious answer would be to stop being friends with her but I have literally no one in my life so it‚Äôs not that easy for me.Here‚Äôs my situation, I live in Canada but I‚Äôll try to give the amounts in USD. I‚Äôm 26 and I have a permanent job for the govt and make about $20/h ($2800 a month and around $33.6k yearly). My rent is $440 a month and my other bills add up to about $140 a month. I don‚Äôt have a car and use public transit. I have about $7.5k left to pay in student debt but have no other debt otherwise. I managed to save $20k for a future house and I put money into my savings every month. Thing is, I feel like I‚Äôm well off but my dad is kinda into hoarding and extreme saving and he basically guilt trips me into putting every cent I have into a future house. He says his goal is to make me a millionaire by 40 and I know he means well but it‚Äôs giving me a lot of anxiety about spending. My apartment is small and shitty (the rent is cheap so yeah) and I wanna improve it by decorating it but I get really anxious just thinking about spending money on things I don‚Äôt need. Just the other day I bought a new backpack cause mine was getting old and had holes everywhere and I still feel really bad about it. Everything I buy is always discounted, I never buy anything full price and don‚Äôt go to hairdressers or nail salons like my friends, the only things I really put money on are my tattoos and piercings because I‚Äôve wanted them since I was a kid and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll just get rid of them, so even if it‚Äôs superficial to me it‚Äôs still an investment in a way. Anyway I wanna go shopping later to improve my apartment since it‚Äôs ugly and making me depressed but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a good idea. Do you think it‚Äôs ok to spend money on superficial things if you could save for your future instead? I‚Äôm really debating it a lot and I‚Äôm not sure.For context, I‚Äôve been diagnosed with OCD and depression last year and I‚Äôve been off my medication for the past month due to my prescription being expired (I‚Äôm waiting to see my psychiatrist to have it renewed). Back when I was on my meds I was sleepy a lot because of them and now that I‚Äôm not on meds anymore, my OCD and depression symptoms have come back and I just feel extremely tired all the time. I don‚Äôt do drugs or drink alcohol and I always get a full night‚Äôs sleep, I usually go to bed around 10 and wake up at 8. Despite sleeping at night I always have to nap at least twice a day for 2-4 hours just because I feel super tired and have no energy to do anything. Just going out for a walk or for coffee exhausts me and I have to nap when I get home. It‚Äôs super annoying because I feel like I‚Äôm wasting all my time sleeping. I know the logical answer would be to exercise and whatnot but it‚Äôs easier said than done when you feel depressed. I spend most of my time bored and alone at home and my friends always bail on me when I wanna do stuff, so if I wanna go out I have to do it by myself and just the thought of it depresses me. I guess what I‚Äôm asking is, should I fight off the sleepiness and try to stay awake even if that means doing nothing due to being tired? I‚Äôm sick of sleeping all the time, I feel like days just fly by because I‚Äôm literally always sleeping and I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.I dated a guy briefly a couple months ago and fell for him hard. He had failed to mention at the time that he was looking for a fwb so I asked to just be friends so I wouldn‚Äôt get hurt and after that when we would hang out he was cold and distant and started accusing me of stupid things. We had a big fight and he blocked me everywhere just because I liked him basically. He unblocked me a few months ago and I reached out to him again. He‚Äôs severely depressed and has a rough life and all those months we weren‚Äôt talking I was worried about him even tho he hurt my feelings, it‚Äôs just the kind of person I am. We have kinda been talking since then but he‚Äôll ghost me when we make plans and then he‚Äôll say ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm too depressed to see anyone rn it‚Äôs nothing personal‚Äù just to post stories on ig of him hanging out with his friends in the same day. We are both musicians and he knows I made a song about him after our falling out and he told me he was flattered and he would listen to it, then weeks passed and I asked him if he ended up listening to it and he left me on read for four days. I think about him all the time and I feel sad and anxious. My friends tell me I deserve better and that I should block him but I just don‚Äôt have it in me. We just recently reconnected and he hasn‚Äôt done anything warranting a block but I feel like the more I tell him I‚Äôm there for him and care about him, the more he takes me for granted. I go to sleep every night thinking about him and wake up everyday hoping he texted me back (he never does) and I keep looking at my own stories on ig to see if he saw them and it‚Äôs driving me crazy. I wish I could just get him out of my head without blocking cause it feels brutal like he did something wrong but I don‚Äôt know how else to move on. There‚Äôs also a part of me that‚Äôs scared of pushing him away forever because I always hope he‚Äôll come back around. He said he‚Äôd text me when he‚Äôd feel good enough to hang out but I know he never will, clearly he feels well enough to hang out with other people. Do you think it‚Äôs a good idea to block?.

Before you ask, I wasn't drunk and I'm pretty sure it was low blood pressure, but it was terrifying none the less.My friends and I went to a bar to see a standup comedy show. I got there feeling great, even ordered myself a drink (which never left my hand so I know no one slipped me anything). Then the show started and within five minutes I started to get really dizzy, hot flashes, I could feel myself going pale, etc. I thought I was gonna puke so I told my friends I was gonna use the bathroom.That's when it gets really confusing for me. I got in a stall feeling atrociously dizzy, I sat down on the toilet thinking I might as well pee while I'm there, then I did my thing and got off the toilet and everything just went blank. Next thing I knew I could hear a girl say ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù and when I opened my eyes, I was on the bathroom floor. I had no memory of even falling down or closing my eyes, all of a sudden I was just slumped in front of the toilet. The girl asked me to come out, checked if I was ok then went to get security and I passed out a second time while she did. I woke up again to security shaking me up and telling me I needed to go sit down. They escorted me out, gave me a bottle of water and gum for my blood sugar and made sure I was ok. The girl who found me said I had fallen pretty hard and she was worried I might be concussed. I just have a headache this morning tho so thank god for that.I'm used to low blood pressure and feeling faint because of some health issues I already have but it was my first time full on passing out in a public bathroom. In fact the only time I can remember passing out in my life before was when I was really hungover and sick a couple years back and just passed out in my own bathroom. At least back then I had a reason (alcohol), but last night I really didn't drink much and was just feeling tipsy, nowhere near drunk at all.It was a really scary and humiliating experience for me, especially since the bar staff and my friends were super worried and I had to call another friend to take me home (I usually walk home but I couldn't for obvious reasons). Now I have some random bruises, a headache and slightly bent glasses after I apparently fell face first into the floor. I woke up and told my sister about what had happened and she made fun of me and called me a drunk, which isn't helping at all.Do you guys have any passing out stories or just stories about a time where you felt scared/humiliated in public? It would really help, I honestly feel ashamed of what happened even tho it's not my fault, I know. Hearing some anecdotes would make me feel better.Sounds like a dumb question but hear me out. Also English isn't my first language so I apologize for any mistakes.I started working for the government a few years ago but I applied for a specific government project in January and was hired. It's a huge project and I'm responsible for its website where my coworkers and I upload our work, I get a lot of requests from people regarding website settings and whatnot and that's actually the fun part of my job so I don't mind.The less fun part is that my supervisor is so incompetent and the communication is so bad that I'm left crying out of frustration most days and sometimes I'll even take the afternoon off or something because I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown. My supervisor is the leader of our group of three people which is responsible for alllll the documentation shared and produced by the 300+ people working on the project. Out of the three, I'm the only one who operates our website. My supervisor seems to think that everything that I do happens in the snap of a finger and she has this extremely annoying tendency to delegate everything she doesn't ‚Äúhave time to do‚Äù because she's ‚Äúso busy‚Äù. Which, you know, she's a supervisor so I understand she has more responsibilities than I do, but lately she's just been treating me like her personal assistant: ‚Äúcan you book a meeting for me with Team A?‚Äù (then gets annoyed because I didn't invite everyone from Team A to the meeting because that's usually her job and I have no idea who even is in Team A), ‚Äúcan you send this email for me?‚Äù (and when asked why I have to do it when it's usually her job, she says it makes more sense that I do it since the email is related to my data entry, even tho it has been her responsibility irrevocably for the past six months), ‚Äúcan you convert this to PDF for me?‚Äù (then complains that the font changed when I converted it. How about do it yourself then?)Anyway, on top of all of this, she's an extreme micromanager and loves to pinpoint the tiniest mistakes I make and asks me to fix them pronto and tell everyone who might be concerned that I had made a mistake. Today, per her request, I had to send an email to a division supervisor to let her know that I had added a space between two words in her document name because she had made a typo. I was OBLIGATED to send the email to let her know about the added space. I find it ridiculous but I had to do it.I had a lot of things to do today, a lot of people asked for me to help them with the website, but I have to push that all aside because my supervisor wants me to write her emails (write, not send; she wants me to just type up something and leave it in the drafts for her to approve), or because I have to send an email about how I added a space in a sentence, or because I have to do everything except my job basically. So many stupid, meaningless tasks are being piled up on me I was left crying out of frustration again today.Right now I'm just left wondering if I'm even fit for the job at all. It seems like everyone takes the tiniest details extremely seriously except me (one of my coworkers lectures me almost every day because I forget to turn my little available sign green when I log into Teams). I'm not sure if it's a problem with me or if the job is just too demanding.Is it ok to quit a government job after only 6 months? Will I be a lazy quitter for it? I know there are worse working conditions than this (I've experienced it) but the constant nagging and the micromanaging is about to be the absolute end of me. Any advice is welcome. PS I don't live in the US.
    Does anyone have a standard list of things they bring to Tailgate on the golf course? Must haves & nice to have? I'm organizing a large multiple birthdays celebration Tailgate from out of state so any help with planning I can get is appreciated. It's been 8 years since my last golf course Tailgate so I'm a little rusty.I feel like this always happens to me and it makes me feel awkward telling them I'm not finished yet. Last night was the worst yet. I had a chip and the ramekin of salsa in my hands when the waitress came by and grabbed my plate to take it away. She then realized I was still eating but at that point I was so annoyed (other issues happened prior) that I just threw down the food and told her to take it. This doesn't happen to my husband. I know I'm kind of a slow eater but does this happen to other people too?. Any guesses as to what time the Nov. 4th game with be? Still showing as TBD. Coming in from out of state and trying to plan a Tailgate so knowing the time would be helpful in planning.
    When I hear music (or play it), it triggers the feeling in my brain that I am looking at certain colors. I don‚Äôt actually see the colors in my field of vision, just in my mind. So if you send me a song, I can tell you what colors it gives off when I listen to it!I also have another slightly different form of synesthesia that assigns colors to chords and notes on a piano, so if you‚Äôd like to know the color of a chord, I can tell you that as well! (It doesn‚Äôt always correspond to the color of the song)Edit: Oh wow that‚Äôs a lot of songs! I‚Äôll have to get to them later tonight when I get home lol. There‚Äôs just so many. For me, a lot of people seem to consider the Dyatlov Pass paranormal or mysterious when it was likely just an avalanche. Oftentimes they point to the fact that the members of the expedition took off their coats and say that there‚Äôs no logical reason they would do that. There is. Paradoxical undressing is a well-known symptom of hypothermia.I also remember watching an episode of some interview-style paranormal show as a kid where they discussed a type of ghost that chokes you while you‚Äôre sleeping. Witnesses report not being able to move while the ghost is standing above them. The episode failed to even mention sleep paralysis as an explanation.So what other mysterious phenomena, disappearances, or events do you think are completely normal?. I‚Äôm so confused about the definition. Every definition I find says a Liminal Space is a place of ‚Äútransition,‚Äù or ‚Äúbetween destinations,‚Äù and by that definition, literally just any hallway or road would be a liminal space. So why are all the photos of empty rooms? Why would a place have to be empty for it to be ‚Äútransitional?‚ÄùAnd then how are pool rooms transitional? How are most of the pictures here transitional?The most common factor between Liminal Space photos I see is a feeling of eerie loneliness, but I never see that in the official definition.I feel stupid every time someone tries to explain it because they just keep using the same vague words and it doesn‚Äôt explain anything for me. (I had no idea what to tag this as since there wasn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù tag. If this is the wrong subreddit for this post, let me know and I‚Äôll remove it!)I‚Äôve been watching paranormal shows since I was eight years old, starting with Ghost Adventures. I thought it‚Äôd be fun to make a ranked list of every paranormal show I‚Äôve ever watched (and can actually remember) so people can either agree or roast my impeccable taste.Keep in mind, this is from the perspective of a skeptic. I am making this list under the assumption that all these shows are 100% fake.I‚Äôll be starting this list from the WORST end of the spectrum.________18. *Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal*This show is child abuse. It shouldn‚Äôt exist.17. *Paranormal Caught On Camera/Unexplained Caught on Camera*Lazy. Extraordinarily lazy. I hate to be that skeptic who just crosses their arms and goes ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs fake‚Äù to every piece of video evidence, but that‚Äôs often what this show calls for. I‚Äôm no expert on video trickery, so if I can look at something and see how it was obviously hoaxed, it should not have a bunch of experts commenting seriously on its eeriness or its creepiness without the slightest hint of skepticism.16. *My Ghost Story*The most boring and cheesy of the interview-format paranormal shows I‚Äôve seen. Even as a kid, I didn‚Äôt really care for it, and I‚Äôd only watch if it was the only thing on.15. *Paranormal Lockdown*I‚Äôve watched several episodes and remember absolutely nothing of them.14. *The Osbournes Want to Believe*This is basically a YouTube react channel as a TV show. The most entertaining part of this show is how unenthused Ozzy is throughout the entire filming. He would obviously rather be asleep than watching the paranormal clips his son has compiled together.13. *Ghost Hunters/Ghost Hunters International*I love that the paranormal television genre was pioneered by a couple of plumbers. As much as I respect that this team didn‚Äôt seek to sensationalize any of their experiences, it didn‚Äôt always benefit the show‚Äôs watchability. This might be a bit of an unpopular opinion, but these guys come off as a little pretentious to me since they try to present themselves as scientists who seek first to debunk before jumping to conclusions. They‚Äôre not scientists. They have no scientific background. It‚Äôs okay, though, because I still love them.12. *Celebrity Ghost Stories*I rarely recognized any of the celebrities on this show, but I have some respect for what the show was trying to accomplish by having prominent people share their paranormal experiences. The reenactments were cheesy, but it was entertaining enough.11. *The Haunted Collector*Very scripted, and it shows. My conspiracy theory is that Zak Bagans started his haunted museum because he saw this guy‚Äôs collection and was jealous. Not terrible, but there‚Äôs the ethical dilemma of convincing a homeowner that one of their possessions is haunted and then ‚Äútaking it off their hands‚Äù to relieve them the burden of the haunting. Felt very scam-ish to me.10. *Paranormal State*Ryan‚Äôs controversies aside, this was a good low-budget show. I haven‚Äôt watched it in years, but I do have vague memories of it being relatively creepy. I would definitely watch this again if it came on TV.9. *Ghosts in the Hood*Whereas other ghost hunting shows will travel to creepy castles and abandoned mental hospitals to investigate, Defecio and his team would investigate places like a dry-cleaner and a drive-thru funeral home. This show was goofy. Loved it.8. *Ghost Adventures*This show would be higher on the list if it had stopped when Nick left. Its early episodes were spooky and fun to watch, and the Ghost Adventures crew had great chemistry together. The raw production, and the gritty feel of the show got me hooked on paranormal television, but over time, all the charm faded as Zak‚Äôs ego started to take over. We all know the story. Soon after, the show became so unwatchably boring. It wasn‚Äôt even that the evidence wasn‚Äôt as compelling anymore‚Äîthe problem was that the show became poorly-made. Earlier seasons would surprise you with evidence as the episode went along, but now Zak has to announce a piece of evidence via voiceover before they show it, completely undermining the surprise aspect that made earlier episodes so suspenseful. It‚Äôs bad story-telling, and I hate it. Occasionally, good episodes will still come out, but the show is way past its prime.7. *Paranormal Challenge*I love that I‚Äôm ranking this higher than Ghost Adventures. I had to. It‚Äôs literally a ghost-hunting game show. No one asked for this show, but it‚Äôs a masterpiece. Hosted by Zak Bagans, it came out right at Ghost Adventures‚Äô heyday, so it‚Äôs an amazing time capsule of what Ghost Adventures and the paranormal community used to be.6. *Destination Truth*This show was interesting because the focus wasn‚Äôt entirely on the paranormal investigations. Josh Gates and his team traveled to a ton of exotic locations throughout the series, and so the first half of each episode was presented like a travel show. You can tell Josh has a passion for adventure, which is also evident in his memoir. Yes, I read his memoir. Actually pretty solid. Anyway, the travel aspect was always entertaining, and the vast array of cryptids they hunted made for some great television.5. *Ghost Files (Formerly Known as Buzzfeed Unsolved Paranormal)*It‚Äôs rare to have a ghost-hunting show where one of the investigators is a complete skeptic, which is why this show is so enjoyable. Just a couple dudes having fun on a ghost hunt. It refuses to take itself too seriously, and I respect it highly for that. The only thing I miss from earlier seasons is how creeped out Ryan was in every investigation. Now he seems to be as fearless as Shane, which is great character development, but I miss how Shane would tease Ryan in earlier episodes.4. *Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files*This ranking might just be because of the nostalgia it gives me. I watched this so much as a kid, and honestly, I get way too excited if I see it on TV. In retrospect, I consider this the predecessor to Paranormal Caught on Camera since it‚Äôs the first Travel Channel show (to my knowledge) that would pull paranormal clips from the internet. The difference with this show is that, once they showed all the paranormal clips, they‚Äôd go into a Mythbusters-esque segment in which they try to debunk whatever photos or videos they‚Äôre investigating. In one episode, they used ancient tools to build their own Stonehenge out of giant concrete blocks, just to show that it was possible. It was fun, creative, and it always felt genuine.3. *Paranormal Witness*Unlike the other interview-format paranormal shows on this list, this one actually knows how to set the mood for scares. The reenactments are top-notch, the acting is amazing, and the stories are terrifying. You could honestly remove the interview segments from the show, and you‚Äôd have a decent TV horror anthology. It hits that sweet spot.2. *Destination Fear*I only managed to catch a few episodes of this show on TV when it was first airing, but it managed to give me the same terrified feeling I had when I was eight years old and watching Ghost Adventures for the first time. The chemistry between the investigators is pretty good, though they definitely speak with that annoying, vlogger-like cadence that makes me feel like I‚Äôm watching a group of YouTubers. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm explaining that properly, but hopefully you get the idea. Still, this show was a breath of fresh air in a genre I thought was basically dead (pun intended). Great if you want genuine scares in a TV show.1. *Mountain Monsters*This bigfoot-hunting show is the pinnacle of paranormal television and demonstrates exactly what happens when a crew of investigators stops caring about whether anyone believes their show or not; they stop trying to be believable and let the show go absolutely insane. The comic relief and the constant drama within the crew makes this show more akin to a mockumentary, and you can never guess what will happen next. If you haven‚Äôt seen this show before, buckle up, because it‚Äôs a wild ride. The first season I ever watched, there was a car chase, three separate instances of kidnapping, and a mysterious masked man who was holding a bigfoot corpse hostage. It's amazing.________So, how was my list? Let me know if you'd rearrange it at all, or if you have any you think I should add to the list!(In compliance with rule 10, this post isn‚Äôt meant as a promotion for any of these shows. Its purpose is to facilitate discussion around a genre of television i am obsessed with. (Please don‚Äôt ban me, I just like to talk about paranormal stufffff!)). I‚Äôve been meaning to make a post on here for a while, but I never got around to it until now! I‚Äôm absolutely honored that an entire subreddit was created for something I made, and I‚Äôm excited to see people using it to learn Greenrune! Thank you to u/xo_kill_me for making this subreddit!I‚Äôll pop in every so often to help critique everyone‚Äôs writing! If you want to get my attention, try tagging me in the comments of your post! (Don‚Äôt just send me a DM because I don‚Äôt look at those, and it‚Äôll be helpful for other people to also see your Greenrune writing attempts!). There‚Äôs a very specific sound I want to recreate, and it‚Äôs the effect put on the entire ‚Äúfarewell, alaska‚Äù album (link attached). I am 90% sure the guy actually just used really low quality recording equipment to get this sound since he usually likes to do that, but I was wondering if there‚Äôs a way to recreate it in a DAW? (I use Logic Pro X)https://youtu.be/Jd7AxDRXOlM. I‚Äôm just trying to order food, please leave me alone, I‚Äôm not bothering you, I‚Äôm just existing here.This is assuming you‚Äôre not on bad terms with them and just slowly drifted apart from because of different lifestyles, distance, etc.So, up until a couple hours ago, I was a copywriter at a relatively large business (I write their blog posts, press releases, newsletters, etc). I thought my job was pretty secure considering I was the only copywriter in the entire company, and a lot of their marketing depended on my work.I just got pulled into a conference room and told by one of the higher ups that my position is being cut due to budget issues, so I had to get my things and leave.Anyway, I still text with my former coworkers, and I‚Äôve been told by them that they‚Äôre using ChatGPT to write what I normally would have been in charge of writing. Honestly, that‚Äôs not a big surprise. I‚Äôve been using ChatGPT at work (with permission from my department), and it‚Äôs a helpful tool. Not perfect, but helpful.Anyway, while my coworkers are stressing out at the office, I‚Äôm starting work on an album I‚Äôve been meaning to record, so I have a lot of free time. Ask me anything!. I love watching videos of people going through abandoned asylums, shopping malls, and schools, and it‚Äôs something I always wanted to try‚Äîminus the fact that it‚Äôs illegal. And dangerous.Just existing in a crumbling place absent of humans feels like standing in a post-apocalyptic world. Going through one is definitely something on my bucket list.Hi, I‚Äôm a musician looking for places to perform, and I was wondering if there were any open mic nights you‚Äôd recommend in the area. My mom is a huge fan of the show and has been watching it since it was still releasing new episodes. She swears that there was another scene in the Toaster episode that doesn‚Äôt get shown on TV anymore, and I want to see if anyone else remembers.Supposedly, it‚Äôs a scene that shows Marie trying to explain to the mall security everything that happened with the toaster (this is a different scene than when she and Frank were at the counter trying to return the coffee maker). My mom says the scene was hilarious since you could see Marie realizing how bad it sounded when she said she returned the toaster.I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs just misremembering an earlier scene, but I‚Äôm super curious to see if there is a scene like this that used to exist.I love to write for fun, and now that I‚Äôm taking the next big step in life and looking for employment, I‚Äôm trying to find a job that involves some writing. So I‚Äôve been looking at PR/Marketing jobs, etc. where I‚Äôd have to write press releases, blog posts, etc.However, it only just now occurred to me that *maybe* having to write for work would burn me out in terms of writing for pleasure.So for you writers who have jobs involving writing: does it take away from the fun of writing for pleasure? How does it affect your motivation (if at all)?. At the intersection of Lee Highway and Nutley St, there‚Äôs a civil war era cemetery with two tombstones right outside of a Starbucks. There are other bodies buried there, but their tombstones were likely stolen or used to fill depressions in the road.But here‚Äôs a Shower-thought for you: the cemetery is pretty elevated compared to the surrounding parking lot. So if you‚Äôre crouched down, you‚Äôre at eye-level with the coffins.Anyway, I wanted to know what other irl Easter eggs (or super odd locations) NOVA residents can visit. Got any that can top mine?. I just read about the Judy Smith homicide (because of a comment I saw on this sub) and was completely baffled by every detail. The way the search unfolded over the course of several months only for her to be discovered 600 miles from where she was last seen is so strange but intriguing.Link to Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Judy_Smithhttps://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/the-strange-unsolved-case-of-judy-smith/news-story/b17a4452389568a863596acbe1c49364Here‚Äôs a quick write-up:_______Judy Smith, a 50 year-old nurse from Massachusetts, was in Philadelphia with her husband Jeffrey in April of 1997. Jeffrey was planning on attending a conference during the couple‚Äôs stay in the city from April 9th to the 11th, and afterwards, the couple would visit friends in New Jersey for the remainder of the week.On the morning of April 10th, Judy was seen taking a shower in the hotel room by Jeffrey. They had a short conversation before Jeffrey left to attend the conference. While Jeffrey attended the conference, Judy planned on touring the city‚Äôs sites like the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. At the end of the day, the two were supposed to meet at the hotel room again before attending the conference‚Äôs cocktail party together at 6pm. However, when Jeffrey came back to the hotel room, Judy was nowhere to be found.At first, Jeffrey thought she went to the cocktail party without him, but upon finding that she wasn‚Äôt there either, he immediately began searching for her. In addition to calling local hospitals to see if she‚Äôd been hurt, he paid a cab driver to follow the route of the tour bus Judy said she planned on taking. After this yielded no results, he reported her as missing.The investigation largely followed Jeffrey as the main suspect, much to his frustration. Jeffrey complained that law enforcement did not take him seriously when he first called to report Judy missing. Philadelphia police similarly expressed some frustration, saying Jeffrey refused to take a lie detector test, though he disputed this claim, saying he told police he‚Äôd be willing to take a lie detector test if the FBI administered it and if the FBI agreed to investigate the disappearance; a request the police did not agree to.There were many reported sightings of Judy in the Philadelphia area and just outside of it. However, some of these sightings were attributed to a homeless woman who had a striking resemblance to Judy. On April 15th, one homeless man insisted when shown Judy‚Äôs picture that he had seen Judy and not the homeless woman sleeping on the bench next to him the night before on April 14th. This is the last time someone identified Judy based on her picture.One worker at a Macy‚Äôs in New Jersey said she saw and spoke with Judy after she was last seen by Jeffrey. According to the worker, Judy said she was shopping for her daughter. She was reportedly with a younger woman whom the worker assumed was the daughter Judy was referring to.Eventually, months later in September of 1997, Judy‚Äôs remains were discovered in a shallow grave a whopping 600 miles from Pennsylvania near Asheville, North Carolina. The remains were confirmed to be hers through dental records. Her cause of death was listed as homicide due to the presence of multiple stab wounds. She was dressed in her typical hiking attire and likely entered the area willingly, as the location would‚Äôve been difficult to carry a body to. Jewelry and money was also found near the remains, which meant robbery was not a likely motive.Police say that Judy likely entered the area with someone, probably her killer. Judy‚Äôs family said that she never expressed any desire to go to the Asheville area, though she had been in North Carolina before. Several people claimed to remember seeing Judy in Asheville during the month of April when she disappeared. One clerk at a local retailer said that Judy did not show signs of mental illness. She was also spotted driving a grey sedan full of boxes by a few other witnesses.The Buncombe County Sheriff‚Äôs Office, which took the lead in the investigation behind Judy‚Äôs death, ruled out Jeffrey as a suspect, citing the fact that Jeffrey was morbidly obese at the time and would have been unable to get Judy to the location of her body. Witnesses also corroborated Jeffrey‚Äôs presence at the conference on April 10th when Judy went missing.In terms of theories as to why she would have been in Asheville, some have proposed that Judy may have left her family behind willingly. Judy‚Äôs family insists that there was no tension between her and her family, though a family friend said that it looked to them as if Judy and Jeffrey‚Äôs marriage was a tenuous one and it wouldn‚Äôt surprise her if Judy would want time away from Jeffrey.There have been no recent developments in the case. There is still a reward for information leading to any persons involved in her murder._____Sorry for the quick write-up. Im a first time poster to this sub, and there are so many details to the case, so I might have left out a few, though I made sure to get all the major points in.Anyway, I‚Äôm interested in hearing any more cases in which a body or person was found far away from where they should‚Äôve been. The mystery of why they went somewhere in the first place adds a whole other layer to the puzzle.When I was 14, I started teaching myself piano again after years of lessons that didn‚Äôt take. I started playing for tips at a restaurant when I was 16, and when I was 20, the venue started paying me and made me their official piano man two nights a week.I play a bit of classic rock, alternative music, and pop. Occasionally, I throw in an indie song that no listening at the restaurant one will know (just because they‚Äôre songs I like). I am not skilled enough to play classical or jazz since I don‚Äôt read sheet music.Ask me anything about the gig or about life in general!Edit: Lots of people are asking how I learned piano. I can‚Äôt respond to all of your comments, so here‚Äôs *my* advice on how to learn:1. *Only play songs you‚Äôre passionate about.* Don‚Äôt waste your time with scales and exercises. These will kill your motivation. Make the *songs* your practice. It may slow you down, but it will fuel your motivation and make practice fun. You‚Äôll go further in the long run and keep with it long enough to improve.2. Pick songs you already know. If you can sing the lyrics by heart from memory, that‚Äôs good. You won‚Äôt need to look at sheet music or anything to know whether you‚Äôre playing it right. Your ears will do that work for you. I‚Äôm addition, you‚Äôll be training yourself to play by ear!3. If you find yourself stuck on something after half-an-hour of practicing, stop and save it for tomorrow. You may just be worn out. After you take a break for twelve hours or so, you may be able to play it all of a sudden. If not, you may just have to accept that the song is beyond your skill level, but that‚Äôs okay! Keep that song on a to-do list, and revisit it once you‚Äôve learned the necessary skills through other songs.4. Watch how other people play a song and copy them. Pay attention to what they play in their left hand, since they will most likely be playing the root notes of chords, and you can follow this to learn the rest of a song. A good YouTuber I used to copy was Adrian Lee5. Don‚Äôt set out to learn a particular skill. The more songs you learn, the more skills you‚Äôll just pick up over time by learning them. Pay attention to patterns between songs, and you‚Äôll learn major concepts like keys and chords in no time!6. Play around! *Write* your own songs! Play random sets of keys and see how it sounds! You may even accidentally teach yourself a song you‚Äôll want to learn.Those are my best tips! May update with more later! If anyone has more specific questions, feel free to DM!. I had completed all the classes required for my degree, so I needed some electives to fill my time. Took a class titled ‚ÄúGender and Communication‚Äù out of curiosity.Ask me anything! I thought it would be fun answering your questions considering people tend to have strong opinions about these kinds of classes.Edit: going to bed but will answer any new questions when I wake upEdit 2: I‚Äôm awake again and will answer questions as they come in throughout the day. Also, a lot of my answers require lots of typing, so I may temporarily skip some of the more content-heavy questions for now until I‚Äôve answered the quicker ones.
    Younger than 10, mom has ambulance and emts at the house due to seizures. As I walked by I saw my mom slump onto the bed basically lifeless and I started to cry. The emt calmed me down and said ‚ÄúYour mom is ok. She just passed out.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt know there was a difference between passed away and passed out so I went to school and told everyone my mom passed away. I was very confused as to why everyone was acting so nice ü§£ Hope my story made some of you laugh.If an issue is important then you should take time to study and fully understand it. If you do, then you don‚Äôt need notes to remind you what to say. In the past few years I‚Äôve seen people do this during debates and even some local stand up comedy shows I‚Äôve been to, they stare at there phone to remember their own material. Very off putting and looks like you don‚Äôt actually care about what you‚Äôre saying.Im on the Spanish course at unit 28. Up to this point I had about 70% of those at legendary prior to the update, which took them all. I have a pretty strong base because of how much I binge at a time. Anyways I started doing the legendary at 40 points each and flew through the first 10 levels. I then took a risk and went and reset my progress. The original reason I reset is because I did want to start over because of the new update.I took the entry test to place you after starting the course over and I made it all the way through with no errors thanks to my superb process of elimination skills. This put me at unit 28 again and reset all my legendary units, which I did again for 40 points each for about ten levels back to back. Rinse and repeat. I‚Äôve done it twice now. I don‚Äôt plan to do it again because I‚Äôm not trying to xp farm. I just wanted to see if it worked. Right now I have double xp which means I could earn 80xp a lesson, which I can do in a few minutes, back to back.Anyways, my plan is to reset again, and just start fresh. Since there‚Äôs so much hate for the new update, personally I couldn‚Äôt care less) I figured I‚Äôd share a way to take advantage of it ü§ò. So, when I was younger the first time I saw a heatwave I was like, ok that‚Äôs hot as hell. I told my dad about it, and he said you can‚Äôt see heat. Heat waves aren‚Äôt real. My dad was also born legally blind. The simplest way to describe it is there is no correction able to get him close enough to wear corrective lenses for his eyesight. He‚Äôs never owned a drivers license. He‚Äôs 64 now and pretty close to total blindness. So, I think he honestly doesn‚Äôt believe they exist as it‚Äôs a very high chance he‚Äôs never actually seen it. That‚Äôs all. Anyone else have some weird info to share?. I know to take into account the pipeline flow capacity.
    I‚Äôve been a data analyst for this company for two years, and been an analyst broadly for 8! I knew I was behind the curve a little but fuck :/The worst part is, the company doesn‚Äôt do compensation changes or hires until the summer except on emergencies, so my manager has to convince HR to fix it early, and what are the chances of that. He straight said I should‚Äôve easily been earning 10k more a year, and that‚Äôs rounded down, not up! What the actual fuck man üò°. Just installed moonlight and the controller driver vigembus, using NVidia's Gamestream. I have restarted my PC. I basically can't get any input at all to work from the steamdeck once moonlight starts a session. Any tips?. I'm not much of a creative person, so I hope I got the site looking well enough that it's not an eyesore. Feel free to make recommendations on things to change and how to change it!. I will require you to list how you got your theme installed. At first I‚Äôll be lax with this rule. Note that saying ‚ÄúI made this, and won‚Äôt be sharing‚Äù is an acceptable answer.Patch notes here! https://vaulthunters.gg/patch. Got a pack that causes me to mine stuff while airborne by accident often enough that I'm just going to avoid exploiting it, and fix the bug-like vibes its causing.Good Morning Kansas City!I need to get Beignets in the AM Monday, and I'm struggling to find a bakery that does them (which isn't a surprise, I'm surprisingly bad at this kind of thing). Does anyone have any recommendations? It can also be a sit down joint instead of a pick up. Otherwise, I'm just gonna have to do them myself. Wife and I were discussing whether trees could "feel" in their own way or not, and how a tree "reacts" to squirrels or birds clawing up the bark, and I'm under the impression that plants don't really use electricity to signal like we do, and instead use mostly chemical signaling and mechanical "call and response" style reactions that plants barely are aware (for lack of a better word). How off am I in this?. Source: RonEmpire's stream yesterdayDisclaimer: This is not settled and can change before launchThe Details: Foxes are currently slated to have 3 complex foods. Skewers, Pickled Goods, and a new food item Porridge. We don't know any further details about Porridge.I've recently been turning away from Robot Head's content due to his MRA-style rants. I recognize the points he's making, but I feel he goes a touch too far for my tastes, and I decided it's time to explore other YouTubers that make similar video essays. I've found Captain Midnight before, but they don't really crank out the content, or cover Star Wars stuff. I'm NOT saying I want positivity 100% of the time, I actually subbed to Robot Head because he was able to parse out and articulate my massive issues with the 2nd entry to the new trilogy, but what use to be some positive videos sprinkled in with negative videos that are mostly anchored around the media being reviewed, now days it feels more and more that he wants to link the media with the current outrage of the month. One thing that Robot Head does that I really enjoy, that Captain Midnight seems to lack, is using other media for jokes and punch-lines. For example, [this channel (watch until 1:13 for my point)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOf4t69fgMo) uses clips from Parks and Rec, among other things, to add variety to their content, which is something both my wife and I enjoy. Lemme know if anything comes to mind!. I have a "Cursed Royal Woodlands" I want to give a try (and probably will result in my first loss, but that's ok). In its description, it reads "The Queen will handsomely reward any viceroy brave enough to settle this part of the world". I looked online and didn't really find anything that signaled what that "handsome reward" would end up being. Is this just some lore quote that's trying to spook me away from this zone, or do biomes have some hidden rewards that I'm not familiar with?. ........Now that I found my wife the vinyl she wanted, I can now pursue the one vinyl I want to add to her collection! I'm looking for the Gris OST (commonly grey, but there is a black version). I will be requesting pictures as there's a much more common Piano Collections version which is NOT what I'm looking for, I've already made the mistake of purchasing that one without realizing that it's a cover and not the OST. The OST is expensive on the used marketplaces ($200+) if it's even available, but I can't justify spending that much, so please keep this in mind before reaching out to me. This is strictly going into my wife's collection and will stick around till we both die as it's by far my favorite instrumental album. Thank you for taking a peek at this post and giving me a minute of your day!. Hello collectors! My wife just got a new record player for xmas and after doing some searches online, told me that if I ever find the album in the title, I need to buy it asap, as she's a pretty big fan of AJJ and doesn't think she'll get the option to get that album without being pushy about finding it. So I ask y'all if you have a spare lying around y'all are willing to part with. We aren't picky on the color or such (though a purple would be amazing), or need their signature(s), but we are willing to pay for any premium for any of the usual collector bonuses. I'll edit this post to signal if I got my hands on a version, so even if this is an old post, feel free to reach out!&#x200B;Mods, dm me if I broke a rule on how to fix it, and I'll edit to conform!. Got a natural rate tree farm going that's basically battling it out between using the leaves for mana and using the leaves for saplings. Since I want it purely automated, I need to find a way to cycle between my munchdew eating the leaves, and letting the leaves despawn organically for saplings. The easiest way I can see is by slapping a comparator on the mana pool and using that redstone signal to somehow turn off the munchdew. Any ideas on how to do this?. Like everyone else, I'm writing a piano piece and am trying to have two different volume levels for each hand. I've almost exclusively only played on instruments which only operate one note at a time, so it isn't something I've seen before and I'm not sure the terms to google search to find the answer. I'll accept "here's the terms you're looking for" as well.Hello!I had a DM that did a little world building activity that I'm trying to find the source material for. He said he heavily referenced a board game that's like a post apocalyptic village manager. He basically had 50 ish questions and repeatedly went around the table, asked each player two questions that the player would pick to answer one. It would be questions like "what's a myth that is often shared among the village?" or "what kind of resource is difficult to find?" and the questions were pulled from the game. Does anyone happen to know what that source material is?. Hello!I'm looking for a 60" x 40" x 24" box. I'll come and get it no matter where in the metro you are. I will also accept two boxes that I can tape together that ultimately gets me the dimensions I need. The box can be larger than the dimensions given as well, but not by a whole lot. I'll take both offers as well as advice to help find such a box. Thanks!. Hello!I got a new PC with a RTX 3080 and 3 new monitors that connect via Display Port on Windows 10. When windows turns off the monitors as a part of power saving when afk, it acts as if I completely disconnected them, and shuffles windows around and resizes them. How do I get W10 to stop shuffling the windows around like this? Is it something I just need to accept if I want to save some power when AFK?. The title. I use two ps5 controllers on my PC with DS4Windows. Mod/add-on variants on already established games is also acceptable.Hallo!There's a lot of discussion on where to spend points early game, so I thought I'd give some pointers based on my own experience. Most cases these aren't in any particular order, and you can grab some utility options (step up, immunities) earlier than the "Must Haves", just be sure to get those "Must Haves" sooner than later. Anyone with experience, by all means argue against my choices!***PRE-75!*****Must Haves (29 points):**Speed 1 - It's cheap, and you go faster.Reach 2 - It's cheapExperienced 3 - Helps loads with getting through exp problems with just bottles of enchantingStrength x - Get these as soon as they're available. Plan ahead to get them the second they're unlockedSoul Hunter 1 - Cheap and lets you get a few things early in the F7 shop. I haven't bought much yet, but I've always had enough available when something I wanted was for sale, like a Vault Diamond Block.Haste 2 - Cheap and Haste 2 lets you insta mine a lot of blocks. Eventually you def should get more as points become available, but Haste 2 is a must!Vein miner x - Fortune - Allows for Level 5 fortune with a default Fortune 3 pick, great for your rare ores you findDash 3 (Recharge) - This will be a skill you use constantly, bind the "select and use" hotkey to something you can press regularly; Mine is one of the thumb buttons on my mouse. Cleanse 1 (no subclass) - I avoid picking a subclass so I can use it more often (10 second cooldown), very usefulRampage 1 (Shaman) - A great tool for boss killing and keeping the boss from healing if they tp away. Absolutely get this as soon as Shaman is available. Ghost Walk 1 - Same as Cleanse, but less as useful. You can put this on the backburner for the above musts, but definitely get it sooner than later.Treasure Hunter/Artisan x - Like Strength, you'll really want to get these as soon as they're available, so plan ahead! The community universally agrees that Artisan helps a lot in the early game if you're playing solo, but on a server, just one player needs it (just be sure to share some loot with them for the help since they won't have treasure hunter!). I personally went Treasure Hunter because loot; and ultimately haven't regretted the decision.&#x200B;**Future Refunds; but useful early!**Water Breathing/Fire Resistance - Significantly reduces stress around Lava, but there are ways to stop this problem without spending the 7 points.Elvish - You'll be falling a lot, and taking chip damage as a result, but eventually that chip damage won't matter since you'll have so much armor and health (and featherfalling) that you'll eventually refund this to get your 5 points back.Step - You'll definitely want this promptly, but over the long run, you'll have other sources of Step up that you'll eventually refund this.Twerker - I have 3 points, def get at least 1, it'll help with getting the crystal ready. &#x200B;Grab if you can as needed (no particular order)!More Speed!Well Fit!Soul Hunter!Reach!Haste!Unbreakable!&#x200B;**At 75!** Oooooweeeee do we have a lot of expensive options opening up, so be sure to save up!Get an archtype; I've seen Barbaric in the ultra late game, but I'm not sure what's actually going to be best. Keep in mind that Frenzy functions how you'd expect, where if you have 10 hearts max, then you'll need to be at 3 hearts for the effect to trigger, 2 hearts at max (though you'll have way more than 10 hearts at that point). I've seen 30 hearts from an ultra late game player. Treasure Hunter/Artisan 2;Fatal Strike + Chance/Damage - I mathed out that Damage helps more than chance overall, but the numbers were close enough that you can just pick whichever you prefer&#x200B;Ghost Walk: Recovery unlocks (not 100% sure if the extra minute cooldown is worth, but probably?)&#x200B;**Mods!**The ones I took are - All the decorations! They reduce each category by 1 (to a limit of 1) Pick a couple mods that you're interested in, and track how many decoration reductions you need to bring that mod down to just 1 point. Make sure you pick a couple more expensive options. If you take danks at 1 for example, and then take more chests, you'll waste one of the reductions since more chests is already super cheap. Get a piece of paper to math out how to go about taking the decorations. Danks, Danks, Danks! - This is one of the first major mods you should save up to buy. This will dramatically change the style of how you approach vaults, and greatly speed up the looting process. For example, getting a dank 3 set up with the items you find in the wooden chests lets you just zoom up, axe down the chest, gobble up the loot (magnets are great for this), and it'll all get auto sorted into your danks. Gilded chests I stack drop (shift+q by default I think, mine is CTRL+Space since I move the jump to shift and crouch to control). &#x200B;Refined Storage + Engineers Decor - I picked AE2 because I'm an AE2 guy, but RS is definitely the better option in this pack, and I wish I could fix it. You'll need Engineers Decor for the solar panel to power your system cheaply. Obviously the Power options would be better, but if you just need that small bit of power for your storage, ED is cheap and does the job. **Edit I'm told that ED has a gate within it that prevents you from getting the solar panel. Keep in mind you'll need a way to work around the lead blocks (via drawers), or pick a different power source. I'm not sure how I managed to get a lead block myself. **&#x200B;Vault BlackSmith - There's plenty that this provides that makes it a great grab. More Chests / More Furnaces - Useful mods to help get you through early game problems&#x200B;**I took Mob Spawners and regret it!** I didn't realize how expensive it would be, and hoped to create a passive mobs grinder to help with stuff like raw chicken, but alas. &#x200B;**Other Mods I want!**Waystones! Easy Villagers got a lot of hype behind it that I'm bought into.Botania has great accessories that provide multi jump, step up, magnets, and more.Dark Utilities' Gluttony Charm is amazing for saving time, and vector plates will help with mob grinders in the future.Vault Powerups is pretty self explanitoryMining Gadgets maybe?Vault LooterDrawersTrashcans &#x200B;&#x200B;Everything else is more of a means to an ends in my eyes, but maybe a commenter has a mod choice that I missed!.

I was just watching the latest Bob's Burgers, and it surrounds Teddy going to a Naval get-together. In the episode, he and his old crew mates are wearing a navy jacket with their ship on the back. On the sleeve, there are an American flag, an Irish flag, and a Greek flag. I served in the Air Force and was curious why the three flags were on there rather than just the expected one.Basically title; I heavily rely on placing blocks via my off-hand and I'm fine with the trade off of that being that I don't get to use a shield, but I hate that I miss out on an entire loot group because I use the blocks.

I have 3 drives on my PC, and moved the game from my main "gaming drive", which is a hard disk, to my OS drive, which is an SSD, by uninstalling and reinstalling the game. Once that was finished, I loaded up the game (it'll restart a few times as a result of downloading patch data), and redid the shader optimization. This completely fixed the problem for me. Wanted to post a thread so people can find a fix via google.This is one of the first sets where I feel the diamond cards really provide a massive improvement on the visual quality of the card rather than feel excessive or lacking impact.
